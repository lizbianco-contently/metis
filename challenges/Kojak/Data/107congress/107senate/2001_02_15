Mr. President, I object to further proceedings on the \nbill at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the rule, the bill will be \nplaced on the calendar.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York, Mrs. \nClinton.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, as we begin our work on the 2002 budget, \nwe find ourselves at a crossroads, facing a very big choice. The choice \nwe make will determine whether we pay down our national debt. It will \ndetermine our investments in priorities like education, the \nenvironment, health care and Social Security. And it will define the \nquality of life for millions of Americans for years to come.\n  The choice we face is this: Do we continue along the budgetary path \nthat we, as a Government and a nation, have followed in recent years? \nOr do we make a break from that path, and return to the one we followed \n2 decades ago?\n  Let's look, for a minute, at history. Eight years ago our budget \ndeficit was $290 billion--the largest in our history. The national debt \nwas $3 trillion and unemployment had surged to 7.8 percent. At the \ntime, the Congressional Budget Office predicted that the deficit would \nreach $513 billion by this year.\n  This year, the predicted deficit is, in fact, a surplus, likely to \nreach $281 billion. We are scheduled to pay off $600 billion of the \nnational debt--concluding the largest three-year debt reduction in our \nnation's history. As Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan once said, \nour ``commitment to fiscal discipline has been instrumental in \nachieving the longest expansion in the nation's history.''\n  Now debt reduction has meant lower interest rates for college, car \nloans and home mortgages. With Government no longer draining resources \nout of the capital markets, private investment in equipment and \nsoftware skyrocketed, and productivity gains kept fueling prosperity.\n  At the same time, we have invested in America's working families. We \ndoubled student financial aid. In New York, for example, 45,000 more \nchildren enrolled in Head Start in 1999 than in 1993 and this year New \nYork schools will receive an additional $100 million for renovations \nand repairs which, based on observations during my many visits, are \nvery much needed.\n  Democrats and Republicans have worked together to set aside the \nSocial Security and Medicare Trust Fund surpluses to extend their \nsolvency. Together, we put more police on the streets, more teachers in \nclassrooms and moved people from welfare to work.\n  And we have done all of this while holding Federal income taxes, as a \npercentage of income for the typical American family, to their lowest \nlevel in 35 years.\n  And something else happened. As the information age exploded, America \nflourished, making itself a leader in new technologies and increasing \nour productivity so that once again we became competitive in this new \nworld. It turned out that these policies were not only prudent--but \nthey opened the doors to the changes that prepared us and our children \nto be successes in the 21st Century. Twenty-two million new jobs were \ncreated--nearly 1 million in New York alone--unemployment dropped to 4 \npercent. And those jobs are pouring more than 900 billion dollars into \nour economy each year. That's how we have gone so quickly from deficit \nto surplus. But here's the catch: If we upset the careful balance of \nour economy, we can lose far more than the cost of the tax cut--a tax \ncut recession would cost us trillions more in lost income through lost \njobs.\n  Mr. President, I share the concerns of many of my colleagues that \nPresident Bush's extremely large tax proposal will take us back back to \nthe days of big deficits, high interest rates, shrinking investment, \nand a growing national debt.\n  I may be old-fashioned, but as the daughter of a small businessman \nwho did not believe in living outside our means and who even paid cash \nfor the house where we lived, I just don't believe we should spend what \nwe don't yet have in the bank. President Bush's extremely large tax \nplan would spend trillions we don't have, and may never have.\n  If we reverse the engines of economic growth by adopting President \nBush's tax proposal, I fear that we will reverse the progress we've \nmade--by increasing interest rates now and by saddling our children \nwith big debts in the future.\n  I know and respect that President Bush supports faith-based programs, \nbut his tax plan should not be one of them. Going forward with a huge \ntax proposal now is like getting a letter from Ed McMahon and going out \nto buy a yacht. A surplus projection is not a promise. And if the past \nis any guide, it's not even a likely outcome.\n  That is not my view alone. It is the view of many experts who have \ntestified before the Budget Committee, on which I serve. It is the view \nof colleagues like the gentleman from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd and the \ngentleman from Florida, Mr. Nelson, both of whom voted for President \nReagan's tax plans in the 1980's, only to regret those votes when those \ncuts plunged us deep into debt.\n  I encourage my colleagues to read the comments of both Mr. Byrd and \nMr. Nelson in our Committee's proceedings, or speak with them \npersonally about their historic and wise perspective.\n  The question before us is not whether or not we should enact tax \ncuts. I support tax cuts. The question is: how do we structure a \nresponsible tax cut? A prudent tax cut that will allow us to pursue our \nimportant national values while keeping interest rates down and \nencouraging economic growth.\n  The path of fiscal discipline is marked by four signposts: It pays \ndown the debt, it protects Social Security and Medicare, it invests \nwisely in children and families, and it reduces taxes in a prudent and \nsensible way.\n  I do not believe President Bush's tax plan meets those tests. It also \nfails the fairness test. President Bush says that, under his plan, the \ntypical family of four will be able to keep $1,600 of their money. \nCitizens for Tax Justice found that when the Bush plan is fully in \neffect, 85 percent of families would receive a nominal tax cut of less \nthan $1,600 or no tax cut at all.\n  Even if President Bush's proposal were fair to all Americans, it \nwould not be prudent. During this time of surplus, it would leave \nnothing for the real reforms necessary to ensure that Social Security \nand Medicare are intact for future generations. The President's tax \nplan abandons the principle of putting first things first.\n  Just yesterday, some of America's wealthiest citizens came out \nagainst President Bush's estate tax repeal, saying that it was ``bad \nfor our democracy, our economy and our society.'' And I agree.\n  A tax cut that is fair to all Americans needs to be part of a \nframework that strengthens, not weakens, our economy. In my view, we \ncan and should have a tax cut that cuts income tax rates, but we have \nto give relief to those paying the payroll tax on their income as well. \nAnd I believe there is a bipartisan consensus for smart, responsible \nand fair tax cuts.\n  It is smart to include a long-term care tax credit to provide relief \nfor families caring for elderly and disabled family members. And the \ncollege opportunity tax deduction of $10,000 a year, championed by my \ndistinguished colleague from New York, would enable families to pay for \ncollege, graduate study, or training courses. Tax cuts like these will \nbring tangible relief to New Yorkers and working families everywhere.\n  It's also both smart and responsible to invest in our people, \nespecially in building the knowledge economy. And I know that the \nPresident has had first\n\n[[Page S1441]]\n\nhand knowledge of that in his former position. We have to bring new \ntechnology to smaller communities across the country so they can take \nadvantage of the well-educated workforce and higher education \ninfrastructure that already exists in or near so many of these smaller \ncommunities.\n  And, we have an obligation to ensure fairness. We should not favor \nthe richest Americans at the expense of the vast majority of Americans.\n  So how should we go forward? Will President Bush try to push through \nhis one-sided and lop-sided proposals with the votes of his own party? \nIf he does, I will respectfully have to dissent. Or will he sit down \nand negotiate to reduce its size and make it fairer to more Americans? \nIf he does this then I hope I can support the outcome. Bipartisanship \nis a two-way street--it's not about Democrats supporting Republican \nproposals or even Republicans supporting Democratic proposals. It's \nabout Republicans and Democrats working together to do what is right \nfor the country. And the true test of leadership is not appealing to \nthe people under the guise of bipartisanship, but actually hammering \nout a bipartisan compromise bill that merits the support of both sides \nof the aisle. That's the right way to pass a tax cut and protect our \nbudget priorities.\n  And it is certainly what I hear when I meet with business leaders, \nworkers and civic leaders in places like Rochester, and Rome, and \nBrooklyn and Watertown, just to name a few of the places I've been in \nthe last week. They want a tax cut, but they also want to make sure we \nmake the right choices for our budget.\n  History calls us to reject a spendthrift tax plan that would threaten \nour efforts to reform and modernize Medicare--including a long overdue \nprescription drug benefit that is voluntary, affordable and available \nto all beneficiaries.\n  I also fear a spendthrift tax plan would hurt our ability to invest \nin the military. As the gentleman from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, said \nthis week, ``the President's tax plan would consume more than 80 \npercent of the on-budget surplus, leaving nothing but fiscal leftovers \nfor national security.''\n  I don't think any of us want that.\n  For me, the details of the 2002 budget have to be negotiated. But the \nbig choice is clear. We must pass a budget that keeps paying down the \ndebt, provides sensible tax cuts and invests in priorities that matter \nto the people we represent. We must stay the course that has helped us \nbuild the longest economic expansion in our nation's history. And we \nmust avoid a course that takes us back, throws caution to the wind and \nrisks mortgaging our children's future.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN.

Mr. President, I rise to comment about the situation in \nthis country with respect to energy.\n  Last evening I was signing letters, as is so often the case for those \nof us who serve in public life. We receive a great deal of mail, many \nphone calls, hundreds of e-mails every day, and then, of course, the \nold-fashioned way--we get letters actually written and stuck in an \nenvelope and mailed to us. It is among the most important things we do, \nto try to respond to constituents.\n  Last evening, as is the case with most of my colleagues, I was \nspending time late in the evening reading mail and signing mail that \nhas come from North Dakota. I came across a couple of letters I want to \nread to my colleagues and then describe what it is we need to be doing \nto respond to some of these issues.\n  I received a letter from a man named John. I have not contacted him, \nso I will not use his last name. John, from Fargo, ND, wrote the \nfollowing:\n\n       Dear Senator Dorgan,\n       I am in complete shock after receiving my natural gas bill \n     yesterday. I live in a modern house that is well insulated, I \n     am careful about closing doors and ensuring that all the \n     windows are sealed, I set my thermostat at 68 degrees (now \n     even lower), and yet I receive a bill for natural gas alone, \n     for over $726 for a one month period. How is that possible?\n       Please tell me, Senator, how it is that we can live in the \n     most technologically advanced country in the world, yet we \n     can't maintain adequate stocks of natural gas to get us \n     through the winter. Are we being gouged by producers?\n\n  He then asks a series of additional questions. I will not read the \nentire letter. I will only say that he asks a question he could ask on \nbehalf of millions and millions of Americans who are opening their \nbills now to heat their homes and discovering, after 2 of the coldest \nfirst 2 months of the winter in a century in this country, it is \ncosting a fortune to pay for natural gas bills, propane bills, home \nheating fuel bills. John writes a letter saying: I am doing all the \nright things. I have a home that is well insulated. I seal it. I keep \nthe thermostat at 68, and my heating bill for natural gas last month is \n$726, and I can't afford it.\n  I have a second letter from another fellow also named John from North \nDakota. He described what happened to him. He and his wife had \npurchased an older building that had been subdivided into several \napartments. They took an apartment in their retirement years and were \nrenting the others. He said he had been paying $300 a month for heat. \nWhen his February bill arrived, it was $1,091. He went to the office of \nthe gas provider to talk to them. He said:\n\n       I left the office wondering what to do. I didn't want to \n     tell my wife the truth about this. She doesn't know about it \n     yet. Today is her birthday, and tomorrow is our 53rd wedding \n     anniversary. We have been making it okay in our retirement \n     years, nothing to spare with the $1600 monthly income from \n     our five apartments. This is our retirement home. We have no \n     choice now but to sell it. Our $1,000 monthly bill would be \n     impossible and yet they say it is going to go up even more. \n     We don't want to move, but there is not much else we can do.\n\n  I am sure all of us are getting identical letters from around the \ncountry. What is happening? What on Earth has happened that has caused \nfuel bills to double, triple, and, in some cases, even quadruple? When \npeople get fuel bills for $600, $700, $800 a month--and in\n\n[[Page S1442]]\n\nNorth Dakota we have had a bitterly cold winter, the first 2 months \nespecially, and especially the last few weeks again--it is sticker \nshock to get bills like that.\n  Now I want to mention a couple of additional points. I will be very \nbrief. First of all, we need to take some emergency action. We need \nmore money in LIHEAP. We are out of money. We have to do a supplemental \nat some point, and there has to be money for the low-income energy \nassistance program.\n  No. 2, I have suggested, in legislation I have joined others in \nintroducing, a tax credit, an income tax credit to offset about 50 \npercent of the increase in home heating fuel bills of this year versus \nlast year.\n  That is a way, it seems to me, to use a tax credit to put some money \ninto people's pockets to offset about 50 percent of these increased \nbills. That would also be helpful.\n  Legislation will be introduced today that would deal with \nweatherization, LIHEAP, conservation grants to States, and increased \nenergy efficiency in the Federal Government. Senator Bingaman has been \nworking on that along with others, and I have been working with him, as \nwell. We have a lot of things to do, both in the short term on an \nemergency basis, and in the long term. We also are investigating \npotential causes for the natural gas price increases.\n  But we also need, at the same time, to understand that we have the \nrequirement to not only find more natural gas and oil--we stopped \nlooking when it went to $10 a barrel--and now it is at $30 a barrel and \nthere is a great deal of exploration again. I think all the evidence \nindicates that there is a record amount of drilling, and we will have \nmore natural gas and oil coming on line within 6 months, 12 months, 24 \nmonths; but that is not going to solve the problem for the next 3 \nmonths, or even 6 months, or a year. So we are doing all of that.\n  At the same time, we need to be more concerned about the development \nof both renewable energy and also about conservation. Renewable energy, \nsuch as wind and biomass, can contribute a significant amount to this \ncountry's energy future. Any energy program that makes sense also must \ninclude an element of conservation. That is why I talk about \nweatherization and other issues.\n  Most important, I think, this ought to lead us to the question of the \nderegulation in areas of essential service. We need to be sure we have \nan adequate supply and demand relationship in areas of essential \nservices for the American people. I don't suggest we reregulate natural \ngas supplies, but we ought to have a safe harbor somewhere with respect \nto production and consumption, so we don't get into a situation where \npeople's natural gas bills spring up two, three, four, five times over \nwhat they were previously, for causes to which they didn't contribute. \nSo I wanted to bring attention to these two letters from two fellows \nnamed John who wrote me lengthy letters about their respective \nexperiences.\n  It is painful and difficult and, in some cases perhaps impossible, \nfor some people to pay these kinds of home heating bills. They don't \nhave the money. We need to do something on an emergency basis to try to \nbe helpful to them. More importantly, this country needs a long-term \nenergy strategy that works. Under both Republicans and Democrats, we \nhave not had an energy strategy. We are far too dependent on the Middle \nEast and on foreign sources of oil. If, God forbid, something should \nhappen to interrupt the pipeline of foreign oil coming into this \ncountry, and all industrial countries, we would have an emergency on \nour hands.\n  We must do something to try to escape the excessive dependence that \nnow exists on foreign energy, notwithstanding all of the current \nproblems we have with respect to the dislocation between supply and \ndemand. Energy issues are critical, and we must do something about \nthem. It is time to have a national energy policy that works, No. 1, \nand, No. 2, it is time this Congress understands there is an emergency \nin parts of this country this winter, with respect to the need for some \nhelp to pay home heating fuel bills that are exceeding the ability of \nsome people to pay them. That emergency includes the need to provide \nmore money for low-income energy assistance, weatherization, and other \nrelated issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise briefly to welcome and congratulate \nmy colleague, Senator Carnahan, the newly elected Senator from \nMissouri, on her first remarks on the floor. I apologize for not being \nable to be here when she made the comments. I was in a Health Committee \nmeeting asking questions about Missouri education programs of the \nSecretary of Education.\n  I understand Senator Carnahan was talking about education on the \nfloor, and I know education and children's issues are going to be areas \nwhere we will work together. Yesterday, Senator Carnahan joined as a \ncosponsor on a couple measures that are very important, ensuring 100-\npercent deductibility on health insurance for the self-employed, which \nis very important to farmers and small business people in my State, and \nalso providing relief from the draconian cuts enforced by HCFA on home \nhealth care agencies, which cost us half the home health care agencies \nin Missouri.\n  We have many areas in which we are looking forward to working \ntogether. I tell my colleagues that Senator Carnahan has been a long-\ntime friend. She and her family were close associates in Jefferson \nCity. Senator Carnahan was best known in Missouri as a very strong \nhelpmate of our late Governor, treasurer, and servant, Mel Carnahan. I \ngot to know her very well when they shared the same public housing in \nwhich we had lived, the Governor's mansion in Missouri. She was a very \nstrong champion of the preservation of that mansion and a most gracious \nhostess for all the people of Missouri who came there.\n  After the terrible tragedy which befell her family in our State last \nyear, she was strong and gracious and was widely respected and admired \nby all Missourians. I know colleagues on this side of the aisle who \nhave not had an opportunity to get to know her and work with her will \nlook forward to doing so. I congratulate her and wish her well after \nmaking her first speech on the Senate floor. I know there will be many \nother issues which affect our mutual constituents on which we will be \nworking together.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues for indulging me as I extend a \nvery warm welcome to Senator Carnahan.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I was surprised to read the headlines in the \npaper this morning--and I actually saw a little bit of this on the news \nlast night--that billionaires in the United States actually support the \nestate tax and oppose President Bush's plan to repeal the estate tax.\n  One would think for a moment that is a man-bites-dog story; that is \ncounterintuitive. Upon reflection, it actually makes a lot of sense and \nmakes no sense. I will discuss that today. I will get back to the \nbillionaires in just a moment.\n  First, to set the stage, we all know President Bush has proposed an \nimportant and innovative set of tax relief proposals that will help \nworking American families, will help the economy at this time when it \nis beginning to falter, and will provide more fairness in our Tax Code. \nIt has three essential features. There may be some other pieces added \nto this by the Congress.\n  Primarily, it calls for reduction in marginal income tax rates. That \nway, everybody who pays taxes receives a tax benefit, tax rate relief.\n\n[[Page S1443]]\n\n  Second, it repeals the estate tax, one of the most unfair taxes we \nhave ever produced in this country.\n  Third, it largely does away with what we call the marriage penalty, \nwhich actually provides a higher rate of taxes for two people who are \nmarried and working than if they were living together without having \nbeen married.\n  Both the repeal of the estate tax and the elimination of the marriage \npenalty were passed by the Senate and the House last year. We sent \nthose bills to President Clinton and he vetoed them. In the campaign, \nGovernor Bush said: If you send those bill to me, I will sign them. So \nthey represent an important part of his tax relief proposal. Mr. \nPresident, I aim to say we will send them to President Bush so he can \nsign them.\n  Because there is such momentum behind the repeal of the estate tax, \npeople who fear now that its repeal will actually become a reality have \nbegun to take to the air waves and get their petitions out and to get \non television proclaiming that naturally this is a very important and \nneeded tax. The ones who would get the most publicity, of course, are \nthe billionaires who say: Look, we will be paying a lot of this tax. If \nwe can be for it, surely, everybody else can be for it; why would you \nwant its repeal?\n  It turns out there are two primary reasons. I will summarize first \nand then go into a little more detail.\n  The first is that these are the very people who can well afford, A, \nto pay the taxes; but, B, to pay for the multimillions of dollars to \nfind the loopholes to avoid paying most of the tax, to do the estate \nplanning. That is the euphemism for the term which means hire \naccountants and lawyers to try to figure out a way to avoid paying most \nof the tax--and there are ways you can do this if you are willing to \npay enough money to these lawyers. And there are ways, also, if you pay \nenough money to insurance companies.\n  By the way, I got a letter from an estate planner in New York. He \nsaid: You can't do away with the estate tax. This would hurt my \nlivelihood. I make a living finding ways for people to avoid paying the \nestate tax.\n  I didn't do this, but I felt like writing back to him and saying, if \nwe could figure out a way to eliminate death, I would probably get a \nletter from a mortician saying, you can't put me out of business like \nthis.\n  These people make a lot of money helping people like George Soros, \nBill Gates, Sr., and other people of great wealth. By the way, I admire \nall of these people for what they have been able to accumulate over \ntheir life. But they make a lot of money on these people doing estate \nplanning. Frankly, I think it would be very interesting if all of the \nbillionaires who have signed the petition calling for a continuation of \nthe estate tax would tell us publicly how much money they have spent on \nestate planning and how much money they have been able to save as a \nresult of what they have been able to accomplish with their lawyers and \naccountants. I expect they have been able to save more than most people \nwill ever pay in taxes.\n  The first point we should realize is with these billionaires, this is \nchump change. They can pay the lawyers and accountants to figure out a \nway to save the most money and they are still happy to pay what they \nhave to pay because it doesn't mean that much to them, unlike what it \nmeans to most Americans. My first challenge to all of these petition \nsigners: Please come forward and state how much you are going to \nactually pay in estate taxes versus how much is in your estate. \nSpecifically, is any one of these people willing to pay the entire \nobligation of the estate tax without any opportunity for estate \nplanning to save money; without taking advantage of any loophole? If \nthey think this is such a great tax, are they willing to pay all that \nis due without any kind of estate planning to avoid any part of the tax \non their part?\n  That would be very interesting to find out for these people who think \nthis is such a wonderful tax. And I present that challenge to them \ntoday. My guess is that during their lifetime, one reason they \naccumulated so much wealth was because they knew very well how to \nmanipulate the stock market, how to manipulate the currency market, how \nto make sound investments, all the while eliminating or reducing to the \nlowest possible amount taxes they would have to pay.\n  There is nothing wrong with that. That is how a lot of people make \ntheir living. And certainly these very wealthy people have undoubtedly \ntaken advantage of whatever provisions we have in the Tax Code for \navoiding the payment of taxes.\n  The second reason why, even though this seems counterintuitive, and \nthis makes a lot of sense, is many of these same people have as one of \ntheir primary goals in life running charitable foundations; in effect, \nspending other people's money for their charitable giving.\n  It is very easy to be very charitable when you are using someone \nelse's money. What some of these people have said is, we need the force \nof Federal law to make people give their money when they die or make \nthe widows and the orphans cough up the money when the breadwinner \ndies. We need to take 55 percent of their estate so we can put it into \nour charitable foundations and hand it out and get invited to all kinds \nof fancy dinners and do good. We are all for the good these charitable \ngroups do.\n  Let no one make any mistake about that. It is easy to be charitable \nwith someone else's money. The question is, Are you willing to be \ncharitable with your own money? Even if you think other people should \nalso give, would it be better for you to ask them to give from the \ngoodness of their heart to charity or to use the confiscatory power of \ngovernment to make them give by saying, we are going to take 55 percent \nof everything you own when you die?\n  There is one way to avoid it: If you can give it all away, then you \nare not passing it on to your heirs.\n  That is the first great problem with those who defend the estate tax. \nThey say it would prevent the concentration of wealth if we can \nmaintain this tax. That is absolutely, 180 degrees off from the \nAmerican dream. Generation after generation in this country has said: \nWe want to leave our family better than the previous generation. We \nwant to work hard. We want to save. We want to provide for our kids' \neducation so when we die they have a better chance in life than we did.\n  What is wrong with that? That is the American dream. These people say \nno. What is wrong is for one generation to be able to pass wealth on to \nanother generation. Everybody should have to start from exactly the \nsame point in life.\n  There are those who would manipulate Government, and our very lives, \nto force equality in fact rather than equality in opportunity. That is, \nin effect, what these people are saying: We are going to force \neverybody to be exactly equal because whatever it is you accomplished \nin life we are going to take away from you at the end of your life so \nyour family, then, has to start all over again.\n  What incentive is there for most people to save for future \ngenerations, to try to help their kids or their grandkids to have a \ngood start in life? I want to be able to put some things away for not \njust my kids but my grandkids. They mean so much to me. I want to make \nsure they have a good start in life, that they will be able to get a \ngood education. What is wrong with that incentive to save?\n  These billionaires, they don't have any problem with that. They could \nbuy half the countries in the world. They do not have to worry about \nwhat most of us have to worry about in life, and that is putting enough \naside to be able to take care of ourselves in our old age and maybe \nprovide something for our kids and grandkids thereafter. That is the \nAmerican dream. These people would destroy that dream. That is wrong. I \nunderstand it is hard for them to appreciate that problem for many \nAmericans. But it is a very real problem. I am going to get back to \nthat problem in just a moment.\n  Let me talk about the next myth these people are trying to \nperpetrate, that actually it will hurt poorer people because if we do \naway with the estate tax, we are going to have to raise other taxes to \nmake up for the revenue. Have these people been living on another \nplanet? Are they not aware that this Government is going to be running \na $5.6 trillion surplus?\n  The whole notion President Bush has here, as he said when he was \nGovernor\n\n[[Page S1444]]\n\nand running for the Presidency: We are going to have a massive surplus. \nWe will have more than enough to have whatever we need to spend money \non--save Social Security and Medicare and have enough left to have tax \nrelief for the people. You don't have to raise taxes. That is what the \nsurplus enables us to do. This is a specious argument. People ought to \nknow better than to make this argument.\n  For the upcoming fiscal year, fiscal year 2002, the on-budget surplus \nis estimated to be at $142 billion, according to the CBO. We can \nafford, with an overtax payment of that amount, to return some of that \nmoney to the American people. And we do not have to then raise taxes \nsomehow to do that.\n  The last budget of President Clinton projected estate tax revenues at \n$34-plus billion. That is for this fiscal year, 2002. That would \nrepresent about 1.5 percent of our revenues. So we have to keep this \ntax in place, a tax that produces only 1.5 percent of our revenues and \ncauses great disruption and consternation in America's families?\n  Let me get back to what I said before about the problem of this \nbusiness of creating wealth and the American dream. The fact is, of \ncourse, most Americans will not pay the death tax. But they still see \nsomething terribly wrong with a system that allows Washington to seize \nmore than half of whatever is left when someone dies, that prevents \nhard-working Americans from passing the bulk of their nest egg on to \ntheir future generations.\n  Mr. President, I love a lot of things in this country. I give to \ncharity. I love my country. But I think I love my kids and grandkids \nand my wife more than anything else in the world, and with this tax the \nGovernment says we cannot benefit them. We are going to force you to \ngive that money to somebody else or to the U.S. Government. You cannot \npass it on.\n\n  Most Americans see that as unfair, even if they are not going to have \nto pay for the tax and even if they don't have to pay a lot of money to \ntry to avoid paying the tax through estate planning. A McLaughlin \nAssociates poll conducted from January 26-27, just a week or so ago, \nfound 89 percent of the people surveyed believed:\n\n       . . . it was not fair for Government to tax a person's \n     earnings while it is being earned and then tax it again after \n     a person dies.\n\n  Let's understand: All the money you earned is taxed. We have an \nincome tax in this country. So it is taxed. Then you invest it and do \nwhatever, and you die and it is taxed again. So it is not as if this \nmoney has not already been taxed at least once.\n  Mr. President, 79 percent of the people in this survey approve the \nidea of abolishing the estate tax--79 percent. Most of them will never \nsee any direct benefit from that, but they understand it is unfair. \nMost Americans are not envious. Most Americans do not want to squash \neverybody else down as a way of making themselves feel good. They \naspire to earn more and to be able to save and maybe even have to worry \nabout the estate tax.\n  Other polls have reached the same conclusion. I found one very \ninteresting, a Gallup poll of last year, which found that 60 percent of \nthe people supported repeal at that time, even though about three-\nfourths of them did not think they would ever have to pay the death tax \nthemselves. They still favored its repeal because they are good, fair \npeople. And fairness is what the effort to repeal the death tax is all \nabout.\n  Edward J. McCaffrey--I think he would characterize himself as a \nliberal--a professor of law at the University of Southern California, \nsaid this:\n\n       Polls and practices show that we like sin taxes, such as on \n     alcohol and cigarettes. The estate tax is an anti-sin, or \n     virtue tax. It is a tax on work and savings without \n     consumption, on thrift, on long-term savings.\n\n  He is exactly right. It is a tax on virtue. It punishes savings. It \npunishes saving something and trying to pass it on to your kids. It \nbasically says: Spend it all because you can't take it with you. That \nis a lifestyle that some have, perhaps, lived in this ``me'' \ngeneration, but it is not the right lifestyle for most Americans.\n  By the way, it is pretty hard to calibrate anyway. Spend it all \nbecause you can't take it with you; that is the idea here. What if you \nlive a little longer than your bank account lasts? Then you turn to the \nGovernment to take care of you for the rest of the years of your life.\n  Being able to save also means being able to take care of yourself and \nyour family, another virtue. This is a tax on virtue. The professor is \ncorrect.\n  Economists Henry Aaron and Alicia Munnell reached similar conclusions \nin a 1992 study in which they said death taxes:\n\n       . . . have failed to achieve their intended purposes. They \n     raise little revenue. They impose large excess burdens. They \n     are unfair.\n\n  The next myth is that the estate tax is necessary to prevent the \naccumulation of wealth. A lot of people have noted that after about \nthree generations the wealth seems to dissipate. But apart from that--\nand I don't know of any study that can quantify that--I can at least \nwith an anecdote tell you what happens in most cases. These are not the \nGeorge Soros kinds of cases but the average case.\n\n  A family in Arizona--and I am going to mention the man's name because \nhe is a real hero to me. He was one of the best, big-hearted givers in \nPhoenix, AZ, for many years. His name is Jerry Wisotsky. Jerry moved \nout from New York to start a printing company by himself. He gradually \nadded employees. He couldn't say no. Every charity in town went to him. \nHe contributed. He has boys and girls clubs named after him. I won't \nget into his charitable contributions. He was a mainstay for our \ncommunity and supported it. He had a very successful business that \ncould support it. He had over 200 employees when he died.\n  His family tried mightily to plan around that death and to avoid \nhaving to sell the business. His daughter and son-in-law wanted to \ncontinue to run the business. After 2 or 3 years, they realized it was \nfutile. The estate tax was simply too much. They had to sell the \nbusiness to pay the estate tax.\n  Two things happened. First of all, they sold, I think, to a big \nGerman conglomerate. So much for preventing the accumulation of wealth. \nThis little family-owned business that turned into a very good income \nproducer, but which was still a small business, was sold to a giant \ncompany from another country. As I say, so much for the estate tax \npreventing the accumulation of wealth. But it did have the intended \neffect of making his family less able to give, to follow in his \nfootsteps.\n  So we now no longer have Jerry Wisotsky or his daughter, Pearl Marr, \nbeing able to contribute to their community as he used to do.\n  That gets to another myth, that we have to have the estate tax in \norder to force charitable giving. Apart from the lunacy of that \nconcept--it reminds me of the Woody Allen movie ``Take The Money And \nRun'' where Woody Allen plays this inept crook and his parents are seen \nwith masks on saying: We tried to beat religion into that kid. Of \ncourse, it doesn't work.\n  It really doesn't work to force people to give to charity either. In \nfact, there are some interesting statistics. It is a specious argument \nthat we have to have the estate tax in order to support charitable \ngiving. But I think it is especially interesting because of these \nbillionaires now supporting the tax.\n  There are also some studies that demonstrate the elimination of the \nestate tax would actually encourage the wealthy to give more during \ntheir lifetimes but less just before they die or in their bequeath--in \ntheir wills.\n  A study by David Joulfaian, a former Treasury Department economist \nfor the National Bureau of Economic Research at the Brookings \nInstitution, found that the estate tax has an important effect on the \ntiming of charitable gifts. It encourages the very wealthy to bunch \ngifts at death rather than over their lifetime. He noted that the very \nwealthy give much less to charity during their lifetimes than the less \nwealthy, and considerably more through their estate and wills and \nbequeaths. This suggests that the elimination of the estate tax will \nencourage the wealthy to give more during their lifetime and less at \ndeath but not necessarily reduce the total amount of lifetime giving.\n  Another study shows that the bulk of charitable giving is made by \npeople who can't deduct such gifts from their income taxes at all. \nAccording to Giving USA, total charitable giving in 1992 amounted to \n$190-plus billion, and only $15-plus billion--about 8 percent--came\n\n[[Page S1445]]\n\nfrom bequeaths. If the goal is to encourage charitable giving, then \nCongress should consider an above-the-line deduction for all charitable \ngifts--for those who itemize as well as those taxpayers who don't \nitemize--rather than to continue to impose a punitive, confiscatory \nestate tax at the time of death when families can least afford to deal \nwith it.\n  We also find charitable giving is strongly related to income and \nwealth. Simply put, the more income and wealth the people have, the \nmore they tend to give charity.\n  William Randolph, an economist for the Congressional Budget Office, \nconcluded from his research that charitable giving responds much less \nto changes in tax rates than permanent changes in income.\n  It is quite specious to argue that we have to have this tax for \ncharitable giving in this country. Eight percent of the gifts come as \nbequeaths; the rest does not.\n  I also think the story today by the Los Angeles Times about the \npetition signed by all of these billionaires is very interesting. They \nsay it was signed by men whose foundations ``rely heavily on charitable \ndonations.'' This is laid bare. Basically, this is a special interest \ngroup. People who have these foundations need to have money constantly \npouring in so they can force taxes from people in order to play that \ngame. Again, I am sure that in their hands very good things come to \npass. But in someone else's hands, this same charitable giving could do \njust as much good. I find it offensive that these people--basically \nspecial interests in this country--would use the U.S. Government to \nextract taxpayer dollars from people and have the threat of that kind \nof 5-percent rate forcing people to give in their wills to these \ncharitable foundations. If they can't persuade people to do it on the \nmerits from the goodness of their heart, they ought not be in the \nbusiness. That is the way I look at it.\n  There is another myth that the wealthy don't need another tax break. \nOf course, a lot of wealthy don't need a tax break. Of course, these \nare people who invest, which is exactly what our economy needs at this \ntime.\n\n  But I would say something else; that is, we are not talking about \njust these billionaires. Sure, they don't need it. I stipulate that. \nBut there are a lot of small businesspeople and farmers and others who \ndo need to be able to maintain what they are doing. They don't want to \nhave to sell the family farm. They don't want to have to sell the small \nbusiness that I talked about a moment ago. They would like to be able \nto continue the operation generation after generation.\n  The point here about these very wealthy people is that the way we \npassed the bill last year they are going to be taxed anyway. They are \nnot going to be taxed 55 percent when they die, but they are going to \nbe taxed on the capital gains if and when the asset is sold. Eventually \nall assets are disposed of. Their heirs are not going to have to pay 55 \npercent of the estate in taxes. But when their heirs turn around and \nsell those assets under the bill that we passed last year--and I \nsuspect the bill we will put forward this year--they are going to have \nto pay a capital gains tax on the sale. Importantly, they are going to \nhave to pay that without a step-up in basis, except for an exemption \nwhich is equal to a little bit larger than the exemption we provide \ntoday--about a $5 million exemption.\n  So nobody who is exempt today would have to pay under this \nlegislation. Except for that exemption, we do away with the step-up in \nbasis so just as Mr. Gates, Sr., would have to pay a capital gains tax \non the original cost of his investment if he sells that asset when he \neventually dies and leaves that estate to his heirs, when they sell it \nthey are going to have to pay a tax on the gain going back to his \noriginal basis. That means their tax is much less expensive, if you are \ninterested in that. It is going to cost the Treasury a lot less money \nthan some people think it will, but it doesn't let these people off the \nhook. They will be taxed under this proposal, but at least they have \nthe choice of when they are taxed.\n  Instead of having to figure out how to pay this tax right after the \nbreadwinner in the family dies and being faced with the possibility of \nperhaps having to dispose of the assets right then, they can wait until \nthey want to make the economic decision to do so knowing full well they \nare going to pay a tax but they can understand the economics of paying \nthe tax at that time.\n  I think this is the beauty of the approach of what we passed last \nyear, which President Clinton vetoed and which I hope President Bush \nwill include in his estate tax repeal. Remember there is another \nbenefit to this.\n  I will close with this notion: It is very difficult to try to come up \nwith an amount of exemption that is fair around the country. Some \npeople said: Let's not repeal the tax; let's just create a much larger \nexemption.\n  I was talking to one of my colleagues from California yesterday who \nsaid the problem with that is that property values in California are \nnow so high, and getting so much larger, that what is a taxable estate \nin California wouldn't even begin to qualify as a taxable estate in \nanother State--let's say in a Midwest or Southern State. But in \nCalifornia, just because of the value of the property, even if that is \nall you own, you could easily be kicked up into the bracket where you \nhave to pay a capital gains tax.\n  There is another problem that people are finding more and more. \nAgain, this is happening in California. There is an environmental \nproblem there. As people find they have to sell their property in order \nto pay the estate taxes, we are talking about environmentally sensitive \nland that could be held but is now having to be sold for development. \nAnd there are always plenty of developers hanging around ready to buy \nthis good land and develop it.\n\n  What we are finding is that more and more native habitats are being \ndestroyed as a result. With that in mind, Michael Bean of the Nature \nConservancy, observed that the death tax ``is highly regressive in the \nsense that it encourages the destruction of ecologically important \nland.'' It represents a real and present threat to endangered and \nthreatened species and habitats. And because it tends to encourage \ndevelopment and sprawl, a lot of environmental organizations have \njoined in urging this repeal. Among those are the Izaak Walton League, \nthe Wildlife Society, Quail Unlimited, the Wildlife Management \nInstitute, and the International Association of Fish and Wildlife \nAgencies.\n  We see there are a lot of myths about the estate tax. That is exactly \nwhat they are, myths.\n  Second, we see that many Americans won't benefit directly from its \nrepeal. There is very strong support for its repeal because Americans \nare fair people. They understand what will help our economy, and they \nunderstand what is fair to working families.\n  I think there are two motivations for retaining the tax. One of them \nis envy--that nobody should have more than I have. But it turns out \nthat very few Americans support that. The other is this special \ninterest notion that having the death tax is the only way we can make \npeople contribute to a charity. They are going to force them to be \ncharitable. Apart from whether or not that is a moral point of view, it \ncertainly isn't or ought not to be the function of Government. As I \nsaid, if we want to use the power of Government to encourage charitable \ngiving, there are much better ways to provide a deduction for \ncharitable giving for both those who itemize and those who don't.\n  There are other things we can do as well. At the bottom of the day, \nit is not surprising that these billionaires would say: Let's keep the \ndeath tax. To them it doesn't matter. I renew my challenge. Are you \nwilling to pay 100 percent of the death tax you owe or have you spent a \nlot of money to try to do estate planning to get around this? I think \nthat would be a very interesting thing to find out. Most Americans \ncannot afford to do that. That is why this tax needs to be repealed.\n\n  I join President Bush in urging my colleagues to ensure that when his \ntax package passes, that it has the repeal of the death tax as one of \nits key components.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 12 \nnoon shall be under the control of the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. \nThomas, or his designee.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON.

I \nappreciate his leadership in that effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/15/senate-section/article/S1446-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1446-S1447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL SECURITY AND OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, another high priority for our Congress \nis our national security, making sure the men and women in the military \nhave the tools they need to do their job, because their job is \nprotecting our freedom. They are laying their lives on the line every \nday to do that. I think they deserve the respect, attention and the \ntools they need to be successful.\n  Ten years ago, President Bush, Secretary Cheney, and General Powell, \ndeveloped a plan to downsize the military while keeping it strong and \nready. Their plan envisioned a leaner force, consisting of fewer \ntroops, ships, and aircraft, but one that was 100-percent manned and \nsupported. This is not the force we have today.\n  Today's military has been cut in half since 1991, but the half is not \nwhole. Our services are struggling to recruit and to retain personnel. \nWe are cannibalizing ships, aircraft, and other weapons systems to \nsupport deployed units. The military is completing the missions today \non the backs of our overworked and overextended troops. As they have \ndone in the past, they are spending an extraordinary amount of time and \neffort doing whatever it takes to get by.\n  Congress and the administration must work together to help our men \nand women in uniform. They deserve it; and America requires it. We \ncould easily throw money at the problems and feel as if we are doing \nsomething, but the military requires more than money. It requires a \nnational strategy and leadership from the top. In today's new world, we \nneed to assess what we are doing, why we are doing it, and provide the \nassets to successfully achieve our mission.\n  In the future, we must ensure that our military is used wisely, not \nwastefully. This requires an immediate review of overseas deployments \nand missions. We must focus our military commitments and we must focus \nour objectives. Before we deploy our forces into harm's way, we must \nknow what it is we expect to accomplish, we must define success, and we \nmust have an exit strategy.\n  We also need to encourage our allies to take a broader role where \nthey can, allowing our forces to contribute in areas where the United \nStates has significant advantages in command and control and logistics. \nLeadership means convincing our allies to do their share in their own \nbackyards and not simply accepting their threats to leave Bosnia or \nKosovo unless we remain with them on the ground. We must be able to \nconvince our allies that if they will step up to the plate, if they \nwill exercise their responsibility, that we will be a backstop for them \nif an emergency occurs.\n  Today's military requires better pay, better treatment, and better \ntraining. In order to recruit and retain military personnel, we must \nimprove their pay. We can no longer allow fast food restaurants to \ncompete with the military for pay and benefits. That is hardly the \nstandard that we should have.\n  Our military deserve pay commensurate with their skills. They demand \nhighly educated recruits to operate the sophisticated weapons systems \nthat are used today and that will be used in the future. We cannot \nattract our young men and women unless we provide a competitive \nstandard of living and quality of life.\n  The President's initiative to add $1.4 billion in pay and bonuses \nwill help close the gap between military and civilian pay. In addition, \nwe must treat our military personnel and their families better. There \nis an old saying that we recruit the soldier, but we retain the family.\n  In my years in the Senate, I have focused on improving three areas in \nthe quality of life of our military: improved military housing, \nincluding barracks and family housing; access to quality medical care; \nand increased support for quality schools for military children.\n  On Monday President Bush proposed adding $400 million to upgrade \nsubstandard housing and $3.9 billion to improve military health care. \nThis is so important to our military personnel, especially the ones \ndeployed overseas without their families.\n  I have visited with our military people on the ground in places such \nas Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bosnia, and Kosovo. I can tell you, the No. 1 \nitem on their agenda is quality health care for their families who are \nback home. They need to have decent housing, access to quality medical \ncare, and good schools when they are away. Nothing is more frustrating, \nnothing will drive the soldier out of the Army faster, than to call \nhome and have to contend with medical care problems from a phone booth \nin Bosnia.\n  Finally, for too long, we have neglected the facilities where our \ntroops work and train. Forcing people to work in 60-year-old frame \nbuildings with little heat and no air-conditioning, and attempting to \nmaintain sophisticated aircraft and systems when hangers are leaking \naround them, is certainly not conducive to retaining good people.\n\n  Our current ranges and training facilities are also a national \ntreasure, but they need to be upgraded. Improved training facilities \nalso affect quality of life by allowing troops to effectively and \nefficiently train and then return home.\n  Taking care of our people also involves taking care of their \nequipment and buying the weapons they need to win if they are called \nupon to go. We need to modernize existing weapons. At the same time, we \nneed to look ahead and use America's lead in technology to build our \nfuture weapons systems. American technology has been a force multiplier \nin the past and will be even more important in the future. We cannot \nallow potential enemies to gain a technology advantage while we spend \nour time and money on incremental improvements.\n  The President has said he intends to earmark $2.6 billion of the \nmilitary procurement budget for research and development. We will use \ntechnology to reduce the risk to our forces and overwhelm any enemy \nquickly.\n  The military of the 21st century must be agile, lethal, readily \ndeployable, and require minimal logistical support. Many of our \nadversaries will not confront our forces directly, therefore we must be \nprepared for both threats posed by terrorists or blackmail by rogue \nnations.\n  Our Army and Marine Corps must be light enough to quickly deploy but \nheavy enough to win. Our Navy must be able to fight at sea as well as \naffect the fight over land, and our Air Force must have a global reach. \nOur defense strategy should be prepared to defend rather than react. \nThis is why deploying an anti-ballistic missile system is so important \nto American security.\n  Missile defense is not a threat against responsible nations. Rather, \nit is an insurance policy that would provide doubt in the mind of a \nrogue state, protect our Nation, help our allies, and increase the \noptions available to the President.\n  I applaud the President for sticking by his guns in saying we are \ngoing to deploy a missile defense system, and I especially appreciate \nwhat Senator Thad Cochran has done year after year after year to move \nmissile defense forward.\n  Taking care of our military includes taking care of our veterans. We \nmust keep the promises we make or why would anyone trust us? We must \nrenew our commitment to our veterans. We must keep our promises to \nthese past defenders of freedom by providing quality medical and \neducational benefits.\n  I will soon introduce a bill regarding gulf war illness. Thousands of \nour gulf war veterans are affected by a chronic disability. One in \nseven have come back from Desert Storm with a disability they did not \nhave when they left. These men and women served our Nation honorably \nand deserve the care to which they are entitled.\n  Our veterans also deserve educational benefits second to none. \nVeteran education pays a high yield on our investment. The veterans of \nWorld War II became our most educated segment of society upon their \nreturn home. These men and women went on to become our leaders in \nbusiness and government. Veteran education has always provided a big \nincentive to volunteer for service. We must renew our commitment by \nimproving and increasing these benefits.\n\n[[Page S1447]]\n\n  If we expect to recruit and to retain our best, America must provide \nthem with the best: the best pay, housing, medical care, and other \nbenefits. I applaud the President's commitment to improving our \nmilitary and strongly support his plans to look before we leap. Our \nresources are limited and they must be used wisely, but we can set \npriorities. We can have a budget that meets our strategy, if we have a \nwell-run military with a clear strategy.\n  We should deploy our troops when there is a U.S. security interest, \nbut not over deploy or over demand their deployment. If we remember \nthis, then we will have a military that is well funded, efficient, and \nwill accomplish the goals we have set for them.\n  Of all of the areas for which Congress is responsible, national \nsecurity is No. 1. It is our highest priority. It is the responsibility \nof the Federal Government to make sure all of those who have died in \nthe past 200 plus years, maintaining the freedom of this country, will \nnever, ever have died in vain. The only way we can repay them is to \nkeep the zeal for freedom alive in our generation and in future \ngenerations.\n  We will keep the zeal for freedom alive if we keep our national \nsecurity a No. 1 priority and we respect the military who have the job \nto make sure our freedom is intact today and will be for our children \nand grandchildren.\n  I applaud President Bush's initiatives. He is going to make sure we \ntake every step in a thoughtful way. We are going to rebuild our \nnational defense. We are going to renew our commitment to national \nsecurity for the families of our country, for the protection of our \nallies, and for the protection of democracy, wherever there are people \nin the world who are trying to become free, with the example for \nfreedom being the United States of America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I first commend the Senator from Texas \nfor her excellent statement on the needs of our men and women in \nuniform. As the Senator from Texas, I had the opportunity earlier this \nweek to accompany President Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld, as well as a \nnumber of Members of Congress, on a trip to Fort Stewart in Georgia. \nThere we had the opportunity to talk firsthand with our soldiers. We \nalso had the opportunity to tour their barracks.\n  I must say I was shocked with what I saw. We saw soldiers living \nthree in a very cramped space, 55 square feet per soldier, housing that \nis an embarrassment to the United States of America.\n  Mr. President, there is an old statement that nothing is too good for \nour troops. Well, ``nothing'' appears to be exactly what they are \ngetting in some parts of this country. We need to recommit ourselves, \nif we are going to solve our recruitment and retention problems, to \nproviding quality housing, competitive pay, and good health and \nretirement benefits to our men and women in uniform. For that reason, I \napplaud the President's initiative and his announcements this week of \nhis commitment to remedy the pay, housing, and benefit problems that \nwere so evident on this trip.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to say how much I appreciate \nthe statement that has been made by the Senator from Maine. I also \nappreciate that she took the time to go and see for herself. She is a \nnew member of the Armed Services Committee and she wanted to see the \nconditions in which our soldiers are living. I know this is now going \nto be a priority for her to make these improvements.\n  I talked to the President after that visit he made, and he was so \ntouched by the response he got from our troops. I know he has \nrecommitted himself to making sure our troops have the support they \nneed to do the job we are asking them to do. So I thank the Senator \nfrom Maine for going on that very important trip and for making that \nstatement and that commitment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the time I have used not be counted \nagainst the time of the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Just to put \neverybody on alert, I think at 1:40 there will be a rollcall vote.\n  I rise today in support of Joe Allbaugh to be Director of the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency. I have had the pleasure of knowing Joe \nAllbaugh for a long time. He is a native Oklahoman. He is actually a \nnative of Kay County, my home county in northern Oklahoma. I had the \npleasure of knowing him at Oklahoma State where he was a member, \nactually, of the fraternity of which I was a member. He is a very good \nfriend of my wife's brother Steve. I think the world of Joe Allbaugh \nand his wife Dianne, and I think he will do an outstanding job as \nDirector of FEMA. He will replace James Lee Witt, a native of Arkansas, \nwho served our country and Arkansas well in that capacity, and I am \nconfident Joe Allbaugh will as well.\n  Joe Allbaugh was politically active going all the way back to \nGoldwater. He helped our former colleague Henry Bellmon, not only in \nBellmon's campaign but also in his administration. He also worked with \nGovernor Bush in his administration, was chief of staff, and became \nquite familiar with State emergencies and disasters.\n  When we were growing up in Oklahoma, our neighborhood was known as \nTornado Alley. Actually, in Joe's hometown of Blackwell, OK, in 1955 we \nhad a severe tornado that killed 20 people and destroyed a very \nsignificant portion of the town. I remember that tornado well. All of \nus do. Joe Allbaugh learned then the value of coordination of emergency \nresponses to natural disasters.\n  During his tenure as chief of staff to Governor Bush, he was well \naware of the natural disasters that happened throughout the State of \nTexas. In 1998, there was a flood in San Antonio that killed 30 people. \nHe was involved in coordinating State responses as well as requesting \nFederal resources and working with Federal officials. So he has a good \nappreciation of the combination of what should be done on the State \nlevel and what can and should be done on the Federal level as well.\n  He is well prepared for this task. I think he will do an outstanding \njob. I think all of us will be proud to have Joe Allbaugh serve as \nDirector of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. I urge all my \ncolleagues to support his nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/15/senate-section/article/S1448-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1448-S1449]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF JOE M. ALLBAUGH TO BE DIRECTOR OF THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY \n                           MANAGEMENT AGENCY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Joe M. \nAllbaugh to be Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, \nwhich the clerk will report nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Joe M. Allbaugh, of \nTexas, to be Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Joseph Allbaugh to be the next director of the Federal \nEmergency Management Administration, FEMA. I was pleased to hear that \nMr. Allbaugh has experience in dealing with natural disasters in Texas \nand in his home state of Oklahoma.\n  I'm sure he learned during his tenure as chief of staff to former \nGovernor George Bush that recovering from a disaster requires great \ncollaboration and compassion. We learned that last year in New Mexico \nwhen we were faced with numerous forest fires, including the Cerro \nGrande fire that started near Los Alamos.\n  Because of the U.S. government's role in starting a controlled burn \nthat soon burned out of control, eventually burning hundreds of homes \nand thousands of acres of forest land, the New Mexico delegation \ndrafted the Cerro Grande Fire Assistance Act, CGFAA, and got the bill \nsigned into law on July 13 of last year.\n  I emphasize that this was a delegation effort because I want Mr. \nAllbaugh to know that the New Mexico delegation worked side-by-side on \nevery aspect of this fire compensation legislation. When it was \nintroduced, all five members of the delegation were present. I hope \nthat FEMA, under Mr. Allbaugh's guidance, will recognize the importance \nof collaborating with all members of the New Mexico delegation when it \ncomes to the Cerro Grande fire, or any other disasters we are faced \nwith in the future.\n  Because of FEMA's strong track record under James Lee Witt of \nresponding quickly and effectively to disasters, the CGFAA designated \nFEMA as the lead agency to compensate the victims of the Cerro Grande \nfire. FEMA responded quickly and set up an Office of Cerro Grande Fire \nClaims in New Mexico in August 2000.\n  We are now almost six months into the claims process and we are \nbeginning to face a few problems. I would like to point out to Mr. \nAllbaugh that the policy section in the Interim Final Regulations--\nregulations that have governed the claims process thus far--says, ``It \nis FEMA's policy to provide for the expeditious resolution of \nmeritorious claims through a process that is administered with \nsensitivity to the burdens placed upon Claimants by the Cerro Grande \nFire.'' Based on the numerous complaints I have received recently about \nthe claims process, it does not appear that the stated policy is being \ncarried out as anticipated.\n  Mr. Allbaugh has been nominated for a position that carries with it \nenormous responsibility. I trust that he will carry out his \nresponsibilities with respect to the Cerro Grande fire claims process \nwith the sensitivity urged in the regulations.\n  Few of the fire victims have been able to begin rebuilding their \nlives and their homes because the final regulations are not complete. \nMany are hesitant to settle their claims against the federal government \nuntil the final regulations are published. Unfortunately, FEMA's 180-\nday deadline for settling claims is approaching for some claimants. We \nnever anticipated that this deadline would come before the final \nregulations were in place. Nearly four months have passed since the \ncomment period ended for the interim final regulations, yet we are \nstill waiting for final regulations. I strongly urge Mr. Allbaugh to \nmake it a top priority to ensure that the final regulations are \npublished in the very near future.\n  Moreover, I urge Mr. Allbaugh to keep in mind that the Cerro Grande \nfire is different from most, if not all, other disasters FEMA has \nresponded to in the past. This fire was not a natural disaster. It did \nnot start as an act of God. Because of the federal government's \ninvolvement, the government had a responsibility to respond \nexpeditiously and thoroughly.\n  The New Mexico delegation initiated that response by introducing \ncompensation legislation. President Clinton responded by signing the \nlegislation. It is now in Mr. Allbaugh's hands to make sure fire claims \nare responded to expeditiously and with compassion.\n  I look forward to sitting down with Mr. Allbaugh in the near future \nto discuss his plans for carrying out the intent of the CGFAA.\n  In the meantime, I will cast my vote in favor of Mr. Allbaugh.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to voice my sincere \ncongratulations to Joe Allbaugh on his confirmation today as the new \ndirector of the\n\n[[Page S1449]]\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency. I welcome him most sincerely to \nthe Washington community.\n  Director Allbaugh has pledged to work closely with state and local \ngovernments. I believe this is the key to effective response. I \nencourage him to direct additional energies to expanding the ability of \nlocal agencies to respond immediately to those disasters that can be \nforeseen but not scheduled.\n  In my State of Alaska, we are familiar with natural disasters. We \nhave experienced them, from storm flooding to tsunamis, to the great \nAlaska earthquake of 1964. We know the value of a strong federal \npresence during such crises.\n  I know that he is interested in my State. He has visited before, and \nI hope to be able to welcome him back as soon as possible--preferably \nwith a fishing pole in hand, not on some less welcome occasion.\n  Joe Allbaugh is a big man with big skills. His reputation is that of \nan extremely accomplished manager with extraordinary abilities, and he \nhas worked on campaigns that have given him knowledge of key issues in \na majority of the states. These traits will be important to the smooth \noperation of FEMA, which is faced with extraordinary pressures in the \nevent of a major disaster, as we have seen in past events. I am \nconfident that he will serve our people and our communities well during \ntimes of need.\n  As the Governor's chief of staff in Texas, he both helped respond to \nimmediate crises, and helped shape his state's disaster response \nprocesses. He now has the opportunity to do the same thing on a much \ngrander scale--one which will be felt in every state of our great \ncountry. I look forward to his guidance in this critical and sensitive \narena.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to address an urgent issue \nin the rural parts of my State regarding a problem we are having with \nthe digital divide being created. What is taking place is that in urban \nand suburban areas, they are getting access to high-speed Internet \naccess so people can get on and get large quantities of data about \nwhich they can communicate back and forth rapidly. That is occurring \nand it is a good thing.\n  In the rural areas of my State and in many places across the country, \nthey are not getting access to high-speed Internet. They have the old \ntype of carrier that can get Internet access. They have Internet \naccess, but they cannot get the high speed. Less than 19 percent of \nrural areas across the country have that high-speed Internet access \ncompared to over 80 percent of the suburban areas across the country.\n  I will shortly be submitting a bill to try to address this inequity \nthat is taking place and to keep this digital divide from further \nexacerbating the economies in suburban areas versus rural areas. The \nbill I put forward last year was the Regulatory Relief Act. It provides \nregulatory relief for those companies operating in rural areas to go \nahead and deploy high-speed Internet access, and then not have to sell \nthis new equipment at a reduced market price. It provides a regulatory \nrelief to them to be able to do so.\n  I have worked on this issue for some period of time. We have worked \non it in the Commerce Committee. There have been hearings held in the \nCommerce Committee on this. In the past, typically in the United \nStates, when one of these sorts of situations starts to develop where \nrural areas get hindered because of their population being spread over \nwide areas versus urban areas, the Congress has frequently stepped in, \nthe U.S. Government has frequently stepped in. Rural electrification \nand rural telephony come to mind, where you wouldn't have gotten \ndistribution in the rural areas because it was just so far between \npeople and the private companies could not make money. In this \nsituation, we are not going to have to put resources forward but, \nrather, we have to put regulatory relief forward for the investment \nthat will take place.\n  I have contacted a number of private sector groups that are looking \nat this and saying they will invest if we will provide them some \nregulatory relief. We will get that number up from 19 percent to a much \nhigher number.\n  Last year, in the bill we put forward, and what we will put forward \nthis year as well, is a requirement that, to get the regulatory relief, \nthere has to be an increased deployment into the rural areas. That will \nbe part of this as well.\n  It is a common theme in Washington today that broadband Internet \naccess is revolutionizing the ways in which ever greater numbers of \nAmericans are using the Internet. No longer a domain of simple data, \ngraphics, and pictures, broadband access and its faster transmission \nspeeds are transforming the Internet from a 56 bit-limited medium into \na multi-megabyte medium, the practical outcome of which are functions \nsuch as video on demand, invaluable real-time telemedicine, improved \ndistance learning, and powerful new tools for consumers and businesses \nalike on the e-commerce frontier.\n  Yet, as we revel in this technological marvel, we continue to find \nourselves faced with the reality that there has been and continues to \nbe a growing digital divide in our Nation--a separation\n\n[[Page S1450]]\n\nof our urban and rural communities into broadband haves and have nots \nrespectively. While it may have become fashionable for us to recognize \nthe threat of this disparity it has not been so fashionable to actually \ndo something about it. So, as we introduce legislative proposals, hold \nhearings, and generally acknowledge the difficulty in advancing any \nparticular plan to help rural America, the digital divide continues to \ngrow.\n  Last year the National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration in conjunction with the Rural Utilities Service \nconcluded that broadband deployment in rural areas was indeed lacking. \nNTIA and RUS found that cable TV companies and local telephone \ncompanies were focusing on deploying cable modems and DSL in markets \nwith the highest population densities in order to maximize revenues. It \nis no wonder then that the Federal Communications Commission's most \nrecent report on the status of broadband deployment found that a mere \n19 percent of our most remote communities had at least one subscriber \nto high-speed Internet access.\n  During the 106th Congress I introduced legislation, the Broadband \nRegulatory Relief Act of 2000, to serve as a vehicle for overcoming \nthis divide. My legislative efforts last Congress reflected the real \nand pressing need for action to insure that all Americans have access \nto broadband. My legislation's answer to this problem was to create an \nincentive for local telephone companies--already providing telephone \nservice in our rural and remote communities--to deploy these advanced \nservices. By providing these companies with regulatory relief we can \ncounter the high cost of deploying broadband facilities in rural areas \nwhere populations are more dispersed than in densely populated areas.\n  Currently, the cable TV and competitive local telephone industries \nfind their advanced services unencumbered by regulation. But because \nthey have coalesced around our more densely populated regions, their \nmarketplace freedom has not translated into rural broadband access. \nYet, some members of the competitive community continue to argue that \ncompetition alone will ultimately drive broadband deployment into rural \nareas. As the FCC's deployment statistics bare out, this is not \noccurring. We can ill afford to hurry up and wait for the day when \nthese companies see fit to include rural America in business plans \ncurrently dominated by a focus on urban businesses. The economics of \nbroadband deployment in rural areas simply do not facilitate the type \nof competition we are currently witnessing in urban and densely \npopulated suburban areas.\n  Meanwhile, contrasted with cable TV and CLECs, we continue to \nregulate broadband services offered by incumbent telephone companies as \nif they are part and parcel of their traditional telephone businesses. \nThis simply is not the case. Broadband facilities being deployed \nthroughout our cities and towns require billions of dollars of new \ncapital investment in new infrastructure. Under the current regulatory \nregime, the sparse populations of rural communities diminish the return \non broadband investment to such an extent that incumbent phone \ncompanies are not deploying them in those areas. By removing these \nincumbent regulations on what is new infrastructure in a nascent \nmarket, we will be providing local phone companies with the incentive \nto deploy broadband in exchange for the opportunity to pursue new \nrevenue streams.\n  Let me be clear that my legislation in no way seeks to upset \ncompetition developing in our urban markets. The Broadband Regulatory \nRelief Act would have removed voice regulations from the advanced \nservice offerings by incumbent local telephone companies, while \npreserving those same competitive measures for their traditional \ntelephone services. The bill simply recognizes that broadband, as \nopposed to traditional voice service, is a new service in which no one \ncompetitor should be given a government-mandated advantage. Incumbent \ntelephone companies started from the same zero broadband-subscribership \nlevels as the cable TV and CLEC industry, and each of them should go \nforward in broadband deployment on a level playing field.\n  These are the principles embodied in the legislation I introduced \nlast year, and will be embodied in legislation I intend to introduce \nshortly. I remain convinced that, before seeking out alternative \nsolutions, we must look to deregulation as the best, most expedient \nmeans of insuring rural America is not left behind. The power of \nindustry to innovate and deploy products and services to the public \nonce government is removed from the marketplace is awesome, as proven \nby the impressive growth of the wireless industry, the Internet and e-\ncommerce--both representing industries largely spared from Government \ninterference.\n  Some have suggested alternatives such as tax incentives or fixed \nwireless solutions to achieve rural broadband deployment. While we can \nand should seek out alternative means of deploying these services \nthroughout the Nation, we cannot afford to delay in enabling currently \navailable solutions from working now. We can always seek out new \nalternatives and when confronted with marketplace developments that \nthreaten the interests of consumers, we can certainly enact measures to \nprotect them. But the challenge facing us most immediately in this \nmatter is to be unafraid to rely on our industries, responsible for the \nlong period of economic growth we have enjoyed, to do what they do \nbest: innovate, and offer new products and services to the public.\n  I recognize that others have differing views and there exists a range \nof opinions on how best to promote broadband deployment in rural areas. \nWhile I may disagree with some of the views and proposals existing in \nthe marketplace of ideas on this matter, I remain keenly interested in \nworking with those who advocate them in the further interests of rural \nAmerica. I am heartened by the knowledge that whatever our \nphilosophical or policy-based disagreements, we all share the common \ngoal of extending this vitally important technology to rural America. I \nlook forward to working with all interested parties to seek a solution \non how best to deliver these important services to rural and remote \ncommunities, and I am confident we can work together to achieve our \ncommon goal.\n  The kind Senator from West Virginia has been willing to allow me to \ncome here, even though he has patiently waited on the floor to make his \nstatement. I appreciate his generosity in allowing me to do so. I \nappreciate his kindness and generosity and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I thank all my colleagues for their \ncooperation in clearing this resolution. For those Members who may want \nto speak on the resolution, we are providing time on Monday, February \n26, and some additional time on Tuesday, February 27, if necessary.\n  I know that Senator Gramm and Senator Miller, perhaps Senator Reid, \nSenator Dodd, and others may want to speak on this resolution. I am \npleased we have been able to clear this bill honoring Senator Paul \nCoverdell.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could just briefly respond to the \nleader, Senator Miller and Senator Cleland wish to speak on this bill. \nBut they have agreed that they will do it when we come back after the \nrecess. Senator Miller wants to speak for 1 hour, and Senator Cleland \nwants to speak for half an hour.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank Senator Reid for making sure Members \nunderstand that these Senators would like to speak, including Senator \nCleland. I thank Senator Reid, Senator Daschle, and again Senator Dodd \nfor their fairness in being able to work through this. We will continue \nto work to make sure this whole area is properly attended to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I don't expect the leader to stay for some \nremarks I will give at the conclusion of the majority leader's \npresentation. But I want him to know and others of my colleagues that I \nconsidered Paul Coverdell to be a very good friend of mine. We worked \nvery closely together chairing or being ranking member on the committee \nthat dealt with the Peace Corps during his tenure. In fact, I arranged \nand handled his confirmation process to become Director of the Peace \nCorps and feel very strongly about the relationship I had with him.\n  The concerns I raised over the last days have nothing whatsoever to \ndo with my admiration and respect for Paul Coverdell. They have to do \nwith an institution with which I have been closely identified and \naffiliated for 40 years, the Peace Corps. I am the only Member of this \nChamber who served as a Peace Corps volunteer. In fact, I was the first \nMember of the U.S. Congress elected to serve in the Peace Corps as a \nvolunteer along with Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts some 33 years ago.\n  My concern and my involvement with this organization are deeply felt. \nThe remarks I will give this afternoon have to address that, as well as \nthe larger issue to which the majority leader has referred; that is, \nthe issue of the naming process that goes on around town for which I \nbelieve a number of my colleagues share a common concern. Maybe at some \npoint we might draft some legislation that allows for a deliberate \nprocess to be used rather than sort of racing to the finish line as to \nwho gets to put a label on some building or monument.\n  I appreciate his listening. But I want him to know that over these \nlast several days as I raised my objection yesterday--the Senator from \nNevada had an objection--I really wanted to have some time to pause and \nthink this process through. But I appreciate and I know how closely the \nmajority leader was to Paul Coverdell and how much his friendship meant \nto him. I hope he understands that what I was engaged in in no way was \nmeant to be any disrespect at all for our former colleague but went to \na deeper issue, one about which I feel strongly.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, let me say to the Senator from Connecticut \nthat while they are appreciated, his assurances in that regard are not \nnecessary. I remember quite well the speech the Senator from \nConnecticut gave on the floor after Senator Coverdell's death. I \nremember it particularly because it was so good and it was so \npassionate.\n  Second, we all know of the Senator's investment in and his commitment \nto the Peace Corps, and nobody would ever question that he cares about \nit, is interested in it, and will continue to be a supporter and \nguardian.\n  Lastly, the Senator from Connecticut, of all Senators, never has to \nsay to us that he wouldn't be properly respectful of another colleague \nor a former colleague. The Senator from Connecticut has proven over and \nover again that when it comes to his colleagues in the Senate, his \nrespect for them as individuals and his respect for them when they \nleave this institution is unwavering.\n  The Senator didn't have to make that statement. We never doubt it, \nand he was very courteous in the way he handled it. I appreciate that \nvery much.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as we pass this resolution to name the \nWashington headquarters of one of President Kennedy's greatest \nlegacies, the Peace Corps, after Paul Coverdell, Senators should recall \nthat we already honored our departed friend and colleague last year. In \naddition to the programs that were named for Senator Coverdell last \nyear that have already been identified by Senator Dodd, we honored \nSenator Coverdell by placing his name on another major Government \nprogram and to the legislation that established it--the Paul Coverdell \nNational Forensic Sciences Improvement Act of 2000.\n  We were all shocked and saddened last July by the untimely passing of \nour friend, Paul Coverdell. As I said at the time, he was one of the \nkindest people to grace this floor, and there was a certain \npeacefulness about him that was always pleasantly contagious. In a \nsometimes very divisive Senate, that peacefulness was so respected.\n  All of us who worked with Paul liked him; we missed him, and we \nwanted to honor his memory in an appropriate way. I think we did that. \nOn October 26, 2000--just a few months after his sudden passing--the \nPaul Coverdell National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act of 2000 \nsailed through the Senate by unanimous consent. The House passed the \nbill a few months later, and President Clinton signed it into law on \nDecember 21. I worked closely with Senator Sessions to ensure passage \nof that legislation last year.\n  The Paul Coverdell National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act calls \nfor an infusion of Federal funds to improve the quality of State and \nlocal crime labs. Passage of this important legislation was a fitting \ntribute to the former senior Senator from Georgia, who had been a \nleader on similar legislation in the past. Paul Coverdell was committed \nto ensuring that justice in this country is neither delayed nor denied, \nand he understood that existing backlogs in our Nation's crime labs \nwere denying the swift administration of justice.\n  In his last years in the Senate, Paul Coverdell made the improvement \nof forensic science services one of his highest priorities. Rather than \nrenaming\n\n[[Page S1452]]\n\nmore programs or buildings in Paul's honor, we should be funding the \nimportant legislation that he championed, and that we already passed in \nhis memory.\n  Let me say a few words about this legislation, which I strongly \nsupported.\n  The use of quality forensic science services is widely accepted as a \nkey to effective crime-fighting, especially with advanced technologies \nsuch as DNA testing. Over the past decade, DNA testing has emerged as \nthe most reliable forensic technique for identifying criminals when \nbiological material is left at a crime scene. Because of its scientific \nprecision, DNA testing can, in some cases, conclusively establish a \nsuspect's guilt or innocence. In other cases, DNA testing may not \nconclusively establish guilt or innocence, but may have significant \nprobative value for investigators.\n  While DNA's power to root out the truth has been a boon to law \nenforcement, it has also been the salvation of law enforcement's \nmistakes--those who for one reason or another, are prosecuted and \nconvicted of crimes that they did not commit. In more than 80 cases in \nthis country, DNA evidence has led to the exoneration of innocent men \nand women who were wrongfully convicted. This number includes at least \n10 individuals sentenced to death, some of whom came within days of \nbeing executed. In more than a dozen cases, moreover, post-conviction \nDNA testing that has exonerated an innocent person has also enhanced \npublic safety by providing evidence that led to the apprehension of the \nreal perpetrator.\n  Clearly, forensic science services like DNA testing are critical to \nthe effective administration of justice in 21st century America.\n  Forensic science workloads have increased significantly over the past \n5 years, both in number and complexity. Since Congress established the \nCombined DNA Index System in the mid-1990s, States have been busy \ncollecting DNA samples from convicted offenders for analysis and \nindexing. Increased Federal funding for State and local law enforcement \nprograms has resulted in more and better trained police officers who \nare collecting immense amounts of evidence that can and should be \nsubjected to crime laboratory analysis.\n  Funding has simply not kept pace with this increasing demand, and \nState crime laboratories are now seriously bottlenecked. Backlogs have \nimpeded the use of new technologies like DNA testing in solving cases \nwithout suspects--and reexamining cases in which there are strong \nclaims of innocence--as laboratories are required to give priority \nstatus to those cases in which a suspect is known. In some parts of the \ncountry, investigators must wait several months--and sometimes more \nthan a year--to get DNA test results from rape and other violent crime \nevidence. Solely for lack of funding, critical evidence remains \nuntested while rapists and killers remain at large, victims continue to \nanguish, and statutes of limitations on prosecution expire.\n  Let me describe the situation in my home State. The Vermont Forensics \nLaboratory is currently operating in an old Vermont State Hospital \nbuilding in Waterbury, VT. Though it is proudly one of only two fully-\naccredited forensics labs in New England, it is trying to do 21st \ncentury science in a 1940's building. The lab has very limited space \nand no central climate control--both essential conditions for precise \nforensic science. It also has a large storage freezer full of untested \nDNA evidence from unsolved cases, for which there are no other leads \nbesides the untested evidence. The evidence is not being processed \nbecause the lab does not have the space, equipment or manpower.\n  I commend the scientists and lab personnel at the Vermont Forensics \nLaboratory for the fine work they do everyday under difficult \ncircumstances. But the people of the State of Vermont deserve better.\n  The Paul Coverdell National Forensic Sciences Improvement Act--if and \nwhen it is fully funded--will give States like Vermont the help they \ndesperately need to handle the increased workloads placed upon their \nforensic science systems. It allocates $738 million over the next 6 \nyears for grants to qualified forensic science laboratories and medical \nexaminer's offices for laboratory accreditation, automated equipment, \nsupplies, training, facility improvements, and staff enhancements.\n  We do not honor our colleague's memory by establishing a program in \nhis name and then leaving it unfunded. I urge my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle to support full and immediate funding of the Paul \nCoverdell National Sciences Improvement Act.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I am honored to be an original cosponsor of \nlegislation to memorialize our friend, Senator Paul Coverdell. Paul \nserved the citizens of the State of Georgia and the United States for \nover three decades as a State legislator, Peace Corps director, and \nU.S. Senator. I believe that this bill is a fitting and appropriate way \nto memorialize Paul and his work.\n  This legislation has three components. The bill names the Washington \nheadquarters of the Peace Corps after Paul Coverdell. The legislation \nreaffirms language approved at the end of last year to ensue that the \nPeace Corps' World Wise Schools program will carry his name as well. \nPaul created the program during his tenure as Peace Corps director. The \nWorld Wise Schools initiative links Peace Corps volunteers serving \naround the globe with classrooms here in the United States. Paul \ncorrectly saw that such an effort would promote cultural awareness and \nfoster an appreciation for global connections. Finally, the legislation \nauthorizes an appropriation of $10 million, to be augmented by $30 \nmillion of state and private funds, to construct the Paul D. Coverdell \nBuilding for Biomedical and Health Sciences at the University of \nGeorgia. Paul Coverdell was a tireless supporter of education in \nGeorgia, and this building will be a living memorial to him and an \nunparalleled resource for the students, researchers, and educators of \nhis State and our Nation.\n  The legislation consists of measures agreed upon by a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators assigned by Senator Lott and Daschle to review the \nmany worthy ideas proposed to honor Paul. After considering many \nsuggestions, Senators Harry Reid, Zell Miller, Mike DeWine, and I \nagreed on the three provisions included in the legislation which has \ntoday been introduced by the majority leader and passed by the Senate. \nI believe that there can be no more fitting tribute to Paul and to all \nhe achieved for the people of Georgia and the country that he loved and \nserved until the day he died.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, I am honored to rise today to speak of our \ndear friend and colleague, Paul Coverdell.\n  We were all shocked and saddened last July when Paul died so \nunexpectedly. Georgia had lost one of its greatest public servants--a \nsoft-spoken workhorse who served the people first and politics second. \nIn a public career spanning three decades--from the Georgia Senate to \nthe Peace Corps to the U.S. Senate--Paul served with dignity and earned \neverybody's respect along the way.\n  Immediately upon his death, folks in Washington and in Georgia began \nto think how we could remember this great Georgian in a worthy and \nenduring way.\n  Senator Lott, our majority leader and one of Paul's greatest \nadmirers, appointed a four-member committee of Senators to sort through \nthe many ideas for memorializing Senator Coverdell. There were two \nRepublicans--Phil Gramm of Texas and Mike DeWine of Ohio--and two \nDemocrats--Minority Whip Harry Reid of Nevada and myself.\n  We quickly agreed that there should be two memorials for Senator \nCoverdell--one in Washington and one in Georgia.\n  In December, in a letter to party leaders Senator Lott and Minority \nLeader Tom Daschle, we outlined the two memorials we thought were most \nfitting for Senator Coverdell.\n  In Georgia, we have chosen to honor Paul's commitment to education, \nresearch and agriculture at the State's flagship university with The \nPaul D. Coverdell Building for Biomedical and Health Sciences. This \nstate-of-the-art science center will let scientists from different \nfields collaborate on improving the food supply, cleaning up the \nenvironment and finding cures for disease.\n  This will be a joint project with the Federal Government, the State \nof\n\n[[Page S1453]]\n\nGeorgia and the university. We will be asking Congress to allocate $10 \nmillion for the building. Georgia Governor Roy Barnes will ask the \nLegislature for a $10 million appropriation. And the university will \nraise the remaining $20 million for the building.\n  I was so glad that Senator Coverdell's widow, Nancy, joined us in \nannouncing this memorial last month.\n  It is my hope that the scientists who gather in this center under \nSenator Coverdell's name will make great discoveries to improve the \nquality of life in Georgia and around the world.\n  In Washington, we have chosen to honor Senator Coverdell's legacy at \nthe Peace Corps, where he served as director from 1989 to 1991. Paul's \nappointment to the Peace Corps was met with great skepticism at first. \nBut he quickly gained respect by demanding professionalism and by \nshifting the agency's focus so that more money was spent actually \ngetting volunteers where they were needed.\n  When the Berlin Wall came down, Paul seized the opportunity to move \nthe Peace Corps into Eastern Europe to promote freedom and democracy. \nThis move not only broadened the agency's mission, but also increased \nits prestige around the world.\n  Senator Coverdell also established the widely acclaimed World Wise \nSchools Program. Under this program, Peace Corps volunteers who have \nreturned to the United States visit schools to give students their \nimpressions and lessons from their overseas service.\n  To honor Paul's legacy at the Peace Corps, we are recommending that \nthe Peace Corps headquarters offices in Washington be named the ``Paul \nD. Coverdell Peace Corps Headquarters.''\n  We also are recommending the designation of the Peace Corps' World \nWise Schools Programs as the ``Paul D. Coverdell World Wise Schools \nPrograms.''\n  Paul's dignity and decency inspired countless young people to serve \ntheir fellow man in far-away places. It is our hope that we can honor \nhis legacy at the Peace Corps in this lasting way.\n  Mr. President, I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting \nthis memorial for our friend Senator Paul Coverdell, and I yield the \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/15/senate-section/article/S1453-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1453-S1455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  JOHN JOSEPH MOAKLEY U.S. COURTHOUSE\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 559 just received from \nthe House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 559) to designate the United States courthouse \n     located at 1 Courthouse Way in Boston, Massachusetts, as the \n     John Joseph Moakley United States Courthouse.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill be \nread a third time and passed and that the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table with no intervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 559) was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I should note that Senators Kennedy and \nKerry, I believe, will be prepared to speak on this resolution. This is \na resolution designating the U.S. Courthouse in Boston after \nCongressman John Joseph Moakley. He is an outstanding individual. \nSenator Dodd and I both had the privilege of serving on the Rules \nCommittee in the House with him the famous Rules Committee--and have \nknown him for, I guess, 25 years.\n  I am delighted and pleased that this bill will name this courthouse \nafter Congressman Moakley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for taking such \nswift action to pass the legislation for the naming of the Federal \ncourthouse in Boston after my very good friend and beloved figure in \nBoston, MA, Congressman Joe Moakley, to rename the Federal courthouse \nin Boston after him. This measure is a fitting tribute to a wonderful \nfriend, and an outstanding leader, for his long and brilliant career in \npublic service.\n  Earlier this week, Joe Moakley announced his decision not to seek \nreelection next year because of a serious illness that has just been \ndiagnosed. In the brief time since his announcement, the outpouring of \nsupport and affection for Joe has been extraordinary. The reason is \nobvious, Joe Moakley is one of the most beloved political leaders of \nour time. All of us in Massachusetts are especially fond of him. We \nadmire his strength, his wisdom, his leadership, and his dedication to \nthe people of Boston, our State, and our Nation.\n  Joe and his wife Evelyn made a wonderful team together, and we \nadmired and loved them both very much. Vicki and I have such wonderful \nmemories of the dinners we had together with them.\n  In addition to this well-deserved tribute today, I hope in the coming \nmonths we can return some of the loyalty, the affection, spirit, and \nsupport that Joe has given to so many of us throughout the years.\n  Joe Moakley has always been a fighter. He was a boxer in college and \na football star in high school. At the age of 13, he was with his \nfather who was driving through south Boston, when they saw a \nneighborhood bully beating up a local child. Joe's father pulled the \ncar over to the side of the road and asked his son what he was going to \ndo about that situation. Joe jumped out of the car and went to the aid \nof the child and stopped the bully.\n  In all the years we have worked with him in Congress, that is the Joe \nMoakley we know and love--always fighting for the underdog and all of \nthose who need our help the most--fighting to provide better jobs, \nbetter education, better health care, better lives, better \nopportunities for the people of south Boston, and Massachusetts, and \nthe Nation. The whole world knows of his magnificent leadership in \nprotecting democracy in El Salvador.\n  The naming of the Federal courthouse in Boston for Joe is an \nespecially fitting tribute because no one has done more to revitalize \nthe area of south Boston than Joe Moakley. As a child, Joe was a \nbudding entrepreneur. I heard him tell the story about how he and his \nfriends from south Boston used to race down to the railyard, where the \ncourthouse now stands, to meet the trains that delivered farm products \nto the city. They collected the fruit that fell off the trains and then \nwould sell it in the neighborhood. Their favorite fruit was watermelon \nbecause it had the highest resale value.\n  In half a century, and more, since then, Joe never lost his touch or \nhis commitment to economic development in south Boston. As a \nCongressman, he has fought vigorously to revitalize the entire \ncommunity and its neighborhoods for the past 30 years; and what an \noutstanding job he has done. Thanks to Joe Moakley, the watermelons \nhave long since made way for a beautiful new Federal courthouse, a \nconvention center, the World Trade Center, and several new hotels. \nSouth Boston is booming today thanks to Joe Moakley.\n  When he was not working to revitalize south Boston's economy or clean \nup Boston Harbor, Joe Moakley was teaching his pride and joy--his \nfrench poodle named Twiggy--to sing. I understand Joe and Twiggy used \nto sing a famous duet to the tune of ``Everybody Loves Redheads.'' Joe \nsang and Twiggy howled, and everyone loved them both.\n  When I think about all Joe Moakley has done for Boston and \nMassachusetts, I also recall how long and hard and well he fought for \nfunds to rebuild the Central Artery, to build the South Boston Piers \nTransitway, to clean up Boston Harbor, to modernize the Port of Boston, \nand to preserve Massachusetts's many historic sites--the Old State \nHouse, the Old South Meeting House, the U.S.S. Constitution, Dorchester \nHeights, and our famed historic marketplace, Faneuil Hall. Joe Moakley' \nefforts to protect and preserve these extraordinary parts of our \nheritage guarantee they will be part of our State's history for \ngenerations to come.\n  In Congress, no one is more effective on the front lines or behind \nthe scenes than Joe. The dean of our delegation has touched the hearts \nof all our people, and he has made a remarkable difference in their \nlives and hopes.\n  He is a voice for the voiceless, and an inspiration to all of us who \nknow him. He champions the cause of hard-working families and the \nmiddle class. And all of us are proud to stand with him in all these \nbattles.\n\n[[Page S1454]]\n\n  The poet Yeats said it well:\n\n       Think where man's glory most begins and ends, and say my \n     glory was I had such friends.\n\n  We love you, Joe, and we are very proud of you.\n  Mr. KERRY addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. \nKerry.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank you and express my gratitude to \nSenators Lott, Dodd, and Kennedy for their courtesy and their \nassistance in helping to bring us to the point where this important \nresolution has been adopted by this Congress with respect to Joe \nMoakley.\n  I thank my colleague for his comments with respect to Joe that we \njust shared.\n  In these last hours since Joe Moakley announced his retirement from \nCongress, we have had the opportunity in our State--and I think many \npeople down here in Washington--to share in a unique outpouring of \nsupport and emotion, all surrounding our friend and our colleague, the \ndean of the Massachusetts congressional delegation.\n  Today, with this resolution in Congress, we have had the opportunity \nnot only to forever honor Joe, through the John Joseph Moakley United \nStates Courthouse, but to also share our affection and our perceptions \nof this very special public servant, public person, this special \nrepresentative of the people of Boston. We have been able to share that \nwith all of our colleagues in the Congress and, indeed, with our fellow \ncitizens in this country.\n  On Monday, as Senator Kennedy just described, Joe shared with his \nconstituents--with all of our State--that he has been diagnosed with an \nincurable form of leukemia, and that he will retire after he serves his \ncurrent term in the House of Representatives.\n  Joe made this announcement together with friends and supporters at \nthe courthouse that he helped to build in Boston, and he made it with a \nremarkable level of candor, of courage, and with a great, great sense \nof humor.\n\n  When Joe told us of the severity of the illness--and people learned \nof the severity of that illness--and the nature of the battle that \nstill lies ahead for Joe, I think it reminded all of us of all of the \nbattles that he has fought and, indeed, of the degree to which Joe \nMoakley is a fighter, a special kind of fighter for the things he \nbelieves, and which, most of all, is doing what is right for his fellow \ncitizens.\n  In all of the endeavors he has undertaken, all the years he has been \nin Congress, all the important people he has met, and all the important \nthings he has done, this is a man who has never lost his sense of \ndirection, his compass, if you will, which in his case is a special one \nwith a unique sense of direction.\n  Joe has--I think everyone will agree--come out on the winning side of \nalmost every fight he has ever fought.\n  He was born and raised--and living a lifetime--in south Boston, MA. \nJoe is not just from south Boston; he is of south Boston.\n  He wears those roots proudly as a badge of honor, never shy to admit \nthat, in the end, this is a man who still knows how to settle an \nargument.\n  He is a member of a group of citizens we have proudly called our \nGreatest Generation. He earned his stripes as a member of that \ngeneration in a way that was not completely atypical but which I think \nsort of demonstrates the special nature of his patriotism and his sense \nof duty.\n  When he was 15 years old, Joe rose to the call of service to his \ncountry by falsifying his birth certificate so he could enlist in the \nU.S. Navy. He fought for his country, with honor, in World War II.\n  When he returned home from the South Pacific, he received his \neducation at the University of Miami in Florida, but believe me, south \nBoston was never far from his heart or his consciousness. He returned \nhome and went to law school at night at Suffolk University. Then he \nwent to work for the people of Massachusetts.\n  He began his career in public life in the Massachusetts State \nLegislature at the age of 25, and then, before his election to the \nHouse of Representatives in 1972, he served in the State senate and on \nthe Boston City Council. In both his approach and his effectiveness, \nJoe followed the path that was laid down by his great mentor in the \nCongress, former Speaker Tip O'Neill, a man who knew himself, who knew \nwhat he believed, and who knew there were things worth fighting for \nevery single day.\n  That is what Joe has done the entire time he has served in Congress. \nAs chairman of the Rules Committee, he did more than steward the course \nof important legislation and the operation of the House. He fought for \nan agenda, and he secured its passage into law. He built a reputation \nas a tough and effective legislator with a real ability to work across \nparty lines and achieve consensus on so many issues. He put many of his \nopponents in the unenviable position of having to explain themselves to \nthe gentleman from south Boston, a fight that people soon learned they \nwere smarter to avoid.\n  Joe made it clear there were no borders, no limits that would apply \nto the fights he would embrace, and he insisted--and I think this is \none of the most interesting things about Joe Moakley--that foreign \npolicy was not something foreign, even to the work of a bread-and-\nbutter Democrat from south Boston, but an extension of the ideals he \nbrought to work for his own constituents.\n  In 1983, Joe was among the first in the Congress to understand the \nsimmering injustice in El Salvador. When he gathered with a small group \nof refugees from the brutal fighting in that country and listened to \ntheir stories, he was moved again to service. Those refugees told Joe \nthey were in danger of being deported to El Salvador. That lit a fire \nunder Joe Moakley. He understood that being deported back to that \ncountry for those people, given their history, would mean death.\n  A Congressman from south Boston wasted no time in helping people from \nthe southern part of our hemisphere. He sent his top aide, Jim \nMcGovern, to find answers. And, as always, Joe, himself, personally \nfollowed through, traveling again and again to El Salvador, heading up \nthe Moakley commission and working to make it possible not just for \nthose refugees to stay in the United States but also to address the \nbroader questions of human rights abuses in Central America.\n  For more than a decade, Joe kept at it. For 10 long years plus, when \na lot of people turned their attention elsewhere, Joe Moakley continued \nto understand the difference between right and wrong. He fought against \nhundreds upon hundreds of deportations and, finally, he won an \namendment barring them altogether in 1989.\n  Later that year, when six Jesuit priests were murdered in El \nSalvador, he led an investigation that pointed to elements of the U.S.-\nbacked military as the murderers. It was quite fascinating, when we \nlistened to Joe at the courthouse in Boston announcing the end of his \ncareer within the U.S. Congress--it was fascinating that even as he \ndescribed himself as a bread-and- butter Democrat and a person who \ncared always about the issues of all of his constituents in his home \ncity as well as in the rest of his constituency, measured against all \nthe things he had done, he thought he was proudest of what he had done \nin El Salvador. He thought it so because it was a reflection of the \nkinds of things he learned from his constituents and from his home, and \nit reflected the depth of who he was as a citizen of south Boston.\n\n  Joe has been delivering for south Boston and the Nation for almost \nhalf a century, and he has done it the only way he knows--with hard \nwork, with a smile, and with a special brand of humor. Whether it has \nbeen finding money for the ``Big Dig,'' project after project, or for a \nwhole host of other projects in Boston, he has been a national leader \non issues from Central America to our relationship with Cuba.\n  Joe will tell you his secret, whether it is in a senior center in \nsouth Boston or when meeting with the heads of state around the world. \nIt is his ability to listen and to remember who he is and from where he \ncomes. And when he completes his 15th term in the House and retires, we \nwill miss his service, his friendship, and his passion, but we will \nalso know that until his last day in office, Joe Moakley will continue \nto be a giant, caring first and foremost for the people he represents, \nliving by Tip O'Neill's old adage--all politics is local--and with a \nspecial Moakley corollary that certain values and commitments are \nglobal as well.\n\n[[Page S1455]]\n\n  He has used his remarkable clout to do what is right for \nMassachusetts and the Nation. And knowing Joe, having watched him and \nlearned from him, as so many of us have, I know that in these next 2 \nyears this courthouse will not be the only way he will be honored. The \nfights he will continue to wage for all that he believes, for working \npeople, for jobs, for social and economic justice, will be the ultimate \ntestimony to the full measure of the man whom we pause to honor today, \nand it will be the real measurement of those values by which Joe \nMoakley has served.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/15/senate-section/article/S1455-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       COMMEMORATING THE 5TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE 1996 TELECOM ACT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, recently we celebrated the fifth anniversary \nof the passage of the 1996 Telecom Act. This legislation--a \ncomprehensive overhaul of our nation's laws governing communications--\nwas the product of approximately ten years of hard work by many people. \nThe intent of Congress in passing the Act was to spur competition, \npromote innovation, and provide new services at lower prices to \nconsumers.\n  I hoped at the time that we passed the Act that it would have a \ntremendous impact on the economy, and my hopes were realized. Hundreds \nof thousands of new jobs were created in the communications sector in \nthe first four years after passage of the Act, and this sector has been \na major contributor to the nation's real economic growth since the \nAct's passage.\n  The blueprint of the 1996 Act provided industry and the markets the \nnecessary certainty to foster and encourage investment in the \ntelecommunications sector. This investment has occurred despite \nsignificant delays in the Act's implementation on the part of the FCC, \nand more disturbingly, delays related to the litigation of the Act in \nthe courts. I am encouraged by the birth and growth of the competitive \nlocal telecommunications industry. Furthermore, I am pleased that two \nof the regional Bell companies satisfied the checklist required by \nsection 271 of the Act in several states, thus indicating that these \nstates are fully open to local competition. By opening these particular \nmarkets fully to local competition, these Bell companies are now able \nto offer long distance service in these states.\n  While I am pleased with these positive developments since the passage \nof the '96 Act, I believe it is time to review the '96 Act to determine \nwhether it needs to be modified to fully achieve its purpose. While \ncompetition in many sectors of the telecommunications industry has \nundoubtedly increased, I believe that the Congress should consider how \nto create additional incentives for increased competition in those \nsectors of the telecommunications industry which remain dominated by a \nsmall number of competitors.\n  While we have seen the new competitive companies emerging in the \nmarketplace with a particular focus on business clients, perhaps there \nare measures which would make it more attractive to these new companies \nto aggressively pursue the market for local service to consumers' \nhomes. Although a few states are now fully open to local competition \npursuant to the '96 Act's conditions, we need to do more to make it \nattractive for additional markets to be opened, especially rural \nmarkets. Additional inducements may be necessary to speed the process \nof opening more and more states for local competition, as it appears \nthe promise of allowing the incumbent local carriers to enter the long \ndistance service market may not be a sufficient motivating factor in \nmany states.\n  I am also concerned, however, that there are significant deficiencies \nin the enforcement of the '96 Act. While there were encouraging \ndevelopments in the telecommunications industry resulting from the \npassage of the Act, I have serious concerns about the health of the new \ncompetitive local telecommunications industry and a perception that \ntrue competition for incumbent local carriers has not been achieved due \nto such enforcement failures. For this reason, I believe that the 107th \nCongress should look closely at these enforcement issues, with a view \ntowards possible tweaks that may be necessary to ensure full \nimplementation of the Act as it was originally envisioned.\n  I was a strong supporter and key sponsor of the '96 Telecom Act, and \nI believe that its principles remain relevant and solid. However, a bit \nof fine-tuning may be in order as we learn from our experiences under \nthe first five years of the Act and look forward to a \ntelecommunications sector which thrives under additional competition, \ninnovation, and consumer choice in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/15/senate-section/article/S1455-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1455-S1456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FLUNKING AMERICAN HISTORY\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, every February our Nation celebrates the \nbirth of two of our most revered presidents--George Washington, the \nfather of our Nation, who victoriously led his ill-fitted assembly of \nmilitiamen against the armies of King George, and Abraham Lincoln, the \neternal martyr of freedom, whose powerful voice and iron will \nshepherded a divided Nation toward a more perfect Union. Sadly, I fear \nthat many of our Nation's school children may never fully appreciate \nthe lives and accomplishments of these two American giants of history. \nThey have been robbed of that appreciation--robbed by a school system \nthat no longer stresses a knowledge of American history. In fact, study \nafter study has shown that many of the true meanings of our Nation's \ngrand celebrations of patriotism--such as Memorial Day or the Fourth of \nJuly--are lost on the majority of young Americans. What a waste. What a \nshame.\n  In 1994, the National Assessment of Educational Progress assessed \nfourth, eighth, and twelfth-grade students' knowledge of U.S. history. \nThe results of this study are deeply disturbing. The study divided \nstudents into three groups--advanced, proficient, and basic--based on \ntheir ability to recall, understand, analyze, and interpret U.S. \nhistory. Only 17 percent of fourth graders, 14 percent of eighth \ngraders, and 11 percent of twelfth graders were judged to be \n``proficient''. Over one-third of fourth and eighth graders failed to \nreach the ``basic'' level and more than half of the twelfth graders \nsurveyed could not even achieve the ``basic'' category in the history \nof their own Nation.\n  The questions were not overly difficult, especially not for a twelfth \ngrader. One question asked students to name the document that contains \nthe basic rules used to run the Government of the United States of \nAmerica. Only 27 percent selected the U.S. Constitution as the correct \nanswer. Imagine that--27 percent! How can we ever survive as a country, \nif more than \\2/3\\ of our high school seniors are so ignorant about our \nbasic charter? This deplorable record indicates that too many American \nchildren lack even the most rudimentary grounding in U.S. history.\n  Even more disturbing were the results of a study released last year \nby the American Council of Trustees and Alumni that tested the \nknowledge of college seniors who were on the verge of graduation. The \norganization gave students from fifty-five of our Nation's finest \ncolleges and universities a typical high school-level American history \nexam. Nearly 80 percent--80 percent!--of these college seniors--the \nfuture leaders of our Nation--earned no better than a ``D.'' A mere 23 \npercent could identify James Madison as the principal Framer of the \nConstitution; more than a third did not know that the Constitution \nestablished the separation of powers in American government; a scant 35 \npercent could correctly identify Harry S. Truman as the President in \noffice at the start of the Korean Conflict; and just 60 percent could \ncorrectly select the fifty-year period in which the Civil War \noccurred--not the correct years, or even the correct decade, but the \ncorrect half-century.\n  These results are shameful and appalling. Not only are our grade-\nschool students ignorant about their own history, so are our college \nstudents. Our children are being allowed to complete their formal \neducations without any semblance of historical context. To put it \nsimply, young Americans do not know why they are free or what \nsacrifices it took to make us so.\n  An American student, regardless of race, religion, or gender, must \nknow\n\n[[Page S1456]]\n\nthe history of the land to which they pledge allegiance. They should be \ntaught about the Founding Fathers of this Nation, the battles that they \nfought, the ideals that they championed, and the enduring effects of \ntheir accomplishments. They should be taught about our Nation's \nfailures, our mistakes, and the inequities of our past. Without this \nknowledge, they cannot appreciate the hard won freedoms that are our \nbirthright.\n  Our failure to insist that the words and actions of our forefathers \nbe handed down from generation to generation will ultimately mean a \nfailure to perpetuate this wonderful experiment in representative \ndemocracy. Without the lessons learned from the past, how can we ensure \nthat our Nation's core ideals--life, liberty, equality, and freedom--\nwill survive? As Marcus Tullius Cicero stated, ``to be ignorant of what \noccurred before you were born is to remain always a child. For what is \nthe worth of human life, unless it is woven into the life of our \nancestors by the records of history?''\n  Last session, fearing that our children were being denied any sense \nof their own history, I added an amendment to an appropriations act \nthat I believe will be a starting point for a partial solution to this \negregious failure of the American educational system. This amendment \nappropriated $50 million to be distributed as competitive grants to \nschools across the Nation that teach American history as a separate \nsubject within school curricula--no lumping of history into social \nstudies. Schools that have previously sought to teach American history \nshould be commended, and schools that wish to add this critical area of \nlearning to their curriculae should be helped to do so. It is my hope \nthat this money will serve as seed corn, and that future funding will \nbe dedicated to the improvement and expansion of courses dedicated to \nteaching American history on its own, unencumbered by the lump sum \napproaches of ``social studies'' or ``civics.''\n  The history of our Nation is too important to be swept under the bed, \nlocked in the closet or distorted beyond all recognition. The corridors \nof time are lined with the mistakes of societies that lost their way, \ncultures that forgot their purpose, and Nations that took no heed of \nthe lessons of their past. I hope that this Nation, having studied the \nfailures of those before it, would not endeavor to test fate's nerve.\n  Thucydides, the Greek historian, understood that the future can \nsometimes best be seen through the prism of the past. The following is \nan excerpt from the funeral oration of Pericles as reported by \nThucydides in his ``History of the Peloponnesian War.''\n\n       Fix your eyes on the greatness of Athens as you have it \n     before you day by day, fall in love with her, and when you \n     feel her great, remember that this greatness was won by men \n     with courage, with knowledge of their duty, and with a sense \n     of honor in action . . . So they gave their bodies to the \n     commonwealth and received, each for his own memory, praise \n     that will never die, and with it the grandest of all \n     sepulchers, not that in which their mortal bones are laid, \n     but a home in the minds of men, where their glory remains \n     fresh to stir to speech or action as the occasion comes by. \n     For the whole earth is the sepulcher of famous men; and their \n     story is not graven only on stone over their native earth, \n     but lives on far away, without visible symbol, woven into the \n     stuff of other men's lives. For you now it remains to rival \n     what they have done and, knowing the secret of happiness to \n     be freedom and the secret of freedom a brave heart, not idly \n     to stand aside from the enemy's onset.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/15/senate-section/article/S1456-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1456]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        STELLERS SEA LION CRISIS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, the Steller sea lion crisis continues to \nbe a serious issue for Alaska fishermen and the families and \ncommunities that depend on them. A recent guest columnist piece in the \nSeattle Post Intelligencer contains a good description of the flawed \nregulatory process that led us to this point. I ask unanimous consent \nthat this piece be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Feb. 8, 2001]\n\n           Let's Do Right by STELLERS Sea Lion and Fishermen\n\n                            (By Glenn Reed)\n\n       In mid-December Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, was able to \n     pass legislation that places requirements on the federal \n     government's latest Biological Opinion dealing with \n     interaction between fishing activity and the Stellers sea \n     lion. Two of these requirements are that the government's \n     opinion will undergo the legally required public review \n     process as well as an independent scientific review. The \n     legislation also requires the placement of protection measure \n     for the Stellers sea lions, which the National Marine \n     Fisheries Service has said will eliminate any negative \n     impacts that might be caused to the sea lions by fishing \n     activity.\n       This legislation also avoids a virtual shutdown of the \n     fisheries and the resulting negative impact to the \n     Washington-based fleet and Alaskan communities.\n       The senator's action also provides $30 million in new \n     research money to the NMFS so that it can conduct the \n     research necessary to determine if Alaska's fisheries are \n     having an impact on Stellers--something that government \n     scientists theorize, but that they have failed to even test \n     after the industry has suffered through 10 years of \n     increasingly severe harvest restrictions.\n       How did we get to this point? In 1990 the western \n     population of Stellers sea lions was listed as a threatened \n     species. In 1997 the western population of Stellers were \n     listed as endangered. The cause of the Stellers' decline has \n     never been determined. In the case of Stellers, the only \n     regulatory steps available to the National Marine Fisheries \n     Service were to progressively move commercial fisheries \n     further and further out of their traditional areas. In the \n     past decade the amount of fishing in the areas adjacent to \n     sea lion rookeries and haulouts has been reduced to a \n     fraction of historic levels (from 60 percent of the harvest \n     in 1997 to under 15 percent in 2000). Fishing seasons have \n     also been drastically altered in an attempt to help Stellers.\n       With all the costly restrictions that have been placed on \n     fishing it would be logical to ask, ``What benefits have sea \n     lions realized over the past decade as a result of the \n     redesigned fishery?''\n       Unfortunately, NMFS has conducted no studies to determine \n     if any of the restrictions have had a positive effect, a \n     negative effect or no effect. And it is worth noting that \n     there is a body of opinion in the scientific community that \n     argues that the government's actions over the past 10 years \n     have been just as likely to cause more harm to Stellers than \n     to have helped.\n       The basis for the government's placement of restrictions on \n     fishing is a theory known as ``localized depletion.'' The \n     theory surmises that fishing activity is competing with sea \n     lions for prey and is making it more difficult for Stellers \n     to catch the fish they need. The theory has been rejected by \n     the scientific advisers to the North Pacific Fisheries \n     Management Council. Scientific arguments that run counter to \n     the government's theory have been peer-reviewed and \n     published, but largely ignored.\n       So why has the estimated sea lion population decreased so \n     dramatically? Some things that leading marine mammal \n     scientists outside the government consider most likely are \n     listed below.\n       First, the stocks of those fish species which have \n     historically provided Stellers with their greatest dietary \n     benefit are far lower now than in the 1950s and 1960s when \n     Stellers populations were very high. It could be that \n     Stellers populations have declined because the ecosystem \n     cannot support as large a population as it once did.\n       Also, the greatest population decline of sea lions occurred \n     between the mid-1970s and the late '80s. During much of this \n     time the taking (killing) of sea lions was commonplace and \n     was at times encouraged by the government. Killer whales also \n     prey on sea lions, and mariners have noted that killer-whale \n     populations have increased sharply. Estimates of the impact \n     of these activities in the period of the decline are able to \n     account for a large portion of the overall decline.\n       NMFS admits in its Nov. 30 Biological Opinion that Alaska's \n     fisheries aren't posing imminent harm to Stellers. There is \n     time to study the effects of the actions that have been taken \n     since 1990 to determine if they are helping sea lions or \n     harming them. NMFS also admits that there is no threat of \n     extinction for the next 100 years, and the agency is \n     receiving more than $30 million this year alone to work on \n     better understanding the situation. It would be particularly \n     encouraging if the conservation community would participate \n     in the support of scientific research designed to better \n     understand and help the Stellers sea lion.\n       The legislation passed in December will provide an \n     opportunity for public and scientific review to ensure the \n     right decisions are made. NMFS does not need to take the \n     ``ready-shoot-aim'' approach. We have time to find the right \n     answers.\n       How will history judge us if in an attempt to save the \n     Stellers sea lion we take actions that are ultimately \n     responsible for causing them further harm?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/15/senate-section/article/S1456-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1456-S1457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ONE YEAR LATER\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, over the course of the next few weeks, the \npeople of my home state of Michigan will memorialize the death of a \nlittle girl named Kayla Rolland.\n\n[[Page S1457]]\n\n  Kayla Rolland was killed by a classmate in their own first-grade \nclassroom at Buell Elementary School near Flint, Michigan almost one \nyear ago. This well publicized school shooting sparked outrage across \nour state and nation and helped lead hundreds of thousands of mothers \nto march in Washington for safer gun laws.\n  Over the course of the year, we have learned more details about the \nshooting of the young girl. Police reports released just a few months \nago reveal that the six-year-old boy who shot and killed Kayla had \nconcealed the handgun in his pants pocket. He pulled the gun out of his \npocket and pointed it at Kayla, who told the boy, ``Jesus doesn't like \nyou to point guns at someone.'' The young boy responded, ``So? I don't \nlike you'' and fired the gun that killed the young girl. Just before \nshe collapsed, she turned to her classmate and said, ``I'm going to \ndie.''\n  For Kayla's mother and family, the pain from those few moments will \nlast forever. At the Million Mom March, Kayla's mother spoke just a few \ndays after what would have been Kayla's seventh birthday. She said:\n\n       These are hard times for me and Kayla's brothers, sisters, \n     and her father, and for the rest of my family. Kayla's death \n     was devastating. There is not a day that goes by that I do \n     not cry as I go on with my life without my daughter. A part \n     of my heart went with her. It is so hard for me to think that \n     I will never see her smile, laugh or play again. I can never \n     hold her and kiss her again. Or see her grow up, get married, \n     and have a happy life. The gun that killed my daughter in her \n     first grade classroom was a gun that could be loaded by a 6-\n     year-old child, concealed by a 6-year-old child, and held and \n     fired by a 6-year-old child. Please, don't ever forget that. \n     This is proof that there is need for gun safety devices and \n     gun control. I come here today, two days after what would \n     have been her seventh birthday. I am a Mom with a terrible \n     tragedy, and I hope it never, ever happens again.\n\n  One year after the death of Kayla Rolland, after hundreds of \nthousands of families marched in Washington at the Million Mom March, \nand after countless other shooting tragedies, Congress cannot guarantee \nthat it never happens again because one year later Congress has not \nworked seriously to reduce youth access to guns or to pass legislation \nthat will make our nation's children safer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/15/senate-section/article/S1457-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONFIRMATION OF JOE ALLBAUGH\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, Mr. Joe Allbaugh is fully qualified to \nserve as the next FEMA Director, and I will vote to confirm his \nnomination.\n  Most recently, Mr. Allbaugh served as the national campaign manager \nfor President Bush. Prior to that Mr. Allbaugh was then-Governor Bush's \nchief of staff. In that capacity, he was responsible for management of \ncrises and emergency response.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Comprehensive \nTest Ban Treaty and how it fits into an integrated national non-\nproliferation policy. We all agree that proliferation of nuclear \nweapons is a bad thing. Slowing or halting new countries from acquiring \nnuclear weapons, or keeping current nuclear states from developing new, \nmore powerful weapons is not a Democrat or Republican--it is a \nnecessity. It also is not a new idea.\n  Since the end of World War II, every president has worked on ways to \nreduce other countries' access to nuclear weapons and their reasons for \ntrying to acquire them. By mutual security alliances and numerous \ninternational agreements, we have succeeded in slowing the development \nof nuclear weapons. But, the game has changed. A number of smaller \nstates may see nuclear weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction, \nas the only way to counter the unparalleled superiority of American \nconventional military power. Therefore, the United States has more \nreason than ever to lead global efforts to stop proliferation.\n  A national non-proliferation program needs to include diplomatic, \neconomic, scientific and military tools, all honed and accessible for \nparticular proliferation problems. One such tool should be the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty, CTBT. It is time for a responsible, calm \nreconsideration of the CTBT. Former Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman \nGeneral Shalikashvili's recent report addresses many of the questions \nand concerns raised in objection to the CTBT. I urge any of my \ncolleagues who have not had a chance to read his report to do so. \nGeneral Shalikashvili states that the CTBT ``. . . is a very important \npart of global non-proliferation efforts and is compatible with keeping \na safe, reliable U.S. nuclear deterrent . . . an objective and thorough \nnet assessment shows convincingly that U.S. interests, as well as those \nof friends and allies, will be served by the Treaty's entry into \nforce.''\n  The CTBT does not mean an end to the threat of nuclear war or nuclear \nterrorism or nuclear proliferation. It is, however, a step in the right \ndirection of containing these threats. Of course there are risks, but \nthey exist with or without the CTBT. These risks can be better managed \nwith the treaty than without it. An integrated and comprehensive non-\nproliferation strategy is required, of which the CTBT is a crucial \npart. In his report, General Shalikashvili outlines recommendations to \nmake such a strategy.\n  Is the CTBT verifiable? With or without the CTBT, we will always need \nreliable information about nuclear testing activity. The CTBT gives us \nnew sources of information and creates greater political clout for \nuncovering and addressing suspected violations. There is more to the \nverification regime than the International Monitoring System, which by \nitself will be an impressive network of 321 stations and 16 \nlaboratories. There are also stations and satellites owned and operated \nby governments, research institutions, universities, and commercial \ncompanies.\n  A report by the Independent Commission on the Verifiability of the \nCTBT concludes that when all the resources are put into place, they \nwill be able to detect, locate and identify all relevant events. \nMonitoring and verification will involve a complex and constantly \nevolving network, which any potential violator will have to confront. A \ntreaty evader would need to muffle the seismic signal, ensure that no \nsignature particles or gas escape the cavity, as well as avoid the \ncreation of surface evidence, such as a crater. And, all test \npreparations, such a making a cavity or buying materials, would have to \nbe done without causing suspicion. Only the United States and the \nformer Soviet Union have ever been able to carry off such a test. How \nlikely could an emerging nuclear weapon state do so? Some have argued \nthat advancing technology would make hiding such a test easier, but \nthat assumes all monitoring and detection technology will stand still. \nNew technologies and the expansion of a global monitoring regime will \nmake it more difficult to conceal such tests.\n  What about the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapon \nstockpile? General Shalikashvili, former Secretary of Defense Cohen, \nformer Secretary of Energy Richardson, the Commander in Chief of U.S. \nStrategic Command, the directors of the three nuclear weapon \nlaboratories, and numerous experts agree that the nation's nuclear \nstockpile is safe and reliable and that nuclear testing is not needed \nat this time.\n\n[[Page S1458]]\n\n In the Armed Services Committee Department of Energy oversight hearing \nlast week, Secretary of Energy Abraham stated ``. . . that the results \nof the most recent process, which was just completed in January, enjoys \nthe full confidence of the lab directors and the certification that \njust took place by my predecessor and the immediate past Secretary of \nDefense, another one of our former colleagues, is one that I have high \nconfidence in.'' The United States has no alternative to the Stockpile \nStewardship Program unless we want to return to the level of nuclear \ntesting prior to the testing moratorium. The annual certification \nprocess provides a clear, candid and careful assessment of each nuclear \nweapon type in the stockpile.\n  I am especially concerned about recent news reports that President \nBush wants to cut back funds for the Stockpile Stewardship Program. \nDuring the presidential campaign, President Bush stated that, while he \nwas in favor of the nuclear weapon testing moratorium, he was opposed \nto CTBT ratification because it ``is not enforceable'' and it would \n``stop us from ensuring the safety and reliability of our nation's \ndeterrent, should the need arise.'' For the Stockpile Stewardship \nProgram to work, it must have both sufficient funds and a strong \ncommitment from the Congress and Administration.\n  I do not believe that the American public wants to see resumed \nnuclear weapon testing, nor do they want any other country to do so. We \nall agree that the spread of weapons of mass destruction is one of the \ngreatest national security threats we face. The CTBT establishes an \ninternational norm against nuclear testing while preserving the \nundisputed U.S. advantage in nuclear weapon technology. It reduces the \nlikelihood that significant new threats will arise from proliferating \nnations while enhancing the already formidable U.S. monitoring \ncapability. Finally, it strengthens our ability to persuade other \nnations to respect the obligations of the nuclear Non-Proliferation \nRegime.\n  We need to examine all the risks in a careful and deliberate manner, \njust as General Shalikashvili has done. Two days before the Senate's \nOctober 1999 vote against ratification of the CTBT, 62 of our \ncolleagues sent a bipartisan letter to their respective leaders \nrequesting that consideration of the Treaty be postponed until the next \nCongress. It is now sixteen months later. Let us work together to \ndiscuss how, not if, the U.S. should lead global efforts to deal with \nnuclear proliferation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/15/senate-section/article/S1458-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1458]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         MINNESOTA FATALITIES IN THE OAHU ARMY HELICOPTER CRASH\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I had planned to deliver this morning my \nfirst formal Senate remarks about the urgent need to provide \nprescription drug coverage for America's senior citizens. It is a \ncrisis affecting many Minnesota seniors, and I will return to the floor \nvery soon to address its urgency.\n  However, I have decided to defer my first address, to show my deep \nrespect for the courageous soldiers killed in the recent crash of two \nArmy Black Hawk helicopters. Two of the victims were native \nMinnesotans: Sergeant Thomas E. Barber and Major Robert L. Olson.\n  I offer my deepest condolences to the families and friends of Major \nOlson, Sergeant Barber, and the four other soldiers who gave their \nlives in the service of our country. We join with you in mourning their \ndeaths, and we pay tribute to them for their ultimate sacrifice on \nbehalf of our national defense. My prayers also extend to the eleven \n(11) other soldiers, who were injured in the accident. May they be \ngraced with swift and complete recoveries.\n  As President Abraham Lincoln stated in his famous address at \nGettysburg, ``The world will little note nor long remember what we say \nhere, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the \nliving rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they \nwho fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to \nbe here dedicated to the great task remaining before us--that from \nthese honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which \nthey gave the last full measure of devotion--that we here highly \nresolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, that this nation \nunder God shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the \npeople, by the people, for the people shall not perish from the \nearth.''\n  This tragedy should remind us that, even during times of peace, our \nfreedom and our security are neither free nor secure. They must \ncontinually be earned and protected, in order to be assured. For these \nalways awesome, often invisible, and usually thankless \nresponsibilities, we rely upon our Armed Forces, and especially upon \nthe men and women in uniform.\n  They risk their lives, so that we can enjoy our lives. And sometimes, \nthey are called upon even to give up their lives, in order to safeguard \nour lives. They make the ultimate sacrifice; they pay the ultimate \nprice; they commit the ultimate acts of heroism, so that we might be \nsafe, secure, and free.\n  All of us Americans owe these two Minnesotans, Major Robert L. Olson \nand Sergeant Thomas E. Barber, and their fellow soldiers a debt which \nwe can never repay. We owe their families and friends our lifelong \ngratitude, support, and assistance for the burdens they must now bear \non all our behalf. And we can only stand in awe and admiration as we \nwitness such courage, such heroism, and such devotion as the men and \nwomen who serve their great country with their abilities and who \nprotect it with their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/15/senate-section/article/S1458-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1458-S1459]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LITHUANIA'S NATIONAL DAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Friday, February 16th is Lithuania's \nNational Day marking the day in 1918 when the Lithuanian National \nAssembly declared independence after World War I.\n  But Lithuania was not ``new'' in 1918; it simply took its place among \nmodern, democratic nation-states after an ancient history of a distinct \nculture and people. The Baltic peoples settled in the Baltic region \nduring the second millennium BC, and the Medieval Lithuanian empire \nstretched for a time from the Baltic to Balkans and lasted hundreds of \nyears.\n  But February 16th carried a special meaning for Lithuanians during \nthe dark days of Soviet occupation. Lithuanians carried their hopes and \ndreams for freedom, democracy, and independence in their hearts and \nmarked that special day silently or risked persecution by the KGB. Woe \nto those who showed the Lithuanian flag or celebrated on February 16th. \nThey risked being hauled off to jail or into exile.\n  On March 1, 1990, Lithuania re-asserted its independence from the \ndomination of the Soviet Union. Lithuania led the way for other Soviet \nRepublics to throw off the yoke of Soviet Communist imperialism, \nresulting in the disintegration of the Soviet Union.\n  This declaration was not without cost. In January 1991, Soviet \nparatroopers stormed the Press House in Vilnius, injuring four people. \nBarricades were set up in front of the Lithuanian Parliament, the \nSeimas. On January 13, 1991, Soviet forces attacked the television \nstation and tower in Vilnius, killing 14 Lithuanians. One woman was \nkilled when she tried to block a Soviet armored personnel carrier. Five \nhundred people were injured during these attacks. Just last month, \nLithuanians commemorated the tenth anniversary of those tragic events.\n  But these courageous Lithuanians did not suffer and die in vain. \nLithuania has now become a vibrant democracy. It has established a \nfree-market economy and the rule of law. Lithuania wants to be fully \nintegrated into Europe, and is seeking membership in the European Union \nand the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.\n  The United States always refused to recognize the Soviet domination \nof the Baltic states. The U.S. position was that it would only \nrecognize a free and independent Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia. What \nwe celebrate this year is what we must help preserve next year and the \nyear after that. We must carry on that principle today by being sure \nthat Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia are admitted into NATO as an \nunequivocal statement that we will never again tolerate domination of \nthe Baltic states.\n  I support admitting the Baltic states into NATO and I hope my \ncolleagues here in the Senate will support their entry also in the next \nround of NATO expansion.\n  That debate we will save for another day, but I am sure all my \ncolleagues\n\n[[Page S1459]]\n\ncan agree on the importance of Lithuania's contribution to freedom and \nindependence for the former Soviet Republics and will join me in \ncongratulating Lithuania on its National Day.\n  I am honored that my mother was born in the tiny Lithuanian village \nof Jurbarkas many years ago; that she came to this country proud of her \nheritage, but determined to be an American citizen.

Mr. President, This month in Minnesota and across the \ncountry we celebrate ``Black History Month''--a time when our nation \nrightfully recognizes the many and varied achievements of African \nAmericans and the positive contributions they have made to American \nsociety and to our way of life.\n  In 1926, Carter Woodson--considered by many to be the ``Father of \nBlack History''--created Negro History Week, which became Black History \nWeek in the early 1970s. In 1976, February was chosen to be Black \nHistory Month, because it included the birthdays of Frederick Douglass \nand Abraham Lincoln, both of whom made heroic contributions to the \nlives of African Americans in this country.\n  Today, Americans of all races recognize Black History Month as an \nimportant way to celebrate the achievements of African-Americans in \nMinnesota and the United States.\n  However, today, and throughout our history as we honor this \ncommemoration, we must also remember that we have a long way to go to \nensure full and equal rights, opportunities, and benefits for all \nAmericans.\n  We must be bolder in our efforts to ensure that all Americans--of \nevery race--have the opportunity to share in--and contribute to--our \neconomic prosperity. That means a quality education, adequate housing \nand health care for all Americans. And it means that our tax and budget \npolicies must spread their benefits across all social and economic \nlines.\n  We must renew our commitments to ensure that all American--of every \nrace--can fully share in--and contribute to--our economic prosperity. \nThat means quality education, housing, and health care for all \nAmericans. It means a good job with living wages, so that everyone can \nearn the American dream. And it means our tax and budget policies must \nspread their benefits across all social and economic lines.\n  We must increase our efforts to ensure that our justice system is \ncolor blind when it comes to enacting and enforcing our laws. Racial \nprofiling, hate crimes, prejudice, and discrimination must be \neliminated now and forever.\n  Ever since a Minneapolis Mayor named Hubert Humphrey challenged the \nconsensus of the Democratic Party on civil rights in 1948, the women \nand men who have lead and shaped my party have made tremendous \ncontributions to achieving these national goals. But this work is yet \nunfinished, and it is now, during Black History Month, that all members \nof this new Congress and our new President must rededicate ourselves to \nthese causes.\n  I voted against confirmation of our new Attorney General, John \nAshcroft, because I did not think he was adequately committed to \nupholding our nation's long and hard-fought tradition--forged by \nDemocrats and Republicans alike--on civil rights. Now that he has been \nconfirmed, however, I hope he will demonstrate through his actions that \nhe truly is interested in justice for all Americans, regardless of \nrace.\n  I intend to hold him to the promises he made during his confirmation \nprocess that he will not repeat his past actions that demonstrated a \nracial insensitivity which not only divided many communities, but also \nthe work of this Senate.\n  The Bush Administration's recent announcement that it will appoint an \nAfrican American as Attorney General Ashcroft's top deputy is a good \nstart to healing some of these rifts, but we must see action.\n  Minnesota takes great pride in the African Americans who have made \nour state and our country a better place to live, work, and recreate. \nTheir contributions to the arts, business, politics and culture are \nnumerous.\n  Starting back in the Civil War, Black Minnesotans were involved in \nimportant undertakings that contributed to the good of the nation. In \n1860, although there were only 259 residents of African descent in the \nstate, 104 Black men served in the Union army. Despite being paid less \nand suffering from racial prejudice, they fought courageously along \nwith their white brethren.\n  Minnesotans also played important roles in more recent civil rights \nadvances. The U.S. Postal Service recently honored St. Paul native Roy \nWilkins as the 24th American honored in the Black Heritage \nCommemorative Stamp Series. As a leader of the NAACP when this country \nmade significant civil rights advances, his legacy is felt today across \nthis country.\n  Alan Page was first known to most of us as an all-pro Hall of Fame \nlineman for the Minnesota Vikings. However, Alan has often said he \ntakes more pride in his subsequent career as a Special Assistant \nAttorney General and an Associate Justice on the Minnesota Supreme \nCourt.\n  Nellie Stone Johnson has had a long and distinguished record of \npublic service in support of the advancement of minority concerns, the \nrights of workers, and equal opportunities for all people. Her life is \nchronicled with a series of ``firsts.'' As a leader of organized labor \nin the 1930s and 1940s, she was the first woman vice president of the \nMinnesota Culinary Council and the first woman vice president of Local \n665 of the Hotel and Restaurant Employees Union. She was also the first \nAfrican American elected to citywide office in Minneapolis when she won \na seat on the Library Board in 1945.\n  Sharon Sayles-Belton, another of Minnesota's greatest mayors, has for \nalmost eight years led initiatives to make our state's largest city a \nbetter place to live, work, do business and educate our children.\n  And Billy McGee, a Public Defender who passed away last year, was a \ntireless champion of civil and human rights in the Twin Cities \ncommunity. Everyone knew that they could call Billy at all hours and be \nassured of his help.\n  Minnesota native Dave Winfield and World Series hero Kirby Puckett \nwere both voted into the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame last year. \nNot only are they great athletes, they are greatly respected and \nenormously contributing civic leaders.\n  And William Finney is the distinguished Chief of Police of our \ncapitol city, St. Paul. He has successfully integrated that police \nforce, combatted crime afflicting citizens of all races and \nnationalities, and helped lead the way for racial and social advances \nin his city.\n  Those are just a few of the Minnesotans who have and continue to set \nexamples for the rest of us. There are many more women and men who are \ngiving their very best to improve our state. As we celebrate Black \nHistory Month, we can all do well to look to their examples of activism \nand excellence. And we can strive to follow their leadership in making \nthis country all that it should be for all our citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/15/senate-section/article/S1459-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1459-S1460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      HONORING CHASKA POLICE OFFICERS BRADY JUELL AND MIKE KLEBER\n\n Mr. WELLSTONE.

With little regard for their \nown safety, Officers Juell and Kleber searched and found resident after \nresident. In some instances they literally pulled people to safety.\n\n[[Page S1460]]\n\n  Officers Juell and Kleber did their job. But they did so much more: \nthey inspired us because they showed how great and how selfless we can \nbe.\n  The community will be honoring these brave men on March 3, but I \nwanted the Senate today to recognize these good and noble men who saved \nlives and provided us a glimpse of who we can be as a people.\n  I ask that the following articles from the Minneapolis Star Tribune \nand the Chaska Herald be printed in the Record.\n\n           [From the Minneapolis Star Tribune, Feb. 7, 2001]\n\n       Police Officers Save People From Burning Chaska Apartment\n\n                           (By Chris Graves)\n\n       As he lay choking on smoke and unable to see, Brad Bandas \n     saw the glimmer of a flashlight through the sooty black smoke \n     filling his Chaska apartment building.\n       The 22-year-old man hoped that whoever was on the other \n     side of the light saw his hand frantically waving.\n       Out of the smoke came a hand. Then Bandas was on his feet. \n     Then he was outside, standing--and coughing--in the crisp, \n     predawn air.\n       ``The officer just clutched my hand and pulled me out and \n     gave me the boost I needed,'' Bandas said. ``I could have \n     been dead. Smoke kills you.''\n       He was one of more than a dozen apartment residents saved \n     by Chaska police officers Brady Juell and Mike Kleber as fire \n     lapped up the side of the three-story stucco building in the \n     600 block of Ravoux Rd. about 4 a.m. Tuesday.\n       One resident, Robert A. Ebert, 38, died in the blaze after \n     he broke out his garden-level apartment window to try to \n     escape.\n       Chaska Police Chief Scott Knight said a bystander tried to \n     pull Ebert out of his burning apartment, but he fell backward \n     and died in the blaze.\n       Knight said preliminary findings indicate the fire, which \n     started in Ebert's apartment, was caused by an electrical \n     malfunction and was an accident.\n       Knight beamed like a father about his officers' actions.\n       ``They are heroes. I know we would have many more deaths,'' \n     he said, ``with the people sleeping and the rapid spread of \n     fire and smoke.''\n       Bandas had made it down to a first floor hall before \n     collapsing. His fiancee, Jackie Gallipo, 19, watched from \n     their third-floor apartment as he was pulled out of the \n     building. The officers, as well as Bandas, were yelling at \n     her to jump. The officers assured her they would catch her.\n       And they did.\n       ``I climbed out the window and was hanging off the sill. I \n     didn't want to jump,'' she said. ``But I didn't want to burn \n     up . . . so I jumped.''\n       Knight said the two officers crawled through the smoke, \n     banged on apartment doors and yelled to awaken residents. \n     Several times, the two men used their shoulders to break down \n     doors.\n       ``They reluctantly accept the title `hero,' '' Knight said. \n     ``They said they were doing nothing short of what their peers \n     would have done. But I have to tell you, they are heroes.\n       ``I'm beaming with pride.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Chaska (MN) Herald, Feb. 7, 2001]\n\n               One Dead in Fire; Police Help Save Others\n\n                           (By Mark W. Olson)\n\n       Dave Cooper's first migraine in six months kept him awake \n     early Tuesday morning. He was flipping from channel to \n     channel when he heard glass breaking. Cooper looked out his \n     Creekside Apartment window at the other Creekside Apartment \n     building across the parking lot. Flames were shooting from a \n     sub-level apartment of the three-story complex, at 625 Ravoux \n     Road, and windows had shattered from the heat, Cooper said.\n       Cooper called 911, ran outside and into the west entrance \n     of the blazing building and began pounding on doors. His \n     girlfriend, Donna Busch, ran to the east side of the building \n     and began yelling at residents from outside the apartment. By \n     the time Cooper reached the second floor, the building was \n     filled with smoke, he said.\n       Chaska Police Officers Brady Juell and Mike Kleber arrived \n     about a minute after receiving the 3:54 a.m. call.\n       The fire began in Robert Andrew Ebert's sub-level \n     apartment. He had apparently broken the bedroom window of his \n     flame-filled apartment to escape and another resident had \n     tried to reach for him, said Chaska Police Chief Scott \n     Knight. By the time police officers arrived, flames six to 10 \n     feet high were coming out of Ebert's apartment windows. \n     Ebert, 38, died in the fire.\n       Ebert was the only occupant in the apartment. Knight said \n     Ebert had a son, who did not live with him, and relatives in \n     Watertown and Waconia.\n       The fire may have been ``electrical in nature,'' according \n     to Knight. Preliminary investigations by the State Fire \n     Marshal point to it starting in Ebert's living room in the \n     vicinity of the VCR and television. There is a continuing \n     investigation into the exact cause.\n       The apartment building could be a complete loss, Knight \n     said. There were 21 occupants in the building, according to \n     apartment manager Brad Bandas. Residents suffered from smoke \n     inhalation and one occupant sprained an ankle, Knight said.\n       Knight credited officers Juell and Kleber with saving many \n     lives during the fire. ``I can tell you that I am fiercely \n     proud of these men,'' Knight said, at a Tuesday afternoon \n     press conference. ``I'm here to tell you they're heroes.''\n       The officers entered the smoke and fire-filled building to \n     get people out, experiencing ``conditions we can't imagine,'' \n     Knight said.\n       In one case, the officers saw a hand reach out from the \n     darkness for help. The officers shouted at occupants to walk \n     toward their flashlights. For one brief moment the officers \n     lost each other in the smoke, Knight said. ``They had to \n     crawl and shout and came upon people by feel,'' Knight said.\n       Bandas, and his fiancee Jackie Gallipo, woke to the sound \n     of smoke alarms. Their apartment was so full of smoke, Bandas \n     said he couldn't see a television across the room.\n       He headed out the door of his third-floor apartment, \n     thinking Gallipo was right behind him. ``I couldn't see a \n     damn thing,'' Bandas said. He felt his way out of the \n     building by following stair railings. A police officer pulled \n     him out the door. ``All I could do was gasp for air,'' he \n     said. Emergency crews gave him oxygen.\n       Meanwhile, Gallipo popped out a screen and jumped out a \n     third-story window, into the arms of two awaiting police \n     officers. ``I'm just glad everyone got out,'' Bandas said.\n       ``We thought someone's (clock) alarm was going off at \n     first,'' said Al Knadel. Knadel and his girlfriend, Missy \n     Schumacher, threw on shoes and jackets and headed for the \n     door. By the time they left, flames were coming from under \n     one of their apartment's doors.\n       ``We just moved in a week ago,'' Knadel said. ``Time to \n     pack everything up and start at square one again.''\n       Tuesday morning Bill and Virginia Standke, volunteers with \n     the American Red Cross of Carver County, were helping the \n     residents find temporary places to stay, and finding out what \n     clothes and other supplies residents needed.\n       Firefighters from Chaska, Chanhassen, Shakopee, Victoria \n     and Carver all fought the fire.\n       Chaska's last apartment building fire, on Jan. 15, 2000 at \n     123 W. 2nd Street in downtown Chaska, left 11 people \n     homeless.

Mr. President, this past Monday, the Ohio \nagriculture community lost a dear friend with the passing of Ed \nJohnson. He was not only a friend of mine, he was a wonderful human \nbeing.\n  Ed Johnson grew up on a dairy farm in Fairfield County, Ohio. From \nthe time he was a young boy, Ed realized that the only way to get ahead \nin life was through honest, hard work. This philosophy translated \nitself into a tremendous work ethic, which, combined with his robust \nenergy and love for farming, made Ed an enthusiastic and well-regarded \nspokesman for Ohio farmers.\n  With a background in agricultural economics and agricultural \neducation, Ed started out his professional life as a teacher before \njoining the Ohio Farm Bureau as Organizational Director for Fairfield, \nPickaway and Ross Counties. He worked hard on behalf of ``his'' farmers \nand was a great source of agricultural information for both farmers and \nnon-farmers alike. It was while he served at Ohio Farm Bureau that he \ndiscovered he had a real knack for radio, reporting on Farm Bureau \nevents, then sporting events and farm market news.\n  Ed, it seems, had found his niche. He took his love of farming, \ncombined it with his communication skills, and became a true media \nentrepreneur. He assumed the risk of starting up his own radio network, \nABN, Agri Broadcasting Network, and developed a multi-state service to \nsmall stations by delivering market news and covering agricultural \nevents. It wasn't long before Ed became an accomplished radio \npersonality. As his success grew, he developed an early industry \nservice of up-linking and down-linking sporting events for major radio, \nWBNS Columbus being one such station.\n  Ed also branched out into television, hosting his own weekly morning \nshow, Agri Country, which aired in Ohio and three other states. With Ed \nat the helm, Agri Country has been popular to both farming and non-\nfarming audiences since 1982.\n  In addition to his radio and television work, Ed advanced agriculture \nwith ``Ohio's Country Journal,'' a monthly publication that, even \nthough it struggled for its first few years, has blossomed as \nreadership numbers shot\n\n[[Page S1461]]\n\nup. It is now ``the'' farm publication for Ohio's agriculture.\n  Ed's great contributions to agricultural media were surpassed only by \nhis humanitarian giving in terms of his leadership and his time. His \nunselfish dedication to further the causes of his alma mater, the Ohio \nState University, the 4-H Foundation, the Future Farmers of America, \nand all Ohio farmers for that matter, were unparalleled.\n  Ed's personal caring and concern for society and his fellow man made \nhim an outstanding communicator. Ed could talk with anyone--rich man or \npoor man; farm hand or a nation's president--he had an uncanny ability \nto put anyone he talked to totally at ease.\n  Throughout the years, I came to rely on Ed's knowledge of Ohio \nagriculture and his viewpoint on the agricultural situation throughout \nthe state of Ohio. I appreciated his tireless efforts to promote \nagribusiness both within the state and nationwide.\n  Because of Ed's contribution to agriculture in the State of Ohio, I \nwas pleased to induct him into Ohio's Agriculture Hall of Fame in 1997. \nOn that occasion, I said ``I don't think there's anyone in the state \nwho is more readily identifiable with agriculture by the average person \nthan Ed.'' Indeed.\n  I've often said that it's not the number of years that one lives, but \nwhat one does with those years that counts. In his sixty-three years, \nEd lived his life to the fullest, and in so doing, touched the lives of \ncountless individuals. Ed took risks, celebrated his successes and \nlearned from his defeats, and, through it all, Ed never lost his focus, \nhis positive attitude, nor his ever-present grin. There is no one \ncomparable, and the void his loss has created in Ohio will not soon be \nfilled.\n  Ed Johnson has been taken from us too early, and I will miss him. It \nis my hope that his wife, Marilyn, his children, Julie and Bart, his \nfoster daughter Julie, his grandchildren--Adam, Eric, Nathan, Sarah, \nElizabeth, Gage and Lauren--his brothers and sister and his entire \nfamily will take comfort in the knowledge that Ed is with our Father in \nHeaven.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/15/senate-section/article/S1461-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO PAUL NASH\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Paul has been a highly-valued member of my legislative \nstaff for more than 4 years, and I wanted to take this opportunity to \npublicly thank him for all his years of hard work and dedication to the \npeople of South Dakota. Paul will no longer be working on my staff \nafter next week, and I, along with my entire staff, will miss his \ncontributions greatly.\n  Paul was one of the original members of my Senate staff when I began \nserving in this body in January of 1997. Paul has worked on a number of \nissues in my office, and for the past several years has been my \nlegislative assistant responsible for staffing my Banking Committee \nassignment, as well as taxes, telecommunications, campaign finance \nreform, government employees and labor issues. Paul has been an \ninstrumental part of some of my key legislative accomplishments since I \nhave had the honor of serving in the Senate, including passage of the \nJohnson amendment to the Financial Services Modernization Act, and \nlegislation to provide access to local television stations for rural \nsatellite owners. Paul has also been actively involved in helping to \nproduce bipartisan legislation in the past Congress and at the start of \nthis Congress to reauthorize the Export Administration Act. His efforts \nhave earned him the respect of many people he has worked with, \nincluding other Senators and staff of the Banking Committee.\n  Paul has also worked closely with members of the South Dakota \nfinancial services community, and I know he will be missed by them as \nwell. Paul's efforts on telecommunication issues for rural America, as \nwell as his hard work on many other issues, such as campaign finance \nreform and tax policy have also been important contributions to my \nlegislative efforts of the past 4 years. He has been a true public \nservant for me, the people of South Dakota and the Nation.\n  I know Paul's parents, family, friends and colleagues are all very \nproud of him. Paul has a very bright future, and I know he will \ncontinue to succeed at whatever he chooses to do. On behalf of my wife \nBarbara and I, and my entire staff, I want to thank Paul Nash for his \ndedication and years of hard work for me and the people of South \nDakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/15/senate-section/article/S1461-2", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      JOHN HARRIES' 107TH BIRTHDAY\n\n Mr. INHOFE.

On \nFebruary 23, 2001, Mr. John Harries, of Edmond, Oklahoma, will be 107 \nyears old.\n  Born on a farm twelve miles west of Waukegan, Illinois, in 1894, John \nhas witnessed many major events throughout his lifetime, including two \nworld wars. Showing true patriotism, he left dental school and joined \nthe army at the onset of World War I. While fighting in France, he was \nexposed to mustard gas, which severely damaged his lungs. But the \nsacrifices he made in the name of freedom did not go unnoticed. \nRecently, France awarded him the French Legion of Honor for his \nservice. This is the highest medal that the French award to foreigners.\n  Retiring in 1967, John spent most of his professional life at Salerno \nBaking Company in Chicago, where he was chief salesman. He was married \nto his wife, Mildred, for 66 years until her death in July, 2000. He \nthen moved to Oklahoma, where he now lives with his niece, Nancy \nPruett.

A bill to recruit and retain more qualified individuals to \nteach in Tribal Colleges or Universities; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, earlier this week I had the honor and \npleasure of meeting with the presidents, faculty and student leaders \nfrom South Dakota's tribal colleges to talk about the educational needs \nof Native Americans and the crucial role tribal colleges play in \nstrengthening tribal communities. It was a fascinating conversation.\n  We sat around a table in my office in the United States Capitol \nbuilding talking about the hopes and aspirations of the next generation \nof Native American leaders. Every one of those young people had good \nideas and the poise and self-confidence to express them.\n  As the participants spoke of the importance and the power of \neducation as the key to unlock the promise of the future, the story I \nheard was not one of bricks and mortar, but rather one of enduring \nspirit, sense of community and hope for a better quality of life. \nListening to the discussion and observing the people in the room, I had \nno doubt that the future of Indian Country is in good hands.\n  Tribal colleges and universities play a critical role in educating \nNative Americans across the country, and I have come to believe they \nmay well be the best kept secret in higher education. For more than 30 \nyears, these institutions have been instrumental in providing a quality \neducation for Native American students, many of whom our mainstream \neducational system previously had failed.\n  Before the tribal college movement began, only six or seven out of \n100 Native American students attended college. Of those few who did, \nonly one or two would graduate with a degree.\n  Then tribal colleges emerged, offering curricula that is culturally \nrelevant and focused on a tribe's particular philosophy, culture, \nlanguage and economic needs. With this focus and a clear mission, these \ninstitutions have had a high success rate in educating Native American \nand Alaska Native people, and tribal college enrollment has increased \n62 percent over the last six years.\n  The track record of tribal colleges is impressive. Recent studies \nshow that 91 percent of 1998 tribal college and university graduates \nare working or pursuing additional education one year after graduation. \nOver the last ten years, the unemployment rate of recently polled \ntribal college graduates was 15 percent, compared to 55 percent on many \nreservations overall.\n  While tribal colleges and universities have been highly successful in \nhelping Native Americans obtain a higher education, additional \nchallenges remain before the future of these institutions is assured. \nThese schools rely heavily on federal resources to provide educational \nopportunities for their students, and federal spending trends for these \nschools have been woefully inadequate. It is imperative that the \nbipartisan effort to provide additional core and facilities funding to \ntribal colleges continue.\n  In addition to resource constraints, tribal college administrators \nand faculty have expressed to me a particular frustration over the \ndifficulty they experience in attracting qualified teachers to Indian \nCountry. Geographic isolation and low salaries have made recruitment \nand retention particularly difficult for many of these schools, and \nthis problem has been exacerbated by rising enrollment.\n  As a matter of public policy, it simply makes sense for Congress to \nhelp tribal college administrators overcome these serious barriers to \nthe recruitment and retention of qualified faculty. Today, with the \nsupport of the South Dakota delegation of Tribal Colleges, the American \nIndian Higher Education Consortium, and the National Indian Education \nAssociation, and the co-sponsorship of my colleagues Senators Bingaman, \nConrad, Baucus, Akaka, Reid, Kennedy, Leahy, Dodd, and Johonson, I am \npleased to introduce the Tribal College or University Loan Forgiveness \nAct, which will provide forgiveness on federal student\n\n[[Page S1466]]\n\nloans to individuals who commit to teach for up to five years in one of \nthe 32 tribal colleges nationwide. Under this proposal, individuals who \nhave Perkins, Direct or Guaranteed loans may qualify to receive up to \n$15,000 in loan forgiveness, which will help tribal colleges attract \nqualified teachers and encourage Native American students to fulfill \ntheir promise.\n  The Tribal College or University Loan Forgiveness Act will benefit \nindividual students and their communities. By expanding opportunities \nfor Native American students to develop valuable skills, it will not \nonly allow individuals to maximize their human potential, but also spur \neconomic growth and help facilitate self-sufficiency in communities \nthat desperately need it.\n  I believe our responsibility as legislators was perhaps best summed \nup by one of my state's historic leaders, Sitting Bull, who said: ``Let \nus put our minds together and see what life we can make for our \nchildren.'' This message still resonates loudly and applies today, and \nis reflected in the life's work of Sitting Bulls' great-great-great \ngrandson, Ron McNeil, the president of Sitting Bull College, with whom \nI met on this very subject earlier in the week.\n  Mr. President, I look forward to working with Ron McNeil and his \nfellow educators across the country to familiarize the public with the \naccomplishments and the promise of the tribal college movement. And I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues in the Congress to pass the \nTribal College or University Loan Forgiveness Act as quickly as \npossible. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 340\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to require \nthat violent video programming is limited to broadcast after the hours \nwhen children are reasonably likely to comprise a substantial portion \nof the audience, unless it is specifically rated on the basis of its \nviolent content so that it is blockable by electronic means \nspecifically on the basis of that content; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Stevens, Senator \nHutchison of Texas, Senator Inouye, Senator Kohl, Senator Dorgan, and \nmyself, I send to the desk a bill, the Children's Protection From \nViolent Programming Act.\n  Mr. President, it has been a 50-year learning process. I am reminded \nof Peter, Paul, and Mary, singing that song about, ``Where have all the \nflowers gone? When will they ever learn?'' The truth of the matter is \nthat we have learned. We have had hearings starting back in the early \n1950s with Senator Kefauver. We have had Surgeon General reports, \nAmerican Medical Association reports, American Psychological \nAssociation reports, National Cable Television Association reports, \nKaiser Family Foundation reports--reports, reports, reports, again, \nagain, and again; and only this yet to be introduced ``Youth Violence: \nA Report of the Surgeon General,'' which I quote, among other findings, \nfrom page 93:\n\n       Research to date justifies sustained efforts to curb the \n     adverse effects of media violence on youth.\n\n  We have had Attorney General Janet Reno, along with other legal \nscholars, attest to the constitutionality of the safe harbor approach. \nThe truth of the matter is that everybody is talking about \nbipartisanship. We have had it with respect to TV violence and its \neffect on children. In the last three Congresses, safe harbor has been \nreported out of committee almost unanimously, with only one dissenting \nvote in each Congress, 16-1, 19-1, 17-1, after a series of hearings in \nthe Commerce Committee. Then it gets to the full Senate's calendar and \nit stops.\n  On Thursday, January 25, a thirteen year old boy was sentenced to \nlife in prison for the killing of a six year old family friend. Why did \nhe do it? To imitate pro wrestling he had watched on television. In \nthis instance, the defendant punched, kicked, and threw a 48 pound \nlittle girl against a metal staircase after asking her ``Do you want to \nplay wrestling?'' His defense attorney stated: ``He wanted to emulate \nthem. . . . Like Batman and Superman, they were his heroes.'' He added, \nthat the defendant ``didn't understand that he could hurt the 48-pound \ngirl if he punched her and threw her because he had seen pro wrestlers \ndo that hundreds of times without injuring each other.'' Apparently, \nthe death was one of at least four cases in 1999 in which pro wrestling \ninspired the killing of one child by another.\n  The day after this sentencing, another thirteen year old boy suffered \nsecond and third degree burns when he tried to imitate an MTV \npersonality who set himself on fire as part of the\n\n[[Page S1467]]\n\nshow ``Jackass,'' which airs on that music network. The injured teen, \nwho was from Torrington, CT, allowed his friend to douse his pants and \nshoes with gasoline and then light them on fire mistakenly assuming \nthat he would not be injured. His burns, and required hospitalization \ntell another tale.\n  Mr. President, enough is enough. And yet, we can never bring \nourselves to act. Remember, it was over three years ago, in Paducah, \nKentucky, when a fourteen year old savagely murdered three teenage \ngirls and shot five others who had just completed their morning prayer \nmeeting at school. Prosecutors alleged the defendant plotted his \nkillings after watching ``The Basketball Diaries,'' a movie in which a \ntormented student dreams of brutally slaying his tormentors in the \nclassroom. In the scene in which the killings take place, popular rock \nmusic resonates in the background and students high-five each other and \nlaugh while their friend guns down multiple students and the classroom \nteacher.\n  And we all are familiar with the incident in which a young boy burned \ndown his home, thereby killing his sister, while imitating the \nritualistic pyromaniac practices that were glorified on the popular \ncartoon show ``Beavis and Butthead.'' A few years before that, in 1991, \na thirteen year old boy in Jerusalem accidentally killed himself when \nhe imitated a TV hanging he had witnessed on one of his favorite \naction-adventure programs. His friends discovered him dead, hanging \nfrom the stairway bannister in his home.\n  How much copycat violence will it take? How many violent acts have to \nbe committed, how much vandalism, destruction, injury, and death has to \noccur, before we act here in Congress? As we have seen in Littleton, \nColorado, and in Paducah, Kentucky, violence in our culture is \nbegetting violence by our youths. Violence is everywhere, it is readily \naccessible, and it is a source of corporate profits. As a Washington \nPost article entitled ``When Death Imitates Art'' stated two years \nago--``For young people, the culture at large is bathed in blood and \nviolence . . . where the more extreme the message, the more over the \ntop gruesomeness, the better.'' This assessment is based on established \nevidence and facts. We know from the Congressional Research Service \nthat before completing elementary school, the average child will \nwitness 8,000 murders and 100,000 other acts of violence on television \nalone. By the time he or she graduates from high school, the exposure \nwill rise to 40,000 televised murders. Often accompanied by popular \nmusic, portrayed in a glorified light, and delivered without reference \nto the negative consequences of such dire actions, television violence \nhas a direct, adverse impact on our children.\n\n  The legislation I offer today provides an opportunity for us to act \nresponsibly to lessen that impact, by limiting our children's exposure \nto the poisonous effects of televised, glorified, violence. We need to \ntake advantage of that opportunity. The purveyors of violence in \ncorporate America will no doubt criticize this effort and seek the \nmantle of the First Amendment while espousing the virtue of self-\nregulation. What they won't say is that U.S. law already restricts the \nbroadcasting of indecent programming on television, a restriction the \nfederal courts have upheld as consistent with the First Amendment. A \nsimilar approach for violence is also likely to be upheld, as has been \ndemonstrated in previous Congresses through the hearing testimony of \nthe U.S. Attorney General, the Chairman of the Federal Communications \nCommission, and numerous constitutional scholars. As for self-\nregulation, it has been proven unequivocally that such an approach will \nnever work so long as it is pitted against the allure of the almighty \ndollar.\n  Mr. President, this is an issue about accountability and \nresponsibility. Those responsible for supplying and distributing video \nprogramming have been entrusted with public resources--through grants \nof government spectrum and public rights of way--that allow them to \ndeliver their programming to America's children. Notwithstanding the \nresponsibility that accompanies the grant of this public trust, we know \nfrom the studies that there is more violence on television during prime \ntime, during ``sweeps weeks'' and even on weekend afternoons. Why? \nBecause violence sells and money talks. And no amount of self- \nregulation, and no number of antitrust exemptions is going to change \nthat profit incentive.\n  Moreover, we know that no issue is more developed, more researched, \nand more debated than this one. Allow me to lay out the history.\n  We were in the last days of the Truman Administration when a House \nSubcommittee first looked at the issue of violence on radio and \ntelevision.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee and Senator Estes Kefauver began to \nexamine media and youth violence in hearings in 1954 and the Senate \nCommerce Committee began hearings in 1960. In the Senate Commerce \nCommittee alone we have held twenty two hearings on the issue of media \nviolence.\n  In 1972, the Surgeon General's report concluded that there is a \ncausal link between viewing violence as a child and subsequent violent \nor aggressive behavior.\n  In 1982, the National Institute of Mental Health, after ten years of \nresearch, found that ``the consensus among most of the research \ncommunity is that violence on television does lead to aggressive \nbehavior by children and teenagers who watch the programs.''\n  Congress finally responded to this overwhelming evidence in 1990, \nwhen we granted the industry an antitrust exemption to meet and develop \nways to reduce violence on television. In response to that legislation, \nthe TV networks issued standards for the depiction of violence on \nbroadcast television. Let me quote from those standards:\n\n       All depictions of violence should be relevant and necessary \n     to the development of character, or to the advancement of \n     theme or plot. Gratuitous or excessive depictions of \n     violence, (or redundant violence shown solely for its own \n     sake), are not acceptable. Programs should not depict \n     violence as glamorous, nor as an acceptable solution to human \n     conflict. . . . Realistic depictions of violence should also \n     portray, in human terms, the consequences of that violence to \n     its victims and its perpetrators.\n\n  The goals articulated by these network standards are good ones--they \nare the same goals I hope to achieve with this legislation. \nUnfortunately, the standards developed pursuant to the 1990 antitrust \nexemption were never adhered to by the networks. Instead, the \ntelevision industry ignored and violated those standards, thereby \nrendering the antitrust exemption meaningless. We know this because an \nindustry commissioned study by the National Cable Television \nAssociation tells us as much. That NCTA study, issued in 1998, reported \nthat:\n\n       The way that most TV violence is portrayed continues to \n     pose risks to viewers . . . Much of TV violence is still \n     glamorized. . . . Most violence on television continues to be \n     sanitized. Television often ignores or underestimates what \n     happens to the victims of violence . . . Much of the serious \n     physical aggression on television is still trivialized.\n\n  The NCTA report could not put it more plainly. The networks failed to \nheed their own standards. I hope we have learned our lesson: no \nantitrust exemption is going to protect children from the harms \nassociated with television violence.\n  With respect to the causal impact of exposure to televised violence, \nthe NCTA report was equally illuminating. It stated:\n\n       Prior to this study, it had already been well established \n     that television influences many kinds of attitudes and \n     behaviors by modeling them as appropriate and/or desirable. A \n     highly successful multi-billion dollar advertising industry \n     is built on that premise. More specifically, violence on \n     television has been shown in hundreds of studies to have an \n     influence on aggressive behavior. Over the past 20 years, \n     numerous respected academic and public health organizations \n     and agencies--including the American Psychological \n     Association, the American Medical Association, the U.S. \n     Surgeon General, and the National Institute of Mental \n     Health--have reviewed the existing body of evidence in this \n     area and have unanimously affirmed the validity of that \n     conclusion.\n\n  Finally, several weeks ago, the Surgeon General released a \npreliminary report that concludes-- yet again--that there exists a \nscientific link between violent television programming and increased \naggression in children. The report states: ``A diverse body of research \nprovides strong evidence that exposure to violence in the media can \nincrease children's aggressive behavior in the short term.'' The report \nnotes further that a smaller body of reports demonstrates that ``long-\nterm effects exist, and there are strong theoretical reasons that this \nis the case.'' Finally, the report concludes that ``Research to date \njustifies sustained efforts to curb\n\n[[Page S1468]]\n\nthe adverse effects of media violence on youths.''\n\n  So there you have it. We have come full circle with two significant \nsurgeon general reports almost thirty years apart and scores of studies \nin between. In the interim, Congress and the Federal Communications \nCommission have tried to address this problem with a mix of regulation \nand self regulation. These attempts have been unsuccessful. In the \n1970s, FCC Chairman Dick Wiley attempted to cajole industry to adopt a \nfamily hour, but that ultimately was abandoned. Then, in addition to \nthe failed 1990 antitrust exemption, we acted in 1996, as part of the \nTelecommunications Act, to require televisions to be equipped with a V-\nChip. We know today, however, almost five years since that provision \nwas passed, that the V-chip is not working. For example, an April 2000 \nsurvey by the Kaiser Family Foundation demonstrates that only 9 percent \nof parents of children aged 2-17 own a television with a V-Chip. \nMoreover, only one-third of these parents (3 percent of all parents) \nhave programmed the chip to block unsuitable programming. Finally, the \nsurvey indicated that 39 percent of parents of children aged 2-17 had \nnever heard of the V-Chip.\n  As if that was not bad enough, we know further that the industry \ndeveloped ratings system designed to work in conjunction with the V-\nchip is failing as well. To be specific, although almost all broadcast \nand cable channels now encode their programs with ratings, many violent \nprograms are in fact not specifically rated ``V'' for violence--thereby \nrendering the system ineffective. The most recent survey by the Kaiser \nFamily Foundation on this subject found that 79 percent of shows with \nviolence did not receive the ``V'' rating. If the V-Chip and the \nratings system do not provide enough protection, it is our \nresponsibility to fill in the gap.\n  Last year, the Senate Commerce Committee held two high profile \nhearings to examine an issue related to televised violence--that of \nmarketing violence to children. At those hearings we reviewed industry \npractices as outlined in a Federal Trade Commission report that found \nthat the entertainment industry as a whole routinely marketed violent \nfare to children that was in fact rated as inappropriate for those same \nchildren. I raise this subject because some members of industry \nresponded to the FTC report and our hearings by choosing to limit the \nadvertising of violent material on television to certain hours of the \nday. In other words, they too believe that it is better to shield \nchildren from exposure to violent images when they are likely to \ncomprise a substantial portion of the audience. While I applaud those \nvoluntary actions, they do not go far enough, and as a result, we in \nCongress have to do more. If it is good for children to limit violent \nadvertisements, it follows that it should be good for children to limit \nviolent programming.\n  A recent study by Stanford University supports this conclusion. \nReleased last month, the study determined that aggression by children \ncan be reduced by limiting their exposure to media violence--exactly \nthe approach advocated in our Safeharbor legislation.\n  Mr. President, that is why I am introducing my legislation today. My \nbill takes a two track approach to television violence. First, it would \nrequire the FCC to study whether the V-Chip and the content-based \nratings system can capably meet the compelling government interest in \nprotecting children from the harms associated with their exposure to \nviolence on television. The FCC is to complete this determination \nwithin 12 months of enactment and is directed to continue an ongoing \nannual assessment of this issue. If the FCC at any time determines that \nthe V-Chip and the ratings do not constitute an effective means of \nsatisfying the government's compelling interest in protecting children, \nthen it must institute a Safeharbor to shield children from violent \nprograms when they are likely to comprise a substantial portion of the \naudience. While this legislation would apply to broadcast television \nand basic satellite and cable programming, it would exempt pay-per-view \nand premium cable and satellite programming from the Safeharbor.\n  Prior to the imposition of any safeharbor, the legislation directs \nthe FCC to develop rules penalizing broadcasters and cable and \nsatellite programmers for distributing violent programming on \ntelevision that is not blockable by the V-Chip. These penalties will be \ntriggered if violent shows are not in fact rated ``V'' for violence as \nrequired by the ratings system. This provision will increase the \nincentive for programmers to rate their shows accurately, and responds \nto evidence that most violent programming is in fact not specifically \nrated for violence, and therefore is not blockable by the V-Chip.\n  This legislation was reported favorably by the Senate Commerce \nCommittee last year by a 17-1 vote. I look forward to moving the bill \nout of Committee again this year, and I hope that we can secure \nenactment of this measure for the first time in this Congress.\n  Mr. President, the evidence is in, we know the results, and we have a \nsolution. Its time to enact a safeharbor for television violence.\n  Mr. President, I refer to page 23 of volume 3 of ``A History of \nBroadcasting in the United States.'' It alludes to the year 1949 and \nthe production of the program ``Man Against Crime,'' starring Ralph \nBellamy. I begin right on page 23:\n  ``Man Against Crime was sponsored by Camel Cigarettes. This affected \nboth writing and direction. Mimeographed instructions told writers, \n``Do not have the heavy or any disreputable person smoking a cigarette. \nDo not associate the smoking of cigarettes with undesirable scenes or \nsituations plot wise.''\n\n       Cigarettes had to be smoked gracefully, never puffed \n     nervously. A cigarette was never given to a character to calm \n     his nerves, since this might suggest a narcotic effect. \n     Writers received numerous plot instructions.\n\n  Listen carefully because this is the instruction that the writers \nwere given 50 years ago:\n\n       It has been found that we retain audience interest best \n     when our story is concerned with murder. Therefore, although \n     other crimes may be introduced, somebody must be murdered, \n     preferably early, with the threat of more violence to come.\n\n  That is from the History of Broadcasting.\n  The industry knows that violence is a moneymaker. Ten years ago, the \ndistinguished Senator from Illinois said: No, no, wait a minute, don't \nrush into this thing; freedom of speech, freedom of speech. We don't \nwant to damage the originality of the producers. So we gave an \nantitrust exemption so they could work together because Senator Simon \nsaid they could not work together and regulate because of antitrust \nprovisions in the Federal statute. We gave them that protection.\n  Then came a very interesting study from cable television. Every time \nI speak in the Chamber, they give me another study. That is why I wish \nI could sing: When will they ever learn?\n  This study, done a few years ago, was financed by the National Cable \nTelevision Association, but it was done by the University of California \nat Santa Barbara, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the \nUniversity of Texas at Austin and the University of Wisconsin at \nMadison. It included, amongst other council members, the American \nFederation of Television and Radio Artists, the Producers Guild of \nAmerica, the Writers Guild of America West, the Caucus for Producers, \nWriters and Directors, the American Bar Association, and the Directors \nGuild of America. Point: The very people who are doing the producing \nfound that violence begets children's violence.\n  Three weeks ago, a 13-year-old was sentenced to life in prison for \nbludgeoning to death a 48-pound 8 year old. He had seen this on a cable \nwrestling show. These wrestlers jumped on each other, they beat each \nothers' heads against a post, and then flung opponents out of the ring. \nThat was the undisputed record: That the 13-year-old saw wrestling \nmatches where everybody got up and walked away unharmed and came back \nthe next week.\n  Just last month, someone else emulated a stunt on MTV showing how \npeople could be set on fire and then walk away unharmed. The individual \nsaw the MTV program, tried it, and got first- and second-degree burns \nall over his body.\n  I will never forget years ago on the ``Johnny Carson Show,'' they had \na fellow with a tie around his neck, and he dropped through a trap door \nand hung and, again, just walked away. The next day a couple found \ntheir young teenager hanging from the bedroom fan. He\n\n[[Page S1469]]\n\nhad tied himself up, got on the edge of the bed, and jumped off and \nhanged himself.\n  We know monkey see-monkey do, and it begets violence. This country, \nthe industrial country of the United States, has more violence than all \nother countries combined.\n  What have the other countries done? For years on end they have had a \nsafe harbor in Europe, in Australia, and in New Zealand, and other \nplaces. They have a time set aside when children dominate the audience \nand thou shalt not have violent shows during that time. It works. Their \nchildren do not shoot up classrooms, they do not emulate violence, or \nkill little girls. That does not go on in Europe, but it continues to \nincrease in our country, according to the Surgeon General's report just \nabout to be released. We see it on the increase.\n  The Kaiser Family Foundation counters with: Oh, well, you have to get \nthe V-chip. Under legal decisions, you have to use the least intrusive \nmethod of regulating so-called free speech. So we put the V-chip into \nthe 1996 Telecommunications Act. That was supposed to allow parents to \ntake charge. We constantly hear that when we know it is not the case.\n  Sixty-two percent of young single women are in the workforce with \nlatchkey children at home. We have tried that V-chip. One, 40 percent \nof those interviewed under the Kaiser Family Foundation have never even \nheard of the V-chip--what are you talking about? Two, less than 10 \npercent have ever had the V-chip, and, three, less than 3 percent have \never used it.\n  It is impractical. You have to run around to the three or four TVs in \nthe house and say: I have the program, and before I go to work this \nmorning, I am going to put in the chip. Come on, that is unreal, but \nthat is the political solution which has not worked.\n  I do not want to be put aside. I have been put aside. I offered an \namendment a couple of years ago to the juvenile justice bill. Some \ncolleagues said: Fritz, I would vote for your amendment, but I don't \nwant any amendments on the juvenile justice bill, or we have not tried \nthe V-chip. They gave any putoff they could think of.\n  We found out that we ought to just include it in a statute. In this \nbill, we direct the Federal Communications Commission to have hearings \non this matter and determine whether or not the V-chip is effective \nand, if it is not, to promulgate a safe harbor.\n  Constitutionally, the Federal Communications Commission has been \ngiven that authority on indecency. Why not on violence? These programs \nhave not been properly rated. We prescribe in this measure that the \nindustry start rating violence--V for violence--on these shows. If they \ndo not, there is going to be a penalty.\n  A Stanford University study has just been issued whereby they have \ntested the diminution of violence on television and there has been a \ndiminution then in children's violence in that particular community. We \nwill bring that to the floor. We are ready to debate this legislation. \nThis is a bipartisan bill. We have had Republican and Democrats in the \nlast three Congresses join in, but we have never had a fair hearing on \nthe floor.\n  We have done this in a deliberate, measured fashion so that we can \nget it considered in this Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Senator Hollings' \nChildren's Protection from Violent Television Programming Act. I thank \nSenator Hollings for his leadership and hard work on this important \nissue shielding our children from excessive violence in the media.\n  This proposal is vital to ensure that the promise of the V-chip is \nfulfilled, that our public airwaves cannot be used and abused to the \ndetriment of our families and our children. But today, in spite of the \nV-chip, our children are still being exposed to ultra-violent \nprogramming on television, even during the early prime time period \nknown as ``family hour.''\n  Since my first term in office, I have fought to limit the amount of \nviolence that our children are exposed to on television, in video \ngames, in the movies and in music. Although I have focused on the video \ngame industry encouraging the manufacturers to create and implement a \nratings system I was also a vocal supporter of the V-chip provision \nincluded in the Telecommunications Act of 1996.\n  The V-chip legislation required the installation of blocking \ntechnology in most televisions. That technology is used in conjunction \nwith a television ratings system so that parents can restrict their \nchildren's access to violent programming at all times. We know that \nparents can't realistically look over their children's shoulders every \nminute they're in front of the television. But the V-Chip allows them \nto configure their television to do essentially that.\n  Since January 2000, V-chip technology has been installed in every \ntelevision measuring over 13''. More than 25 million televisions have a \nV-chip now. However, a recent study by the Annenberg Public Policy \nCenter revealed that nine in ten parents do not know about the \ntelevision ratings system, and of parents who own and know about their \nV-chip, only half actually use the blocking technology.\n  Clearly, having a V-chip in a television is just not good enough. It \nhas to be combined with a good, easily understood ratings system and a \nreal commitment by manufacturers, retailers and broadcasters to educate \nparents. Without these elements, having a V-chip in your television is \nabout as effective at protecting your child as requiring car seats but \nletting toddlers sit in the front seat without a seatbelt.\n  Mr. President, my first preference is to have V-chip technology that \nworks and that parents trust. But if it seems otherwise, we will not \nstand idly by. This legislation presents a step-by-step approach: it \nasks the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to gauge the success \nand public awareness of the V-chip. And if success is limited and \npublic awareness is low, this measure vests the Commission with the \npower to remedy it.\n  So let's pass this legislation, and let's find out if the V-chip is \nreally helping parents shield their children from violence on \ntelevision. And if not, let's give the FCC the power to do something \nabout it. Our families and especially our children deserve nothing \nless.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CARNAHAN:\n  S. 342. A bill to assist local educational agencies by providing \ngrants for proven measures for increasing the quality of education, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak \nabout an issue that is close to my heart and one that is essential to \nthe Nation's future--the education of our children.\n  Education was a priority for my husband, the late Mel Carnahan, \nthroughout his career, and it was a driving force during his two terms \nas Governor of Missouri.\n  I recall that one of the things he enjoyed most as he traveled around \nthe State was visiting schools. He would come home excited about the \ngood things that were happening in Missouri schools.\n  His Outstanding Schools Act, passed during his first term as \nGovernor, brought major improvements to classrooms throughout our \nState. He dreamed of doing even more. As he traveled across Missouri \nseeking election to this body, he called for a new national commitment \nto the education of America's children.\n  Though he did not live to pursue that dream, I am proud to stand here \nin his place in the U.S. Senate to introduce my first bill--a bill \nimprinted with his hopes, a bill that fulfills his pledge to the \ncitizens of Missouri, and a bill that reinforces the President's \npromise ``to leave no child behind.''\n  Though teachers, students, and parents are trying harder than ever, \nschools are facing difficult times.\n  My concern, and the focus of this legislation, is the classrooms of \nAmerica: Classrooms that are severely crowded and housed in \ndeteriorating facilities; classrooms where disorderly and sometimes \nviolent students are disrupting learning; classrooms in need of math, \nscience, and reading specialists.\n  As a result of these conditions, far too many students are failing to \nlearn and are falling behind in comparison with students in other \ndeveloped nations.\n  Increases in student population across the Nation further heighten \nthe\n\n[[Page S1470]]\n\nproblems, as does the loss of teachers to retirement or other \nprofessions. According to the 1998 National Assessment of Education \nProgress, one-quarter of our students are still being taught in classes \nof more than 25 students.\n  As we watch class sizes grow, we see the physical condition of our \nolder classrooms fall into dangerous disrepair. In Missouri alone, we \nface the daunting prospect of $4 billion in construction needs for our \npublic schools over the next decade.\n  The threat and frequency of violence and disruptions in our \nclassrooms remain at unacceptable levels. A recent study by the \nEducational Testing Service made this observation:\n\n       School discipline * * * problems are critical factors in \n     student achievement. Without order in our classrooms, \n     teachers can't teach and students can't learn.\n\n  Our national leaders have been bemoaning the condition of public \nschools for many years. Over 50 years ago, President Truman said:\n\n       The schools in this country are crowded and teachers \n     underpaid. One of our greatest national needs is more and \n     better schools.\n\n  Later, President Eisenhower noted:\n\n       Millions of children were receiving substandard education \n     because of unsanitary, overcrowded, and unsafe classrooms. * \n     * * It was evident to many of us, but not all, that in view \n     of the financial positions of many states and school \n     districts, the federal government would have to help.\n\n  Yet decades after these remarks, the Federal Government still \nprovides a mere 7 percent of the national education budget.\n  I understand there are many who are weary of increased Federal \neducation funding because they fear that with such funds comes Federal \ncontrol of local schools. While this is a legitimate concern, it need \nnot be a paralyzing fear that prevents us from moving ahead with much \nneeded classroom improvements.\n  There is a way for us to fund public schools without adding redtape, \nburdening our school districts, or enabling Federal bureaucrats to \ndictate local education policy.\n  The legislation I introduce today--the Quality Classrooms Act--will \ndo just that. It calls for a new commitment of $50 billion over the \nnext decade to our local schools.\n  These funds would flow directly from the Federal Government to local \nschools districts and would be dedicated exclusively to helping schools \nprovide what parents, teachers, and students most desire--more \nintensive, individualized, face-to-face instruction in the classroom.\n  It recognizes that different school districts have different needs. \nSome may need to reduce class size, others to improve classroom \nconditions. In an attempt to provide more flexibility to each school \ndistrict and to keep decisionmaking at the local level, this bill \nallows school districts to use the funding for one, or a combination of \npurposes. Each of the five options addresses class size or conditions--\na formula that has led to improved student performance in the past.\n  Funds under the Quality Classrooms Act would be used to do one or \nmore of the following: Hire new classroom teachers to reduce student-\nteacher ratios; build or renovate classrooms to relieve overcrowding; \nhire experienced teaching specialists, focusing on basics such as \nreading, science, and math; establish alternative discipline programs \nfor the education of chronically violent and disruptive students; and \nprovide a year-round schedule.\n  This menu of choices allows schools to retain flexibility, yet leaves \nparents and taxpayers with the comfort of knowing that resources are \nbeing spent on measures with proven success.\n  The bill provides added flexibility and innovation by setting aside \n10 percent of the available funding for a competitive grant program. \nThese ``Innovation Grants'' would encourage schools to develop creative \napproaches to quality instruction.\n  Grant recipients are required to evaluate these newly developed \nprograms to determine what approaches enhance student performance. \nAside from this evaluation, however, school districts will not be \nrequired to file burdensome reports or abide by new Federal mandates.\n  This proposed legislation makes sure that money goes to schools, \nteachers, and students, not the education bureaucracy. It requires the \nDepartment of Education to spend only the bare minimum necessary to \noperate the grant program. Funds flow directly from the Federal \nGovernment to local school districts.\n  I present this legislation knowing that education improvement is \ngoing to be one of the predominant themes in the 107th Congress. An \nimportant part of this theme is the discussion about how to make our \nschools more accountable. These discussions are centered around \nproposals by the President, my colleagues, Senators Bayh and Lieberman, \nand others. Accountability must be a part of our education debate, and \nI look forward to participating in those efforts.\n  But even as we pursue that goal, we must make sure that all our \npublic school students are learning in modern facilities, with skilled \nteachers, in classrooms with an appropriate number of well disciplined \nstudents.\n  To achieve these goals, we need a greater Federal investment in \neducation. Families wanting to provide a better future for themselves \nand their children know the wisdom of investing in a home, a savings \naccount, or a pension plan. It is a lesson worth noting as we ponder \nthe future of public education. To shortchange America's children not \nonly disheartens educators, parents, and communities, it violates our \nnational interests and the vision that has marked us as a people.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to consider this legislation designed \nto strengthen student achievement by promoting quality classrooms all \nacross America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 342\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a demonstration project to authorize the \nintegration and coordination of Federal funding dedicated to the \ncommunity, business, and economic development of Native American \ncommunities; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, though there are glimmers of hope in \nNative communities, most Native Americans remain racked by \nunemployment, mired in poverty, and rank at or near the bottom of \nnearly every social and economic indicator of well-being that is \ntallied.\n  For years the Committee on Indian Affairs has made strengthening \nIndian economies a top priority. Healthy tribal economies and lower \nunemployment rates are imperative if tribes are to achieve the goals of \nself-sufficiency and true self-determination.\n  Although federal economic development assistance has been available \nfor years, poverty, ill-health, and unemployment remain rampant on most \nIndian reservations.\n  One reason for the lack of success, despite spending billions of \ndollars promoting Indian economic development, is the absence of a \nconsistent and consolidated federal mechanism that targets development \nresources to the areas and projects that are most promising. Indian \nbusiness, economic, and community development programs span the entire \nfederal government and for any given project undertaken by a tribe \nthere may be 6 to 8 or more agencies involved. This fragmentation and \nlack of coordination is not producing the kind of results Indian \ncountry so badly needs.\n  To begin to remedy this problem, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation that builds on the most successful federal Indian policy to \ndate, Indian self-determination, and seeks to expand the principles of \nself-determination, and seeks to expand the principles of self-\ndetermination to the economic development realm.\n  The Indian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act of 1975 \nauthorizes Indian tribes and tribal consortia to ``step into the \nshoes'' of the federal government to administer programs and services \nhistorically provided by the United States.\n  This act has worked as it was intended and has resulted in improved \nefficiency of program delivery and service quality; increased tribal \nadministrative acumen; better managed tribal institutions; stronger \ntribal economies; and a positive and healthy shift away from federal \ncontrol over Indian lives to more flexible decision making and local \ncontrol.\n  What began as a demonstration project in 1975 has blossomed into an \nevery-increasing number of tribal governments that have come to realize \nthe benefits of self-governance.\n\n[[Page S1472]]\n\n  As of 1999, nearly 48 percent of all Bureau of Indian Affairs, BIA, \nand 50 percent of all Indian Health Service, IHS, programs and services \nhave been assumed by tribes pursuant to Indian Self-Determination Act \ncontracts and compacts.\n  The legislation I introduce today will launch the second phase of the \nself-determination experiment by assisting Indian tribes in their use \nand maximization of existing resources for purposes of economic \ndevelopment.\n  By authorizing tribes and tribal consortia to consolidate and target \nexisting funds for development purposes, this bill will promote a more \nefficient use of those resources. Perhaps more importantly, this \nlegislation will lay the foundation for a coordinated development \nstrategy that looks to employment creation, investment and improved \nstandards of living in Indian country rather than how much money is \nspent by the federal government as the real measure of a successful \ndevelopment policy.\n  One goal of this bill is to eliminate inconsistencies and duplication \nin federal policies that continue to be a barrier to Indian development \nthrough the issuance of uniform regulations and policies governing the \nuse of funds across agencies.\n  Similar to the demonstration project that will be authorized by this \nbill is the 477 Program which was created by Public Law 102-477. Under \nthe 477 Program, tribes are eligible to consolidate all federally \nfunded employment training and related services into a single, fully \nintegrated program. This integration promotes tribal flexibility and \nefficiency, and has been one of the few successes in federal Indian \neconomic development.\n  By authorizing federal-tribal arrangements to combine and coordinate \nresources, this bill will make the best use of existing programs to \nassist tribes in attracting private investment and capital into Indian \nreservations.\n  In the 106th Congress, the Committee on Indian Affairs held a hearing \non an almost identical version of this bill. At the hearing, the \ncommittee received testimony strongly supporting the type of \nconsolidation and coordination of federal resources represented in this \nlegislation.\n  I am hopeful that the legislation introduced today will signal a new \nday for how the federal government assists Native communities in \ncreating jobs and building a better future for their members.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 343\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TITLE.\n\n       The Act may be cited as the ``Indian Tribal Development \n     Consolidated Funding Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) A unique legal and political relationship exists \n     between the United States and Indian tribes that is reflected \n     in article I, section 8, clause 3 of the Constitution, \n     various treaties, Federal statutes, Supreme Court decisions, \n     executive agreements, and course of dealing.\n       (2) Despite the infusion of substantial Federal dollars \n     into Native American communities over several decades, the \n     majority of Native Americans remain mired in poverty, \n     unemployment, and despair.\n       (3) The efforts of the United States to foster community, \n     economic, and business development in Native American \n     communities have been hampered by fragmentation of authority, \n     responsibility, and performance, and by lack of timeliness \n     and coordination in resources and decision-making.\n       (4) The effectiveness of Federal and tribal efforts to \n     generate employment opportunities and bring value-added \n     activities and economic growth to Native American communities \n     depends on cooperative arrangements among the various Federal \n     agencies and Indian tribes.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purpose of this Act are to--\n       (1) enable Indian tribes and tribal organizations to use \n     available Federal assistance more effectively and \n     efficiently;\n       (2) adapt and target such assistance more readily to \n     particular needs through wider use of projects that are \n     supported by more than 1 executive agency, assistance \n     program, or appropriation of the Federal Government;\n       (3) encourage Federal-tribal arrangements under which \n     Indian tribes and tribal organizations may more effectively \n     and efficiently combine Federal and tribal resources to \n     support economic development projects;\n       (4) promote the coordination of Native American economic \n     programs to maximize the benefits of these programs to \n     encourage a more consolidated, national policy for economic \n     development; and\n       (5) establish a demonstration project to aid Indian tribes \n     in obtaining Federal resources and in more efficiently \n     administering those resources for the furtherance of tribal \n     self-governance and self-determination.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st \nCentury to make certain amendments with respect to Indian tribes; to \nthe Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to be introducing a bill \nthat provides needed clarifications in the law to improve the \nadministration of both the Indian Reservation Roads Program and the \nIndian Reservation Road Bridge Program to better meet the \ntransportation needs in native communities.\n  There is still an enormous need for physical infrastructure on Indian \nlands throughout the country. This infrastructure is necessary for \nIndian tribes and their citizens to carry out emergency services, law \nenforcement, and the transportation of goods and services.\n  Good transportation is fundamental to attracting private investment \nand enterprise into Native communities. When entrepreneurs or investors \nare calculating whether to invest in a community they first look to see \nif the basic building blocks exist within the community. Roads, \nhighways, electricity, potable water, and other amenities are critical \nfactors that investors look to before making their investment \ndecisions.\n  For Indian communities, efficient and effective federal road \nfinancing and construction are one factor leading to healthy economies \nand higher standards of living.\n  In 1998 Congress enacted the Transportation Equity Act of the twenty-\nfirst century, ``TEA-21,'' to authorize federal surface transportation \nprograms with the goals of improved highways, increased safety, \nprotecting the environment, and increased economic growth.\n  In passing TEA-21, Congress approved several Indian provisions that I \nwas proud to have sponsored. One important provision required \nnegotiated rule-making to develop an allocation formula that is both \nflexible and fair in addressing the needs of all Indian communities \nthroughout the country. Another provision provided that all Indian \nreservation road monies under TEA-21 are eligible for tribes to \ncontract and compact under the Indian Self-Determination and Education \nAssistance Act of 1975, P.L. 93-638, as amended.\n  In the 106th Congress, the Committee on Indian Affairs held two \nhearings on the Indian reservation roads program and TEA-21. From \ntestimony and other evidence presented, it is evident that there remain \nserious obstacles to a more efficient functioning of TEA-21 in Indian \ncommunities. I am sorry to say that one of the obstacles appears to be \nthe administration of the program by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, BIA, \nitself.\n  Although reservation roads comprise 2.63 percent of the federal \nhighway system, less than 1 percent of federal aid has been allocated \nto Indian roads. This bill would remove the so-called ``obligation \nlimitation'' contained within TEA-21 and would allow the already-\nauthorized funds for Indians to reach the intended beneficiaries. In \nfiscal year 2001, imposition of the obligation limitation diverted $34 \nmillion from the Indian Reservation Road program.\n  This bill also authorizes the Federal Lands Highway Program, FLHP, to \nestablish a pilot program in which up to 12 tribes may, in their \ndiscretion, contract directly with the FLHP for the administration of \ntheir roads programs. The dual goals of this pilot program are to \npromote a more efficient use of existing resources, and to further the \npolicy of Indian self-determination.\n  Under current law, the BIA is authorized to use ``up to 6 percent'' \nof roads funding for oversight and administration of the Indian roads \nprogram. If it was not clear in 1998, it should be clear now that these \nfunds are not intended to be available to subsidize other BIA roads \noperations nor are they intended to be used for other BIA purposes.\n  The bill I am introducing today contains a provision that clarifies \nthe ``up to 6 percent'' language by reiterating Congress' intent that \nthe figure was and is intended as a maximum, not a minimum, funding \nlevel with regard to the BIA's administrative costs.\n  This bill also clarifies that tribes who are administering their \nIndian reservation roads program under Public Law 93-638 are authorized \nto receive the monies that the BIA would have used to administer these \ntribes' roads programs. Because tribes that are either ``638'' \ncontractors or compactors have assumed the BIA's administrative \nfunctions, it is unnecessary for the BIA to withhold either \nadministrative or project related funding from these tribes.\n  Finally, this bill seeks to eliminate the redundancy that is \ncurrently required in the health and safety certification process by \nallowing tribes to meet statutorily required health and safety \nstandards without the need for a second, duplicative effort by the BIA. \nIt is important to note that the standards themselves will not change, \nnor will the need for tribal compliance with those standards change.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 344\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 3 of title 28, United States Code, to \ndivide the Ninth Judicial Circuit of the United States into two \ncircuits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nStevens, Burns, Craig, Crapo, Inhofe, and Gordon Smith in introducing \nthe Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Reorganization Act of 2001. While \nthis bill is not the first attempt to solve the crisis of the Ninth \nCircuit, I believe the need for change has never been greater. The \nNinth Circuit has grown so large, and has drifted so far from prudent \nlegal reasoning, that sweeping change is in order.\n  Congress has already recognized that change is needed. In 1997, we \ncommissioned a report on structural alternatives for the federal courts \nof appeals. The Commission, chaired by former Supreme Court Justice \nByron R. White, found numerous faults within the Ninth Circuit. In its \nconclusion, the Commission recommended major reforms and a drastic \nreorganization of the Circuit.\n  This bill will divide the Ninth Circuit into two independent \ncircuits. The new Ninth Circuit would contain Arizona, California, and \nNevada. A new Twelfth Circuit would be composed of Alaska, Hawaii, \nIdaho, Montana, Oregon, Washington, Guam, and the Northern Mariana \nIslands. Immediately upon enactment, the concerns of the White \nCommission will be addressed. A more cohesive, efficient, and \npredictable judiciary will emerge.\n  In this debate, let us not forget why change is in order. The Ninth \nCircuit extends from the Arctic Circle to the Mexican border, spans the \ntropics of Hawaii and across the International Dateline to Guam and the \nMariana Islands. Encompassing some 14 million square miles, the Ninth \nCircuit, by any means of measure, is the largest of all U.S. Circuit \nCourts of Appeal. It is larger than the First, Second, Third, Fourth, \nFifth, Sixth, Seventh and Eleventh Circuits combined!\n\n  The Circuit serves a population of more than 50 million people, \nalmost 60 percent more than are served by the next largest circuit. By \n2010, the Census Bureau estimates that the Ninth Circuit's population \nwill be more than 63 million. That's an increase of 13 million people \nin just 10 years! How many people does this court have to serve before \nCongress will realize that the Ninth Circuit is overwhelmed by its \npopulation?\n  As I noted before, legislation to split the Ninth Circuit is \ncertainly not novel. Since the day the Ninth Circuit was founded over a \ncentury ago, Congress has tinkered with the structure of the Circuit \nand has debated its split.\n  In 1866, Congress established a newly numbered Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals consisting of California, Nevada,\n\n[[Page S1476]]\n\nand Oregon. Congress included Montana, Washington, and Idaho in the \nCircuit at the time each gained statehood. The present Ninth Circuit \nwas completed by including Hawaii in 1911, Alaska in 1925, Arizona in \n1929, Guam in 1951 and the Northern Mariana Islands in 1977. During \nthis period of geographic expansion, Congress determined a split of the \nNinth Circuit to be inevitable; numerous proposals to divide the Ninth \nCircuit were debated in Congress since before World War II.\n  Congressional members were not alone in advocating a split. In 1973, \nthe Congressional Commission on the Revision of the Federal Court of \nAppellate System Commission, commonly known as the Hruska Commission, \nrecommended that the Ninth Circuit be divided. Also that year, the \nAmerican Bar Association adopted a resolution in support of dividing \nthe Ninth Circuit. The Hruska recommendation sparked controversy \nbecause it called for a Circuit division that split the state of \nCalifornia in half. Instead of that radical approach, Congress, in \n1978, created the en banc proceedings as an effort to streamline the \nNinth Circuit's docket. In 1990, the United States Department of \nJustice endorsed legislation to split the Ninth Circuit in a surprising \nreversal of the official ``no position'' approach it had previously \nassumed.\n  In 1995, a bill was reported from the Senate Judiciary Committee in \nwhich Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah declared in his Committee's report \nthat the time for a split had arrived:\n\n       The legislative history, in conjunction with available \n     statistics and research concerning the Ninth Circuit, \n     provides an ample record for an informed decision at this \n     point as to whether to divide the Ninth Circuit . . . Upon \n     careful consideration the time has indeed come.\n\n  Even more recently, Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy had \nstated his concerns regarding the size of the Ninth Circuit. Justice \nKennedy, a former member of the Ninth Circuit for twelve years, \ntestified before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, and stated that \nhe has ``increasing doubts about the wisdom of retaining, the Circuit's \ncurrent size.'' During a House subcommittee hearing, Justice Kennedy \nhad earlier voiced his reservations about the Circuit's size, saying \nthat it ``is larger than it ought to be,'' and he recommended ``looking \nvery hard'' at dividing the Circuit.\n  Arguments in support of dividing the Ninth Circuit are both \nqualitative and quantitative. The magnitude of case filings in the \nNinth Circuit creates a slow and cumbersome docket. Once a final brief \nis filed, it takes longer to receive a hearing or submission in the \nNinth Circuit than any other Circuit. And, from the time of a \nlower court filing to final disposition, the Ninth Circuit is the \nsecond slowest Circuit in the nation.\n\n  The Ninth Circuit's travel expenses are the largest in the federal \nsystem, and operating costs of the Ninth Circuit surpass the costs of \nall other Circuits. In 1990, Congress allocated to the Ninth Circuit 28 \nactive judges, which surpasses by twelve the second largest appellate \ncourt. This increase means that judicial travel expenses in 1996 were \nover double the amount of any other circuit. Additionally, support \nstaff of the Circuit is so large and unwieldy that one appellate judge \nfacetiously complained that it was ``impossible to determine who \nactually was assigned to clerk.''\n  The ever-expanding docket in the Ninth Circuit creates an inherent \ndifficulty in keeping abreast of legal developments within its own \njurisdiction, rendering inconsistency in Constitutional interpretation \nwithin the Court. Interestingly, the statistical opportunities for \ninconsistency on a 28 panel court calculates out to be 3,276 \ncombinations of panels that could resolve any given issue. Former \nOregon Senator Mark Hatfield expressed much concern about the growing \ninconsistency of the Ninth Circuit, stating that the ``increased \nlikelihood of intra- \ncircuit conflicts is an important justification for splitting the \ncourt.''\n  One only needs to review the appallingly high reversal rate of Ninth \nCircuit cases to appreciate the severity of the problem. For example, \nbetween the years 1990 and 1995, the Ninth Circuit's average rate of \nreversal was higher than any other circuit. During its 1995-1996 \nsession, the Supreme Court overturned an astounding 83% of the cases \nheard from the Ninth Circuit, a figure which is 30 percent higher than \nthe national average reversal rate. In the 1996-1997 session alone, an \nastounding 95% of its cases reviewed by the Supreme Court were \noverturned. This number should raise more than a few eyebrows. A split \nof the Circuit would enable a more complete and sound review, thereby \nreducing the Circuit's rate of reversal before the Supreme Court.\n  Many who oppose legislation to bifurcate the Ninth Circuit, contend \nthat all the Circuit needs is the appropriation of more federal dollars \nfor more federal judges. However, history reveals this contention to be \nfalse. In fact, Congressional increases in the number of judges have \nyielded few improvements. Studies on omnibus judgeships legislation \nconcluded that adding ``judges only delayed what appeared to be a \nnearly inexorable climb in appeals taken to the court'' and only served \nto further tax the judicial confirmation process.\n  As early as 1954, Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter warned that \nthe courts' growing business could not ``be met by a steady increase in \nthe number of federal judges'' because this increase was ``bound to \ndepreciate the quality of the federal judiciary and thereby adversely \naffect the whole system.'' Soon after Congress divided the former Fifth \nCircuit, former Senator and Alabama Supreme Court Chief Justice, Howell \nHeflin, a Democrat from Alabama, remarked that ``Congress recognized \nthat a point is reached where the addition of judges decreases the \neffectiveness of the court, complicates the administration of uniform \nlaw, and potentially diminishes the quality of justice within a \nCircuit.''\n  Former Oregon Senator Bob Packwood believed that a circuit split \nwould enable judges to achieve a greater mastery of applicable, but \nunique, state law and state issues. He believed such a mastery was \nnecessary because ``burgeoning conflicts in the area of natural \nresources and the continuing expansion of international trade efforts \nwill all expand the demand for judicial excellence . . . By reforming \nour courts now, they will be better able to dispense justice in a fair \nand expeditious manner.''\n  I concur. The uniqueness of the Northwest, and in particular, Alaska, \ncannot be overstated. An effective appellate process demands mastery of \nstate law and state issues relative to the geographic land mass, \npopulation and native cultures that are unique to the relevant region. \nPresently, California is responsible for almost 50 percent of the \nappellate court's filings, which means that California judges and \nCalifornia judicial philosophy dominate judicial decision on issues \nthat are fundamentally unique to the Pacific Northwest. This need for \ngreater regional representation is demonstrated by the fact that the \nEast Coast is comprised of five federal circuits. A division of the \nNinth Circuit will enable judges, lawyers and parties to master a more \nmanageable and predictable universe of relevant caselaw.\n  Further, a division of the Ninth Circuit would honor Congress' \noriginal intent in establishing appellate court boundaries that respect \nand reflect a regional identity. In spite of efforts to modernize the \nadministration of the Ninth Circuit, its size works against the \noriginal purpose of its creation: the uniform, coherent and efficient \ndevelopment and application of federal law in the region. Establishing \na circuit comprised solely of states in the Northwest region would \nadhere to Congressional intent. Alaska, Washington, Oregon, Hawaii, \nIdaho, and Montana share similar land bases, populations and economies. \nEach state contains a high percentage of public lands, fairly \ncomparable populations, is financially dependent upon tourism, and is \nblessed with an abundance of natural resources. A new Twelfth Circuit, \ncomprised of states of the Pacific Northwest, would respect the \neconomic, historical, cultural and legal ties which philosophically \nunite this region.\n  No one Court can effectively exercise its power in an area that \nextends from the Arctic Circle to the tropics. Legislation dividing the \nNinth Circuit will create a regional commonality which will lead to \ngreater uniformity and\n\n[[Page S1477]]\n\nconsistency in the development of federal law, and will ultimately \nstrengthen the constitutional guarantee of justice to all.\n  While I may believe even more sweeping change is in order, I strongly \nurge that this body address the crisis in our judiciary system. It is \nthe 50 million residents of the Ninth Circuit that suffer from our \ninaction. These Americans wait years before their cases are heard. And \nafter these unreasonable delays, justice may not even be served by an \nover-stretched and out of touch judiciary.\n  Congress has known about the problem in the Ninth Circuit for a long \ntime. Justice has been delayed too long. The time for reform has come, \nand I urge action on this bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of my bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 346\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Endangered Species Act of 1973 to improve \nthe processes for listing, recovery planning, and delisting, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Listing and \nDelisting Reform Act of 2001. The Endangered Species Act has become one \nof the best examples of good intentions gone astray, and so today I am \ntaking one small step toward injecting some common sense into what has \nbecome a regulatory nightmare. It is my intention to start making the \nlaw more effective for local landowners, public land managers, \ncommunities and state governments who truly hold the key to any \nsuccessful effort to conserve species. My legislation seeks to improve \nthe listing, recovery planning and delisting processes so that \nrecovery, the goal of the act, is easier to achieve.\n  In Wyoming, we have seen first hand the need to revise the listing \nand delisting processes of the Endangered Species Act. Listing should \nbe a purely scientific decision. Listing should be based on credible \ndata that has been peer-reviewed. Not long ago, the Prebles Meadow \nJumping Mouse was listed in the State of Wyoming. The listing process \nfor this mouse demonstrates how the system has gone haywire devoid of \ngood science. One of the more significant shortcomings of the Preble's \nRule relates to confusion about claims regarding the ``known range'' of \nas opposed to the alleged ``historical range.'' Historical data and \ncurrent knowledge do not support the high, short-grass, semi-arid \nplains for southeastern Wyoming as part of the mouse's historical \nhabitat range. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has even admitted to \nuncertainties regarding taxonomic distinctions and ranges. Further, the \nstate was not properly notified causing counties, commissioners, and \nlandowners all to be caught off guard. Such poor practices do not \nfoster the types of partnerships that are required if meaningful \nspecies conservation is to occur. Clearly, changes are desperately \nneeded to the Endangered Species Act.\n  Not far behind the mouse in Wyoming, was the black tailed prairie \ndog. Petitions to list the prairie dog were being filed with the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service. I've lived in Wyoming most of my life, and \nI've logged a lot of miles on the roads and highways in my state over \nthe years. I can tell you from experience that there is no shortage of \nprairie dogs in Wyoming. Any farmer or rancher will concur with that \nopinion. This petition, and countless other actions throughout the \ncountry, makes it painfully clear that some folks are intent on \ncompletely eliminating activity on public lands, no matter what the \ncost to individuals or local communities that rely on the land for \neconomic survival.\n  My legislation will require the Secretary of the Interior to use \nscientific or commercial data that is empirical, field tested and peer-\nreviewed. Right\n\n[[Page S1478]]\n\nnow, it's basically a ``postage stamp'' petition: any person who wants \nto start a listing process may petition a species with little or no \nscientific support. This legislation prevents this absurd practice by \nestablishing minimum requirements for a listing petition that includes \nan analyses of the status of the species, its range, population trends \nand threats. The petition must also be peer reviewed. In order to list \na species, the Secretary must determine if sufficient biological \ninformation exists in the petition to support a recovery plan. Under my \nproposal, states are made active participants in the process and the \ngeneral public is provided a more substantial role.\n  This legislation requires explicit planning and forethought with \nregard to conservation and recovery at the time the species is listed. \nLet me be clear about the intent of this requirement. I do not question \nthe basic premise that some species require the protection of the \nEndangered Species Act. However, listing a species can cause hardship \non a community. For that reason, it is critically important and only \nreasonable that every listing be supported by sound science. We should \nbe sure of the need for a listing before we ask the members of our \ncommunities and private landowners to make sacrifices.\n  In the past in my State of Wyoming, I have found that with several \nlistings, the Secretary of the Interior was unable to tell me what \nmeasures were required to achieve species recovery. The Secretary could \nnot tell me what acts or omissions we could expect to face as a \nconsequence of listing. How can this be, if the Secretary is fully \napprized of the status of the species? Conversely, if the Secretary \ncannot clearly describe how to reverse threatening acts to a species so \nthat we can achieve recovery, how can we be sure that the species is, \nin fact, threatened?\n  This ambiguity has caused much undue frustration to the people of \nWyoming. If the Secretary believes that certain farming or ranching \npractices, or the diversion of a certain amount of water, or a private \ncitizen's development of one's own property, is the cause for a \nlisting, then the Secretary should identify those activities that have \nto be curtailed or changed. If the Secretary does not have enough \ninformation to indicate what activities should be restricted, then why \nlist a species? Why open producers and others to the burden of over-\nzealous enforcement and even litigation without being able to achieve \nthe goal of recovering the species?\n  This legislation is ultimately designed to improve the quality of \ninformation used to support a listing. If the Secretary knows enough to \nlist a species, he should know enough to tell us what will be required \nfor recovery. That should be the case under current law, and that is \nall that this provision would require.\n  Just as the beginning of the process needs changes, we need to revise \nthe end of the process the de-listing procedure. Recovery and delisting \nare quite simply, the goals of the Endangered Species Act. Yet, it is \nvirtually impossible to currently de-list a species. There is no \ncertainty in the process and the states the folks who have all the \nresponsibility for managing the species once it is off the list are not \ntrue partners in that process. Once the recovery plan is met, the \nspecies should be de-listed.\n  Wyoming's experience with the grizzly bear pinpoints some of the \nproblems with the current de-listing process. The Interagency Grizzly \nBear Committee set criteria for recovery and in the Yellowstone \necosystem, those targets have been met, but the bear has still not been \nremoved from the list. We've been battling the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService for years over this one to no avail, despite tremendous effort \nand financial resources to meet recovery objectives. Despite rebounded \npopulations, we keep funneling money down a black hole.\n  The point is something needs to be done. My constituents, rightly so, \nare angry and upset about this current law and the trickling effects of \ncountless listings. Real lives are being impacted. It is time for some \nreal changes. These are small changes but I believe they will make big \nimpacts. The changes I've suggested will have a significant affect on \nthe quality of science, public participation, state involvement, speed \nin recovery and finally the delisting of a species. Species that truly \nneed protection will be protected, but let's not lost sight of the real \ngoal recovery and delisting.

A bill to amend the Small Business Act to extend the \nauthorization for the drug-free workplace program; to the Committee on \nSmall Business.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Drug-\nFree Workplace Program Extension Act of 2001. This important \nlegislation will reduce the number of employees who engage in substance \nabuse while on the job and will thus directly improve worker safety. As \nemployee substance abuse declines, there will be a corresponding \ndecline in the number of drug-related fatalities, injuries, and lost \nworkdays. Workers who abuse substances not only hurt themselves, but \ntheir coworkers as well.\n  Approximately 1,000 workers are currently being injured and killed \neach year as a direct result of their own and their coworkers' \nsubstance abuse. Prior to 1993, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, BLS, \nreported that toxicological reports for occupational fatalities \nindicated that one-sixth of the nation's workers who died on the job \nwere under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance. \nUnfortunately, the true extent of this problem is not definitively \nknown as a result of the Department of Labor's decision to order the \nBLS to discontinue the tracking of this statistic. In the meantime, we \ncan commit to providing additional funding to enhance drug-free \nworkplace programs.\n  The Drug-Free Workplace Program Extension Act of 2001 would simply \namend the Small Business Act, SBA, to authorize another $10 million, $5 \nmillion each, in fiscal years 2004 and 2005 for grants to states and \nnon-profit organizations working with small businesses to promote drug-\nfree workplaces. I ask my colleagues to join me in this simple, non-\npartisan attempt to enhance the safety of American workers and I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 348\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

PROGRAM EXTENSION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 27(g)(1) of the Small Business Act \n     (15 U.S.C. 654(g)(1)) is amended by striking ``2003'' and \n     inserting ``2005''.\n       (b) Small Business Development Centers.--Section \n     21(c)(3)(T) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. \n     648(c)(3)(T)) is amended by striking ``2003'' and inserting \n     ``2005''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Smith of Oregon, \n        Mr. Thomas, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. \n        Johnson):\n  S. 349. A bill to provide funds to the National Center for Rural Law \nEnforcement, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues \nSenator Harkin, Senator Gordon Smith, and Senator Thomas to introduce \nthe Rural Law Enforcement Assistance Act of 2001. This important \nlegislation will authorize the funding necessary to ensure that rural \nlaw enforcement agencies are able to secure the technical assistance, \neducation, and training they need.\n  As in my home state of Arkansas, many rural law enforcement agencies \nare comprised of a handful of officers and don't have the financial \nresources to provide them with crucial technical assistance, education, \nand training. However, the need for these services is greater than ever \nas these officers are increasingly facing violent crimes that were once \nconfined to urban settings. When one considers the fact that ten \nofficers in 100,000 die in the line of duty each year in rural counties \nand communities with a population less than 25,000, as contrasted with \nseven in 100,000 in the largest cities, this legislation becomes \nnecessary.\n  I am very proud that, under the leadership of Dr. Lee Colwell, the \nformer\n\n[[Page S1480]]\n\nAssociate Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National \nCenter for Rural Law Enforcement in Little Rock, Arkansas has taken the \nlead in addressing this problem. Since 1985, the Center has been \nproviding the technical assistance, education, and training that rural \nlaw enforcement agencies so critically need. For instance, the Center \nis currently providing Internet access, forensic science education and \ntraining, and model management and investigative policies to rural law \nenforcement agencies throughout the nation. Its effectiveness is \nreadily apparent as it is strongly supported by law enforcement \nagencies located in the following 40 states: Alabama; Alaska; Arizona; \nArkansas; California; Connecticut; Delaware; Florida; Georgia; \nIllinois; Indiana; Iowa; Kentucky; Louisiana; Maine; Maryland; \nMichigan; Minnesota; Mississippi; Missouri; Montana; Nebraska; Nevada; \nNew Jersey; New York; North Carolina; North Dakota; Ohio; Oklahoma; \nOregon; Pennsylvania; South Carolina; South Dakota; Tennessee; Texas; \nUtah; Vermont; Virginia; Wisconsin; and Wyoming.\n  The Rural Law Enforcement Assistance Act of 2001 will establish eight \nregional centers to compliment the Center and thereby expand the \ntechnical assistance, education, and training available to local law \nenforcement agencies throughout our nation. Thus, I ask my colleagues \nto join with me as I work to see that this important measure is enacted \ninto law and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 349\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Comprehensive Environmental Response, \nCompensation, and Liability Act of 1980 to promote the cleanup and \nreuse of brownfields, to provide financial assistance for brownfields \nrevitalization, to enhance State response programs, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I introduce the Brownfields \nRevitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of 2001. Together with \nChairman Bob Smith, Senators Harry Reid, and Barbara Boxer, and other \nmembers of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I am \nreintroducing the popular bipartisan legislation that I co-authored in \nthe 106th Congress. That bill eventually amassed sixty-six co-sponsors \nand I look forward to the bill enjoying the same strong bipartisan \nsupport it did last year.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Superfund Subcommittee, I have made \nbrownfields reform my top environmental priority. As one of six former \nmayors in the Senate, I understand the environmental, economic, and \nsocial benefits that can be realized in our communities from \nrevitalizing brownfields. Estimates show there to be between 450,000 \nand 600,000 brownfield sites in the United States. Why do we have so \nmany of these abandoned sites? The shift away from an industrialized \neconomy, the migration of land use from urban areas to suburban and \nrural areas, and our nation's strict liability contamination statutes \nhave all contributed. By enacting this legislation, we can recycle our \nnation's contaminated land, reinvigorate our urban cores, stimulate \neconomic development, revitalize blighted communities, abate \nenvironmental health risks, and reduce the pressure to develop pristine \nland.\n  People may legitimately question the necessity of enacting federal \nbrownfields legislation. Given the frequent touting of brownfield \nsuccess stories, is federal legislation necessary? The short answer is \n``yes''. While many states have implemented innovative and effective \nbrownfield programs, they cannot remove the federal barriers to \nbrownfield redevelopment. By providing federal funding, eliminating \nfederal liability for developers, and reducing the role of the federal \ngovernment at brownfield sites, we will allow state and local \ngovernments to improve upon what they are already doing well.\n  I would like to briefly describe the highlights of our legislation. \nThe bill authorizes $150 million per year to state and local \ngovernments to perform assessments and cleanup at brownfield sites. In \naddition, that money will allow EPA to issue grants for cleanup of \nsites to be converted into parks or open space. It also authorizes $50 \nmillion per year to establish and enhance state brownfield programs. \nThe bill clarifies that prospective purchasers, innocent landowners, \nand contiguous property owners, that act appropriately, are not \nresponsible for paying cleanup costs. Finally, this legislation offers \nfinality by precluding EPA from taking an action at a site being \naddressed under a state cleanup program unless there is an ``imminent \nand substantial endangerment'' to public health or the environment, and \nadditional work needs to be done.\n  Enactment of this legislation and the accompanying redevelopment will \nprovide a building block for the revitalization of our communities. \nCommunities whose fortunes sank along with the decline of mills and \nfactories will once again attract new residents and well-paying jobs. \nWe will bring vibrant industry back to the brownfield sites that \ncurrently host crime, mischief and contamination. There will be parks \nat sites that now contain more rubble than grass. City tax rolls will \nburgeon; schools will be invigorated; new homes will be built, and \ncommunity character will be restored. This vision for our communities \ncan be realized with enactment of this legislation.\n  As with all legislation, we must reach across the aisle and work with \nbipartisan cooperation to be successful. The legislation we are \nintroducing today garnered sixty-six bipartisan co-sponsors in the \n106th Congress. It also enjoyed broad support from the real estate \ncommunity, local government officials, state officials, business \ngroups, and environmental groups. I hope that the bill will continue to \nattract such broad support in the 107th Congress. I would like to thank \nChairman Bob Smith, and Senators Harry Reid and Barbara Boxer for their \nleadership on this issue and their steadfast commitment to moving this \nlegislation forward. I look forward to working with all my colleagues \nand with the Administration on this very important measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of \nsupport be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 350\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The mayors believe \n     that this legislation can dramatically improve the nation's \n     efforts to recycle abandoned and other underutilized \n     brownfield sites, providing new incentives and statutory \n     reforms to speed the assessment, cleanup and redevelopment of \n     these properties.\n       This is a national problem that deserves a strong and \n     prompt federal response. The mayors believe that this \n     bipartisan legislation will help accelerate ongoing private \n     sector and public efforts to recycle America's land.\n       We thank you for your leadership on this priority \n     legislation for the nation's cities. We strongly support this \n     legislation and we encourage you to move forward \n     expeditiously so that the nation can secure the many positive \n     benefits to be achieved from the reuse and redevelopment of \n     the many thousands of brownfields throughout the U.S.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               H.

NAR \n     commends you for your efforts in crafting a practical and \n     effective bill which has garnered bipartisan support from the \n     leadership of the Senate Environment and Public Works \n     Committee.\n       NAR supports this bill because it:\n       Provides liability relief for innocent property owners who \n     have not caused or contributed to hazardous waste \n     contamination;\n       Increases funding for the cleanup and redevelopment of the \n     hundreds of thousands of our nation's contaminated \n     ``brownfields'' sites;\n       Recognizes the finality of successful state hazardous waste \n     cleanup efforts.\n       Brownfields sites offer excellent opportunities for the \n     economic, environmental and social enrichment of our \n     communities. Unfortunately, liability concerns and a lack of \n     adequate resources often deter redevelopment of such sites. \n     As a result, properties that could be enhancing community \n     growth are left dilapidated, contributing to nothing\n\n[[Page S1487]]\n\n     but economic ruin. Once revitalized, however, brownfields \n     sites benefit their surrounding communities by increasing the \n     tax base, creating jobs and providing new housing.\n       The new Administration has clearly indicated its support \n     for brownfields revitalization efforts. The ``Brownfields \n     Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act'' is a \n     positive, broadly-supported policy initiative. NAR looks \n     forward to working together with you to enact brownfields \n     legislation in the 107th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Richard Mendenhall,\n     2001 President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               American Insurance Association,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 2001.\n     Senator Lincoln D. Chafee,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste Control, Risk \n         Assessment, Senate Committee on Environment and Public \n         Works, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the American Insurance \n     Association, I want to congratulate you upon the introduction \n     of the Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental \n     Restoration Act.\n       We believe this bill will provide necessary relief to many \n     cities struggling with the problem of abandoned, contaminated \n     properties. While insurance is now emerging as one of the \n     most useful tools for managing environmental liability risk \n     in the redevelopment of contaminated properties, insurance \n     products alone are not enough. The predicament for many \n     cities is that they don't have the resources to address the \n     brownfields problem, but they can't develop the resources \n     without addressing the brownfields problem. Your bill is a \n     giant step toward resolving this conundrum.\n       In sum, we believe this bill constitutes a positive step \n     toward cleaning up hazardous waste sites. We are especially \n     happy to observe that the bill does this through a mechanism \n     other than litigation. Finally, we are pleased to note the \n     bill is the product of a bipartisan consensus of the \n     leadership of the Senate Environment Committee.\n       We look forward to working with you to see that this \n     legislation becomes law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                John G.

This legislation is \n     very important to the development community as it promotes \n     the cleanup and reuse of brownfields, provides financial \n     assistance for brownfields revitalization and helps to \n     provide incentives to put unused industrial sites back into \n     productive use.\n       NAIOP, with over 9,400 members, is a national association \n     that represents the interests of developers, owners and \n     investors of industrial, office and related commercial real \n     estate throughout North America. We applaud the efforts of \n     the Committee to once again encourage brownfields \n     revitalization.\n       With respect to brownfields, NAIOP is encouraged by the \n     grant program proposed in the bill and supports federal \n     assistance to states in establishing and expanding voluntary \n     clean up programs. These provisions demonstrate a serious \n     attempt toward achieving much-needed brownfields \n     revitalization, which is a primary concern to the commercial \n     real estate industry.\n       All across the country there is debate about how to control \n     urban sprawl. We believe that this legislation will go \n     further to address the issue of sprawl, especially since it \n     will encourage the revitalization of our nations urban areas.\n       NAIOP urges swift passage of this bill, and we look forward \n     to working with you to achieve this result.\n           Sincerely,\n     Anne Evans Estabrook,\n       Chairman of the Board.\n     Thomas J. Bisacquino,\n       President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          International Council of\n\n\n                                             Shopping Centers,\n\n                                Alexandria, VA, February 13, 2001.\n     Hon. Lincoln D. Chafee,\n     Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Chafee: The International Council of Shopping \n     Centers (ICSC) strongly commends your plans to introduce the \n     ``Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration \n     Act of 2001.'' Along with your co-sponsors, you have \n     displayed critical leadership on a public policy issue to \n     often caught up in partisan rhetoric. ICSC enthusiastically \n     supports the legislation, as we did last year with S. 2700, \n     and looks forward to working with you and your staff to \n     ensure its passage.\n       Shopping centers are America's marketplace, representing \n     economic growth, environmentally responsibility, and \n     community strength. Founded in 1957, the ICSC is the global \n     trade association of the shopping center industry. Its nearly \n     35,000 U.S. members represent almost all of the 44,426 \n     shopping centers in the United States. In addition, shopping \n     centers employ over 11 million people, about nine percent of \n     non-agricultural jobs in the United States. Legislation such \n     as the ``Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental \n     Restoration Act of 2001'' will allow center developers to \n     further step-up their efforts to assist in the redevelopment \n     of urban areas in their continuing efforts to enhance the \n     environmental and economic quality of America's cities.\n       The 2001 Act will provide practical solutions to many of \n     the issues developers confront when debating the merits of \n     brownfields redevelopment. Provisions providing liability \n     relief for innocent property owners who have not caused or \n     contributed to hazardous waste contamination; increased \n     funding for the cleanup and redevelopment of the hundreds of \n     thousands of the country's brownfields sites; and, \n     recognition that sites remediated under the authority of \n     state voluntary clean up laws should constitute final action \n     are all vital to encouraging development in sites that may \n     otherwise be left abandoned.\n       The targeted reforms you have focused on will result in \n     greater infill development and enhance the urban landscape. \n     The 2001 Act will not only spur economic development but also \n     improve environmental quality throughout the country. ICSC \n     looks forward to working with you in the coming months in \n     support of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          William H. Hoffman, III,\n     Manager, Environmental Issues.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   The Real Estate Roundtable,\n\n                                                February 14, 2001.\n     Hon. Lincoln D. Chafee,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste Control and Risk \n         Assessment, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Chafee: I am writing on behalf of the Real \n     Estate Roundtable to express our members' enthusiastic \n     support for ``The Brownfields Revitalization and \n     Environmental Restoration Act of 2001'' (BRERA). This \n     important legislation would make welcome reforms to the \n     Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and \n     Liability Act or ``Superfund'' law.\n       Last year's similar legislation achieved an astonishing \n     degree of bipartisan support--picking up a total 67 co-\n     sponsors and broad support from a diverse array of \n     environmental, state and local government and business \n     organizations. Today we believe there is a great \n     opportunity--with help from the Bush Administration--to move \n     BRERA quickly through Congress and to the president's desk \n     for signature. In that regard, we have been heartened by the \n     strong signal of support for this type of bill sent by \n     President Bush during his campaign for the presidency. As \n     indicate by her remarks during her confirmation hearings, \n     Administrator Christine Todd Whitman will also clearly be an \n     ally.\n       There are brownfields in every state--and almost every \n     community--in this country. If enacted into law, BRERA would \n     significantly advance the economic prospects for remediating \n     and recycling those properties into a broad range of \n     productive uses. The economic and regulatory incentives \n     included in the bill would help thousands of brownfield sites \n     across the country become vibrant new employment centers. In \n     other cases, the clean-up properties would provide many \n     communities with environmentally sound housing alternatives.\n       As you know, The Real Estate Roundtable's members are \n     America's leading real estate owners, advisors, builders, \n     investors, lenders and managers. The Real Estate Roundtable \n     (and its predecessor organization the National Realty \n     Committee) has long supported enactment of bipartisan \n     legislation that includes meaningful incentives for \n     brownfields redevelopment. BRERA is clearly just such a piece \n     of legislation.\n       In particular, the proposed legislation would go far in \n     assuring those parties purchasing already contaminated \n     ``brownfields'' properties that they have not also acquired \n     unwarranted Superfund liability. Such assurance is critical \n     to successfully financing and closing on brownfields \n     transaction. In addition, we are pleased the bill recognizes \n     the need to clarify the innocence of those individuals or \n     companies whose real property has become contaminated simply \n     because hazardous substances have migrated from adjacent \n     sites.\n       The legislation also includes a provision that will, in \n     most cases, reassure participants in state voluntary cleanup \n     programs that their state-approved cleanup is not likely to \n     be ``second-guessed'' by federal officials. This so-called \n     ``finality'' assurance is crucial not only to potential \n     buyers and sellers of brownfields properties but to their \n     financial partners as well. The bill presents a welcome \n     compromise on a very difficult policy challenge.\n\n[[Page S1488]]\n\n       We look forward to working with you, other Senate leaders \n     and the Administration to encourage the swift passage of \n     BRERA.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Jeffrey D.

We \n     appreciate your outstanding efforts to promote local \n     environmental quality, as typified by your energetic advocacy \n     of this brownfields legislation.\n       TPL was honored to be part of the coalition that helped to \n     push this legislation to the brink of enactment at the end of \n     the 106th Congress, and we again look forward to working with \n     you to make this legislation a reality within the near \n     future. We are particularly grateful that you have re-\n     introduced identical legislation this time around.\n       Given our experience in community open-space issues, we are \n     heartened by the emphasis the legislation places on \n     brownfields-to-parks conversion where appropriate, and its \n     flexibility to tailor loan and grant funding based on \n     community needs and eventual uses. In all, this legislation \n     provides the framework and funding that an effective national \n     approach to brownfields requires, and offers the promise of a \n     much-needed federal partnership role in brownfields \n     reclamation.\n       Brownfields afford some of the most promising \n     revitalization opportunities from our cities to more rural \n     locales. This legislation will serve to help meet the \n     pronounced needs in underserved communities to reclaim \n     abandoned sites and create open spaces where they are most \n     needed. By transforming these idled sites into urgently \n     needed parks and green spaces, or by focusing investment into \n     their appropriate redevelopment, reclamation of brownfield \n     properties brings new life to local economies and to the \n     spirit of neighborhoods.\n       The Trust for Public Land gratefully recognizes the vision \n     and careful craftsmanship you have shown in your work to \n     advance this vital legislation, and we look forward to \n     working with you towards its enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Alan Front,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Institute of Scrap\n\n\n                                   Recycling Industries, Inc.,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 2001.\n     Hon.

Barbara Boxer,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste Control and \n         Risk Assessment, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Smith Reid, Chafee and Boxer: The Institute \n     of Scrap Recycling Industries, Inc. (ISRI), strongly supports \n     the passage of the Brownfields Revitalization and \n     Environmental Restoration Act of 2001. Passage of this \n     bipartisan bill will reduce the many legal and regulatory \n     barriers that stand in the way of brownfields redevelopment.\n       This important brownfields legislation will provide \n     liability relief for innocent property owners who purchase a \n     property without knowing that it is contaminated, but who \n     carry out a good faith effort to investigate the site. It \n     also recognizes the finality of successful state approved \n     voluntary cleanup efforts and provides funds to cleanup and \n     redevelop brownfields sites.\n       ISRI stands ready to help build support for passage of this \n     bipartisan brownfields bill. In the previous Congress, ISRI's \n     membership worked to build grassroots support and sought \n     cosponsors for S. 2700 of the 106th Congress, the predecessor \n     bill to the Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental \n     Restoration Act of 2001.\n       ISRI looks forward to continuing to work with you to see \n     that the brownfields bill you have sponsored becomes law. We \n     believe that the Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental \n     Restoration Act of 2001 is a model for sensible bipartisan \n     environmental policy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robin K.

Lincoln Chafee,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste Control and Risk \n         Assessment, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste Control and \n         Risk Assessment, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Smith, Chairman Chafee, Senator Reid, and \n     Senator Boxer: We are writing to thank you for the \n     outstanding leadership you have demonstrated by your re-\n     introduction of the Brownfields Revitalization and \n     Environmental Restoration Act of 2001. Our organizations, and \n     our many community partners across America, are heartened by \n     the benefits that this legislation would impart upon our \n     landscapes, economies, public parks and our communities as a \n     whole. Transforming abandoned brownfield sites into \n     greenfields or new development will provide momentum for \n     increasing ``smart growth'' and reducing sprawl by utilizing \n     existing transportation infrastructure, which in turn will \n     lead to better transportation systems and the revitalization \n     of historic areas and our urban centers.\n       As you are well aware, brownfields pose some of the most \n     critical land-use challenges--and afford some of the most \n     promising revitalization opportunities--facing our nations' \n     communities, from our cities to more rural locales. \n     Revitalization of these idled sites into urgently needed \n     parks and green spaces or into appropriate redevelopment will \n     provide great benefits to our neighborhoods and local \n     economies. In the process, it has also proven to be an \n     extremely powerful too in local efforts to control urban \n     sprawl by directing economic growth to already developed \n     areas, encouraging the restoration and reuse of historical \n     sites, and in addressing longstanding issues of environmental \n     justice in underserved areas.\n       We acknowledge the commitment that the Environmental \n     Protection Agency and other federal agencies have \n     demonstrated to brownfields restoration through existing \n     programs. At the same time, given that there are estimated \n     450,000-600,000 brownfield properties nationwide, we \n     recognize that these limited resources have been stretched \n     too far to allow for an optimal federal role. Additional \n     investment, at higher levels and in new directions, is \n     essential to meeting the enormous backlog of need and to \n     establishing the truest federal partnership with the many \n     state, local, and private entities working to renew \n     brownfield sites.\n       The Brownfield Revitalization and Environmental Restoration \n     Amendments Act of 2001 would provide this much needed federal \n     response. Through our work with local governments, our \n     organizations have witnessed first-hand--and have often \n     worked as a partner to help create--the benefits that this \n     bill would provide. We are particularly gratified by the \n     emphasis your legislation places on brownfields-to-parks \n     conversion, and the flexibility its provides to tailor \n     funding based on a community's a particular needs. In all, \n     this bill provides the framework and funding that an \n     effective national approach to brownfields will require.\n       Accordingly, we appreciate your vision in developing this \n     legislation, and we look forward to working with you towards \n     its enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n         The Trust for Public Land; Scenic America; American \n           Planning Association; The Enterprise Foundation; \n           National Association of Regional Councils; Smart Growth \n           America; Surface Transportation Policy Project; \n           National Recreation and Park Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            Environmental Business\n\n\n                                             Action Coalition,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 14, 2001.\n     Hon.

EBAC endorses this bipartisan effort and will work \n     with you to secure its passage this year.\n       EBAC is an organization of nearly thirty-five environmental \n     engineering, scientific and construction firms representing \n     over 60,000 professional, managerial and support personnel in \n     the hazardous waste cleanup field. Our companies are the \n     experts in environmental cleanup, including Superfund and \n     brownfields nationwide.\n       The Brownfields Revitalization and Environment Restoration \n     Act of 2001 would provide the much-needed ``finality'' for \n     states that already have successful cleanup programs. In \n     addition, the measure would provide critically needed \n     financial support for assessment and cleanup of brownfields. \n     Finally, the proposal's liability reforms will go a long way \n     in returning to productive use these abandoned sites \n     burdening communities across the country.\n       While EBAC supports these provisions and believe they will \n     make important contributions to the redevelopment of \n     countless abandoned properties nationwide, we strongly urge \n     you to expand the liability reform provisions contained in \n     this legislation to include protections for Response Action \n     Contractors (RAC's) form the Superfund law's unfair liability \n     scheme. This will greatly increase the resources available \n     for cleanups across the country. Similarly, we urge you to \n     support the use of professional engineering judgment that \n     will increase program efficiency as opposed to imposing \n     nationwide ASTM standards on site cleanups. These ``one-size-\n     fits-all'' dictates will needlessly complicate efforts by \n     creating legal uncertainty for professionals addressing the \n     inherently unique characteristics of contaminated sites.\n       EBAC appreciates your hard work in drafting this important \n     legislation. We are committed to working closely with you to \n     move this measure to enactment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Jeremiah D.

Barbara Boxer,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Superfund, Waste Control and \n         Risk Assessment, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Smith, Chairman Chafee, Senator Reid and \n     Senator Boxer. Smart Growth America would like to thank you \n     for your leadership on the introduction the Brownfields \n     Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of 2001. A \n     broad coalition of elected officials, public and private \n     sector professionals, community groups, and environmentalists \n     have been championing the need for brownfields redevelopment \n     for many years. The U.S. Conference of Mayors recently \n     conducted a survey and found that across the country, 210 \n     cities are plagued with 21,000 industrial or commercial sites \n     whose redevelopment is hindered by environmental \n     contamination or sometimes just the perception of \n     contamination.\n       As advocates of smart growth--growth that revitalizes \n     neighborhoods, creates and preserves affordable housing, \n     promotes transportation choice, preserves scenic and historic \n     resources, and conserves open space and farmland--we regard \n     brownfields redevelopment as a top priority. Although we \n     support the bill, we are concerned that the bill may not \n     provide adequate protection of the environment and public \n     health in certain cases. We believe this would be unwise and \n     hope to work with you on appropriate amendments to the \n     language.\n       The primary obstacle to brownfields redevelopment has been \n     inadequate funding and liability issues for contiguous \n     landowners, prospective purchasers and innocent landowners. \n     This legislation addresses these issues and presents a \n     tremendous opportunity for communities to capitalize on their \n     untapped resources. The U.S. Conference of Mayors found that \n     176 cities estimated that between $878 million and $2.4 \n     billion annually could be generated by fully tapping into the \n     potential of brownfields sites. In addition, 189 cities \n     predict that 554,419 new jobs could be generated.\n       We believe the Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental \n     Restoration Act of 2001 will allow communities nationwide to \n     utilize their existing infrastructure to encourage economic \n     development, remove environmental and public health hazards, \n     promote neighborhood revitalization and preserve open space. \n     We support your efforts and look forward to working with you \n     to pass this truly groundbreaking legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n         Smart Growth America; National Trust for Historic \n           Preservation; Surface Transportation Policy Project; \n           Chesapeake Bay Foundation; Environmental Justice \n           Resource Center, Clark Atlanta University; Great \n           American Station Foundation, Center for Neighborhood \n           Technology; Scenic America; American Planning \n           Association; The Enterprise Foundation; National Center \n           for Bicycling and Walking; and Environmental & Energy \n           Study Institute.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, as chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee, I am pleased to join Senator \nReid, the ranking member of the Committee; Senator Chafee, the chairman \nof the Superfund Subcommittee; and Senator Boxer, ranking member of the \nSubcommittee, to introduce a bill that protects the environment, \nencourages community involvement, promotes economic redevelopment, \nprovides incentive for the preservation of green spaces, and sets the \nstage for future comprehensive Superfund reform.\n  As a nation, our industrial heritage has left us with numerous \ncontaminated abandoned or underutilized ``brownfield'' sites. Although \nthe level of contamination at many of these sites is relatively low, \nand the potential value of the property may be quite high, developers \noften shy away from redeveloping these sites. Behind their reluctance: \nuncertainty regarding the level of contamination, the extent of \npotential liability, or the likely costs of cleanup.\n  The Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of \n2001 addresses the uncertainty that has long plagued developers, \nproperty owners, and communities seeking to make use of these otherwise \ndesirable sites. This bill is identical to a bill we introduced last \nyear, a bill that had the overwhelming support of 67 cosponsors, but \nunfortunately never saw floor time.\n  How is our bill better than current law? Simply stated, our bill \nprovides an element of finality which does not exist today, while \nallowing for federal involvement under a specific universe of \nconditions. Our bill strikes a solid balance on the issue of finality \nbetween so-called ``Republican bills'' and ``Democratic bills'' \nchampioned in previous years with no bipartisan support. Furthermore, \nour bill provides authorization for critically needed funds to assess \nand clean up brownfield sites, which will create jobs, increase tax \nrevenues, and preserve and create open space and parks. This is a \nbalanced bill. If you never had a chance to review it last year, do so \nnow. This year, we are determined to move this bill through the \nprocess--and quickly. Senator Reid and I have committed to marking up \nthis bill in early March, and we hope to have floor time soon \nafterwards.\n  There are an estimated 450,000 brownfield sites in the United States. \nThese are low risk sites, not the traditional Superfund sites that \nwould be impacted by comprehensive Superfund reform. However, if States \nand citizens continue to be discouraged form cleaning up brownfield \nsites, these sites will never be redeveloped, and may in fact become \nSuperfund sites. While I strongly believe that comprehensive Superfund \nreform is needed, I feel that we can move forward with brownfield \nlegislation without compromising our chances for comprehensive reform.\n  As brownfield sites are outside of the scope of Superfund, I believe \nthat liability carve-outs are outside of the scope of any brownfield \nlegislation. As I have done in the past, I continue to oppose narrow \ncarve-outs. Carve-outs weaken attempts at overhauling the remedy \nselection and liability allocation provisions in the current Superfund \nstatute and, frankly, make a bad system worse. Our brownfield \nlegislation does not affect the allocation of liability at Superfund \nsites; instead, it provides needed resources to address sites, provides \ncertainty to those who voluntarily cleanup, and prevents brownfields \nfrom being included in the superfund web. Brownfield legislation \npresents a win-win for all involved and should jumpstart action on \nsubstantive Superfund reform.\n  Let me just say that last year, the Congress made a bold move in \napproving bipartisan legislation to restore the Florida Everglades. One \nof the proudest moments of my Senate career was witnessing the signing \ninto law of that landmark environmental legislation. I want to use the \nEverglades model--cooperation, partnership, bipartisanship--as an \nexample of what Congress can do when it puts aside personal politics \nfor good policy. No one thought we'd get Everglades to the President's \ndesk in a presidential election year, but we proved them wrong. \nPessimists\n\n[[Page S1490]]\n\nhave little faith that an equally divided Senate will accomplish more \nthan partisan bickering. Let's prove them wrong, too, by committing to \nenact brownfield legislation in the first session of this Congress. By \ndoing so, not only do we demonstrate to a skeptical nation that \nbipartisan cooperation is possible, but once again, the environment \nwins.\n  Our bill represents a carefully negotiated compromise, and as is the \nnature of a compromise, both sides had to give a little to reach common \nground. Now that we stand together on that common ground, let's not \nundermine our widespread support by trying to bring the bill farther to \nthe left or to the right. The Brownfield Revitalization and \nEnvironmental Restoration Act of 2001 is a strong bill and represents \nour best chance of addressing the issues plaguing brownfield sites. I \nurge your support for this bill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bi-partisan \nlegislation to cleanup American's brownfields. I am joined by my \ncolleagues from the Environment and Public Works Committee in \nintroducing this important legislation, Senators Chafee, Smith, Box, \nBaucus, Graham, Corzine, and Warner.\n  This is an exciting beginning to my tenure as the ranking member of \nthe Environment and Public Works--this bill which I hope will be \nenacted swiftly, has broad support on both sides of the aisle, and \nwhich is supported by environmentalists, realtors and the business \ncommunity.\n  What are brownfields? They are contaminated, abandoned sites that \nblight our communities, but also offer great promise for the future. \nthere are, according to the Conference of Mayors, over 450,000 \nbrownfields in the US, in every state of the union, and in both rural \nand urban areas. The Conference of Mayors has estimated that \nredeveloping these sites would create more than 587,000 jobs nationally \nand increase annual tax revenues from between $902 million to $2.4 \nbillion dollars.\n  So, it is clear that there are great benefits to be realized from \ncleaning up these sites. For example, in Las Vegas alone, there are \nroughly 30 brownfields sites. It is estimated that cleaning up these \nsits would generate between $1.6 and $4 million per year of additional \ntax revenues, and create an estimated 320 jobs.\n  Some think of brownfields cleanup as just an urban issue, but \nbrownfields can be found anywhere, even in our most rural areas. Their \ncleanup will have important economic benefits for rural America. For \nexample, Hawthorne, a small town in Nevada has limited private lands to \naccommodate the town's growth. To the west of the city, 240 acres of \nvaluable space have been used as a landfill for years. Nevada's \nbrownfield program completed the first contamination assessment and \ncompanies are already interested in developing the land.\n  Brownfields funding can be used to complete the assessment and \ncleanup of this valuable rural land, allowing the town to grow, provide \nnew jobs, and expand its tax base.\n  Let me give you another specific example of what we can do with \nbrownfields funding. The National Guard Armory site in Las Vegas was \nthe first site in the nation to be cleaned up under a loan from EPA's \nBrownfields Cleanup Revolving Loan Fund. This site had been used for a \nvariety of military purposes, including chemical storage. The cleanup, \nincluding removal of over 600 cubic yards of soil contaminated with \nhazardous waste and petroleum hydrocarbons, cost only $50,000, but \nfreed the site up for reuse. The city is making the site a community \ncenter with space for a senior center, a small business center, a \ncultural center and retail stores.\n  This bill will provide for many years more such success stories. With \nthis bill, we can begin to address in a significant way those 450,000 \nsites and help our neighborhoods and business thrive.\n  These blighted areas pose threats to human health and the \nenvironment, contributing to economic depression, crime and job loss. \nThey push new development into farmland and green spaces and cause \nsprawl, increasing driving time, traffic, congestion and air pollution.\n  The brownfields bill we are introducing today will directly spur such \ncleanup of these sites, in a number of ways.\n  It provides critically needed money to assess and clean up abandoned \nand underutilized brownfield sites.\n  It encourages cleanup and redevelopment of these properties, by \nproviding legal protections for innocent parties, such as contiguous \nproperty owners, prospective purchasers, and innocent landowners.\n  It provides for funding and expansion of state cleanup programs, and \nprovides ``certainty'' for developers, but still ensures protection of \npublic health and the environment.\n  Creating a public record of brownfield sites and enhances community \ninvolvement in site cleanup and reuse.\n  In conclusion, this bill has the support of a wide variety of groups, \nincluding environmentalists, mayors, businesses, and the real estate \ncommunity. We are fortunate enough to have an opportunity to do well by \nso many. I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact this \nlegislation this Congress and seeing the payoff in clean sites and new \njobs in communities across the country.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Subcommittee \non Superfund, Waste Control, and Risk Assessment, I am pleased to join \nmy colleagues in sponsoring the Brownfields Revitalization and \nEnvironmental Restoration Act--a very important piece of legislation.\n  Our nation's industrial history has left us with the unfortunate \nlegacy of tens of thousands of abandoned sites that are contaminated \nwith hazardous materials.\n  Unfortunately, many of these sites are located in low-income, \nminority communities. The result is that this toxic legacy \ndisproportionately impacts some of our most vulnerable and disempowered \npopulations.\n  For many of my constituents in places like Oakland, Anaheim, Long \nBeach, Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Diego, and Stockton these polluted \nareas--or so-called ``brownfields''--are a blight on the community. \nThey are dead zones that sit unused or only partially used, sometimes \nposing health hazards, sometimes merely eyesores.\n  The idea behind the Brownfields Initiative is that those areas of \nlight, or moderate, contamination should be restored for economic \nredevelopment, community use, or made into parks and greenways.\n  In Oakland, for instance, an abandoned industrial brownfield site is \ngoing to be transformed into a large-scale, mixed use development area. \nIt will include a pedestrian walkway, retail shops, child care \nfacilities, medical care facilities, a senior center, and a branch of \nthe Oakland Public Library.\n  I'm proud to note that two California sites, in East Palo Alto and \nLos Angeles, have been selected by the Environmental Protection Agency, \nEPA, to be ``Showcase Communities.'' These communities are at the \ncutting edge of the brownfields effort; their experiences will help us \nlearn how to bring together federal, state, local, and non-governmental \ninterests to address the brownfields problem. They will serve as a \nmodel for the rest of the Nation.\n  While EPA has made important strides in the development of the \nBrownfields Initiative, there is much more than could be done.\n  By authorizing increased funding for this program, clarifying some of \nthe liability questions, and directing the program to the areas of \ngreatest need, this legislation will help expand the scope of this \nprogram and elevate its visibility in the eyes of the American public.\n  This legislation helps us set right some of the mistakes that were \nmade in the past. And it illustrates what we have had to learn the hard \nway--that a prosperous economy and a healthy environment go hand in \nhand.\n  By cleaning up these contaminated brownfields, we can protect public \nhealth, while at the same time curbing the devastating impact of urban \nsprawl on our environment.\n  Encouraging the clean up of these contaminated properties will also \nmean new jobs and greater economic growth for the communities that need \nit most.\n  We owe it to our children to leave them an environment that is \ncleaner and healthier than the one we have inherited. This bill will \nhelp take us in that direction.\n\n[[Page S1491]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, brownfields are abandoned, idled, or under-\nused commercial or industrial properties where development or expansion \nis hindered by real or perceived environmental contamination. \nBusinesses located on brownfields were once the economic foundations of \ncommunities. Today, brownfields lie abandoned--the legacy of our \nindustrial past. These properties taint our urban landscape. \nContamination, or the perception of contamination, impedes brownfields \nredevelopment, stifles community development and threatens the health \nof our citizens and the environment. Redeveloped, brownfields can be \nengines for economic development. They represent new opportunities in \nour cities, older suburbs and rural areas for housing, jobs and \nrecreation. Today, Senator Smith, Senator Reid, Senator Chafee and \nSenator Boxer introduced the Brownfields Revitalization and \nEnvironmental Restoration Act of 2001. I support their efforts to \naddress this issue and I will co-sponsor the legislation.\n  As cochair of the Senate Smart Growth Task Force, I believe \nbrownfields redevelopment is one of the most important ways to \nrevitalize cities and implement growth management. The redevelopment of \nbrownfields, is one fiscally-sound way to bring investment back to \nneglected neighborhoods, cleanup the environment, use infrastructure \nthat is already paid for and relieve development pressure on our urban \nfringe and farmlands.\n  The State of Michigan is a leader in brownfields redevelopment--\noffering technical assistance and grant and loan programs to help \ncommunities redevelop brownfields. This legislation will compliment \nState and local efforts to successfully redevelop brownfields. The bill \nprovides much needed funding to State and local jurisdictions for the \nassessment, characterization, and remediation of brownfield sites. \nImportantly, the bill removes the threat of lawsuits for contiguous \nlandowners, prospective purchasers, and innocent landowners. \nCommunities must often overcome serious financial and environmental \nbarriers to redevelop brownfields. Greenfields availability, liability \nconcerns, the time and cost of cleanup, and a reluctance to invest in \nolder urban areas deters private investment. This bill will help \ncommunities address these barriers to redevelopment. Finally, the bill \nprovides greater certainty to developers and parties conducting the \ncleanup, ensuring that decisions under state programs will not be \nsecond- guessed. Public investment and greater governmental certainty \ncombined with private investment can provide incentives for \nredeveloping brownfield properties and level the economic playing field \nbetween greenfields and brownfields.\n  I believe the Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental \nRestoration Act of 2001 will do much to encourage commercial, \nresidential and recreational development in our nation's communities \nwhere existing infrastructure, access to public transit, and close \nproximity to cultural facilities currently exist. America's emerging \nmarkets and future potential for economic growth lies in our cities and \nolder suburbs. This potential is reflected in locally unmet consumer \ndemand, underutilized labor resources and developable land that is rich \nin infrastructure. In Detroit, the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment estimates that there is a $1.4 billion retail gap (the \npurchasing power of residents minus retail sales). In Flint, HUD \nestimates the retail gap to be $186 million and in East Lansing, $160 \nmillion. The redevelopment of brownfields will help communities realize \nthe development potential of our urban communities. It is a critical \ntool for metropolitan areas to grow smarter--allowing us to recycle our \nNation's land to promote continued economic growth while curtailing \nurban sprawl and cleaning up our environment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 351. A bill to amend the Solid Waste Disposal Act to reduce the \nquantity of mercury in the environment by limiting use of mercury fever \nthermometers and improving collection, recycling, and disposal of \nmercury, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today, along with Senator Kerry, I am \nintroducing the Mercury Reduction and Disposal Act of 2001. This bill \naddresses the very serious problem of mercury in the environment and \nmercury disposal. It takes special aim at one of the most common and \nwidely distributed sources of mercury, and that is mercury fever \nthermometers.\n  Mercury is a potent neurotoxin that is widespread in the environment \nand particularly harmful to developing children and pregnant women. In \nfact, a National Academy of Sciences report released last year \nattributed mercury exposure to birth defects and brain damage in up to \n60,000 newborn children each year.\n  Although mercury can be safe in an elemental form or in amalgamations \nsuch as dental fillings, mercury takes on a highly toxic organic form \nknown as methylmercury when it enters the environment. Methylmercury is \nalmost completely absorbed into the blood and distributed to all \ntissues, including the brain. This organic mercury can accumulate in \nthe food chain and become concentrated in some species of fish, posing \na health threat to those who consume them. For this reason, 40 States \nhave issued public health warnings advising certain individuals to \nrestrict or avoid consuming fish from certain affected bodies of water.\n  Mr. President, the largest sources of mercury in the environment \ninclude incinerated solid waste, powerplant emissions, and emissions \nfrom chlor-alkali plants, such as the now closed HoltraChem \nManufacturing Company in Orrington, ME.\n  About 50 tons of mercury are estimated to enter the environment from \nmedical and solid waste incinerators, about 45 tons from powerplant \nemissions, and a large but uncertain amount derives from chlor-alkali \nplants.\n  Of the 50 tons of mercury that enters the environment from medical \nand solid waste incinerators, mercury thermometers are one of the \nlargest, if not the largest, source. The EPA has estimated that mercury \nthermometers contributed approximately 17 tons of mercury to solid \nwaste per year in the early 1990s. Although this number may well be \ndeclining due to innovative efforts, such as those in towns like \nFreeport, ME--the first town in Maine to ban the sale of mercury fever \nthermometers--it is still a very large amount.\n  Mr. President, I have a mercury thermometer right here. It is very \nfamiliar to all of us. Many of us know from personal experience how \neasily it can be broken. I have broken a couple myself, and not \nrealizing the dangers of mercury back then, I used my hands to gather \nup the various beads of mercury and throw them away, not realizing the \ndanger I was creating.\n  In fact, in 1998, the American Poison Control Center received 18,000 \nphone calls from consumers who had broken mercury thermometers.\n  This one mercury thermometer contains about 1 gram of mercury. That \ndoes not sound like much, but let me tell you, despite its small size, \njust one of these thermometers per year contains enough mercury to \ncontaminate all of the fish in a 20-acre lake.\n  Let me repeat that. The mercury in one of these thermometers is \nsufficient to pollute a 20-acre lake.\n  The bill I am introducing today calls for a nationwide ban on the \nsale of mercury fever thermometers such as the one I just showed. It \nwill also provide grants for swap programs to help consumers exchange \nmercury thermometers for digital or other alternatives.\n  I have an example of an alternative right here. This is a digital \nthermometer. Digital thermometers like this one are easier to read, \nmuch quicker to use, they do not break easily, and, most important of \nall, they do not contain a toxic element such as mercury.\n  My bill will allow millions of consumers across the Nation to receive \nfree digital thermometers in exchange for their mercury thermometers. \nBy bringing mercury thermometers in for proper disposal, consumers will \nensure the mercury from their thermometers does not end up polluting \nour lakes and threatening our health. It will also reduce the risk of \nbreakage and contamination inside the home.\n  Another important component of my bill is the safe disposal of the \nmercury\n\n[[Page S1492]]\n\ncollected from thermometer exchange programs. My legislation directs \nthe EPA to ensure that the mercury is properly collected and stored to \nmake sure it is kept out of the environment and out of commerce. This \nmercury will not reenter the environment, and it will not be sent, for \nexample, to India, one of the largest manufacturers of mercury \nthermometers.\n  The mercury collected from thermometer exchange programs addresses \nonly one part of the problem. The other aspect is the global \ncirculation of mercury. When the HoltraChem chlor-alkali manufacturing \nplant in Orrington, ME, shut down last year, the plant was left with \nover 100 tons of unwanted mercury and no way to permanently dispose of \nit. In total, about 3,000 tons of mercury are held at similar plants \nacross the United States.\n  In addition, large amounts of mercury are still being mined around \nthe world. In 1999, Algeria mined 400 tons of virgin mercury and \nKyrgyzstan mined 600 tons. In total, approximately 2,000 tons of new \nmercury are mined every year. Moreover, the Department of Defense \ncurrently has a stockpile of over 4,000 tons of mercury it does not \nwant and does not know what to do with.\n  What can we do about these problems? What can we do about the \nsituation where some countries are still mining large amounts of an \nelement that is a known neurotoxin, while the United States and other \ncountries are doing their best to remove this extremely toxic element \nfrom the environment? How will the United States dispose of the huge \namounts of mercury at chlor-alkali plants and other no longer needed \nsources?\n  My legislation creates an interagency task force to address these \nvery issues. This task force will be chaired by the Administrator of \nthe Environmental Protection Agency and comprised of representatives \nfrom the States, other Federal agencies involved with mercury, and \npublic health officials.\n  Specifically, my bill directs this task force to find ways to reduce \nthe mercury threat to humans and the environment, to identify a long-\nterm means of disposing of mercury, and to address the excess mercury \nproblems from mines as well as from industrial sources.\n  In sum, this task force is directed to identify comprehensive \nsolutions to the global mercury problem. In one year, the mercury task \nforce will make recommendations to Congress for permanently disposing \nof mercury, for retiring mercury from chlor-alkali plants and other \nsources, and for reducing the amount of new mercury mined every year. \nAt that time, it will be up to Congress to act on their \nrecommendations.\n  In the meantime, this bill will make significant progress toward \nreducing one of the most widespread sources of mercury contamination in \nthe environment, something that many of us still have in our medicine \nchests at home, and that is the mercury fever thermometer.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his attention. I urge support and \ncosponsorship of my colleagues for this initiative.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 351\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mercury Reduction and \n     Disposal Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) mercury is a persistent and toxic pollutant that \n     bioaccumulates in the environment;\n       (2) according to recent studies, mercury deposition is a \n     significant public health threat in many States throughout \n     the United States;\n       (3) 40 States have issued fish advisories that warn certain \n     individuals to restrict or avoid consuming mercury-\n     contaminated fish from affected bodies of water;\n       (4) according to a report by the National Academy of \n     Sciences, over 60,000 children are born each year in the \n     United States at risk for adverse neurodevelopmental effects \n     due to exposure to methyl mercury in utero;\n       (5) studies have documented that exposure to elevated \n     levels of mercury in the environment results in serious harm \n     to species of wildlife that consume fish;\n       (6) combustion of municipal and other solid waste is a \n     major source of mercury emissions in the United States;\n       (7) according to the Mercury Study Report, prepared by the \n     Environmental Protection Agency and submitted to Congress in \n     1997, mercury fever thermometers contribute approximately 17 \n     tons of mercury to solid waste each year;\n       (8) the Governors of the New England States have endorsed a \n     regional goal of ``the virtual elimination of the discharge \n     of anthropogenic mercury into the environment'';\n       (9) mercury fever thermometers are easily broken, creating \n     a potential risk of dangerous exposure to mercury vapor in \n     indoor air and risking mercury contamination of the \n     environment; and\n       (10) according to the Environmental Protection Agency, the \n     quantity of mercury in 1 mercury fever thermometer, \n     approximately 1 gram, is enough to contaminate all fish in a \n     lake with a surface area of 20 acres.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to increase the authorization of appropriations for \nlow-income energy assistance, weatherization, and state energy \nconservation grant programs, to expand the sue of energy savings \nperformance contracts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nincrease the authorization for low-income energy assistance, \nweatherization and state energy conservation grants and to increase the \nenergy efficiency of federal facilities. I am offering this bill on \nbehalf of myself, Senator Daschle, and many of my colleagues.\n  Energy costs have been, and are expected, to remain especially high \nthis year. We have had a long period of economic growth, enabled in \npart by extremely low oil and natural gas prices. But, we are finally \nexperiencing the end of the excess capacity cushion that had kept the \nsystem functioning with low prices and relatively minor bumps along the \nway. Those extremely low oil and gas prices that consumers loved so \nmuch a few years ago devastated the domestic drilling industry. \nDrilling has recovered, so we will start seeing an impact on prices in \nthe coming months as those supplies find their way to market.\n  In the interim, unusually cold weather early in the winter has \nresulted in natural gas bills at least 70 percent-100 percent higher \nthan last year. Heating oil and propane prices correlate closely with \nnatural gas. Farmers, especially, are seeing huge increases in propane \nprices this winter and are looking at dramatically higher fertilizer \nprices this spring. Natural gas prices and tight generating capacity \nare driving up electricity prices around the country, and many people \nin the southern states with high air conditioning needs will be \nespecially hard hit this summer.\n  Applications for assistance have increased dramatically this year. \nMost states have already depleted the LIHEAP and Weatherization funds \nwe appropriated for this year. Many states have laws prohibiting \ncutting off heating supplies during the winter, but when those \nprohibitions expire in March or April, the seriousness of the situation \nfor low-income and working families will become harshly obvious. And \nassistance to low-income and working families for the summer cooling \nseason will be impossible at current levels.\n  Some will say we need to address these issues as part of some \ncomprehensive energy bill, yet to be written. I disagree.\n  We have immediate needs that cannot wait months, as we debate an \nideal\n\n[[Page S1494]]\n\nenergy policy. The Administration has told us it will not even have its \nproposal to us for another two months. Individuals, families and small \nbusinesses are suffering today from energy bills they cannot pay. This \nbill authorizes changes to the LIHEAP program to help alleviate the \nfinancial burdens in the near term. The bill also focuses attention \non investment in energy efficiency through the low income \nweatherization program, state conservation grants and the federal \nenergy management program. This bill covers needed changes to existing \nauthorizations. Next we need to ensure that full funding is forthcoming \nas soon as possible.\n\n  Specifically, the base authorization for the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program to $3.4 billion for fiscal years 2001 to 2005. The \nbase funding has been relatively flat at roughly $2 billion since the \nmid-1980's. This increase comes close to addressing the erosion in the \nprogram due to inflation, but does not take into consideration the \nincrease in population.\n  The bill provides states with additional flexibility on the income \nlevel for recipients, by increasing eligibility from 150 percent to 200 \npercent of the poverty level. This change, which only applies for the \nremainder of this fiscal year, will give the states the flexibility to \nhelp working families.\n  The bill also increases the authorization for the weatherization \nprogram to $310 million. The current appropriation is at $162 million, \ndown from $300 million in the mid-1980s. The weatherization program is \na long term investment in energy efficiency.\n  A one-time investment in weatherization yields savings of $300-$470 \nper household annually thereafter. The program requires trained staff, \nerratic and insufficient funding of the program has diminished its \neffectiveness in recent years. Increased energy efficiency is the least \ncost solution to meeting energy needs. Even at $310 million the program \nis still lower in real dollars than in the 1980's.\n  The bill increases the authorization for grants to state energy \nprograms to $75 million. This program funds state conservation and \nemergency planning. The low level of funding in recent years has \ndiminished the states' ability to implement state level conservation \nplans and to plan for emergencies in coordination with the Department \nof Energy and neighboring states.\n  Finally, Executive Order 13123 requires federal facilities to \nincrease energy efficiency by 30 percent by 2005 and 35 percent by 2010 \nrelative to 1985. The Federal Energy Management Program requires \nfederal facility managers to evaluate opportunities for energy and \nwater efficiency improvements and opportunities for siting renewable \nprojects. Federal agencies spend $4 billion per year to heat, coal and \npower facilities, we can and should do better.\n  The bill includes several amendments to the program clarifying and \nenhancing the use of alternative financing tools to minimize the need \nfor additional government outlays. The bill calls for a concerted \neffort by facility managers to meet those targets early, thereby saving \ntaxpayer dollars, reducing stress on the power grid and demand for \nfuels.\n  Companion measures, that I support, have been introduced by Senator \nKerry, S. 295, Senator Feinstein, S. 286, to provide emergency loans to \nsmall businesses.\n  There will be plenty of time in this Congress to consider the highly \ncomplex issues of U.S. energy supply and consumption. Senator Murkowski \nand I intend to proceed with a series of hearings to evaluate the \ndifferent elements of our energy policy and systems. We need to focus \non how we can ensure adequate fuel supplies and sufficient \ninfrastructure to deliver those fuels, whether electricity, natural \ngas, or gasoline without degradation of environmental quality. We also \nneed to look at issues of supply diversity and efficiency. Those \nefforts will require some time on the part of the Congress and the \nAdministration, in consultation with the states and the various \nstakeholders.\n  We should not allow that lengthy process, though, to prevent us from \nmeeting clear and present needs. I urge my colleagues to support \nimmediate passage of this bill and the small business bills.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n\n                                 S. 352\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Energy \nEmergency Response Act of 2001, which will help low-income residents \ncope with high energy costs brought on by the crisis in California. I \nthank Senator Bingaman and others on the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources for their leadership in preparing this valuable \nlegislation. The current crisis in energy supply and costs is a crucial \nand immediate problem for the people of Washington state. I am working \non several fronts to help alleviate these effects.\n  The Energy Emergency Response Act of 2001 authorizes increased \nfunding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, LIHEAP. The \nprogram is a lifeline to many of our most vulnerable people, providing \ndirect assistance to eligible households to pay for home energy. \nBecause of the energy crisis, applications for LIHEAP assistance in \nWashington state have increased by more than 50 percent this year. We \nneed to bolster the program, or it will fall short at a time when low-\nincome people need it the most.\n  This bill also authorizes increased funding for the Weatherization \nProgram that provides insulation for Washington state homes, educates \nfamilies on energy conservation, tests furnaces and ovens for safety \nand efficiency, and makes homes safer and healthier places to live. An \naverage household saves 20 percent in fuel and energy costs every year \nas a result of participating in the Weatherization program. In these \ntimes of soaring energy costs, those savings are especially important. \nThat is why this bill authorizes increased funding and raises the \neligibility to 200 percent of the poverty level.\n  The bill requires Federal facility managers to evaluate opportunities \nto increase efficiency of energy and water use and installation of \nrenewable energy projects at federal facilities. It also requires that \nthe evaluation period be followed by implementation of energy and water \nsavings within the 180 days.\n  Energy Savings Performance Contract usage is enhanced by this bill. \nThese are innovative financing methods that leverage private sector \ninvestment and expertise to accomplish energy savings and cost savings \nin federal facilities. The bill amends the Federal Energy Management \nProgram to include savings realized from operation and maintenance \nefficiencies.\n  This bill also authorizes a total of $75 million for state energy \nconservation. This is for energy efficiency and emergency planning at \nthe state level. The bill also clarifies the definition of energy \nsavings to include water conservation, excluding Federal hydroelectric \nfacilities.\n  We are going to push for the funding of this bill to be appropriated \nthrough a special supplemental appropriation for 2001, adding $1 \nbillion to base funding for LIHEAP, $152 million for weatherization, \nand $37 million for state energy conservation grants. We will also \nattempt to get forward funding for LIHEAP for 2002.\n  I will be working with the Washington State delegation, Senator \nBingaman, and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to move this \nbill and to push for funding as soon as possible. The energy crisis \nwill not be resolved easily, but we can and should make this investment \na part of our overall response to this issue. I urge my colleagues to \nmove quickly on this legislation, and I hope that the President will \nmake LIHEAP a priority in his upcoming budget.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Domenici, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Gramm, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Sessions, and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 353. A bill to provide that a certification of the cooperation of \nMexico with United States counterdrug efforts not be required in fiscal \nyear 2001 for the limitation on assistance for Mexico under section 490 \nof the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 not to go into effect in that \nfiscal year, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will begin to reform our relationship with Mexico, particularly as \nit relates to our partnership in fighting drugs. I am pleased to be \njoined in this effort by Senators Dianne Feinstein, Pete Domenici, Phil \nGramm, Jon Kyl, and Jeff Sessions, who are cosponsoring the legislation \nI will introduce today.\n  As you know, President Bush will visit Mexico on February 16th. He \nwill hold a one day summit with Mexico's new President Vicente Fox. \nImproving cooperation between our two countries in the war on drugs \nwill figure prominently on the President's agenda when he meets with \nPresident Fox.\n  Now is the time that we take the right first step in our mutual \nefforts to stop the flow of drugs into the United States through \nMexico.\n  Last year, the Senate passed a resolution expressing a Sense of the \nSenate that the incoming new governments in both Mexico and the United \nStates must develop and implement a counter-drug program that more \neffectively addresses illegal drug trafficking.\n  The resolution stated that a one-year waiver of the requirement that \nthe President certify Mexico is warranted to permit both new \ngovernments time to implement such strategies and programs.\n  The legislation I am offering today again provides that a waiver is \nappropriate for this year. It also directs that a long term solution be \nfound to the massive drug problem.\n  As you know, by March 1, after just six weeks in office, President \nBush will be required to re-certify to Congress that Mexico is making \nprogress in the war on drugs.\n  Forcing a confrontation so soon on the most important issue that we \nface with Mexico will serve neither country, and it will not loosen the \ngrip that the drug culture has on both of our societies and economies.\n  Our bill will authorize a one-year waiver for Mexico from the annual \ncertification process. The various reports and assessments prepared by \nthe Department of State, the Department of Justice, or the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy will still be required.\n  The legislation will simply eliminate the requirement that the \nPresident in effect ``grade'' Mexico's performance in this area a scant \n12 weeks after a new Mexican President has taken office.\n  Our legislation also takes another important step. It asks the \nPresident, no later than June 30, 2001, to develop and submit to \nCongress, a strategic plan outlining proposed efforts to increase \ncooperation between our two countries in the fight against drugs.\n  We need proposals on both sides of the border that will combat drug \ngangs; money laundering; drug smuggling and any other items the \nPresident believes should be addressed.\n  It seems to me that we must look for a comprehensive solution to this \nproblem. We must look beyond the certification process--that in many \nways is broken.\n  The strategic plan called for in this resolution should serve as the \nbeginning of a new effort in the war against drugs.\n  We have two new leaders who are committed to tackling this problem. \nThis bill is a good first step for building on the new relationship. I \nsubmit\n\n[[Page S1496]]\n\nthis to the Senate. I hope that we can consider this measure soon.\n  I want to say about the new leader of Mexico that he is taking a very \npositive approach and I think an aggressive one.\n  It was reported on February 2 of this year in the Washington Post in \na by-line that has the Mexico City date line that the new head of \nMexico's customs agency has fired more than 90 people, including \nvirtually every manager, in the first major purge of government \nofficials since President Fox took office in December.\n  Forty-five out of the customs department's 47 supervisors were fired \non corruption issues. In addition, in the first month of this year 150 \ntractor-trailers containing contraband were stopped by the Mexican \ncustoms office. Last year, for the entire year, 38 tractor-trailers \nwere stopped for contraband merchandise.\n  That is a good sign. That is a sign that President Fox is going to \nmake good on his promise to purge the corruption out of the system. We \napplaud him. That is why I think we should give him a chance to sit \ndown with President Bush and work out a cooperative plan, one that is \nnot punitive or unilateral but one that is cooperative. It will be in \nthe best interest of both our countries to stop the cancer of drug \ntrafficking. It is a cancer on both of our societies. The criminal \nelement in Mexico certainly takes away from the productivity of that \ncountry. The criminal element that has arisen in the United States that \nis preying on our children certainly must be stopped.\n  I hope we can have an expedited action on this bill because I think \nwe can do some good. I intend to talk to our majority leader and the \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee to see if we can agree on \nsomething that will stop this decertification. Let's sit down and do \nsomething that will produce the results that both of our countries \nwant.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 354. A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to \ninclude additional information in social security account statements; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bicameral piece \nof legislation with my colleague Representative DeMint ensuring that \nevery American worker is provided with honest information about the \nfinancial status of the Social Security program, including the real \nvalue of their personal retirement benefits. It is our obligation to \ntalk straight with working Americans about the true financial status of \nthe Social Security program.\n  Under the current system, hard working Americans--young and old--are \nnot receiving straight, honest information regarding the actual \nfinancial status of the Social Security program, including how much it \nis receiving in payroll taxes and how much is needed to give promised \nbenefits to seniors. It is our obligation to ensure that all Americans \nare provided with accurate information regarding exactly when the \nSocial Security program will no longer have sufficient funds for paying \nfull benefits.\n  Furthermore, we must begin providing working Americans with accurate, \neasy to understand information regarding the average rate of return \nthey can expect to receive from Social Security as compared to the \namount of taxes an individual pays into the program. It is only fair to \nbe straight with everyone and let them know the true facts about how \nmuch they will pay in payroll taxes and what the limited return will be \non their contributions.\n  Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to once again remind \nmy colleagues of the very precarious financial condition of the entire \nSocial Security system and the urgent need for a serious, bipartisan \neffort to reform and revitalize this cornerstone of many Americans' \nretirement planning.\n  The only way to achieve real reform of the Social Security system is \nto work together in a bipartisan manner. It's time to abandon the \nirresponsible game of playing partisan politics with Social Security. \nDemocrats will have to stop using the issue to scare seniors into \nvoting against Republicans. Republicans will have to resist using \nSocial Security revenues to finance tax cuts. And both parties must \nstop raiding the Trust Funds to waste retirement dollars on more \ngovernment spending. We must face up to our responsibilities, not as \nRepublicans or Democrats, but as elected representatives of the \nAmerican people with a common obligation to protect their interests.\n  We have an obligation to ensure that Social Security benefits are \npaid as promised, without putting an unfair burden on today and \ntomorrow's workers. It is time for us to talk straight to Americans \nabout Social Security and begin working together in a bipartisan \nfashion to make the necessary changes to strengthen and save the \nnation's retirement program for the seniors of today and tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 354\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin commemoration of the contributions of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., \nto the United States; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill which \nis long overdue. February is a particularly appropriate time to \nintroduce this legislation, the Martin Luther King, Jr. Commemorative \nCoin Act of 2001, as this month we celebrate Black History Month.\n  Historian Carter G. Woodson began what was first called Negro History \nWeek in 1926 when he realized schools were not teaching children about \nthe history and achievements of black Americans. Now, for one month out \nof every year, we focus on the contributions of African-Americans \nduring Black History Month. However, celebrations of the history and \nculture of black Americans should not be limited to just one month. By \nrecognizing the history of black Americans every day of the year, we \nbuild the respect and perspective necessary to face the challenges \nbefore us.\n  During the 1960s, a young and gifted preacher from Georgia gave a \nvoice to the voiceless by bringing the struggle for freedom and civil \nrights into the living rooms of all Americans. Dr. Martin Luther King, \nJr. raised his voice rather than his fists as he helped lead our nation \ninto a new era of tolerance and understanding. He ultimately gave his \nlife for this cause, but in the process brought America closer to his \ndream of a nation without racial divisions.\n  It has been said that, ``Those who do not understand history are \ncondemned to repeat it.'' America's history includes dark chapters--\nchapters in which slavery was accepted and discrimination against \nAfrican-Americans, women and other minorities was commonplace. It is in \nacknowledgment of that history, and in honor of Dr. King's bright \nbeacon of hope, which has lead us to a more enlightened era of civil \njustice, that I introduce the Martin Luther King, Jr. Commemorative \nCoin Act of 2001.\n  This bill would instruct the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin commemoration of Dr. King's contributions to the United States. \nRevenues from the surcharge of the coin would be used by the Library of \nCongress to purchase and maintain historical documents and other \nmaterials associated with the life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther \nKing, Jr.\n  As we start the 21st century, I cannot think of a better way to honor \nthe civil and human rights legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n  Today, Dr. King's message goes beyond any one group, embracing all \nwho have been denied civil or human rights because of their race, \nreligion, gender, sexual orientation, or creed. This Congress, as well \nas previous Congresses, has taken important steps to put these beliefs \ninto civil code.\n  However, upholding Dr. King's dream is a continuing struggle. As a \nsociety, we must always remember Dr. King's message, ``that one day \nthis nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: \n`We hold these truths to be self-evident; that all men are created \nequal.' ''\n  Dr. King's majestic and inspiring voice as he made this speech will \nremain in our collective memory forever. His writings and papers \ncompliment the visual history of his legacy. Keeping Dr. King's papers \navailable for public access will serve to remind us of what our country \nonce was, and how a solitary voice changed the path of a nation. It \nalso would be a constant reminder of the vigilance needed to ensure we \nnever return to such a time.\n  This legislation has been developed in consultation with the King \nfamily, the Library of Congress, the Citizens Commemorative Coin \nAdvisory Committee, and the U.S. Mint. Similar legislation has been \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by the chairman of the House \nBanking and Financial Services Committee, Congressman Jim Leach of \nIowa.\n  Although African-Americans have played a vital role in our nation's \nhistory, African-Americans were included on only 4 out of 157 \ncommemorative coins:\n  Jackie Robinson who broke baseball's color barrier and brought about \na cultural revolution with the courage and dignity in which he played \nthe great American pass time, and the way he lived his life;\n  Booker T. Washington who founded Tuskegee Institute in Alabama and \nserved as a role model for millions of African-Americans who thought a \nformal education would forever be outside of their grasp;\n  George Washington Carver whose scientific experiments began as a way \nto improve the lot in life of sharecroppers, but ended up \nrevolutionizing agriculture throughout the South; and\n  The Black Revolutionary War Patriots, a commemorative half-dollar \nwhich recognized the 275th anniversary of the birth of Crispus Attucks, \nwho was the first revolutionary killed in the Boston Massacre.\n  The Martin Luther King, Jr. Commemorative Coin will give us an \nopportunity to recognize the valuable contributions of all Americans \nwho stood and were counted during our nation's civil rights struggle.\n  Americans such as the late Reverend Avery C. Alexander, a patriarch \nof the New Orleans' civil rights movement. He championed anti-\ndiscrimination, voter registration, labor rights, and environmental \nregulations as a six-term state legislator and as an advisor to \nGovernor Morrison of Louisiana in the 1950s.\n  Heroes such as Dr. C.O. Simpkins of Shreveport, Louisiana, whose home \nwas bombed simply because he dared to stand by Dr. King and demand that \nthe buses in Shreveport be integrated, and Reverend T.J. Jemison of \nBaton Rouge--a front-line soldier and good friend of Dr. King who \nhelped coordinate one of the earliest boycotts of the civil rights \nmovement.\n  Louisiana also was fortunate enough to have elected leaders such as \nmy father Moon Landrieu and Dutch Morial, both former mayors of New \nOrleans during those turbulent times. They led the way when the \npersonal and political stakes were very high.\n  These are just a few of the great civil rights leaders from my state. \nHowever, throughout Louisiana and all across America thousands of \ncitizens--black and white, young and old, rich and poor--listened to \nDr. King, followed his voice and dreamed his dreams. It is in memory of \nall of our struggles that I introduce this bill.\n  The great Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza said, ``If you want the \npresent to be different from the past, study the past.'' This \nlegislation not only ensures we are able to preserve and study our \npast, but also honors Dr. King, who played such an integral role in \nshaping both our present and our future. Most importantly, this coin \nwould serve as a reminder every day of the year, not just during Black \nHistory Month, of the great contributions of Dr. King and all black \nAmericans who have shaped this nation's history and future.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 355\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., \n     Commemorative Coin Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I am pleased to be an original cosponsor \nof S. 355, the Martin Luther King Jr. Commemorative Coin Act.

His was a long, tumultuous journey and his vision of equality \nis one that touched the lives of so many people around this country, \nincluding my own.\n  I will continue to do all I can to assure that we preserve his legacy \nfor generations to come. It is my hope that this commemorative coin \nwill become a collector's treasure and that its popularity will help us \npreserve the timeless and poignant story of Dr. King and the civil \nrights movement for our children.\n  Dr. King spoke these words in his final sermon on the day before he \ndied in 1968:\n\n       Let us rise up tonight with a greater readiness. Let us \n     stand with a greater determination. And let us move on in \n     these powerful days, these days of challenge, to make America \n     what it ought to be.\n\n  I hope that every American who holds one of these commemorative coins \nin their hands will remember Dr. King's powerful message.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mrs. Lincoln, and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 356. A bill to establish a National Commission on the Bicentennial \nof the Louisiana Purchase; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I rise, along with Senators \nLincoln, Breaux, and Carnahan, to introduce a bill to establish a \nNational Commission on the Bicentennial of the Louisiana Purchase. This \nlegislation has particularly special meaning to Senators from Louisiana \nbecause the site of the actual transfer of the Louisiana Purchase in \n1803, the Cabildo, is a building still located in Jackson Square in New \nOrleans.\n  The bicentennial of the Louisiana Purchase, which occurs in 2003, \nmarks an event that more than any other, determined the character of \nour national life--determined that we should be a great expanding \nnation instead of a relatively small and stationary one.\n  For only $15 million, three cents an acre, a remarkable bargain, all \nor part of 14 states were created out of vast territory acquired in the \nLouisiana Purchase, virtually doubling the size of the United States. \nThe largest peaceful land transaction in history, the Purchase opened \nthe heartland of North America for exploration, settlement and \nachievement to the people of the United States and immigrant from \naround the world.\n  It made possible the travels of Lewis and Clark, whose invaluable \nknowledge of the land and peoples beyond the Mississippi River \nemboldened thousands of Americans to search for a new life Out West. \nAround the world, the American Frontier became synonymous with the \nsearch for spiritual, economic and political freedom.\n  The bill we are introducing today creating this Commission would \nrequire an appropriation of no more than $4,000,000. The Commission \nwould be composed of a bipartisan group of 24 members, appointed by the \nPresident through recommendations of the Speaker of the House and the \nSenate majority and minority leaders. A year after enactment of this \norder, the Commission will submit a report to the President and \nCongress detailing its recommendations for activities to celebrate the \nevent. By March 31, 2005, the Commission is to submit a final report \ndescribing all activities, programs, expenditures and donations \nrelating to its work.\n  Commemoration of the Louisiana Purchase and the subsequent opening of \nthe West can enhance public understanding of the impact of westward \nexpansion on American society and can provide lessons for democratic \ngovernance in our own time. I call on my colleagues to join us in \nhonoring this momentous occasion in our nation's history and provide \nthe proper ways and means for us to celebrate it appropriately.\n  Mr. President, again, this bill is to establish a national commission \non the bicentennial of the Louisiana purchase. This, hopefully, is \ngoing to be an exciting celebration for our Nation. Of course, it will \ntake place in the year 2003. This legislation has particularly special \nmeaning to the Senators from Louisiana because the site of the actual \ntransfer of the Louisiana purchase, of course, which was in 1803, took \nplace in the Cabildo, a building that still stands right there on the \nhistoric Jackson Square in New Orleans.\n  The bicentennial of the Louisiana purchase which will occur in 2003 \nmarks an event that more than any other determined the character of our \nnational life. It determined that we should be a great and expanding \nNation instead of a relatively small and stationary one.\n  As we all remember from our history classes, for only $15 million, 3 \ncents an acre--a remarkable bargain, actually, for part or all of 14 \nStates that were created out of this vast territory acquired in the \nLouisiana Purchase, virtually doubling the size of the United States--\nthis was, in fact, the largest\n\n[[Page S1499]]\n\npeaceful land transaction in history. The purchase opened the heartland \nof North America for exploration, settlement, and achievement to the \npeople of the United States and immigrants from around the world. It \nmade possible the travel of Lewis and Clark, whose invaluable knowledge \nof the land and peoples beyond the Mississippi River emboldened \nthousands of Americans to search for a new life out West.\n  Around the world, the American frontier became synonymous with the \nsearch for spiritual, economic, and political freedom. So the bill we \nare introducing today creates a commission. It would require an \nappropriation of no more than $4 million. The commission would be \ncomposed of a bipartisan group of 24 members appointed by the President \nthrough recommendations of the Speaker of the House and the Senate \nmajority and minority leaders. A year after enactment of this order, \naccording to our legislation, the commission will submit a report to \nthe President and Congress detailing its recommendations and activities \nto celebrate this wonderful event.\n  Hopefully, by March of 2005, the commission will submit a final \nreport describing all of the activities and programs, expenditures, and \ndonations relating to its work.\n  The commemoration of the Louisiana Purchase and the subsequent \nopening of the West can enhance a public understanding of the impact of \nthe westward expansion on American society, and, I think, provide for \nall of us, adults and children alike, lessons we can use each day as we \npress forward for more stable and robust and terrific democracy and for \ngovernance in our time.\n  I call on colleagues today to join us in honoring this occasion in \nour Nation's history so we can provide the proper ways and means for us \nto celebrate it fully and appropriately.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 356\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Louisiana Purchase \n     Bicentennial Commission Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to establish a \nMedicare Prescription Drug and Supplemental Benefit Program and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I am pleased to once again stand before the \nSenate and speak on the critical issue of Medicare reform and \nprescription drugs. Over the past 3 years, I have worked extensively on \nthis issue with my friend Senator Breaux, and we have introduced two \npieces of bipartisan legislation comprehensively reforming and \nstrengthening the Medicare program. Therefore, I am thrilled today to \nreintroduce these bills along with Senator Breaux as we take the next \nstep in this process towards improving Medicare.\n  No one disputes that Medicare needs changes. Every year, Congress \nconsiders numerous proposals to update the Medicare program--some more \nfar-reaching than others. We have a strong consensus on the importance \nof a prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. What remains \nfor us, then, is to strengthen the Medicare program in a way that will \nbring it into the 21st century--by allowing seniors to have a \nprescription drug benefit, bringing the overall benefits package into \nline with what most other Americans receive, and giving the program the \nflexibility to change and grow over the years.\n  We all know Medicare's shortcomings. It is projected to be bankrupt \nby 2025. It only covers 53 percent of beneficiaries' health care costs, \nmaking seniors spend an average of $2,000 per year out-of-pocket on \nhealth care. It does not cover prescription drugs, long-term care, \neyeglasses or dental care. As the fourth-largest item in the budget, \nits spending, left unchecked will consume an ever-increasing share of \nthe Federal budget. A generational time-bomb awaits it as 77 million \nbaby boomers begin to enter the program in 2010. It is an example of \nCongressional\n\n[[Page S1501]]\n\nmicromanagement at its worst, and its regulatory system encompasses \nmore than 130,000 pages of HCFA regulations.\n  Designed in 1965, the Medicare program remains mired in the past. \nWhen Medicare was first enacted in 1965, it had the goal of providing \nseniors necessary acute health care that would otherwise have been \nunaffordable. However today's health care delivery systems are far more \nadvanced than the program's creators ever imagined. It has simply not \nkept pace with the changing nature of health care. We must fix the \nprogram--not just continue to tinker around the edges.\n  I believe that the overwhelming public support for a prescription \ndrug benefit gives us a real opportunity to improve Medicare in a \nbipartisan, comprehensive manner. Seniors absolutely need prescription \ndrug benefits, but a free-standing drug benefit that fails to address \nthe underlying program only exacerbates Medicare's financial and \nadministrative troubles while removing the political will to tackle the \npressing need for system-wide reform.\n  Therefore, any reform legislation, while including prescription drug \ncoverage, must also address these other issues facing the program. The \nfirst bill we introduce today, ``Breaux-Frist I,'' was the first \nbipartisan attempt to comprehensively reform Medicare in the program's \n35-year history. Breaux-Frist I draws heavily on the recommendations of \nthe National Bipartisan Commission on the Future of Medicare and is \nmodeled after the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan, (FEHBP), a \nplan through which we and millions of other Federal employees receive \nhealth care. This is a plan with a forty year track record of success \nin providing quality comprehensive health coverage.\n\n  Breaux-Frist I does three main things. First, it replaces the current \nsystem for competing health plans in Medicare, which is not working \nvery well, with a new system based on the FEHBP. A new Medicare Board, \nnot HCFA, would oversee the competition. It also requires that all \nMedicare plans, including the HCFA-sponsored plans, have a high option \nwith prescription drug coverage and a limit on seniors' out-of-pocket \ncosts. The Government would make the least cost high option plan \navailable to low-income seniors for free and would share a part of the \ncost with all beneficiaries choosing a high option plan. Finally, it \ngives HCFA the opportunity to manage the government-run plans more like \na business, with less regulation and less need for Congressional \nmicromanagement.\n  Building on Breaux-Frist I and the findings of the Medicare \nCommission, our second piece of legislation, ``Breaux-Frist II,'' takes \nthe first steps towards long-term Medicare reform while adding a much \nneeded outpatient prescription drug benefit to the program. The bill \nwill provide seniors the option to choose the kind of health care \ncoverage that best suits their individual needs, including enhanced \nbenefits, outpatient prescription drug coverage, and protections \nagainst high out-of-pocket drug costs.\n  Breaux-Frist II establishes the Competitive Medicare Agency, CMA, an \nindependent, executive-branch agency to spearhead an advanced level of \nMedicare management and oversight--leaving behind the intransigent \nbureaucracy and outdated mindset infecting the program and instead \nguaranteeing seniors choice, health care security, and improved \nbenefits and delivery of care.\n  Vital to this bill is the Prescription Drug and Supplemental Benefit \nProgram that provides beneficiaries outpatient prescription drugs and \nother additional benefits through new Medicare Prescription Plus plans \noffered by private entities or through Medicare+Choice plans. Seniors \nare guaranteed a minimum benefit but also have the choice of other drug \nbenefit packages. I recognize more than anyone that a one-size-fits-all \napproach to health care does not work. It is important to pass along \nthe same choices we, as members of Congress, have. Seniors deserve no \nless.\n  The bill also provides drug coverage premium subsidies for low-income \nbeneficiaries and addresses the high costs of drugs by ensuring that no \nbeneficiary will ever pay retail prices for prescription drugs again.\n  Both of these bills will prove successful in placing Medicare on the \nright road to financial stability and quality health care. They will \nensure more competition, provide a universal prescription drug benefit, \nprotect low-income and rural Americans and create new measures of \nMedicare's financial solvency.\n  Medicare must be modernized to provide seniors integrated health care \nchoices, including outpatient prescription drug coverage. By moving \nforward on this legislation, we can truly provide choice and security \nfor our Medicare beneficiaries to ensure their individual health care \nneeds are met, today and well into the future. I look forward to \nworking with Senator Breaux, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nand the White House towards this critical goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SHELBY:\n  S. 359. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to provide \neligibility for members enlisting in a regular component of the Armed \nForces to enroll for advanced training in the Senior Reserve Officers' \nTraining Program; to increase the maximum age authorized for \nparticipation in the Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps financial \nassistance program; and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Senior Reserve \nOfficers' Training Corps Eligibility Reform Act of 2001. I believe this \nbill will shore up the military's ability to recruit and retain \nqualified junior officers. This legislation will reform our college \nlevel Reserve Officer Training Corps Units by expanding eligibility for \nthose programs.\n  This bill contains two primary provisions which will alter the way in \nwhich ROTC determines eligibility. First, it will allow active duty \nenlisted personnel, who have been selected for an officer commissioning \nprogram, to participate in ROTC training. These enlisted personnel are \nalready on college campuses and are attached administratively to an \nROTC unit. Their tuition is paid by their respective service and they \nearn their regular active duty pay while earning their degree. However, \nthese enlisted personnel do not normally begin their formal officer \ntraining until after earning their degree when they attend their \nrespective service's officer candidate school. On average, our \nmilitary's officer candidate schools are three months long. This \nlegislation would permit these personnel to complete their officer \ntraining at the ROTC unit which serves the college or university they \nare attending. This would be a more equitable use of an officer \ncandidate's time and would decrease the time and cost associated with \ntraining. Additionally, it will free up positions at officer training \nschools and significantly increase their ability to cope with \nfluctuations in the number of officer recruits.\n  Second, this legislation increases the maximum age for participation \nin ROTC scholarship programs from 27 to 35. In other words, if a cadet \nor midshipman can complete their degree and earn their commission, by \nthe maximum legal commissioning age of 35, they should be able to earn \na scholarship which will pay for that education. This provision will \nallow the services to use scholarship money to cover the entire \ncommissioning envelope. Our military recruiters will be able to provide \nfinancial incentives to an older yet valuable age group. I have been \ntold that officer trainees in the 27 to 35 age group are more mature \nand focused and are less likely to try to back out of their service \ncommitment.\n  This legislation is one small initiative in our effort to rebuild the \nmorale and readiness of our armed forces. Whether they be infantry \ncommanders, pilots, submariners, intelligence analysts or information \ntechnology specialists, our junior officer ranks are depleted across \nthe spectrum. In conjunction with the service academies and officer \ncandidate schools, the ROTC scholarship program has been the backbone \nof our military's ability to train and commission high quality junior \nofficers. My proposal today would merely expand this established \nprogram to include regular active duty personnel and an older and more \nseasoned citizenry. Overall, I believe that this bill will help the \nmilitary to commission more junior officers, especially those with \nvaluable prior enlisted service. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n[[Page S1502]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 361. A bill to establish age limitations for airmen; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators \nInhofe and Enzi in introducing legislation that attempts to diminish \nthe scope of a problem that is facing our air transport industry, \nnamely a critical shortage of pilots. The pilot shortage is starting to \nhave effects in many rural states.\n  In response to this problem, I am today introducing a bill that would \nrepeal the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rule which now \nrequires pilots who fly under Part 121 to retire at ago 60. Under my \nlegislation, pilots in excellent health would be allowed to continue to \npilot commercial airliners until their 65th birthday.\n  The Age 60 rule was instituted 40 years ago when commercial jets were \nfirst entering service. The rule was established without the benefit of \nmedical or scientific studies or public comment. The most recent study, \nthe results of which were released in 1993, examined the correlation \nbetween age and accident rate as pilots approach 60. That study found \nno increase in accidents.\n  The FAA contends that although science does not dictate retirement at \nthe age of 60, it is the age range when sharp increases in disease \nmortality and morbidity occur. In FAA's view it is too risky to allow \nolder pilots to fly the largest aircraft, carrying the greatest number \nof passengers over the longest non-stop distances, in the highest \ndensity traffic.\n  However, 44 countries worldwide have relaxed the age 60 rule within \nthe last ten years primarily because the pilot shortage is a worldwide \nphenomenon. Many of these air carriers currently fly into U.S. \nairspace.\n  One of the ways carriers are attempting to adapt to the shortage is \nto lower their flight time requirements. In my view, this is a risk \nfactor the FAA should be concerned about.\n  How did this shortage occur? The reason is simple: There has been an \nexplosive growth of the major airlines worldwide, and there's a \nshortage of military pilots who used to feed the system. In addition, \nthere is an aging pilot pool that must retire at age 60.\n  Add to this domino effect the decline in the number of people \nlearning to fly, due primarily to the cost, and the pool of available \npilots has shrunk.\n  The shortage acutely affects my home state of Alaska because we \ndepend on air transport far more than any other state. Rural residents \nin Alaska have no way out other than by air service. There are no rural \nroutes, state or interstate highways serving most rural residents in \nAlaska and the airplane for many of them is their lifeline to the \noutside world.\n  The pilot shortage has left Alaskan carriers scrambling for pilots. \nAlaska's carriers must hire from the available pilot pool in the lower \n48. Many of these pilots view flying in Alaska as a stepping stone that \nallows them to build up flight time. Although they get great flying \nexperience in my home state, in nearly all instances when a pilot gets \na higher-pay job offer with a larger carrier in the lower 48, he leaves \nAlaska.\n  According to the Alaska Air Carriers Association, raising the \nretirement age to 65 will help alleviate the shortage and keep \nexperienced pilots flying and serving rural Alaskans.\n  I would note that what is happening across the country is that the \nmajor carriers are luring pilots from commuter airlines, who in turn \nrecruit from the air charter and corporate industry, who in turn hire \nflight instructors, agriculture pilots, etc. Which leaves rural \ncarriers strapped. The big fish are feeding off the little ones.\n  Small carriers simply cannot compete with the salaries, benefits and \ntraining costs of the major carriers. They simply do not have the \nfinancial resources.\n  According to figures provided by the Federal Aviation Administration, \nthere were 694,000 pilots in 1988 and 616,342 in 1997. Within that \nnumber, private pilot certificates fell from approximately 300,000 in \n1988 to 247,604 in 1997. Commercial certificates, like air taxi and \nsmall commuter pilots, fell from 143,000 in 1988 to 125,300 in 1997. \nThe number of total pilots in Alaska fell from more than 10,000 in 1988 \nto approximately 8,700 in 1997.\n  However, light is beginning to show at the end of the tunnel. \nOrganizations such as the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) \nand the General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) have been \nmonitoring this shortage for some time and have stepped up to the plate \nto get people interested in flying. AOPA has started a pilot mentoring \nprogram in 1994 and approximately 30,000 have entered the program. \nGAMA's ``Be a Pilot'' program is starting to bring more potential \npilots into flight training.\n  Even the Air Force is starting to institute new programs to keep \npilots.\n  In Alaska, as a result of a precedent-setting program involving Yute \nAir, the Association of Village Council Presidents, the University of \nAlaska, Anchorage, Aero Tech Flight Service, Inc., and the FAA, a \nprogram was developed to train rural Alaska Natives to fly. Seven are \non their way to pilot careers.\n  Also, the number of students working on pilot licenses at the \nUniversity's Flight Technology program has almost doubled in two years.\n  It is my hope that the shortage has hit rock bottom. But even so, it \nwill take years before a cadre of qualified pilots is ready to take to \nthe friendly skies.\n  The time has come for Congress to wrestle with this problem. As long \nas a pilot can pass the rigorous medical exam, he or she should be \nallowed to fly. Air service is critical to keep commerce alive, \nespecially in rural states.\n   I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 361\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe applicability of section 179 which permits the expensing of certain \ndepreciable assets; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I'm reintroducing several bills that \nare needed to fix glaring problems in our Internal Revenue Code.\n  Clearly, the issue of tax cuts will be the subject of extensive \ndebate in the coming months. I think a responsible new tax relief plan \ncould be crafted to ease the tax burden on working families and others \nwho need it. I also believe that if the expected surpluses materialize, \na significant part should be used to pay down the federal debt.\n  But, as we move forward with this debate about new tax breaks, I \nthink Congress needs to remember that there are a number of tax \nfairness matters pending from previous years that we must address \nwithout any further delay.\n\n[[Page S1503]]\n\n  First, when Congress enacted a new $500,000 capital gains exclusion \nfor home sales in 1997, it offered a good deal to those families who \nlive in urban areas affected by rising home and land prices. \nUnfortunately, this provision offers little or no benefits for family \nfarmers because their farm homes are part of the larger farmstead. By \nitself, the farmhouse often has little value in relation to the \nsurrounding farmland and buildings. This means that farmers who are \nselling the whole farm because they are retiring or who are being \nforced out of business because of the downturn in the farm economy may \nface a hefty tax bill at a time they can least afford it.\n  Legislation that Senator Hagel and I are introducing today recognizes \nthe economic realities of farming and extends the benefit of the \n$500,000 capital gains tax exclusion to farm families. Specifically, \nour legislation would expand the $500,000 capital gains exclusion for \nhome sales to cover family farmers who sell their farmhouses or \nsurrounding farmland, so long as they are actively farming prior to the \nsales.\n  We have introduced virtually identical legislation in the past. Our \napproach has garnered substantial bipartisan support from most of our \ncolleagues. If we enact a major tax bill this year, we believe it ought \nto include language to correct this capital gains tax problem that many \nof our nation's farmers urgently need fixed.\n  Second, I'm introducing legislation along with Senators Johnson, \nDaschle and others to immediately eliminate the disparity between sole \nproprietors and their large corporate competitors in the tax treatment \nof their health insurance costs. Under current federal tax law, we tell \nour biggest corporations that they can deduct 100 percent of their \nhealth insurance costs, while we say to our nation's sole proprietors \nthat they can deduct only 60 percent of these same costs. Almost \neveryone agrees that this circumstance is indefensible and needs to be \nremedied. Current law fixes this problem by 2003, but small business \nowners should not have to wait. Congress should act now to give them \nthe full deduction.\n  This legislation addresses this inequity facing family farmers, \nranchers, and other self-employed individuals by permitting them to \ndeduct 100-percent of their health insurance costs beginning this year. \nThe health of a family farmer or small business owner is just as \nimportant as the health of an officer of a large corporation and our \ntax laws should reflect that simple fact now.\n  The third bill I'm introducing today addresses what I believe is a \nmajor flaw in the current federal income tax expensing provision that \nhinders many small businesses from making needed building improvements. \nUnder current law, small businesses generally can deduct immediately up \nto $24,000 in qualifying purchases of equipment and machinery. But they \nmust depreciate over 39 years the costs of any storefront or other \nstructural building improvements, even if those improvements are \ncrucial to the business or to the maintenance of a Main Street.\n  This legislation tells the local drug store, shoe store or barber \nshop, which doesn't have much need for equipment purchases but does \nneed to improve the storefront or interior, that it should be able to \ndeduct the costs of such improvements, rather than be forced to \ndepreciate them over nearly four decades. Specifically, my bill expands \nthe current $24,000 expensing provision to cover investments in \ndepreciable real property. The bill also increases the expensing amount \nto $25,000, which is currently scheduled to occur by the year 2003.\n  There are Main Streets across this country that were built or \nrefurbished decades ago and now need investments and improvements. Our \nfederal tax laws ought to assist small businesses to make such \nimprovements, and my legislation is a simple way to accomplish that.\n  The Senate unanimously agreed to an amendment I offered to a larger \ntax bill last summer that would have made the changes I have proposed \nin the three bills I introduce today. Unfortunately, none of these \nprovisions was included in the final version of that tax bill or other \nlegislation before the Congress adjourned last year.\n  Therefore, I would urge my Senate colleagues to cosponsor each of \nthese bills and work with me to get them added to any tax package \npassed by the Congress this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THOMAS:\n  S. 365: A bill to provide recreational snowmobile access to certain \nunits of the National Park System, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to \nprovide recreational snowmobile access to certain units of the National \nPark System, and for other purposes.\n  Recently many of my constituents in and around Yellowstone and Grand \nTeton National Parks witnessed the bureaucracy exercise its powers and \nrun roughshod over those who disagreed with its findings.\n  For years, the National Park Service managed and encouraged \nrecreational snowmobiling in Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks \nand on the adjacent John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Memorial Parkway, \nproviding thousands of Americans an opportunity to enjoy the winter \nwonders of the Yellowstone plateau and the majestic surrounding \ncountryside.\n  Instead of continuing this reasonable approach to winter access, or \nconstructively addressing perceived adverse issues; The Clinton \nadministration hijacked the National Park Service effort to update \nYellowstone's winter use management plan; corrupted the environmental \nimpact statement process; cut off meaningful participation by \ncooperating states, local communities and citizens; disregarded \ncritical facts and science, and injected new anti-snowmobile \nalternatives into the process at the last moment.\n  In short, federal land managers cast aside their statutory duties and \nobligations and instead accepted interpretations of law twisted to \nstage a grand political gesture--the banning of snowmobiles from \nNational Parks, including Yellowstone and Grand Teton.\n  Snowmobiles often come under fire from those who suspect that the \nmachines degrade air and water quality, despite the fact that \nscientists were unable to produce or confirm any resource degradation \nin the recent environmental impact study conducted by the National Park \nService. In this regard, I have met personally with the presidents and \nCEO's of the four major snowmobile manufacturers. They have informed \nme, that as soon as the Environmental Protection Agency issues emission \nstandards, they can produce and market snowmobiles that meet or exceed \nthe standards within three years.\n  Mr. President, the industry only needs to have the emission standards \nset so that they can get on with their business. In fact, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, was in the process of creating \nstandards; however, EPA employees were told to stand down by the \nPresident's appointees until the Yellowstone scenario was played out. \nThey did not want to be confused by the facts nor did they desire to \nconstructively address the perceived problems.\n  Headlines were more important than people as well as the economic \nviability of small communities and businesses in Idaho, Montana and \nWyoming. Press reports were more important than providing winter \nvisitors continued access to their parks.\n  The bureaucrats did decide that the ``snowcoach only no other \nsnowmachine'' scenario is the only way people should enjoy, experience \nand view the majesty that winter brings to the Yellowstone region.\n  The ``snowcoach only'' scenario is unfortunately another bureaucratic \nsnafu. No one considered that today's snowcoach is mechanically \nunreliable and it lacks the speed necessary to see much of the park in \na day. While the snowcoach may be the correct and preferred mode of \ntransportation for some, it is not for many. Telling local businessmen \nthat more comfortable, more reliable snowcoaches will be developed in \nthe next few years at taxpayer expense serves absolutely no purpose. I \nknow of no such budget request or plan and I know of no one willing to \ninvest in such a risky scheme.\n  I do know that a viable alternative for winter access is possible. \nMore importantly, access can be attained in an environmentally sound \nmanner. It is not an issue that should be ignored. I doubt that the new \nrules and regulations will stand the scrutiny of our\n\n[[Page S1504]]\n\ncourt system. The International Snowmobile Manufacturer's Association \nand other parties have already filed suit against the Department of the \nInterior and the National Park Service challenging the government's \narbitrary and capricious decision to reverse decades of traditional \nactivity.\n  In watching the progress and the mistakes made, along with the \ninformation and facts ignored, I believe there is a real possibility \nthat the newly issued rules and regulations will be overturned.\n  It is for this reason that I am introducing this legislation today. I \nbelieve that a proactive, constructive and environmentally sound \napproval to winter access to our parks needs to be discussed and \nimplemented.\n  This legislation, when enacted, will:\n  (1) direct the EPA, within two years, to promulgate final national \nstandards governing emissions by snowmobiles;\n  (2) the National Park Service, in conjunction with the Society of \nAutomotive Engineers, shall set noise standards for snowmobile use in \nthe National Park System, and\n  (3) not later than five years after the enactment of this act, the \nNational Park Service will not allow a snowmachine to operate within \nthe boundaries of a park that does not meet the new emission and noise \nstandards.\n  The measure also provides the Secretary with authorities to close \nportions of parks if damage to the resource can be shown and the bill \nrequires comprehensive studies; which, to date, have not been \ncompleted, much less initiated. The studies will assess the impacts of \nrecreational snowmobile use within the affected units of the System on \npark resources, visitor use and enjoyment, and adjacent communities.\n  I am not suggesting that snowmachine users have unfettered access \nacross park lands. Any use will be closely monitored and highly \nregulated. Some are unaware of the fact that currently snowmachines in \nparks are limited to the same established roadways used by hundreds of \nautomobiles during the summer months. The users are not allowed to \ntravel at will in parks as they are allowed on other federal lands.\n  There will be some who will admit that cleaner, quieter machines are \nnot that much different than the automobiles that tend to clog our park \nroadways from time to time. They would be correct, except that there \nare far fewer snowmachines visiting our parks than there are \nautomobiles. They will point out; however, that snowmachines harass \nwildlife.\n  Some of the folks at Yellowstone coined a phrase--``bison ping pong'' \nEvidently, there is a VCR tape that has been circulated showing two \nindividuals on snowmobiles harassing a bison within the boundaries of \nYellowstone National Park. I have not seen the tape and I cannot attest \nto its veracity.\n  Currently, there are laws that make it a federal crime to engage or \nparticipate in such activities. The National Park Service has all of \nthe powers and authorities it needs to address this management problem \nor illegal activity, if indeed, it exists. I would advocate, that \nanyone apprehended in a park engaged in this sort of illegal activity, \nshould be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, and in addition \nto fines and jail time, their machines should be confiscated.\n  The bottom line in the snowmobile debate is that with a little care, \nthe program can be well managed, without causing damage to the park \nresources, including the wildlife therein.\n  Finally, I am committed to work with my colleagues toward the passage \nof this legislation. I am willing to compromise where necessary and I \nam willing to listen to all sides of this issue. I firmly believe that \nwe can reach resolution.\n  The concept and management style which advocates the theory that \nthere may be a problem with a particular activity, but we don't really \nknow what the problem is--therefore the activity should be eliminated \nno matter who or what is inconvenienced, forced out of business, or \ndenied access to our natural treasures--should not be allowed to \ncontinue unchecked.\n  I am an avid supporter and protector of our National Park System. I \nfirmly believe this winter use can be accommodated through good \nmanagement, good science and a little common sense.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, a synopsis of \nsnowmobile regulations, and a section-by-section analysis be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 365\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This act may be cited as the ``National Park Service Winter \n     Access Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SNOWMOBILES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Recreational snowmobile use within units of the \n     National Park system is an established, traditional, and \n     legitimate means of visitor use and enjoyment of these public \n     lands when conducted in a manner that does not adversely \n     affect or impair park resources and values.\n       (2) The snowmobile manufacturers and the Environmental \n     Protection Agency will be working to establish emissions \n     standards for a new generation of snowmobiles. This new \n     generation of machines will be cleaner and quieter and should \n     be available to the public within five years.\n       (3) Cleaner, quieter snowmobiles may provide the public \n     with a greater opportunity to enjoy the National Park System \n     in a manner that is consistent with park resources and \n     values.\n       (b) Interim Park Operations.--\n       (1) As is consistent with the Act entitled, ``An Act to \n     establish a National Park Service, and for other purposes,'' \n     approved August 25, 1916 (16 U.S.C. 1 et seq.), in the \n     following units of the National Park System where snowmobile \n     use occurred or was authorized as of January 1, 2000, such \n     use shall continue restricted to levels of no less than the \n     average wintertime use and activity over the last three \n     winters. This use can be subject to other reasonable \n     regulations governing such use existing as of January 1, \n     2000, including emergency closure authority:\n       Acadia National Park, Maine\n       Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, Colorado\n       Crater Lake National Park, Oregon\n       Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming\n       Mount Rainier National Park, Washington\n       North Cascades National Park, Washington\n       Olympic National Park, Washington\n       Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado\n       Sequoia National Park, California\n       Kings Canyon National Park, California\n       Theodore Roosevelt National Park, North Dakota\n       Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota\n       Yellowstone National Park, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming\n       Zion National Park, Utah\n       Appalachian National Scenic Trail, Multi-States\n       Saint Croix National Scenic River, Wisconsin, Minnesota\n       Pictured Rocks National Seashore, Michigan\n       Cedar Breaks National Monument, Utah\n       Dinosaur National Monument, Colorado, Utah\n       Grand Portage National Monument, Minnesota\n       Blue Ridge Parkway, North Carolina, Virginia\n       John D. Rockefeller, Jr. Parkway, Wyoming\n       Herbert Hoover National Historic Site, Iowa\n       Perry's Victory National Historic Site, Ohio\n       Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area, Montana, Wyoming\n       Curecanti National Recreation Area, Colorado\n       Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area, new Jersey, \n     Pennsylvania\n       Lake Chelan National Recreation Area, Washington\n       Ross Lake National Recreation Area, Washington\n       (2)(i) Notwithstanding subsection (b)(1), and consistent \n     with other applicable laws, the Secretary has the authority, \n     if necessary, to address or avert significant environmental \n     impacts in a particular unit or portion of a unit, to \n     restrict snowmobile use and activity down to a level that is \n     no less than 50% below the three year average level \n     established under subsection (b)(1). The restrictions shall \n     apply to the smallest practical portion of the unit adequate \n     to address the impacts.\n       (ii) Before restricting use and activity in this manner, \n     the Secretary shall make a finding of significant \n     environmental impact based on on-the-ground study in the \n     affected unit or portion of the unit and sound, peer-reviewed \n     scientific information applicable to that unit or portion of \n     the unit. Within at least 90 days before finalizing such \n     restrictions, the Secretary shall notify the Senate Committee \n     on Energy and Natural Resources and the House Committee on \n     Resources of its intent and provide the public with at least \n     30 days to comment on the proposal.\n       (3) Consistent with other applicable law, the National Park \n     Service may prohibit recreational snowmobile use within all \n     units of the system not listed in subsection (b)(1).\n       (c) Long-Term Program and Operations.--\n       (1) Within two years after the enactment of this Act, the \n     Environmental Protection\n\n[[Page S1505]]\n\n     Agency shall promulgate final national standards governing \n     emissions by snowmobiles.\n       (2) The Environmental Protection Agency may engage in \n     negotiated rulemaking with the snowmobile manufacturers \n     regarding this standard.\n       (3) Taking into account noise reductions achieved in \n     conjunction with the emissions standard described in \n     subsection (c)(1), not later than five years following the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the National Park Service, in \n     conjunction with the Society of Automotive Engineers, \n     shall set noise standards for snowmobile use in the \n     National Park System.\n       (d) Management Plans and Studies.--\n       (1) The National Park Service is directed to prepare \n     management plans to assure education and enforcement of \n     regulations governing recreational snowmobile use within the \n     system.\n       (2) The National Park Service shall conduct new \n     comprehensive studies to assess the impacts of recreational \n     snowmobile use within the affected units of the system on \n     park resources, visitor use and enjoyment, and adjacent \n     communities. Among other things, these studies must include \n     consideration of the EPA snowmobile emission standards, \n     snowmobiles that are produced in response to those standards, \n     and technological and other advances occurring or anticipated \n     at that time. The conclusions derived from such studies shall \n     be the basis for any proposed revised regulations and \n     management plans to govern use of recreational snowmobiles \n     within the units listed in subsection (g)(1) of this section.\n       (3) Not later than four years following the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the National Park Service shall \n     prepare a Report to Congress concerning the proper use of \n     snowmobiles for recreation in National Park System units. \n     Among other things, this Report shall consider the impact of \n     the snowmobiles complaint with the emission standards set in \n     subsection (c)(1) on wildlife, the environment, and other \n     relevant factors.\n       (4) Not later than five years after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, and based upon the findings of the report to \n     Congress described in subsection (d)(3) and other relevant \n     information, the National Park Service shall propose revised \n     regulations and management plans to govern use of \n     recreational snowmobiles within the units listed in \n     subsection (b)(1) of this Act.\n       (i) No management plan or regulation developed in \n     accordance with subsection (d)(4) shall permit the entry of \n     snowmobiles that do not meet the emission and noise standards \n     described in subsections (c)(1) and (c)(3), respectively, \n     into the units of the National Park System described in \n     section (b)(1) of this Act.\n       (e) Savings Clause.--\n       Nothing herein is intended to affect the provisions of \n     Public Law 96-487, including but not limited to, Section \n     1110(a).\n                                  ____\n\n\n                                Synopsis\n\n\n                       Yellowstone National Park\n\n       The regulation delineates a timeline that eliminates all \n     recreational snowmobile access by the end of the 2003-04 \n     season. This prohibition will be implemented incrementally \n     over several years. Upon the effective date, February 21, \n     2001, the regulation designates established routes for \n     snowmobiles and snowcoaches, public safety and air pollution \n     restrictions for snowmobiles and snowcoaches, designated \n     periods of operation for snowcoaches, permit and license \n     requirements for snowmobile operators, and a prohibition on \n     snowplanes.\n       Effective through the end of the 2001-2002 winter season, \n     the use of snowmobiles is limited to the unplowed roadway. \n     There are further restrictions on the routes available to \n     snowmobiles during the 2002-2003 winter season and there are \n     restrictions placed on what hours during the day that \n     snowmobiles may be operated. Additional restrictions during \n     this period include a daily limit on the number of \n     snowmobiles allowed to use the park each day, a requirement \n     for snowmobiles to be accompanied by a guide in groups of no \n     more than 11. By the end of the 2003-2005 winter season, the \n     use of snowmobiles in Yellowstone is prohibited.\n\n\n               John D. Rockefeller, Jr., Memorial Parkway\n\n       As in Yellowstone there are restrictions and requirements \n     that go into effect immediately, such as registration, \n     licensing, rules of the road, and restriction to keep \n     snowmobiles on designated routes. Effective until the end of \n     2001-2002 winter season use, snowmobiles are required to stay \n     on designated routes. Snowplanes are prohibited.\n       During the 2002-2003 season there are specific routes \n     designated for snowmobile travel, limits on the numbers of \n     snowmobiles each day are imposed, and the hours of operation \n     are prescribed.\n       The prohibition on all snowmobile use occurs one year \n     earlier than in Yellowstone, at the end of the 2002-2003 \n     season.\n\n\n                       Grand Teton National Park\n\n       The regulations restricting snowmobile and snowplane use at \n     Grand Teton NP vary from those found at Yellowstone and the \n     John D. Rockefeller Memorial Parkway primarily to allow for \n     access across parklands and access to private lands within \n     the park. Recreational snowmobile use is eliminated entirely \n     from Grand Teton NP, except for snowmobile use over certain \n     designated routes and for specific purposes. Snowplane use is \n     allowed to continue under permit until the end of the 2001-\n     2002 season.\n       Upon the regulations effective date several public safety, \n     licensing, and registration requirements are imposed, there \n     is an exception on licensing for individuals accessing \n     private and adjacent public lands.\n       The regulation specifies designated snowmobile routes that \n     are effective to the end of the 2001-2002 winter season most \n     of which follow unplowed roads. During the 2002-2003 winter \n     season only the Continental Divide Snowmobile Trail is \n     designated for snowmobile use. Effective winter use season of \n     2003-2004, the only snowmobile use is for reasonable and \n     direct access to adjacent public and private lands via \n     designated routes.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n       Section 1 designates the Act's short title as the \n     ``National Park Service Winter Access Act.''\n       Section 2(a) finds that snowmobile use in the National Park \n     System is an established, traditional, and legitimate means \n     of visitor use and enjoyment.\n       Paragraph 2 finds that snowmobile manufacturers and the \n     Environmental Protection Agency will work together to \n     establish emission standards for a new generation of \n     snowmobiles which should be available in five years.\n       Paragraph 3 states that cleaner and quieter snowmobiles may \n     provide the public the opportunity to enjoy the parks in a \n     manner consistent with park values.\n       Subsection 2(b)(1) directs that until new emission \n     standards and the new generation snowmobiles are available, \n     the National Park Service will allow snowmobiles use to \n     continue at levels no less than the average wintertime use \n     and activity over the last three years. This subsection \n     designates 29 National Park Service areas where such use will \n     continue.\n       Paragraph 2(b)(2)(i) allows the Secretary to restrict \n     snowmobile use and activity down to a level no less than 50% \n     below the three year average level to address or avert \n     significant environmental impacts. Such restrictions apply to \n     the smallest practical area to address the impact.\n       Paragraph 2(b)(2)(ii) requires that before restricting \n     snowmobile activity, the Secretary must make a finding of \n     significant environmental impact and present these findings \n     to House and Senate Committees as well as give adequate \n     public notice.\n       Paragraph 2(b)(3) allows the National Park Service to \n     prohibit snowmobile use in all areas not listed in paragraph \n     2(b)(1).\n       Subsection 2(c) requires the EPA to promulgate national \n     standards on snowmobile emission.\n       Paragraph 2 allows the Environmental Protection Agency to \n     engage in negotiated rulemaking with snowmobile manufacturers \n     on emissions standards.\n       Paragraph 3 requires the National Park Service to set noise \n     standards for snowmobile use within five years of this act's \n     enactment, in conjunction with the Society of Automotive \n     Engineers.\n       Subsection 2(d) directs the National Park Service to \n     complete management plans addressing education and \n     enforcement of regulations regarding recreational snowmobile \n     use in the National Park System.\n       Paragraph 2 directs the National Park Service to conduct \n     new studies on the impacts of recreational snowmobile use in \n     the park system. The studies will consider the new EPA \n     standards and anticipated changes in technology.\n       Paragraph 3 directs the National Park Service to prepare a \n     Report to Congress addressing the use of snowmobiles in \n     National Park Service units within four years of the act's \n     enactment.\n       Paragraph 4 requires the National Park Service to propose \n     revised regulations governing the use of snowmobiles in units \n     affected by this act within five years of the enactment of \n     the act. These regulations should include a prohibition on \n     snowmobiles that do not meet established noise and emission \n     standards\n       Subsection 2(e) states that nothing in this act will affect \n     the access provisions of the Alaska National Interest Lands \n     Act (PL 96-487).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Smith of \n        Oregon, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Wyden, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 366, A bill to amend the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 to \nincrease the amount of funds available for certain Agricultural Trade \nprograms; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Craig, \nCleland, Gordon Smith, Cantwell, Wyden and Boxer to reintroduce the \nAgricultural Market Access and Development Act of 2001.\n  Trade is the lifeblood of Washington state's economy. From aerospace \nto software to agriculture, one out of every three jobs in my state is \ntrade-related. Without access to markets around the world, Washington \nstate's economy cannot function.\n  The legislation I am introducing today would open and expand markets \nfor U.S. agricultural exports. It would\n\n[[Page S1506]]\n\nhelp rural economies. It would create jobs in regions that need them \nthe most.\n  In the 106th Congress, we focused our attention on opening markets to \nAmerican goods and services. I strongly supported efforts to pass \npermanent normal trade relations for China, to reform our ineffective \nunilateral sanctions policies, and to create new trade relationships \nwith Africa and the Caribbean Basin.\n  Our nation's producers generally supported these efforts, but their \nenthusiasm for new trade agreements is waning.\n  It's difficult for our farmers and ranchers to endorse new trade \nagreements when our trade partners heavily subsidize their producers.\n  It's difficult for farmers and ranchers to get excited about \npotential new markets when federal agencies give a green light to \nimports from nations that won't let our products in.\n  It's difficult for farmers and ranchers to support free trade when \nour competitors have the advantage of cheaper labor, cheaper land, \ncheaper water and fewer environmental regulations.\n  When these trade challenges are combined with low prices, a strong \ndollar, the 1997 Asian financial crisis, and higher energy and \nfertilizer prices, I understand why many of our farmers and ranchers \nare losing patience with our trade agreements.\n  I believe agricultural producers and rural communities should \ncontinue to support free trade. U.S. producers are so productive that \nwe can't afford not to push for more open markets.\n  But I also believe we should give our agricultural producers a \nfighting chance to succeed. We need to pursue trade agreements that are \nfair. We need to enforce the good agreements we make. And we need to \ninvest in market promotion and development.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will help give producers a \nfighting chance. It invests in market share, not potential markets. It \nbuilds on success, not rhetoric.\n  Current law authorizes hundreds of millions of dollars for the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture's Export Enhancement Program. But the program \nisn't being used. Current law does not allow the Secretary of \nAgriculture to transfer those authorized funds to programs that are \nbeing used, like the Market Access Program and the the Foreign Market \nDevelopment ``Cooperator'' Program.\n  My bill would change that.\n  The Agricultural Market Access and Development Act does three things.\n  First, it raises the existing cap on the Market Access Program from \n$90 million to $200 million.\n  Second, it creates a $35 million floor for the Foreign Market \nDevelopment ``Cooperator'' Program.\n  The Market Access Program and the Cooperator Program have helped to \nexpand markets for apples, potatoes, wheat, wine and other products \nfrom Washington state and around the nation. Under these programs, the \nfederal government reimburses a non-profit industry association or a \nprivate business for a portion of trade promotion activities.\n  Third, the bill establishes a mechanism to pay for these changes. It \nauthorizes the Secretary of Agriculture to transfer a percentage of \nunspent funds under the Export Enhancement Program to market access and \ndevelopment programs.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is nearly identical to S. \n1983, which I introduced in 1999. In the 106th Congress, more than \neighty agriculture and food organizations wrote to Members of Congress \nsupporting S. 1983. I believe we will have equal--if not greater--\nsupport as we start working on the next farm bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor and support the Agricultural Market \nAccess and Development Act.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that I am \ncosponsoring the Agricultural Market Access and Development Act of \n2001, which was introduced by Senator Murray today. This bill will \nauthorize increases in the funding levels for agricultural market \naccess and development programs in 2001 and 2002. These programs \nprovide matching funds to assure aggressive marketing of our \nagricultural products in the international markets.\n  U.S. exports of high-value and consumer-oriented agricultural \nproducts have increased steadily in recent years but are facing stiff \ncompetition from foreign sources. In 1998 foreign competitors outspent \nthe U.S. by nearly 4 to 1 on export promotion activities. The Market \nAccess Program is a cost-sharing approach to help U.S. farmers and \ngrowers close this funding gap. Program funds are used to generically \nsupport important Washington agricultural products.\n  Washington State depends on agriculture to provide jobs, particularly \nin Eastern Washington which has been left out of the prosperity of the \nPuget Sound region. Apple growers in the Yakima valley must have new \nmarkets if their businesses are to survive and prosper. Eastern \nWashington needs these jobs and we need this program.\n  Export markets provide some of the best economic support to the \nagricultural community. Agricultural products are an important part of \nthe dynamic market mix that makes Washington a thriving, productive \neconomic area. The matching funding of the Market Access Program helps \nto provide support and encouragement for the farmers and growers so \nimportant to Washington State and the Northwest.\n  I thank Senator Murray for the leadership she has shown in promoting \nand protecting our agricultural interests. I look forward to continuing \nclose cooperation with Senator Murray, other members of the Washington \nState delegation, as well as State and local leaders to support our \nvalued agricultural interests.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Chafee, \n        Mr. Reid, Ms. Collins, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Corzine, \n        Mr. Durbin, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Biden, Mr. Feingold, and Mr. \n        Specter):\n  S. 367. A bill to prohibit the application of certain restrictive \neligibility requirements to foreign nongovernmental organizations with \nrespect to the provision of assistance under part I of the Foreign \nAssistance Act of 1961; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, within 48 hours of assuming the \nPresidency, President Bush issued a policy that will hurt the women of \nthe world. A policy that takes us back to the 1980s, rather than ahead \nto the new century.\n  His policy, the Mexico City gag rule, cuts U.S. funding to any \norganization that uses its own funds to provide abortion services. It \neven cuts U.S. funds if the organization uses its own funds to simply \ncounsel women on all their options which include abortions.\n  As a result, many organizations will be forced to either limit their \nservices or simply close their doors to women across the world. And, \nthis will cause women and families increased misery and death.\n  The current facts are chilling.\n  Approximately 78,000 women throughout the world die each year as a \nresult of unsafe abortions. At least one-fourth of all unsafe abortions \nin the world are to girls aged 15-19. By 2015, contraceptive needs in \ndeveloping countries will grow by more than 40 percent.\n  Make no mistake, the Mexican city gag rule will restrict family \nplanning, not abortions.\n  The media has mistakenly portrayed the Mexico City policy. I think we \nneed to be clear of what this policy does and does not do:\n  It does not change the fact that no United States funds can be used \nfor abortion services. That is already law, and has been since 1973. It \ndoes restrict foreign organizations in ways that would be \nunconstitutional here at home.\n  It is puzzling for me to understand how anyone could fail to realize \nthat family planning is crucial to preventing abortions.\n  According to Population Action International, research shows that \nhigher levels of contraception use are associated with lower reliance \non abortion.\n  For example, the recent increased availability of modern family \nplanning methods has already resulted in a 33 percent drop in the \nabortion rate in Russia and a 60 percent reduction in Hungary.\n  Additionally, we know that young girls between the ages of 15 and 19 \nare\n\n[[Page S1507]]\n\ntwice as likely to die in childbirth as older mothers. Talk about a \npolicy that is cruel to girls and young women--this is it.\n  Family planning can significantly improve the health of these girls \nand young women by teaching them to postpone childbearing until the \nhealthiest times in their life, which would in turn prevent abortions.\n\n  However, as a result of the harsh penalties imposed by the Mexico \nCity gag rule, family planning groups will not be able to adequately \ncounsel these desperate women.\n  Picture a woman who has already walked sometimes half a day to get to \nthe nearest clinic. How can we expect these clinics to then tell this \nwoman who is seeking services on her own volition, that they cannot \ncounsel her on the full array of her legal options when there is no \nother clinic within a hundred miles of them?\n  Additionally, the Mexico City policy goes against a fundamental tenet \nof American society . . . freedom of speech.\n  That is why today in the Senate today, I am introducing the \nbipartisan ``Global Democracy Promotion Act.''\n  The Boxer-Snowe bill aims to overturn the draconian restrictions \nplace upon international family planning programs put in place by \nPresident Bush on January 22. Our bill will allow these organizations \nto continue to provide legal family planning services without \nneedlessly restricting their funds.\n  Family planning organizations should not be prevented from using \ntheir own privately raised funds to provide legal abortion services, \nincluding counseling and referral services.\n  These groups should not be forced to relinquish their right to free \nspeech in order to receive United States funding. This type of \nrestriction is un-American and undermines our key foreign policy goal \nof supporting democracy worldwide.\n  The true bipartisan consensus is that family planning organizations \nshould be supported, not punished, for helping women in need. We hope \nPresident Bush will change his mind and reverse his order. If not, we \nwill work hard to overturn it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 367\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Global Democracy Promotion \n     Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is a fundamental principle of American medical \n     ethics and practice that health care providers should, at all \n     times, deal honestly and openly with patients. Any attempt to \n     subvert the private and sensitive physician-patient \n     relationship would be intolerable in the United States and is \n     an unjustifiable intrusion into the practices of health care \n     providers when attempted in other countries.\n       (2) Freedom of speech is a fundamental American value. The \n     ability to exercise the right to free speech, which includes \n     the ``right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to \n     petition the government for a redress of grievances'' is \n     essential to a thriving democracy and is protected under the \n     United States Constitution.\n       (3) The promotion of democracy is a principal goal of \n     United States foreign policy and critical to achieving \n     sustainable development. It is enhanced through the \n     encouragement of democratic institutions and the promotion of \n     an independent and politically active civil society in \n     developing countries.\n       (4) Limiting eligibility for United States development and \n     humanitarian assistance upon the willingness of a foreign \n     nongovernmental organization to forgo its right to use its \n     own funds to address, within the democratic process, a \n     particular issue affecting the citizens of its own country \n     directly undermines a key goal of United States foreign \n     policy and would violate the United States Constitution if \n     applied to United States-based organizations.\n       (5) Similarly, limiting the eligibility for United States \n     assistance on a foreign nongovernmental organization's \n     willingness to forgo its right to provide, with its own \n     funds, medical services that are legal in its own country and \n     would be legal if provided in the United States constitutes \n     unjustifiable interference with the ability of independent \n     organizations to serve the critical health needs of their \n     fellow citizens and demonstrates a disregard and disrespect \n     for the laws of sovereign nations as well as for the laws of \n     the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. ASSISTANCE FOR FOREIGN NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS \n                   UNDER PART I OF THE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE ACT OF \n                   1961.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, regulation, or \n     policy, in determining eligibility for assistance authorized \n     under part I of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. \n     2151 et seq.), foreign nongovernmental organizations--\n       (1) shall not be ineligible for such assistance solely on \n     the basis of health or medical services including counseling \n     and referral services, provided by such organizations with \n     non-United States Government funds if such services do not \n     violate the laws of the country in which they are being \n     provided and would not violate United States Federal law if \n     provided in the United States; and\n       (2) shall not be subject to requirements relating to the \n     use of non-United States Government funds for advocacy and \n     lobbying activities other than those that apply to United \n     States nongovernmental organizations receiving assistance \n     under part I of such Act.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my strong \nsupport for the ``Global Democracy Act of 2001'', introduced by my \nfriend and colleague from California, Senator Boxer.\n  Last month, President Bush announced that he was reinstating the \n``global gag rule'' restricting United States assistance to \ninternational family planning organizations. I was extremely \ndisappointed and amazed that the President opted to start his \nAdministration with such a divisive action.\n  If women are to be able to better their own lives and the lives of \ntheir families, they must have access to the educational and medical \nresources needed to control their reproductive destinies and their \nhealth. International family planning programs reduce poverty, improve \nhealth, and raise living standards around the world; they enhance the \nability of couples and individuals to determine the number and spacing \nof their children.\n  The ``Global Democracy Promotion Act of 2001'' will allow foreign Non \nGovernmental Organizations that receive U.S. family planning assistance \nto use non-U.S. funds to provide legal abortion services, including \ncounseling and referrals and will lift the restrictions on lobbying and \nadvocacy.\n  The United States must reclaim its leadership role on international \nfamily planning and reproductive issues. The United States must renew \nits commitment to help those around the world who need and want our \nhelp and assistance. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                   ____\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN (for himself and Mr. Hollings):\n  S. 368. A bill to develop voluntary consensus standards to ensure \naccuracy and validation of the voting process, to direct the Director \nof the National Institute of Standards and Technology to study voter \nparticipation and emerging voting technology, to provide grants to \nStates to improve voting methods, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, on behalf of the nearly 280 million \nAmericans in this country, today I am introducing the American Voting \nStandards and Technology Act. After one of the closest and most \ncontested elections in our Nation's history, Americans want to have \ncomplete confidence in the electoral process. We can accomplish that \ngoal by ridding politics of large, unregulated contributions, and by \nensuring that every vote is counted and recorded accurately.\n  The key to achieving meaningful reform and to restoring Americans' \nfaith in government, is finding both a short-term and a long-term \nsolution to the widespread abuses of the past election. I have devised \na two-pronged strategy toward realizing these necessary changes in our \nelectoral system. First, on January 22, Senator Feingold and I \nintroduced the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2001. This measure \nbans soft money contributions, restricts corporate and union spending \non electioneering ads, and provides for greater disclosure and stronger \nelection laws. I look forward to bringing campaign finance reform back \nto the floor next month.\n  The bill that I am introducing today represents the second part of my \nelectoral reform strategy. One of the most flagrant violations of our \ndemocratic electoral process was highlighted this past November by the \noverwhelming number of precincts who reported voting machine flaws. \nThis is an embarrassment to our democracy. The American Voting \nStandards and Technology\n\n[[Page S1508]]\n\nAct was written to directly address the root of these voting \ncontroversies--the actual machines. In the 2000 election, pre-scored \npunch-card ballots were used by one in three voters. These archaic \n``votomatic'' machines, engineered in the 1960's, continue to be \nemployed throughout the country, yet their ability to accurately record \nvoters is questionable. In 1988, The National Institute of Standards \nand Technology, NIST, recommended the elimination of prescored ballot \ncards, but this recommendation was unfortunately never heeded.\n  To compound the problems with pre-scored punch cards, numerous \nstudies reveal that throughout the country, ballots cast by African \nAmericans were nullified at a much higher rate than those of \nCaucasians. In Atlanta's Fulton County, which uses old punch-card \nvoting machines, one of every 16 ballots for president was invalidated, \nwhile two largely white neighboring counties, Cobb and Gwinnett, using \nmore modern equipment had a rate of 1 in 200. Similar patterns were \nfound in Florida and Illinois. We cannot encourage and expect every \nAmerican to vote if we ignore the inequalities that are inherent in our \nentire voting system.\n  The National Association of Secretaries of States recently issued \nfifteen recommendations aimed at avoiding the problems of last year's \npresidential election. The resolution recommends that States: Ensure \nequal access to the election system for the elderly, disabled, and \nminority communities; modernize voting machines and equipment; and \nconduct aggressive voter education and outreach programs. The \nresolution also advocates that Congress authorize an update of the \nvoluntary federal voting standards and fund the development of \nvoluntary management standards for each voting system. Senator Hollings \nand I have written the American Voting Standards and Technology Act in \nresponse to these recommendations.\n  This legislation that we are introducing today has three targets: \nFirst, it directs NIST to develop voluntary consensus standards to \nensure the accuracy and validation of the voting process. Second, it \nauthorizes matching grants to State agencies to purchase new or \nrehabilitated voting equipment to improve the ability of the public to \ncast a timely and accurate vote for the candidate of their choice. \nFinally, it authorizes grants throughout the Department of Commerce to \nState agencies to strengthen voter education campaigns. Both Senator \nHollings and I have been working closely with NIST to begin this \nprocess now so that the next election will not bring the same confusion \nand frustration at the polls.\n  How can we encourage young Americans to vote if they believe their \nvote may not be counted? We must modernize our voting machinery and \nimprove our voting process without barraging the States and local \ngovernments with excessive rules and regulations. The American Voting \nStandards and Technology Act accomplishes these goals.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, it has been said that there's no system \nworse than democracy--except for all of the other ones. What this \naphorism reveals is that though democracy, in its republican form of \nelections, is the best form of government that we know of at this \npoint, it nevertheless has its shortcomings, be they human or \nmechanical. A close election certainly tends to highlight these human \nand mechanical flaws in our voting systems. This was never more proven \nthan by last year's Presidential election. Last November and December \nstories of overvotes, undervotes, and hanging chads flooded the media. \nMany voters complained that confusing butterfly ballots led them to \nmake unintended choices, while others claimed they were denied the \nopportunity to vote by being left off of the registration rolls or \nthrough intimidation.\n  Unfortunately, these problems are not new. We've had difficulties \nusing punch cards and other machine-readable ballots for more than 30 \nyears. Federal officials were made aware of these issues as early as \n1978, by a National Bureau of Standards, now NIST, study, Science & \nTechnology: Effective Use of Computing Technology in Vote-Tallying. \nThat study--and another in 1988--found difficulties in vote-tallying \nstemming from management failures, technology failures, and human \noperational failures. The 1978 report cited major difficulties in 7 \ncities. One of the key recommendations was the elimination of the pre-\nscored punch card, similar to the kind used in Palm Beach County's \nVotomatic machines.\n  We know that there is a problem, the question is what are we going to \ndo about it? Senator McCain and I have one answer--the American Voting \nStandards and Technology Act, which we are introducing today. In short, \nthe Act would direct the National Institute of Standards and Technology \nto develop voluntary consensus standards to ensure the accuracy and \nvalidation of the voting process from voter registration through any \nrecount. Quite simply, NIST knows standards--it has been in the \nstandards game for over 100 years. Its experts know how to work with \nstakeholders like state and local governments and private sector \ntechnology leaders to build valid, usable, reliable standards that \npeople trust. The agency updates its standards regularly.\n  NIST's voluntary voting standards could set a threshold for accuracy, \nmaintenance, and usability of voting systems that would feed into the \nsecond leg of our program--matching grants to State and local \ngovernment agencies to purchase new or rehabilitated voting equipment. \nWe want to give priority in this program to the places least able to \nafford state of the art voting equipment--the precincts with high \nunemployment and low income levels.\n  However, because we don't want to buy new equipment if no one knows \nhow to use it, our bill would authorize the Department of Commerce to \ngive grants to State agencies to strengthen voter education campaigns. \nWe want voters to understand how to use the technology that is in their \npolling place and how to determine if their vote will be correctly \ncounted.\n  The right to vote is the most fundamental right bestowed upon \nAmericans by the U.S. Constitution. There are millions of Americans who \nlost faith in the guarantee and exercise of this fundamental right due \nto the circumstances of the last election. Senator McCain and I do not \nclaim to know how to restore the American people's faith in our voting \nsystems. However, we do have an idea that setting basic performance \nstandards, helping election officials acquire systems which meet those \nstandards, and helping voters use those systems is part of the \nsolution. When we return from the President's Day recess, we plan to \nschedule hearings to work through the details of our legislation and \nimprove it. We realize that our American Voting Standards and \nTechnology Act is only one piece of the pie, and we also look forward \nto working with other Senators who are examining other aspects of the \nelectoral system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Conrad, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 369.

A bill to establish and expand child opportunity zone family \ncenters in public elementary schools and secondary schools, and for \ntheir purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that \nseeks to remove barriers to learning by encouraging communities to \ncoordinate community services through school-based or school-linked \nfamily centers. These centers would provide a comprehensive array of \ninformation, support, services, and activities to improve the \neducation, health, mental health, safety, and economic well-being of \nchildren and their families.\n  As we strive to ensure the academic and future success of our \nstudents, we must recognize that the increasingly complex needs of \nchildren cannot be met by our schools and teachers alone. Children \nbring many social, health, and family problems to school, which leaves \nthem in no shape to learn.\n  Some facts to illustrate this point:\n  Today, 7.5 million children under the age of 18 require mental health \nservices, while the National Institute of Mental Health estimates that \nfewer than one in five receive the help they need.\n  11.3 million children--more than 90 percent of them in working \nfamilies--have no health insurance.\n  It is estimated that nearly five million school-age children spend \ntime without adult supervision during a typical week. Meanwhile, FBI \ndata show that the peak hours for violent juvenile crime occur during \nthe after-school hours of 3:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m.\n  Also according to the FBI, juveniles accounted for 17 percent of all \nviolent crime arrests in 1997, and juveniles are victims in nearly 25 \npercent of all crimes.\n  Programs and services exist to deal with these and other needs facing \nchildren--SCHIP, WIC, and after school programs, to name a few. \nHowever, too many children can't access such programs and services, \nand, consequently, too many children don't get the help they need. This \nis because these services are often too disjointed and fragmented, \nmaking it difficult for many families to find a point of entry. This \nproblem is especially acute in low-income urban and rural areas.\n  To address these and other serious issues facing our children and \nfamilies, a few states and localities have established centers and \ndeveloped programs designed to provide families with access and \nlinkages to needed social services, like health and mental health care, \nnutritional programs, child care, housing, and job training, in a \nlocation that is easily accessed by families--their children's school. \nThe aim of my legislation is to support and expand such efforts.\n  Research indicates that school-linked family center programs are a \ncost-effective way to provide supports to children and families. \nAccording to a report by the Department of Education's Northeast and \nIslands Regional Educational Laboratory, school-linked services can \nalso ``help to increase student achievement, save money and reduce \noverlapping services, reach those children and families most in need, \nmake schools more welcoming to families, increase community support for \nthe school, and help at-risk families develop the capacity to manage \ntheir own lives successfully.'' Moreover, according to a 1999 American \nAssociation of School Administrators Nationwide Survey, 82 percent of \nparents would like family centers in their schools to help improve \ntheir schools.\n  My legislation, the Child Opportunity Zone Family Center Act, builds \non a successful model in my home state of Rhode Island, the Rhode \nIsland Child Opportunity Zone (COZ) Family Center initiative, as well \nas Kentucky's Family Resource and Youth Service Centers, and \nMinnesota's Family Service program.\n  The Child Opportunity Zone Family Center Act, which is supported by \nmore than 30 health, education, and children's organizations, would \nprovide grants on a competitive basis to partnerships consisting of a \nhigh poverty public school; school district; other public agency, such \nas a department of health or social services; and non-profit community \norganizations. Partnerships would be required to complete a needs \nassessment, and then use this information to provide children and \nfamilies with linkages to existing community prevention and \nintervention services in core areas such as education, child care, non-\nschool hours care and enrichment programs, health services, mental \nhealth services, nutrition, family support, literacy services, \nparenting skills, and dropout prevention. In addition, partnerships \nwould provide violence prevention education to children and families, \nas well as training to enable families to help their children meet \nchallenging standards and succeed in school.\n  The guiding principle of Rhode Island's COZ Family Centers is to help \nchildren and families get the assistance they need so children are \nready to learn in the classroom. This principle is reflected in my \nlegislation, which contains accountability provisions to ensure that \npartnerships focus on improvements in student achievement, family \nparticipation in schools, access to health care, mental health care, \nchild care, as well as family support services, and work to reduce \nviolence among youth, truancy, suspension, and dropout rates in order \nto continue to receive funding.\n  As we again begin to consider the reauthorization of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act, I believe that it is critical that we do \nall we can to provide a seamless, integrated system of support for \nchildren and families. By giving families an opportunity to get the \nsupport they need, we can truly help children come to school ready to \nlearn and in turn help children succeed in school and life. I urge my \ncolleagues to cosponsor this important legislation and work for its \ninclusion in the upcoming reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record along with a letter of support.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 371\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Reed \n     COZ bill would ensure the coordination of services in order \n     to remove barriers to learning. According to a report of the \n     Northeast and Islands Regional Educational Laboratory, \n     school-linked services ``help to increase student \n     achievement, save money, and reduce overlapping services, \n     reach those children and families most in need, make schools \n     more welcoming to families, increase community support for \n     the school, and help at-risk families develop the capacity to \n     manage their own lives successfully.''\n       Unfortunately, too many children today are struggling with \n     a variety of problems that make their ability to meet \n     challenging academic standards much more difficult. \n     Inadequate access to health care, lack of family and child \n     mental health services, poor nutrition, abuse, and other \n     social ills undercut these children's ability to succeed in \n     the classroom and in their daily lives. The coordination of \n     schools with the range of supportive services that children \n     and families need is particularly important in low-income \n     urban and rural areas. Families that need and would otherwise \n     be eligible to receive services simply cannot access them \n     without coordination at or through the schools.\n       The Reed COZ bill draws on successful efforts already \n     underway in some areas. Kentucky's Family Resource and Youth \n     Service Centers, Minnesota's Family Service program, and \n     Rhode Island's Child Opportunity Zone Family Center \n     Initiative need to be replicated more widely. The current \n     barriers to these important services are pervasive in every \n     state. We believe that these proposed grants are critical to \n     helping schools and school districts partner with communities \n     and parents to make possible the school-\n\n[[Page S1511]]\n\n     linked or school-based coordination of the necessary services \n     for strengthening our nation's children.\n       Once again, we thank you for introducing the Reed Child \n     Opportunity Zone Family Center Act.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to strengthen the involvement of parents in the education of their \nchildren, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Parent Act, \nwhich seeks to increase parental involvement in the educational lives \nof their children.\n  Research, experience, and reason tell us that providing parents with \nopportunities to play active roles in their children's schools empowers \nthem to help their children excel. When parents are actively involved \nin their child's education, not only does their own child go further, \nbut their child's school also improves to the benefit of all students. \nIndeed, as I have witnessed in Rhode Island, and I am sure my \ncolleagues can attest to this in their states, our best schools are not \nsimply those with the finest teachers and principals, but those which \nstrive to engage parents in the education of their children.\n  Research shows that regardless of economic, ethnic, or cultural \nbackground, parental involvement is a major factor in determining a \nchild's academic success. Parental involvement contributes to better \ngrades and test scores, higher homework completion rates, better \nattendance, and greater discipline. Further, when parental involvement \nis a school priority, schools have fewer failing students, achieve \nbetter reputations in the community, and show improvements in staff \nmorale.\n  In 1999, the American Association of School Administrators conducted \na nationwide survey and found that 96 percent of parents believe that \nparental involvement is critical for a student to succeed in school and \nthat 84 percent believe in parent involvement so strongly that they are \nwilling to require such involvement. Further, a recent National PTA \nsurvey revealed that 91 percent of parents recognize that it is \nextremely important for parents to be involved in their children's \nschool. Unfortunately, even as we extol the virtue of parental \ninvolvement, we must recognize that reality falls far short of that \ngoal. The National PTA survey also found that roughly half the parents \nsurveyed felt they were inadequately informed about ways in which they \ncould participate in schools, or even gain access to basic information \nabout their children's studies and their children's teachers. There are \nalso other obstacles to greater parental involvement, such as working \nparents who find it difficult to get to schools and be involved or \nparents who have had negative schooling experiences and are wary of \nentering schools to participate in their children's education.\n  With more than 90 percent of parents believing that parental \ninvolvement is critical to a child's academic achievement and less than \n50 percent of parents believing that their schools adequately involve \nthem in their children's education, the reauthorization of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA provides an opportunity to \nhelp bring schools and parents together, and to ensure parents have the \ntools to become meaningfully and effectively involved in their \nchildren's education. While the ESEA currently contains parental \ninvolvement provisions, they mainly apply to Title I schools and \nstudents, and have not been fully implemented.\n  That is why I am pleased to be joined by Senators Wellstone and \nMurray and Representative Lynn Woolsey in the other body in introducing \nthe Parent Act. This legislation would amend the ESEA to bolster \nexisting, and add new, parental involvement provisions.\n  The Parent Act requires that all schools implement effective, \nresearch-based parental involvement best practices, and it provides \ntechnical assistance to schools that are having problems implementing \nparental involvement programs. My bill also seeks to improve parental \naccess to information about their children's education and a school's \nparental involvement policies; ensure that professional development \nactivities provide training to teachers and administrators on how to \nfoster relationships with parents and encourage parental involvement; \nutilize technology to expand efforts to connect schools and teachers \nwith parents; and promote parental involvement in drug and violence \nprevention programs. Further, the bill requires each local district to \nmake available to parents an annual report card which explains how a \nschool is performing with respect to student achievement, teacher \nqualification, class size, school safety, drop-out rates, the actions \nthe school is taking to involve parents in school activities and \ndecision making, and other school performance indicators.\n  The Parent Act also offers $500 million for school districts, with \nstrict accountability measures, to supplement and support recognized \nand proven initiatives that improve student achievement through \nparental involvement. Currently, section 1118 of Title I requires \ndistricts to develop written parental involvement policies and requires \nschools to develop school-parent compacts, hold annual meetings for \nparents at schools, and involve parents in school review and \nimprovement policies and plans. Local districts are required to spend 1 \npercent of their Title I allotment for this purpose, unless that 1 \npercent amounts to less than $5,000. In Rhode Island, however, in only \n9 of the 34 districts that receive Title I funds is this amount above \n$5,000, and this situation is similar across the nation. In fact, the \nFinal Report of the National Assessment of Title I found that a quarter \nof Title I schools do not have required school-parent compacts, more \nthan four years after they were required. As Secretary Paige stated at \nhis confirmation hearing, ``increased assistance will be needed'' to \nenhance parental involvement.\n  Last Congress, during the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee debate on ESEA, many provisions of the Parent Act were added \nto S. 2, the ESEA reauthorization bill. But S. 2 did not go far enough \nto ensure the parental involvement provisions of ESEA are actually \nimplemented. The accountability provisions of the Parent Act and its \ngrant resources are essential to making sure all of the elements for \neffective parental involvement are in place.\n  To succeed in the endeavor of increasing parental involvement, we \nmust depend on parents, teachers, and school administrators throughout \nthe country to work collaboratively to implement effective programs. \nHowever, federal leadership is needed to provide schools, teachers, and \nparents with the tools required for this task.\n  The bottom line of federal support for education is to increase \nstudent\n\n[[Page S1512]]\n\nachievement. Parental involvement is essential to ensuring that our \nstudents succeed. This legislation is strongly supported by the \nNational PTA, and I urge my colleagues to join Senators Wellstone and \nMurray, Representative Woolsey, and me in supporting the Parent Act, \nand working for its inclusion in the ESEA reauthorization.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 372\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Parents are the first and most influential educators of \n     their children.\n       (2) The Federal Government must provide leadership, \n     technical assistance, and financial support to States and \n     local educational agencies, as partners, in helping the \n     agencies implement successful and effective parental \n     involvement policies and programs that lead to improved \n     student achievement.\n       (3) State and local education officials, as well as \n     teachers, principals, and other staff at the school level, \n     must work as partners with the parents of the children they \n     serve.\n       (4) Research has documented that, regardless of the \n     economic, ethnic, or cultural background of the family, \n     parental involvement in a child's education is a major factor \n     in determining success in school.\n       (5) Parental involvement in a child's education contributes \n     to positive outcomes such as improved grades and test scores, \n     higher expectations for student achievement, better school \n     attendance, improved homework completion rates, decreased \n     violence and substance abuse, and higher rates of graduation \n     and enrollment in postsecondary education.\n       (6) Numerous education laws now require meaningful parental \n     involvement, including title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.), the \n     Goals 2000: Educate America Act (20 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.), the \n     Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et seq.), and the Individuals \n     with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.), and \n     elements of these laws should be extended to other Federal \n     education programs.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to provide for the professional development of \nelementary and secondary school educators; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Professional \nDevelopment Reform Act to strengthen and improve professional \ndevelopment opportunities for teachers and administrators.\n  I have long worked to improve the quality of teaching in America's \nclassrooms for the simple reason that well-trained and well-prepared \nteachers and principals are central to improving the academic \nperformance and achievement of students. In the 105th Congress, I \nintroduced the TEACH Act to reform the way our prospective teachers are \ntrained, and I was pleased that this legislation was included in the \nHigher Education Act Amendments of 1998.\n  As Congress turns to the reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, ESEA, the focus shifts to increasing support \nfor both new and veteran classroom teachers, as well as school \nprincipals.\n  Research shows that professional development programs, however, too \noften consist of fragmented, one-shot workshops, at which teachers \npassively listen to experts, and lack significant opportunity for \nteacher interaction. The Department of Education recently evaluated the \nEisenhower Professional Development program and found that the vast \nmajority of professional development opportunities are not of \nsufficient duration or intensity to generate significant improvements \nin teaching. Other studies support that finding and show that such \nprofessional development fails to improve or even impact teaching \npractice.\n  We do not expect students to learn their ``ABCs'' after one day of \nlessons, and we should not expect a one-day professional development \nworkshop to yield the desired results. Indeed, the Department of \nEducation found that teaching would improve if teachers experienced \nconsistent, high-quality professional development.\n  Moreover, a recent survey of teachers found that professional \ndevelopment is too short-term and lacks intensity. In fact, recent \nstudies indicated that the majority of teachers participated in\n\n[[Page S1515]]\n\nprofessional development activities from one to eight hours, or for no \nmore than one day a year.\n  As a consequence, only about 1 in 5 teachers felt very well prepared \nfor addressing the needs of students with limited English proficiency, \nthose from culturally diverse backgrounds, and those with disabilities, \nor integrating educational technology into the curriculum.\n  There is also widespread agreement that a good principal is the \nkeystone of a good school. However, there is great concern that the \nsupply of quality principals may not meet the increasing demand for \nquality school leadership. Unfortunately, the depth and quality of \nsupport and development programs for both new and veteran principals \nvaries widely, which creates another gap in our education system.\n  I am introducing legislation today which would reform professional \ndevelopment for teachers and principals.\n  There is broad consensus among experts about the elements that truly \nconstitute an effective professional development program. Research \nshows that effective professional development approaches are sustained, \nintensive activities that focus on deepening teachers knowledge of \ncontent; allow teachers to work collaboratively; provide opportunities \nfor teachers to practice and reflect upon their teaching; are aligned \nwith standards and embedded in the daily work of the school; and \ninvolve parents and other community members.\n  Such high-quality professional development improves student \nachievement. Indeed, a 1998 study in California found that the more \nteachers were engaged in ongoing, curriculum-centered professional \ndevelopment, the higher their students scored on mathematics \nachievement on the state's assessment. Further, Community School \nDistrict 2 in New York City has seen its investment in sustained, \nintensive professional development pay off with significant increases \nin student achievement. Professional development in District 2 is \ndelivered in schools and classrooms and focused on system-wide \ninstructional improvement, with intensive activities such as \nobservation of exemplary teachers and classrooms both inside and \noutside the district, supervised practice, peer networks, and offsite \ntraining opportunities. I have visited District 2 and have seen this \noutstanding professional development first hand.\n  My legislation builds on these successful models and the research on \neffective professional development to create a new formula program for \nhigh-quality professional development that is sustained, collaborative, \ncontent-centered, embedded in the daily work of the school, and aligned \nwith standards and school reform efforts.\n  To achieve this enhanced professional development, my legislation \nfunds the following activities: mentoring; peer observation and \ncoaching; curriculum-based content training; dedicated time for \ncollaborative lesson planning; opportunities for teachers to visit \nother classrooms to model effective teaching practice; training on \nintegrating technology into the curriculum, addressing the specific \nneeds of diverse students, and involving parents; professional \ndevelopment networks to provide a forum for interaction and exchange of \ninformation among teachers and administrators; as well as release time \nand compensation for mentors and substitute teachers to make these \nactivities possible.\n  The Professional Development Reform Act also requires partnerships \nbetween elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher \neducation for providing training opportunities, including advanced \ncontent area courses and training to address teacher shortages. In \nfact, Department of Education data show that the Eisenhower \nProfessional Development program activities are most effective when \nthey are sponsored by institutions of higher education.\n  My legislation will also provide funding for leadership training to \nencourage highly qualified individuals to become principals, and to \ndevelop and enhance leadership, management, parental involvement, and \nmentoring skills for principals and superintendents. Indeed, ensuring \nthat our principals have the training and support to serve as \ninstructional leaders is critical. Further, my legislation will provide \nfunding for programs to encourage highly qualified and effective \nteachers to become mentoring teachers.\n  We know that our schools with the highest percentage of poverty have \nthe greatest need for professional development improvement and \nresources, and that is why my bill targets funding to these schools.\n  Importantly, the Professional Development Reform Act offers resources \nbut it demands results. The bill's strong accountability provisions \nrequire that school districts and schools which receive funding \nactually improve student performance and increase participation in \nsustained professional development in three years in order to secure \nadditional funding.\n  In sum, my legislation seeks to ensure that new teachers and \nprincipals have the support they need to be successful educators, that \nall teachers have access to high quality professional development \nregardless of the content areas they teach, and that professional \ndevelopment does not isolate teachers, but rather brings teachers \ntogether as part of a coordinated and comprehensive strategy aligned \nwith standards.\n  The time for action is now because schools must hire an estimated 2.2 \nmillion new teachers over the next decade due to increasing \nenrollments, the retirement of approximately half of our current \nteaching force, and high attrition rates. Ensuring that teachers and \nprincipals have the training, assistance, and support to increase \nstudent achievement and sustain them throughout their careers is a \ngreat challenge. But we must meet and overcome this challenge if we are \nto reform education and prepare our children for the 21st Century. The \nProfessional Development Reform Act, by increasing our professional \ndevelopment investment and focusing it on the kind of activities and \nopportunities for teachers and administrators that research shows is \neffective, is critical to this effort.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this essential endeavor by \ncosponsoring this legislation and working for its inclusion in the \nreauthorization of the ESEA.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nlegislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 373\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the operation by the National Guard of \ncounterdrug schools, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to draw my colleagues' attention \nto the critical role our National Guard plays in efforts to rid our \ncountry of illegal drugs--a role that I believe should be expanded. The \nGuard operates several regional support schools around the nation, that \nfacilitate valuable training for state and local law enforcement \nagencies. These schools are dedicated to teaching counterdrug-related \nskills to State and local law enforcement agencies and community based \norganizations. These counterdrug schools provide training to thousands \nof people each year that would otherwise not be able to receive it for \na lack of resources.\n  Operating under the authority of Title 32, United States Code, \nSection 112, the National Guard actively supports local, state, and \nfederal law enforcement agencies and community based antidrug \ncoalitions. As a part of this effort, the National Guard currently \noperates four schools that provide unique and invaluable assistance to \nthose individuals at the forefront of our country's drug interdiction \nand demand reduction effort. These schools, located in Pennsylvania, \nFlorida, Mississippi, and California, have proved their effectiveness \nin developing training and educational opportunities for local law \nenforcement officials--opportunities that would not otherwise exist.\n  I note, however, that the vagaries in funding and geographical \ndistribution of the existing schools have limited the effectiveness of \nthese training programs. Our national drug problem is not a coastal \nproblem, but affects all communities throughout the United States. I \nbelieve we need a more centrally located school to provide more \naccessible training in the Midwest and Northwest United States.\n  In addition to the need for a fifth school in the upper-Midwest, we \nshould also consider the current budgeting process for these schools. I \nbelieve a critical element in achieving quality training for law \nenforcement and being cost-effective at the same time must include a \nunified National Guard Counterdrug schools budget which fully funds the \nschools. Rather than being pieced together from the National Guard \nState budgets, Defense Department support, and Congressional line \nitems, there should be a discrete item for these National Guard schools \nso Congress can have a clearer idea of the mission, the funding, and \nthe accomplishments of these schools.\n  Today, joining with my colleagues Senator Harkin and Senator Cochran, \nI am introducing legislation that will accomplish these objectives. \nThis legislation clarifies the authorities of the National Guard Bureau \nto operate the four existing counterdrug schools. In addition, it would \nestablish one additional school in Iowa to serve law enforcement \nagencies in the Midwest and Northwest United States. It will establish \na separate line of funding for these counterdrug schools with an \nauthorized funding level of $25 million for FY 2002.\n  I want to take a moment to say something additional about the fifth \nschool (Midwest Counterdrug Training Center, MCTC, to be established at \nCamp Dodge, located in Johnston, Iowa. Designed to fulfill a need for \ntraining in the Midwest and Northwest United States, it would be \nprimarily supported by the Iowa National Guard, and serve as a training \ncenter for State and local law enforcement agencies in the Midwest and \nNorthwest United States. Camp Dodge has much of the physical \ninfrastructure necessary for the school, including housing and being \nthe hub for a state-wide fiber optic network that allows for live, two \nway video and audio communication between Camp Dodge and every National \nGuard Armory and school district in the State of Iowa.\n  I hope all of my colleagues will join me in supporting this \nlegislation, which I now send to the desk and ask that it be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 374\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I am introducing two bills that I \nbelieve will help address a critical need for Iowa state and local law \nenforcement.\n  These bills, which would provide needed training assistance in \nnarcotics as well as overall law enforcement, are based on my \nconversations with Iowa law enforcement officials last summer.\n  The National Guard Counter Drug Schools Act, which I am cosponsoring \nwith my colleague from Iowa, Senator Grassley, would create a new \ncounterdrug training school at Camp Dodge in Johnston, Iowa that law \nenforcement can use for the specialized training on drug \ninvestigations, including those cases that involve methamphetamine.\n  The National Guard has four of these centers in Florida, \nPennsylvania, California and Mississippi. But, Senator Grassley and I \nrecognized the need for one in the Midwest--to help state and local law \nenforcement in their efforts to reduce the supply and demand of \nmethamphetamine and other dangerous drugs.\n  The second one, which I am cosponsoring with Senator Hutchinson from \nArkansas, would focus on rural law enforcement--and would provide new \ntraining and assistance resources for small town sheriff and police \ndepartments.\n  Right now, rural law enforcement officers in Iowa and across the \ncountry have limited resources where they can get continued training \nfor general investigations, the latest in forensics technology and \ntechnical assistance.\n  One place where many of them go is the National Center for Rural Law \nEnforcement in Little Rock, Arkansas. But, these small departments need \nsomething that's closer to home.\n  The Rural Law Enforcement Assistance Act would bring the Center \ncloser to these officers by expanding the center into branches in eight \nregions across the country.\n  I believe these two bills will help ensure that rural law enforcement \nagencies receive the training and assistance they need to make their \ncommunities safer.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Harkin, \n        Mr. Feingold, Mr. Reed, Mr. Jeffords, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 375. A bill to provide assistance to East Timor to facilitate the \ntransition of East Timor to an independent nation, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, along with Senators Chafee, Leahy, \nHarkin, Feingold, Reed, Jeffords, and Kerry, I am introducing \nlegislation to help facilitate East Timor's transition to independence. \nCongressman Lantos, Congressman Chris Smith, and others have introduced \nidentical legislation in the House of Representatives.\n  In August 1999, after almost three decades of unrest under Indonesian \nrule, the people of East Timor voted overwhelmingly in favor of \nindependence.\n  They did so at great personal risk. Anti-independence militia groups \nkilled hundreds, hoping to intimidate and retaliate against those \nsupporting independence. The militias also destroyed or severely \ndamaged seventy percent of East Timor's infrastructure. Government \nservices and public security were severely undermined.\n  An international effort, led by Australia and including the United \nStates, brought much-needed stability to East Timor.\n  Now, under the United Nation's Transitional Authority, stability is \ntaking hold again in East Timor, and normal life is slowly returning.\n  In coming months, looking to America and other democratic nations as \nan example, East Timor's leaders will hold a constitutional convention \nto decide which form of democratic government to adopt. It is a process \nthat reminds us of our own Constitutional Convention and would make our \nFounding Fathers proud.\n  Late next year, after choosing a form of democratic government and \nelecting leaders, East Timor is expected to declare its independence as \nthe UN draws down. A new, democratic nation will take its rightful \nplace in the world.\n  This is a success story. It is a great success story. But it is far \nfrom over.\n  East Timor remains one of the poorest places in Asia. Only 20 percent \nof its population is literate. The annual per capita gross national \nproduce is $340.\n  The people of East Timor need and deserve our help. The extraordinary \nphysical and moral courage they demonstrated over the years is \nimpressive.\n\n[[Page S1519]]\n\nThe great faith in the democratic process they showed by voting for \nindependence under the barrel of a gun must not go unrewarded.\n  This bill is our chance to help them, and help now. Its purpose is to \nput U.S. governmental programs and resources in place now and to enable \nU.S. government agencies to focus on the imminent reality of an \nindependent East Timor. If we wait until East Timor declares its \nindependence before we do the preliminary work, we will lose crucial \ntime and do a disservice to both the United States and to East Timor.\n\n  Specifically, this bill lays the groundwork for establishing a firm \nbilateral and multilateral assistance structure.\n  It authorizes $25 million in bilateral assistance, $2 million for a \nPeace Corps presence and $1 million for a scholarship fund for East \nTimorese students to study in the United States.\n  It encourages the President, the Overseas Private Investment \nCorporation, the Trade and Development Agency and other agencies to put \nin place now the tools and programs to create an equitable trade and \ninvestment relationship.\n  It requires the State Department to establish an accredited mission \nto East Timor co-incident with independence.\n  And it authorizes the provision of excess defense articles and \ninternational military education and training, after the President \ncertifies that these articles and training are in the interests of the \nUnited States and will help promote human rights in East Timor and the \nprofessionalization of East Timor's armed services.\n  The people of East Timor have chosen democracy. The United States has \na golden opportunity to help them create their new democratic nation. \nBut we must prepare for that day now. We must not miss this rare \nopportunity to help.\n  I ask that a copy of the bill appear in the Record, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 375\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``East Timor Transition to \n     Independence Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On August 30, 1999, the East Timorese people voted \n     overwhelmingly in favor of independence from Indonesia. Anti-\n     independence militias, with the support of the Indonesian \n     military, attempted to prevent then retaliated against this \n     vote by launching a campaign of terror and violence, \n     displacing 500,000 people and murdering at least 1,000 \n     people.\n       (2) The violent campaign devastated East Timor's \n     infrastructure, destroyed or severely damaged 60 to 80 \n     percent of public and private property, and resulted in the \n     collapse of virtually all vestiges of government, public \n     services and public security.\n       (3) The Australian-led International Force for East Timor \n     (INTERFET) entered East Timor in September 1999 and \n     successfully restored order. On October 25, 1999, the United \n     Nations Transitional Administration for East Timor (UNTAET) \n     began to provide overall administration of East Timor, guide \n     the people of East Timor in the establishment of a new \n     democratic government, and maintain security and order.\n       (4) UNTAET and the East Timorese leadership currently \n     anticipate that East Timor will become an independent nation \n     as early as late 2001.\n       (5) East Timor is one of the poorest places in Asia. A \n     large percentage of the population live below the poverty \n     line, only 20 percent of East Timor's population is literate, \n     most of East Timor's people remain unemployed, the annual per \n     capita Gross National Product is $340, and life expectancy is \n     only 56 years.\n       (6) The World Bank and the United Nations have estimated \n     that it will require $300,000,000 in development assistance \n     over the next three years to meet East Timor's basic \n     development needs.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO SUPPORT FOR EAST TIMOR.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the United States should--\n       (1) facilitate East Timor's transition to independence, \n     support formation of broad-based democracy in East Timor, \n     help lay the groundwork for East Timor's economic recovery, \n     and strengthen East Timor's security;\n       (2) help ensure that the nature and pace of the economic \n     transition in East Timor is consistent with the needs and \n     priorities of the East Timorese people, that East Timor \n     develops a strong and independent economic infrastructure, \n     and that the incomes of the East Timorese people rise \n     accordingly;\n       (3) begin to lay the groundwork, prior to East Timor's \n     independence, for an equitable bilateral trade and investment \n     relationship;\n       (4)(A) officially open a diplomatic mission to East Timor \n     as soon as possible;\n       (B) recognize East Timor, and establish diplomatic \n     relations with East Timor, upon its independence; and\n       (C) ensure that a fully functioning, fully staffed, \n     adequately resourced, and securely maintained United States \n     diplomatic mission is accredited to East Timor upon its \n     independence;\n       (5) support efforts by the United Nations and East Timor to \n     ensure justice and accountability related to past atrocities \n     in East Timor through--\n       (A) United Nations investigations;\n       (B) development of East Timor's judicial system, including \n     appropriate technical assistance to East Timor from the \n     Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \n     and the Drug Enforcement Administration;\n       (C) the possible establishment of an international tribunal \n     for East Timor; and\n       (D) sharing with the United Nations Transitional \n     Administration for East Timor (UNTAET) and East Timorese \n     investigators any unclassified information relevant to past \n     atrocities in East Timor gathered by the United States \n     Government; and\n       (6)(A) as an interim step, support observer status for an \n     official delegation from East Timor to observe and \n     participate, as appropriate, in all deliberations of the \n     Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) group, the \n     Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and other \n     international institutions; and\n       (B) after East Timor achieves independence, support full \n     membership for East Timor in these and other international \n     institutions, as appropriate.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to modify \nfor fiscal years 2002 through 2004 the procedures relating to \nassistance for countries not cooperating in United States\n\n[[Page S1521]]\n\ncounterdrug efforts, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am sending to the desk a bill for \nmyself and Mr. DeWine to reform the current certification requirement \nfor international drug control. As many members know, I have been a \nstrong supporter of the drug certification process. I remain one. Of \nlate, however, we have seen a lot of criticism of the process. Some of \nthis has been by foreign countries and some here at home. Rather than \nanswer all of these criticisms, I want to take a few moments to address \nwhat I believe have been misconceptions about the process.\n  The first point I want to make is to remind my colleagues why \nCongress required certification in the first place. It arose because we \nbelieved that doing something here and overseas about the drug problem \nwas in the national interests. The public agreed. I might add the \npublic has not changed its mind. I don't believe that we ought to do so \neither.\n  Most of the drugs available in the United States today come from \noverseas. They are produced overseas and smuggled to this country. That \nproduction is illegal. It is illegal in international law. It is \nillegal in the domestic laws of all the countries where these drugs are \nproduced. It is illegal to smuggle the drugs. Here and abroad. The \nconsequences of that smuggling--illegal drugs on our streets--are felt \nin homes and neighborhoods and schools all across this country.\n  I continue to believe that it is in our interest to stop that \nproduction and flow. I own that we have an obligation to expect \ncountries to abide by international law, bilateral agreements, and \ntheir own legal codes on drug production and trafficking. I believe \nthat it is not just a quirk of U.S. interest to expect that we and \nothers commit ourselves to stopping this illegal production and trade. \nIn fact, I believe that we have a moral obligation to stop these \nactivities. In order to do that, we need a clear, knowable process that \nholds ourselves and other countries to account for what we do to help \nstop this production and trade.\n  Drug dealers do more harm to this country every year than all the \nterrorists put together have done in the past 10 years. Let me ask my \ncolleagues, would you seriously offer to ignore or suspend the \nrequirements that we have put in place that hold others to an \ninternational standard of conduct on stopping terrorism? Human rights? \nI think not. But that is one of the things being proposed for how to \ndeal with international drug certification. I do not propose that we be \nany less committed to stopping illegal drugs internationally than we \nare when other important concerns are involved, and I ask my colleagues \nto support this view.\n  I also would point out that this is no time to carve out special \nexemptions for any one country or region. We remain collectively \nresponsible to act responsibly on this issue. That means every one of \nus.\n  My second point on why we have the certification process is to note \ncongressional intent. We passed the law 15 years ago to make stopping \nillegal drug production and transit a national priority. I do not \nbelieve that most members of Congress nor the majority of the U.S. \npublic believe that it is time to change that. Drug trafficking and \nthreats from major criminal organizations have grown worse not better. \nOur third largest foreign assistance program is to help Colombia deal \nwith problems arising from trafficking and the thugs that promote it. \nIs it really time to say we no longer regard international drug \ntrafficking as a national priority? I happen to believe that it is not.\n  I would also note that we have had repeated demonstrations in the \npast several years of the effectiveness of certification in securing \nimproved international cooperation. Administration officials have \ntestified repeatedly as to its effectiveness and utility. It has also \ngiven us needed leverage in specific cases to make important progress. \nI for one am unwilling to undo a process that has paid such dividends.\n  On the other hand, I am aware that the certification process has \nraised a number of concerns here and abroad in the past few years. \nWhile I do not think that the solution in response to these concerns is \nto suspend the process, I do have a suggestion that I believe will \nhelp. Hence the bill Senator DeWine and I send to the desk.\n  Briefly what this proposal does is to simplify the current \nmethodology. At present, we have a three-step certification process: \nthe President can certify a country as fully cooperating, decertify a \ncountry as failing to cooperate, or decertify with a national interest \nwaiver. This aspect of the process has been the main source of \ncontention. It has led some to believe that it forces the \nAdministration to be less than candid about some countries that might \nbe on the list. It has also complicated our relations with important \nallies.\n  What this proposal does is to go to a decertification only standard. \nThis is similar to what we do with terrorism and human rights. In other \nwords, the default position is that all countries are doing the right \nthing on meeting international drug control standards. The only \ncountries singled out for consideration are those whose actions are \nclearly outside a reasonable assessment of accountability as defined in \ncurrent law.\n  Our bill simplifies a complex process and focuses attention on the \nbad guys. It gives the President more flexibility. In doing so, we keep \naccountability. We keep a useful process in place. We avoid unnecessary \ncomplications with friends and allies doing the responsible thing. We \nmaintain necessary reporting on international efforts. We keep our eye \non a critical issue.\n  The provision also sunsets in three years unless Congress acts to \nkeep it. That means we have a chance to drive it around the block, kick \nthe tires, and see if it's a lemon or not.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this bill and I ask \nunanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 376\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to redesignate the Federal building located at 3348 \nSouth Kedzie Avenue, in Chicago, Illinois, as the ``Paul Simon Chicago \nJob Corps Center''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today Senator Fitzgerald and I are \nintroducing legislation naming the Job Corps Center in Chicago, \nIllinois, for our former colleague, Senator Paul Simon.\n  During his 12 years in the Senate, Paul Simon was a stalwart champion \nof the Job Corps program and the work it does in connecting \ndisadvantaged young people to the job market. He led the fight for the \njob corps as chairman of the authorizing subcommittee of jurisdiction \nand also through requests to the Senate Appropriations Committee. \nDuring most of this time, Chicago was the last remaining large city \nwithout a Job Corps center, despite the community's strong interest in \nthe program. Securing a charter for a Job Corps center in Chicago was \none of Paul Simon's top priorities in the latter half of his service in \nthe Senate.\n  Working within the established process for establishing new centers, \nPaul Simon pressed ahead with Illinois allies like former U.S. \nRepresentative John Porter, Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, and the Job \nCorps community to ensure that Chicago's application met all program \nspecifications and that the funds for expansion would be there when \nChicago's charter was approved. These years of effort succeeded in \nmeeting that goal. Eventually funds were appropriated for expansion of \nthe Job Corps program, and Chicago's Job Corps center now is open and \nserving the Chicago community and, most importantly, its young people.\n  Naming the Chicago Job Corps Center for Paul Simon would be \nespecially fitting for three reasons: Job training and employment \npolicy are central elements of the legacy of his service in Congress; \nhe has long been recognized as a diligent and effective champion of the \nJob Corps' mission; and he spent years to fulfill the goal of opening a \nJob Corps center in Chicago. Other centers in the Job Corps network \nhave been named for individuals, and this designation would be \nparticularly fitting for the Chicago center, a facility Paul Simon \nworked tirelessly to create.\n  Paul Simon was clearly one of the Senate's most respected voices. \nThis legislation would honor his service and his commitment to youth \nand job training. It is a small but very appropriate way to recognize \nhis leadership. I invite my colleagues to join Senator Fitzgerald and \nme in honoring Senator Paul Simon through this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Cleland, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kohl, Ms. \n        Collins, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. McCain, and Mrs. Clinton):\n\n[[Page S1523]]\n\n  S. 379. A bill to establish the National Commission on the \nModernization of Federal Elections conduct a study of Federal voting \nprocedures and election administration, to establish the Federal \nElection Modernization Grant Program to provide grants to States and \nlocalities for the modernization of voting procedures and election \nadministration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators \nSchumer and Brownback as an original cosponsor on the Federal Election \nModernization Act of 2001. It has been approximately three months since \nAmericans cast their vote for President, and for many, there remains a \ndegree of uneasiness about the whole process. Many Americans who voted \nor tried to vote feel disenfranchised. They believe their votes didn't \ncount and their voices weren't heard.\n  We can be thankful that we are past the days of poll taxes, literacy \ntests, and other discriminatory practices that kept voters away from \nthe polls. But if there is even an inadvertent flaw in the design or \nadministration of our voting systems that prevents Americans from \nhaving their votes counted, it is our utmost responsibility to ensure \nthat we remedy the situation.\n  There is simply no excuse for the most technologically savvy nation \nin the world to be using voting equipment that is 30 years old. And it \nis disturbing, to say the least, that much of the oldest and least \nreliable equipment is found in the poorest counties across the country. \nOften, people of color make up the majority of the population in those \ncounties. None of us should ever again be in the position of having to \nexplain to urban, minority voters why a portion of their votes didn't \nget counted, while their white suburban neighbors, using better \nequipment, could rest assured that there were no voting irregularities \nin their precincts that would have caused their votes to be discarded.\n  If we can't promise all of our citizens that their votes will count \nequally, then all of the past work this nation has done to guarantee \nthe right to vote to women, people of color and the poor will have been \nsquandered.\n  That is why I am pleased to join my colleagues on this bill. The bill \ncreates a blue ribbon commission that will study the way we administer \nFederal elections and recommend ways to modernize the process. The bill \nalso establishes a five-year, $2.5 billion grant program to help \nupgrade state and local election systems.\n  Both of these elements are critical if we are going to have real \nreform of our election processes. The commission, which will include \namong its advisory members a representative from the US Commission on \nCivil Rights, will study methods of voting and counting votes, methods \nof ensuring accessibility to the polls and to voting equipment, and \nmethods of identifying registered voters. Its mission will be to \nprovide Congress with recommendations to better ensure that all of our \ncitizens can exercise their fundamental right to vote and have that \nvote count.\n  The second piece of this legislation provides states with a portion \nof the estimated $3-9 billion they will need to upgrade their voting \nsystems. This bill provides $2.5 billion over five years in Federal \nmatching grants to States and localities to buy new voting equipment, \noverhaul election administration technology, train poll workers, or \nimplement any other recommendation of the Commission. States and \nlocalities will maintain their independence in administering their \nelections, as states are not required to carry out the Commission's \nrecommendations. But more and more states are sure to apply for grants \nto finance the reforms they wish to adopt.\n  The Federal government must provide states with at least a portion of \nthe resources they will need to overhaul their voting systems. State \nofficials, from governors to county supervisors, face competing demands \nfor funds every day, as they decide how to pay their teachers, pave \ntheir roads, and remove their garbage. When it comes to paying for \nFederal elections, buying the newest, most reliable technology may be \nfar down on their list of priorities. That is why the Federal matching \ngrant program is so important. It gives the incentive, as well as the \nresources, to make improvements that are necessary to assure the \nintegrity of our elections.\n  If there is a silver lining to the chaos that followed the election \nin November, it is that Congress is now fully aware that we must repair \nour election system nationwide. This bill is critical to that effort.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLARD (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 381. A bill to amend the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee \nvoting Act, the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief act of 1940, and \ntitle 10, United States Code, to maximize the access of uniformed \nservices voters and recently separated uniformed services voters to the \npolls, to ensure that each vote cast by such a voter is duly counted, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mrs. President, the bad taste left in everyone's mouth \nafter the Florida election debacle is certainly strongest in those who \nhad their franchise questioned while, incredibly, they were away \nserving our country. Military men and women are forced to give up some \nopportunities during their military service that the rest of us can \nstill enjoy. They surrender some of the freedom of speech, privacy and \npersonnel liberty that we take for granted. But losing their right to \nvote is never something they agreed to face, and never something we \nshould allow them to face.\n  The bill I am introducing today with Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, \nthe Military Voter Support Act, enhances the voting ability of absentee \nmilitary voters in six key ways. This bill will help us ensure that we \nwill not see the repeat of campaign lawyers scrutinizing military \nballots in a partisan attempt to silence their voice.\n  I know that I was not the only one who felt outrage over this. My \noffice received a flood of calls and letters from Colorado citizens \nequally upset. I hope this bill proves to our uniformed voters that we \nnot only value their service, we value their voice, and we value their \nright to vote.\n  The language applies to service members, their spouses, and voting \nage dependents who are necessarily absentee with them.\n  The bill prohibits a state from disqualifying a ballot based upon \nlack of postmark or witness signature alone--this was the basis for \nmost absentee ballot challenges in Florida. Technical faults beyond the \ncontrol of the voter should not endanger their ballot.\n  The bill secures the voting residence of a military voter as they \ntravel on orders. It prevents a repeat of the 1997 Texas lawsuit \nchallenging future intent of residency.\n  It will allow polling places to be operated on military installations \nto serve military voters and others at the discretion of the \nappropriate service Secretary. The law against this was revived and \nenforced by the Clinton Administration for the 2000 elections.\n  There is a Catch-22 for military voters who are discharged and move \nbefore an election but after the residency deadline. They cannot vote \nthrough the military absentee ballot system. Yet sometimes they are not \nable to fulfill deadlines to establish residency in a State. This bill \nallows them to use the proper discharge forms as a residency waiver and \nvote in person at their new polling site.\n  Given the technologies available to us, it should be possible for the \nmilitary to devise and run an efficient and reliable electronic voting \nprogram. The bill calls for a demonstration program during the 2002 \nelections of a possible electronic voting system for the 2004 \nelections.\n  After each election the Pentagon Federal Voting Assistance Program \nmakes recommendations to each state on ways to improve the voting \nability of absentee voters by state statute changes. This bill brings \nmore attention to bear on these improvements--and hopefully generates \nmore state legislature interest--by requiring the states to report on \ntheir implementation of these suggestions to the Secretary of Defense. \nI believe this mild requirement upon a state will raise the profile of \nthese fixes, and facilitate in-depth discussion and study by the \nstates. And that will, in turn, only serve to improve military absentee \nvoting.\n\n[[Page S1524]]\n\n  I sincerely hope that military members understand that we in the \nCongress are as outraged as they are about the problems they \nexperienced in voting. This bill is a way to attack those problems. \nWith it, I hope the 2002 election and every one following is a far \nbetter demonstration of our democracy and the value we place on the \nright to vote.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Frist, Mr. Jeffords, Ms. Collins, \n        Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 382. A bill to prohibit discrimination on the basis of genetic \ninformation with respect to health insurance; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Genetic \nInformation Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act. I am delighted \nto be joined by Senators Frist, Jeffords, Collins, DeWine, and Enzi as \noriginal cosponsors of this bill, which provides strong protection to \nall Americans against the unfair and improper use of genetic \ninformation for insurance purposes.\n  Similar language passed the Senate in the last Congress as part of \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights, and as an amendment to the FY2001 Labor-\nHHS-Education appropriations bill by a vote of 58 to 40. The only \nsubstantive difference between this year's legislation and last year's \nis the inclusion of a safe harbor provision to prevent conflict with \nthe new HHS medical confidentiality regulations.\n  This bill ensures that people cannot be denied insurance coverage on \nthe basis of genetic information, cannot be dropped from coverage on \nthe basis of genetic information, cannot be charged exorbitant premiums \nbased on genetic information, and cannot be discriminated against for \nrequesting or receiving genetic services.\n  The bill also ensures that insurance companies cannot release a \nperson's genetic information without their prior consent, and cannot \ncarve out covered services because of an inherited genetic disorder. \nFinally, we included safe harbor language to prevent conflict with the \nnew privacy regulations published in December by the Department of \nHealth and Human Services.\n  Scientists are finding genetic links to a whole host of diseases such \nas breast cancer and Huntington's disease--in fact, there are now tests \nfor over 450 disorders including Alzheimer's, cystic fibrosis, \nParkinson's, glaucoma, and kidney and colon cancer. Last June America \nlearned that scientists have completed their mapping of the human gene. \nThis was a remarkable and historic event that opens the door to new \nscientific breakthroughs that may well help lead us one day to the \ncause and cure for many of these diseases.\n  Unfortunately, this remarkable news has the potential to become a \ndangerous tool. As the old adage goes, ``knowledge is power'' and an \ninsurance company could use genetic information to deny insurance to an \nindividual because they know that the person is predisposed to a \nparticular disease or health problem.\n  Today in America, we know that an estimated 15 million people are \naffected by over 4,000 currently known genetic disorders. And while we \ncannot yet prevent the diseases that genetic testing can help us find, \nwe can give carriers of these mutated genes the information they need \nto take extra precautions to protect their health and that of their \nloved ones.\n  It is important to remember that while genetic testing is helpful as \nan informational tool, it still remains an inexact science. Prediction \ndoes not mean certainty--in the case of the Alzheimer's gene, for \nexample, there is less than a 35 percent chance that a patient who \ntests positive for the mutated gene will actually develop the disease. \nAnd yet, that person should not have to worry about their health \ninsurance coverage?\n  For instance, when it comes to breast cancer, we know that early \ndetection can often mean the difference between life and death. We also \nknow that women who inherit mutated forms of either of two genes \nrelated to breast cancer--BRCA1 or BRCA2 have an 85 percent risk of \ndeveloping the disease. So, should a woman test positive, she is more \nlikely to take measures such as regular mammograms and self-\nexaminations that can detect cancer early--thereby giving herself a \nfighting chance.\n  But at the end of the day, all of this means nothing if people are \nafraid to take advantage of genetic testing. And people are afraid that \nthe trade-off for gaining an edge in the battle against disease could \nbe losing health insurance--or higher premiums. That's just plain \nwrong. We need every advantage we can get when it comes to breast \ncancer and other diseases, and that's why we need this bill.\n  The bill we are offering will address these concerns and will allow \nour health care system to catch up to the tremendous health care \nadvances of the past few years. It makes no sense to be on the cutting \nedge of medicine but remain in the dark ages when it comes to genetic \ndiscrimination.\n  Anyone who has heard me speak on this issue before has heard me tell \nof the story of Bonnie Lee Tucker, a constituent whose situation is so \ncompelling that it bears repeating. Indeed, Bonnie Lee puts a face and \na name to the very problem I am trying to address here with this bill.\n  Nine women in Bonnie Lee's immediate family have been diagnosed with \nbreast cancer. And Bonnie Lee herself is a breast cancer survivor. So \nyou can imagine that Bonnie Lee is very worried about her daughter, and \nwould like more than anything to have the BRCA test for breast cancer. \nBut she hasn't because she is frightened that having this test could \nruin her daughter's chances of ever obtaining insurance in the future.\n  Bonnie Lee Tucker is not alone. Across this country there are mothers \nand fathers who are caught in a grip of fear for their children--fear \nthat they may have passed along a disease that, without early detection \nand treatment could kill their child and fear that if a genetic test \ndetects a mutated gene they will have ruined their children's chance of \nobtaining insurance further down the line.\n  This bill will put an end to discriminatory insurance practices based \non genetic testing and allow patients the freedom to access vital \ninformation about their health--and I hope my colleagues will join us \nin supporting it.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the critical issue \nof genetic discrimination and to once again proudly join my colleagues, \nSenators Snowe, Jeffords, Collins, and DeWine, in introducing the \nGenetic Information Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act of 2001. \nThis progressive, forward-looking legislation, which we have developed \nand pushed over the past several years, will provide patients with real \nprotections against the threat of genetic discrimination in health \ninsurance.\n  This week, researchers will, for the first time, publish the complete \nhuman genome map and sequence. As a physician and researcher, I applaud \nthe completion of this work, and recognize that, although much has been \ndone, much more remains before we may have a complete understanding of \nthe human gene and its role in many diseases.\n  Over the past several years, I have closely followed the progress of \nthe research into the human gene, aware of the prospect that it has to \nradically alter the practice of medicine, but also concerned by its \npotential for harm. The past generation has witnessed dramatic progress \nin this area--and I am aware of the great differences in medicine \nbetween the time when my father was visiting patients' homes with his \nblack doctor's bag and my own experiences in heart and lung \ntransplantation. But our increasing knowledge of the human genome \nrepresents an opportunity for revolutionary advances in medical \ndiagnoses and treatment. Having access to these secrets of the human \ngene may open doors to an entirely new way of practicing medicine over \nthe coming decades, by producing drugs designed for specific genes and \ngenetically engineered organs for use in organ transplants, as well as \nenhancing the ability of preventive care based in large part on genetic \ntesting.\n  We have already identified genes that are associated with an \nincreased risk of diseases such as breast cancer, colon cancer and \nAlzheimer's dementia. In the past several weeks, in fact, researchers \nannounced the discovery of a gene linked with type 1, or juvenile, \ndiabetes, noting that, although the gene\n\n[[Page S1525]]\n\nmay not be the sole cause of the disease, targeting the gene, may help \nprevent its onset. As science moves forward, researchers will continue \nto learn more about links between genes and the risk of future disease. \nAnd, as more is learned in these fields, physicians will be able to \nbetter treat their patients against the risk of future diseases by \nprescribing preventive measures based on an individual's genetic tests.\n  However, as important as these advances are, there exists a threat to \nour ability to realize their full potential. If, as has been found to \nbe the case, patients fear retribution for carrying ``bad'' genes and \nrefuse to be tested, then much of the fruits of these labors will have \nbeen in vain. As more individuals fear discrimination in health \ninsurance through denial of coverage or costly premiums, they will be \nmore likely to refuse genetic testing. For example, as I noted when we \nfirst introduced this legislation two years ago, almost one-third of \nwomen offered a test for breast cancer risk at the National Institutes \nof Health declined, citing concerns about health insurance \ndiscrimination.\n  Often here in the United States Senate, we are asked to pass \nlegislation in response to past or ongoing problems. But the \nlegislation we are introducing today gives us a great opportunity to \navoid this, to pass forward-thinking legislation that will prevent a \nproblem, rather than be forced to revisit this issue in a few years to \nattempt to remedy a problem.\n  Particularly in the fields of biomedical research, where scientific \nprogress moves at a rate much quicker than public policy debate and \nlegislation, we are often forced to confront issues after the fact. But \nalthough we know that the fear of health insurance discrimination based \nupon one's genetic test results is already present in society, we have \nan opportunity through this legislation to calm that fear and to \nprevent such discrimination from ever taking place. But let no one \nmisunderstand me. While this legislation is a chance to prevent what \nmight happen, our window of opportunity is rapidly shortening. The \nevery-escalating speed of genetic discovery demands that Congress move \nto prohibit discrimination against healthy individuals who may have a \ngenetic predisposition to disease.\n  The bill that I introduce today with Senators Snowe and Jeffords does \njust that. The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination in Health \nInsurance Act of 2001 prohibits group health plans or health insurance \nissuers from adjusting premiums based on predictive genetic information \nregarding an individual. It prohibits issuers in the individual \ninsurance market from using predictive genetic information to deny \ncoverage or set premium rates. It prohibits insurers from even asking \nan individual for predictive genetic information or requiring that \nperson to undergo genetic testing. And it makes certain that insurers \nestablish and maintain appropriate safeguards for the confidentiality \nof predictive genetic information as well as provide patients a \ndescription of those procedures in place to safeguard their predictive \ngenetic information.\n  Over the past several years, Congress has invested great amounts in \nbiomedical research, through the push to double the budget of the \nNational Institutes of Health and other initiatives. The underlying \ngoal in these endeavors has been to see patients benefit from our \ninvestments and fully utilize these medical advancements to improve \ntheir health. The deciphering of the human genome presents an \nunparalleled opportunity to more towards this goal of improving \npatients' health, but this will not be possible unless individuals are \nwilling to be tested. Patients must feel safe from repercussions based \non their genetic profile. The prohibition of genetic discrimination in \ninsurance will remove the greatest barrier to testing and thus further \naccelerate our scientific progress.\n  Patients must not forgo genetic testing because they fear they may be \ndiscriminated against in insurance. We have the opportunity--we have \nthe duty--to dispel the threat of discrimination based on an \nindividual's genetic heritage, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to enact this legislation this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 383. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction from gross income for home care and adult day and respite \ncare expenses of individual taxpayers with respect to a dependent of \nthe taxpayer who suffers from Alzheimer's disease or related organic \nbrain disorders; to the Committee on Finance.\n  S. 384. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make the \ndependent care credit refundable; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, long-term care is an issue that continues \nto tug at Congress and this country. In 1997 close to $117 billion was \nspent on long-term care--almost 12 percent of total U.S. health care \nexpenditures. And it is estimated that those in need of long-term care \nwill double by 2025, up from the 9 million using these vital services \ntoday.\n  The appropriate care for an individual should be an issue that is \nmade by that individual and their loved ones. For many people, \nremaining at home is their choice. It allows them to remain with their \nloved ones in familiar surroundings. But we all know the truth is that \nin many cases it comes down to the financial realities of the family. \nWe need to do more to assist these people and their families so that \nthey really do have a choice.\n  Toward that end I am introducing a bill that provides a tax credit \nfor families caring for a relative who suffers from Alzheimer's \ndisease. When I first came to Congress over 20 years ago, not a single \npiece of legislation devoted to Alzheimer's disease had even been \nintroduced. We have come a long way since then, as today \n``Alzheimer's'' is a household word. It is also the most expensive \nuninsured illness in America.\n  Alzheimer's treatment is estimated to cost $100 billion each year. \nAnd according to the Alzheimer's Association it costs businesses in \nthis country more than $33 billion a year due to caregiver absenteeism. \nSadly, the number of those affected by this disease is rising and will \ncontinue to rise dramatically, from 4 million today to over 14 million \nby the middle of the century. As staggering as these numbers are, they \npale in comparison to the emotional costs this disease places on the \nfamily.\n  The first bill I am introducing today would allow families to deduct \nthe cost of home care and adult day and respite care provided to a \ndependent suffering from Alzheimer's disease. This bill is important \nbecause we need to, as a country, help lessen the financial and \nemotional cost of Alzheimer's by providing some relief to Alzheimer's \npatients and their families.\n  The second bill I am introducing today will strengthen the dependent \ncare tax credit and restore Congress' original intent to provide the \ngreatest benefit of the tax credit to low-income taxpayers. This bill \nexpands the dependent care tax credit, makes it applicable respite care \nexpenses, and makes it refundable.\n  In 1976, the dependent care tax credit was created to help low- and \nmoderate-income families alleviate the burden of employment-related \ndependent care. We have changed the DCTC since it was created 25 years \nago and in fact, in the 1985 Tax Reform Act we indexed all the basic \nprovision of the tax code that determine tax liability except for DCTC. \nWe need to make the credit relevant by updating it to reflect today's \nworld.\n  As more and more women enter the workforce combined with the aging of \nour population, we are continuing to see an increased need for both \nchild and elder care. Expenses incurred for this care can place a large \nburden on a family's finances. The cost of full time child care can \nrange from $4,000 to $10,000. The cost of nursing home care is more \nthan of $40,000 a year. Managing these costs is difficult for many \nfamilies, but it is exceptionally burdensome for those in lower income \nbrackets.\n  My legislation will do that by indexing the credit to inflation and \nmaking it refundable so that those who do not reach the tax thresholds \nwill still receive assistance. It also raises the DCTC sliding scale \nfrom 30 to 50 percent of work-related dependent care expenditures for \nfamilies earing $15,000 or less. The scale would then be reduced by 1 \npercentage point for each additional $1,000 more of income, down to a \ncredit of 20 percent for person earning $45,000 or more.\n\n[[Page S1526]]\n\n  In order to assist those who care for loved ones at home, the bill \nalso expands the definition of dependent care to include respite care, \nthereby offering relief from this additional expense. A respite care \ncredit would be allowed for up to $1,200 for one qualifying dependent \ncare and $2,400 for two qualifying dependents.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting these two bills that \nwill provide assistance to families that wish to provide long term care \nto their loved ones at home.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND (for himself and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 385. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to remove a \nlimitation on the expansion of the Junior Reserve Officers' Training \nCorps, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \nimprove our existing laws regarding the Junior Reserve Officers' \nTraining Corps programs, more commonly known as JROTC. Established by \nCongress in 1916, Junior ROTC has demonstrated over the decades that it \nworks. Junior ROTC is an elective high school course taught by retired \nmilitary personnel at selected private and public high schools in the \nUnited States and its territories. It is also taught abroad through the \nDepartment of Defense Dependents School System. The main goal of JROTC \nis to motivate and develop young people. In order to accomplish this \ngoal, the program combines classroom instruction and extracurricular \nactivities oriented on attaining an awareness of the rights, \nresponsibilities, and privileges of citizenship; developing the \nstudent's sense of personal responsibility; building life skills; and \nproviding leadership opportunities.\n  As we are all aware, President Bush recently placed our Nation's \nyouth at the top of his agenda. In his forward to the ``No Child Left \nBehind'' Education Reform Plan, the President stated that ``[the] \nmission is to build the mind and character of every child, from every \nbackground.'' There is no existing education program that accomplishes \nexactly this goal better than JROTC. What students study in Junior ROTC \nis not primarily found in textbooks. What is learned by students \nenrolled in JROTC is not at the disposal of students and schools \nwithout the JROTC programs. As former Commandant of the Marine Corps, \nGeneral Charles Krulak, summarized in a March 19, 1999 letter to me, \n``as we seek to identify and develop young men and women of character, \nthis program does it all.''\n  Widely recognized studies have praised JROTC as having a dramatic \npositive impact in high school education. In fact, one report noted \nthat JROTC cadets boast a better class attendance rate, a lower number \nof disciplinary infractions, and a higher number of graduates. The \nreport also stated that ``Cadets performed better than the overall \nschool population in every area that is routinely measured by \neducators, including: academic performance, grade point average, the \nScholastic Aptitude Test, and the American College Test.'' It comes as \nno surprise that schools districts throughout the United States are \nclamoring to establish JROTC units at hundreds of high schools.\n  While the primary purpose of JROTC is to develop good citizens, there \nare, in fact, tangible benefits to our Nation's Armed Services. \nStatistics demonstrate that over 40 percent of students who graduate \nfrom the JROTC program choose some form of military service. Without a \ndoubt, this fact proves conclusively that good citizens choose to serve \ntheir country.\n  The JROTC program's contribution to our Nation's schools, communities \nand Armed Forces is no less than remarkable in conveying a sense of \nservice, patriotism, leadership communication skills, team work, and \nself-esteem. After JROTC and advancing into their futures, young men \nand women carry such virtues into America's society while serving as a \nbridge between the military and civil society at a time when the two \nhave tended to diverge. The dividends of this cannot be overstated.\n  Soon we will be unable to expand the proven and praised Junior \nReserve Officers' Training Corps programs. By law, the JROTC program is \nlimited to having 3,500 units for schools throughout the United States. \nEach of our military services have limits to the number of units they \nmay establish, and the Marine Corps has already reached its \nlimitations. Without changing existing law, thousands of high schools \nwill never have the opportunity to reap the benefits of the JROTC \nprogram. Furthermore, some Services have encountered difficulty \nrecruiting retired Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers to fill \ninstructor positions at certain high schools, especially in inner-city \nand rural schools. These staffing difficulties compromise the ability \nto establish these especially critical new units.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today is straightforward and \nsimple. It seeks to repeal limitations on the number of Junior Reserve \nOfficers' Training Corps units and opens the door to the many retired \nGuard and Reserve Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers who have \nexpressed an interest in serving as JROTC instructors, but because of \nthe existing law are unable to do so.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. Every Member in \nCongress has a stake in assuring its unfettered enactment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 385\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. REPEAL OF LIMITATION ON NUMBER OF JUNIOR RESERVE \n                   OFFICERS' TRAINING CORPS UNITS.\n\n       Section 2031(a)(1) of title 10, United States Code, is \n     amended by striking the second sentence.\n\n     SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF AUTHORITY TO AUTHORIZE EMPLOYMENT OF \n                   RETIRED NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE PERSONNEL AS \n                   JROTC ADMINISTRATORS AND INSTRUCTORS.\n\n       Section 2031(d) of title 10, United States Code, is amended \n     by inserting ``regular or reserve component'' after ``as \n     administrators and instructors in the program, retired'' in \n     the matter preceding paragraph (1).\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself, and Mr. Corzine):\n  S. 386. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to study \nthe suitability and feasibility of designating the Great Falls Historic \nDistrict in the city of Paterson, in Passaic County, New Jersey, as a \nunit of the National Park System, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto recognize the historical significance of the Great Falls area in \nPaterson, New Jersey. I am joined by my colleagues from New Jersey, \nSenator Corzine, and pleased to announce that companion legislation has \nalready been introduced in the House of Representatives by Congressman \nBill Pascrell.\n  Paterson is known as America's first industrialized city. Alexander \nHamilton founded Paterson in 1792 as a mercantile private-public \npartnership, using the powerful falls to power industry. He built a \nlaboratory, and established the Society for the Establishment of Useful \nManufactures which actively promoted the textiles industry. Textiles \nwere a large part of the development of industry in Paterson, once \nknown as the Silk City, and regarded as the center of the textile \nindustry for many years.\n  New and developing industries located to Paterson and contributed to \nthe growth of the city. New immigrants, arriving at nearby Ellis \nIsland, settled in Paterson, and provided the workforce necessary for \nthis newly industrialized city to thrive.\n  Rich in history, the Paterson Great Falls is also endowed with \nnatural beauty. The Great Falls is an island of beauty in a sea of \nurban development. The Great Falls is the second largest waterfall on \nthe East Coast, and attracts visitors from within and outside of New \nJersey.\n  Paterson Great Falls is also an educational tool for New Jersey's \nchildren. Students young and old travel to Paterson Great Falls to \nwitness its natural splendor, to learn about the industrial revolution, \nand the pioneers who helped build our Nation.\n  This area is truly a valuable asset to the State of New Jersey, and I \nfeel it is\n\n[[Page S1527]]\n\nonly proper to share this wonderful resource with the entire nation by \nestablishing the Paterson Great Falls as a unit of the National Park \nService, NPS.\n  The Federal Government has already acknowledged the significance of \nGreat Falls, by designating the area a national historic landmark. \nEstablishing it as a unit of the NPS would increase the presence Great \nFalls, and the NPS would provide staff and tours, and allow for a \nbetter, more educational interpretation of the site.\n  This designation is warranted. Our Nation's urban history is \ncurrently under-represented by the NPS. Not many sites tell the story \nof the growth of our Nation and its economy from that of agrarian to \nindustrial. Other than Lowell, Massachusetts, a one-time industry \npowerhouse whose historic district was designated a national park, I am \nnot aware of another NPS site which represents our Nation's rich urban \nhistory.\n  My legislation would take the first step towards this important \ndesignation by directing the NPS to study the feasibility of \nestablishing a national park at the Paterson Great Falls area. I ask \nthat my colleagues join me in support of this worthy effort, so that a \ncritical chapter in the story of our nation may be told to future \ngenerations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/15/senate-section/article/S1527-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1527]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SENATE RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 15--TO DESIGNATE A NATIONAL DAY OF \n                             RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK submitted the following concurrent resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n\n                            S.

Con. Res. 16\n\n       Whereas George Washington responded to a letter sent by \n     Moses Seixas, warden of Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode \n     Island, in August 1790;\n       Whereas, although Touro Synagogue, the oldest Jewish house \n     of worship in the United States, and now a national historic \n     site, was dedicated in December 1763, Jewish families had \n     been in Newport for over 100 years before that date;\n       Whereas these Jews, some of whom were Marranos, came to the \n     United States with hopes of starting a new life in this \n     country, where they could practice their religious beliefs \n     freely and without persecution;\n       Whereas they were drawn to the Colony of Rhode Island and \n     the Providence Plantations because of Governor Roger \n     Williams' assurances of religious liberty;\n       Whereas the letter from Touro Synagogue is the most famous \n     of many congratulatory notes addressed to the new president \n     by American Jewish congregations;\n       Whereas Seixas articulated the following principle, which \n     Washington repeated in his letter: ``For happily the \n     Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no \n     sanction, to persecution no assistance; requires only that \n     they who live under its protection, should demean themselves \n     as good citizens, in giving it on all occasions their \n     effectual support'';\n       Whereas this was the first statement of such a principle \n     enunciated by a leader of the new United States Government;\n       Whereas this principle has become the cornerstone of United \n     States religious and ethnic toleration as it has developed \n     during the past two centuries;\n       Whereas the original letter is on display as part of the \n     permanent collection of the B'nai B'rith Klutznick National \n     Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C.; and\n       Whereas Americans of all religious faiths gather at Touro \n     Synagogue each August on the anniversary of the date of the \n     letter's delivery and at the Klutznick Museum on George \n     Washington's birthday to hear readings of the letter and to \n     discuss how the letter's message can be applied to \n     contemporary challenges: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the George Washington letter to Touro Synagogue in \n     Newport, Rhode Island, in August 1790, which is on display as \n     part of the permanent collection of the B'nai B'rith \n     Klutznick National Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., is one \n     of the most significant early statements buttressing the \n     nascent American constitutional guarantee of religious \n     freedom; and\n       (2) the text of the George Washington letter should be \n     widely circulated, serving as an important tool for teaching \n     tolerance to children and adults alike.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Chafee, in introducing a resolution commemorating the \nletter sent by President George Washington to Touro Synagogue in \nNewport Rhode Island, the oldest Jewish house of worship in the United \nStates.\n  When Roger Williams came to Rhode Island in the 1630s, an \nindividual's right to worship without government interference was \nunknown in other colonies or countries of the world. He made religious \ntolerance the core principle of his new settlement, and it became a \nbeacon of hope for those suffering from persecution.\n  By the middle of the 17th century, 15 Jewish families, who knew the \npain of intolerance firsthand, arrived in Newport to reclaim their \nfaith and rebuild their lives. This group included Jews from Spain and \nPortugal who had been forced to become Christian converts to escape \npersecution. Rhode Island's lively experiment promised a new beginning.\n  The 18th century say many steps toward the realization of this \npromise, as increasing trade and religious tolerance spurred the growth \nof Newport and its Jewish community. By 1759, with about 75 families \ntotaling some 300 people, the Congregation turned to the construction \nof a permanent house of worship. Four years later, this Synagogue was \ndedicated in a service led by Reverend Isaac Touro, the spiritual \nleader of the Congregation.\n  As this country's first President, George Washington was the leader \nof a nation still crafting its ideals and identity. Although the new \nConstitution had won ratification, many Americans feared that its \nconcentration of power in a federal government threatened the \nindividual liberties for which they had so recently gone to war. To \nalleviate these fears, Washington began a nationwide tour in support of \na Bill of Rights that would explicitly protect basic freedoms of \nAmericans against government intrusion.\n  This tour brought Washington to Newport in August 1790. During his \nvisit, Washington received an eloquent letter from Moses Seixas, the \nwarden of Touro Synagogue. Seixas commended the President for his work \nand leadership in establishing a government that respected the \ninalienable rights of all citizens.\n  Washington's response embraced Seixas' simple, elegant phrases to \nrenew his and the nation's commitment to Rhode Island's founding \nprinciple. Addressing a Congregation dedicated to religious liberty in \na state based on this ideal, Washington reaffirmed religious freedom as \nessential to the new nation's identity.\n  When Washington declared that ``the Government of the United States, \nwhich gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, \nrequires only that they who live under its protection should demean \nthemselves as\n\n[[Page S1528]]\n\ngood citizens,'' he made Rhode Island's history of religious liberty a \nmodel for the nation. ``To bigotry no sanction.'' It is for good reason \nthat these words continue to resonate today, as we confront the \nchallenges of an ever more closely linked, yet endlessly diverse \ncommunity of nations. We all know too well the destruction that bigotry \ncauses, and this plague is still with us. The fight for tolerance is as \nnecessary now as in the days of President Washington or Roger Williams.\n  This fight for tolerance is the reason the original letter sent by \nGeorge Washington remains on permanent display at the B'nai B'rith \nKlutznick National Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. This fight for \ntolerance is also the reason Americans of all religious faiths gather \nat the Klutznick Museum each February and at Touro Synagogue each \nAugust to hear readings of the letter.

Res. 16\n\n       Whereas George Washington responded to a letter sent by \n     Moses Seixas, warden of Touro Synagogue in Newport, Rhode \n     Island, in August 1790;\n       Whereas, although Touro Synagogue, the oldest Jewish house \n     of worship in the United States, and now a national historic \n     site, was dedicated in December 1763, Jewish families had \n     been in Newport for over 100 years before that date;\n       Whereas these Jews, some of whom were Marranos, came to the \n     United States with hopes of starting a new life in this \n     country, where they could practice their religious beliefs \n     freely and without persecution;\n       Whereas they were drawn to the Colony of Rhode Island and \n     the Providence Plantations because of Governor Roger \n     Williams' assurances of religious liberty;\n       Whereas the letter from Touro Synagogue is the most famous \n     of many congratulatory notes addressed to the new president \n     by American Jewish congregations;\n       Whereas Seixas articulated the following principle, which \n     Washington repeated in his letter: ``For happily the \n     Government of the United States, which gives to bigotry no \n     sanction, to persecution no assistance; requires only that \n     they who live under its protection, should demean themselves \n     as good citizens, in giving it on all occasions their \n     effectual support'';\n       Whereas this was the first statement of such a principle \n     enunciated by a leader of the new United States Government;\n       Whereas this principle has become the cornerstone of United \n     States religious and ethnic toleration as it has developed \n     during the past two centuries;\n       Whereas the original letter is on display as part of the \n     permanent collection of the B'nai B'rith Klutznick National \n     Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C.; and\n       Whereas Americans of all religious faiths gather at Touro \n     Synagogue each August on the anniversary of the date of the \n     letter's delivery and at the Klutznick Museum on George \n     Washington's birthday to hear readings of the letter and to \n     discuss how the letter's message can be applied to \n     contemporary challenges: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the George Washington letter to Touro Synagogue in \n     Newport, Rhode Island, in August 1790, which is on display as \n     part of the permanent collection of the B'nai B'rith \n     Klutznick National Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C., is one \n     of the most significant early statements buttressing the \n     nascent American constitutional guarantee of religious \n     freedom; and\n       (2) the text of the George Washington letter should be \n     widely circulated, serving as an important tool for teaching \n     tolerance to children and adults alike.\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague from Rhode \nIsland, Senator Chafee, in introducing a resolution commemorating the \nletter sent by President George Washington to Touro Synagogue in \nNewport Rhode Island, the oldest Jewish house of worship in the United \nStates.\n  When Roger Williams came to Rhode Island in the 1630s, an \nindividual's right to worship without government interference was \nunknown in other colonies or countries of the world. He made religious \ntolerance the core principle of his new settlement, and it became a \nbeacon of hope for those suffering from persecution.\n  By the middle of the 17th century, 15 Jewish families, who knew the \npain of intolerance firsthand, arrived in Newport to reclaim their \nfaith and rebuild their lives. This group included Jews from Spain and \nPortugal who had been forced to become Christian converts to escape \npersecution. Rhode Island's lively experiment promised a new beginning.\n  The 18th century say many steps toward the realization of this \npromise, as increasing trade and religious tolerance spurred the growth \nof Newport and its Jewish community. By 1759, with about 75 families \ntotaling some 300 people, the Congregation turned to the construction \nof a permanent house of worship. Four years later, this Synagogue was \ndedicated in a service led by Reverend Isaac Touro, the spiritual \nleader of the Congregation.\n  As this country's first President, George Washington was the leader \nof a nation still crafting its ideals and identity. Although the new \nConstitution had won ratification, many Americans feared that its \nconcentration of power in a federal government threatened the \nindividual liberties for which they had so recently gone to war. To \nalleviate these fears, Washington began a nationwide tour in support of \na Bill of Rights that would explicitly protect basic freedoms of \nAmericans against government intrusion.\n  This tour brought Washington to Newport in August 1790. During his \nvisit, Washington received an eloquent letter from Moses Seixas, the \nwarden of Touro Synagogue. Seixas commended the President for his work \nand leadership in establishing a government that respected the \ninalienable rights of all citizens.\n  Washington's response embraced Seixas' simple, elegant phrases to \nrenew his and the nation's commitment to Rhode Island's founding \nprinciple. Addressing a Congregation dedicated to religious liberty in \na state based on this ideal, Washington reaffirmed religious freedom as \nessential to the new nation's identity.\n  When Washington declared that ``the Government of the United States, \nwhich gives to bigotry no sanction, to persecution no assistance, \nrequires only that they who live under its protection should demean \nthemselves as\n\n[[Page S1528]]\n\ngood citizens,'' he made Rhode Island's history of religious liberty a \nmodel for the nation. ``To bigotry no sanction.'' It is for good reason \nthat these words continue to resonate today, as we confront the \nchallenges of an ever more closely linked, yet endlessly diverse \ncommunity of nations. We all know too well the destruction that bigotry \ncauses, and this plague is still with us. The fight for tolerance is as \nnecessary now as in the days of President Washington or Roger Williams.\n  This fight for tolerance is the reason the original letter sent by \nGeorge Washington remains on permanent display at the B'nai B'rith \nKlutznick National Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. This fight for \ntolerance is also the reason Americans of all religious faiths gather \nat the Klutznick Museum each February and at Touro Synagogue each \nAugust to hear readings of the letter. It is my hope these \ncommemorations inspire us to follow the examples set by Roger Williams \nand President Washington and continue to fight for religious and \npersonal liberty for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/15/senate-section/article/S1528-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 25--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING MARCH 18, 2001 AS \n                      ``NATIONAL SAFE PLACE WEEK''\n\n  Mr. CRAIG (for himself and Mr. Cleland) submitting the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, next week will mark the tragic anniversary \nof Stalin's mass deportation of Chechen civilians from the northern \nCaucasus to the barren steps of Central Asia. In the early morning \nhours of February 23, 1944, thousands of Chechen families were ordered \nout of their homes, arrested, and loaded on to rail cars. Some five \nhundred thousand Chechens were deported to Central Asia. Tens of \nthousands, mainly women, children, and the elderly, died en route to \nCentral Asia.\n  These deportations were part of Stalin's systematic effort to \nsuppress the\n\n[[Page S1529]]\n\nChechen people and to strip them of their culture and history, \nincluding their language, architecture, music and even familial ties.\n  It was only in 1957 that Stalin's deportation order was repealed. \nHowever, many of those Chechens that were able to make the arduous \njourney back to their homes in the Caucasus found them occupied by new \nresidents, many of whom violently opposed the Chechen return.\n  Today, the Chechen people are enduring yet another brutal assault \ndirected by Moscow's authorities. Over the last year and half Russian \nPresident Vladimir Putin has conducted an indiscriminate war against \nthe Chechen people. Russian forces subjected Chechnya's capital, \nGrozny, to a destruction unseen in Europe since World War II, and they \nhave leveled numerous other Chechen towns and villages. Russian forces \nhave herded the Chechen population into refugee or internment camps. \nThis war against the Chechen people has left literally hundreds of \nthousands homeless and countless thousands of innocents dead. Let us \nnot forget that more than 100,000 Chechens were killed in the Russo-\nChechen war of 1994-1996--100,000 out of a population of fewer than a \nmillion.\n  Mr. President, it is with these facts in mind that I introduce a \nresolution marking next week's anniversary of Stalin's mass deportation \nof the Chechen people in 1944. My hope is that this resolution will \ncommunicate to the Chechen people the Senate's awareness of the \nsuffering that they have endured and are enduring today. It is my hope \nthat this resolution will prompt others to view the ongoing war in \nChechnya within the historic context of the repeated abuses suffered by \nthe Chechen people. By promoting a broader awareness of the history of \nChechen people, I am confident that this resolution will contribute \npositively to the efforts of those who are trying to prompt a peaceful, \npolitical, and just end to war in Chechnya.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/15/senate-section/article/S1529-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1529-S1530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         SMITH AMENDMENT NO. 12\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by \nhim to the bill S. 287, to direct the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission to impose cost-of-service based rates on sales by public \nutilities of electric energy at wholesale in the western energy market; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n  On page 3, strike subsection (d) and insert the following:\n\n       (d) Limitations.--\n       (1) In general.--A cost-of-service based rate shall not \n     apply to a sale of electric energy at wholesale for delivery \n     in a State that--\n       (A) prohibits public utilities from passing through to \n     retail consumers wholesale rates approved by the Commission; \n     or\n       (B) imposes a price limit on the sale of electric energy at \n     retail that--\n       (i) precludes a public utility from recovering costs on a \n     cost-of-service based rate; or\n       (ii) has precluded a public utility from making a payment \n     when due to any entity within the western energy market from \n     which the public utility purchased electric energy, and the \n     default has not been cured.\n       (2) No orders to sell without guarantee of payment.--\n     Notwithstanding any other provision of law, neither the \n     Secretary of Energy, the Commission, any other officer or \n     agency in the Executive branch, nor any court may issue an \n     order that requires a seller of electric energy or natural \n     gas to sell electric energy or natural gas to a purchaser in \n     a State described in paragraph (1) unless there is a \n     guarantee that, as determined by the Commission, is \n     sufficient to ensure that the seller will be paid the full \n     purchase price when due.\n       (3) Requirement to meet in-state demand.--Notwithstanding \n     any other provision of law, a State public utility commission \n     in the western energy market may prohibit a public utility in \n     the State from making any sale of electric energy to a \n     purchaser in a State described in paragraph (1) at any time \n     at which the public utility is not meeting the demand for \n     electric energy in the service area of the public utility.\n       (e) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Energy shall--\n       (1) conduct an investigation to determine whether any \n     public utility in a State described in subsection (d)(1) has \n     been rendered uncreditworthy or has defaulted on any payment \n     for electric energy as a result of a transfer of funds by the \n     public utility to a parent company or to a subsidiary of the \n     public utility (except a payment made in accordance with a \n     State deregulation statute); and\n       (2) submit to the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the \n     House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce and \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a \n     report describing the results of the investigation.\n       (f) Duration.--A cost-of-service based electric energy rate \n     imposed under this Act shall remain in effect until such time \n     as the market for electric energy in the western energy \n     market reflects just and reasonable rates, as determined by \n     the Commission.\n       (g) Repeal.--This Act is repealed, and any cost-of-service \n     based electric energy rate imposed under this Act that is \n     then in effect shall no longer be effective, on the date that \n     is 2 years after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I am filing an amendment to \nS. 287, bill to direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to \nimpose cost-of-service based rates on sales by public utilities of \nelectric energy at wholesale in the western energy market.\n  My amendment would clarify the circumstances under which the \nCommission may impose interim limitations on the cost of electric \nenergy, and provide a sunset date. While I applaud my colleague's \nefforts to help restore stability to the wholesale electricity market \non the west coast, I believe S. 287 continues to insulate retail \ncustomers in California from the energy crisis in a way that is \nhampering conservation and investment in new generation.\n  By contrast, my constituents and energy-sensitive businesses in \nOregon are already feeling the effects of the price volatility in the \nwest. Utilities in the northwest are facing current rate increases of \neleven to fifty percent. The customers of the Bonneville Power \nAdministration are facing the prospect of 95 percent rate increases \nbeginning in October, when current contracts expire.\n  I know that there is significant support for short-term wholesale \nprice caps for the entire western market. However, that doesn't address \nwhat is still going on in California, where retail prices are capped at \na level that is insulating consumers from the price shocks being felt \nby the rest of the West. So long as these retail rates remain capped at \nthe current levels, there is no incentive to conserve, and no incentive \nfor additional generation. Both conservation and additional generation \nare the keys to the long-term solution.\n  Much of the media attention in recent weeks has focused on efforts to \nkeep the lights on in California and to keep that state's two largest \nutilities from going bankrupt. But the West Coast energy market extends \nto eleven other western states, including Oregon, that are all \ninterconnected by the high-voltage transmission system.\n  I believe there is more that California can and must do immediately \nto address this situation. I know the California legislature is \ngrappling with this situation, and I hope it will take the steps to \nrestore the creditworthiness of California's utilities.\n  First and foremost, it must approve further electric rate increases. \nThis is necessary to send the right price signals to Californians to \nconserve energy. Further, price increases are necessary to help \nCalifornia's investor-owned utilities--which have recently been reduced \nto ``junk bond'' status--from going bankrupt.\n  Avoiding bankruptcy for these utilities is important for Oregon and \nother western states. Since the middle of December, Northwest utilities \nhave been forced to sell their surplus power into California, with no \nguarantee of being paid. If the California utilities subsequently seek \nbankruptcy protection, it will be Oregonians who are stuck with the \nbill for California's failed restructuring effort.\n  In fact, certain Oregon utilities are already receiving bills from \nCalifornia's power exchange for funds owed to the exchange by \nCalifornia utilities. In addition, the Bonneville Power Administration \nis owed over 100 million dollars for power sales it made into \nCalifornia in November 2000.\n  My amendment to the legislation offered by my colleague from \nCalifornia would do the following: It limits the authorities provided \nto the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) to impose \nwest-wide wholesale price caps by stipulating that the wholesale price \ncap cannot be imposed on sales into any state that has refused to allow \nutilities to pass on Commission-approved rates, has capped retail rates \nat levels that do not allow utilities to recover costs on a cost-of-\nservice based rate, or has capped rates at a level that results in a \ndefault of payments for electricity.\n\n[[Page S1530]]\n\n  Further, the amendment stipulates that the Secretary of Energy, the \nCommission, or the courts may not order sales of electricity or natural \ngas into any such state without guarantees of being paid. It also \nallows state public utility commissions in other western states to make \nsure that utility service areas are served before utilities in their \nrespective states can sell into what might be a higher market in \nCalifornia.\n  It also orders the Secretary of Energy to conduct an inquiry into the \ncharges of shifting funds between utilities and parent holding \ncompanies. Two weeks ago, at a hearing of the Energy Committee, I asked \nthree California utilities if they were seeing any decrease in demand \nin response to calls for conservation. The answer was no.\n  I also asked several energy experts if, in their opinion, state \nofficials in California were taking the measures needed to fix their \nbroken restructuring effort. Again, the answer was either ``No'' or \n``Mostly, but not completely.''\n  To put a human face on what is happening in my state, I would like to \ndiscuss a letter I recently received from a rural school district in my \nstate. Basically, they are pleading for the energy crisis to be fixed \nbecause, as a small school district, they are having to take resources \naway from students to pay energy bills. Their local utility has just \nadded a 20 percent surcharge to the cost of electricity. The district \nalso heats a number of its school buildings with natural gas. In \nNovember 1999, the bill was $4,383.59. By November 2000, the bill to \nheat the same buildings was $11,942.\n  Another small school district in my state is concerned that its power \nbills may go up by $100,000. For them, that means laying off two \nteachers.\n  Oregon is doing its part to conserve, and to build new resources. My \namendment today is trying to prod California to send the right price \nsignals to its consumers to join us in this fight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/15/senate-section/article/S1530-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               committee on energy and natural resources\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

COVERDELL\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we have just adopted a resolution offered by \nthe majority leader and others that will honor our former colleague, \nPaul Coverdell of Georgia, for his service as a Member of this body, as \na member of the political life of the State of Georgia, and as a \nDirector of the U.S. Peace Corps.\n  This resolution, among other things, would name the Washington \nnational headquarters of the Peace Corps as the Paul D. Coverdell Peace \nCorps Headquarters.\n  The bill would also authorize $10 million in appropriations to give \nan award to the University of Georgia to support the construction of \nthe Paul D. Coverdell Building at the Institute of Biomedical and \nHealth Sciences at the University of Georgia.\n  The legislation to honor our former colleague, in addition to what \nwas done last year--when we enacted the Paul D. Coverdell Worldwide \nSchool Act of 2000--would designate the Worldwide Schools Program as \nthe Paul D. Coverdell Worldwide Schools Program that was begun by \nSenator Coverdell when he was Director of the Peace Corps.\n  Last year's action was a fitting one by this Congress to honor our \nformer colleague and is an appropriate tribute which recognizes the \nspecial contribution Paul Coverdell made to the Peace Corps during his \ntenure as its Director. I strongly and enthusiastically supported its \nenactment.\n  Let me, first of all, say there is a particular reason I speak on \nthis particular issue, in addition to my affection for Paul Coverdell \nand the years I spent working with him.\n  As I mentioned a moment ago in the colloquy with the distinguished \nmajority leader, some 33 years ago, after I finished college, I served \nas a Peace Corps volunteer in the Dominican Republic not far from the \nHaitian border for 2\\1/2\\ years in the mountains. I worked with 22 \ncommunities and some 11,000 people in the northwest region of that \ncountry. It was an important period of maturation in my life. I learned\n\n[[Page S1531]]\n\na great deal about myself and have a deeper appreciation of my own \ncountry.\n  Serving outside of the United States and seeing the shortcomings of \nother nations, one appreciates in many ways unimaginable as a U.S. \ncitizen, how fortunate we are to live in this great country with 200 \nyears of strong democracy and freedoms and opportunities that the world \nenvisions. One also comes away with a deeper appreciation of other \ncultures and other peoples. It was a wonderful experience.\n  I have often said that next to my family and the circumstances of \ngrowing up in a strong, healthy household with five siblings and \nwonderful parents, no other event in my life was as significant as \nthese years as a Peace Corps volunteer--as a part of growing up and \nlearning more about myself, sparking, in many ways, a determination to \nbe a part of public life. And that has occurred over the years since my \narrival in the House of Representatives as the first former Peace Corps \nvolunteer to be elected to the Congress, along with Paul Tsongas that \nyear, a blessed memory. And then I arrived in the Senate, along with \nPaul Tsongas, 2 years after his arrival, as Peace Corps volunteers \nhere. Today I am the only returning volunteer.\n\n  I sometimes like to have some fun with my colleague from West \nVirginia, Mr. Rockefeller, the junior Senator from West Virginia, who \nwas a staff member of the Peace Corps. But we make a significant \ndistinction between staff members and volunteers. The 161,000 Americans \nwho are former Peace Corps volunteers will appreciate that distinction.\n  There are deeply emotional and strong feelings that I have about this \norganization and the contribution that it has made to our Nation and to \nmillions of people all over the globe.\n  This was an idea that was born in a speech given by another Senator \nin the State of Michigan as he was running for President in 1960. His \nname was John Fitzgerald Kennedy. He said, on the steps of the \nUniversity of Michigan, that he had an idea where Americans of all ages \nmight take a period out of their lives to serve the needs of others \naround the globe. It was an idea that Hubert Humphrey had talked about \nas a Senator--not specifically the Peace Corps, but he had raised the \nidea of Americans serving the interests of others around the globe.\n  Then, over the years, beginning with the remarkable leadership of \nSargent Shriver as the first Director of the Peace Corps, there have \nbeen 14 other Directors over 40 years. Most remarkably, there was one \ndirectorship under Loret Ruppe, the wife of a former Republican House \nMember, who I served with for 8 years under the Reagan years. She led \nthe Peace Corps in a most magnificent way. In fact, I remember she even \nforwent some of her salary initially because she did not feel she \nunderstood the Peace Corps well enough to take a salary. That is how \ndedicated she was to this organization.\n  But over the years, we have talked about the Peace Corps not as John \nKennedy's Peace Corps or Hubert Humphrey's Peace Corps or Sargent \nShriver's Peace Corps or Loret Ruppe's Peace Corps or my Peace Corps; \nit has been the Nation's. It just says: The Peace Corps. There is one \nroom at the Peace Corps named for Sargent Shriver, but that is the only \nfacility I know of that has a name on it at all, because we never \nthought it belonged to any particular person.\n  Literally hundreds of thousands of people, in direct and indirect \nways, have made a significant contribution to this organization. I \nserved with volunteers who lost their lives during the term of their \nservice. Yet despite that, and the efforts maybe in some countries to \ndesignate certain places or areas in memory of these individuals, we \nhave kept it sort of as a nameless organization in that sense.\n  I hope people understand that when this proposal was made--and I \nrespect the fact that these things can happen--no one came and asked me \nwhat I thought about whether or not we ought to name this building \nafter one particular individual. Had I been asked about it prior to \nthis decision to move forward with it--regardless of who had come \nforward with any particular name--I would have expressed the same \nreservation. This has nothing to do with my deep respect for Paul \nCoverdell. As the majority leader pointed out, I gave a heartfelt set \nof remarks at the time of his passing, so I feel somewhat awkward in \neven standing up and talking about this. But we have to be far \nmore judicious, and careful not to race down and offer resolutions to \nput names on buildings in this community and elsewhere without thinking \nthrough what the implications are.\n\n  For those who have served well, brought honor to institutions, to try \nto race ahead with one name over another does not serve this country \nwell, does not serve its institutions well.\n  I was asked to be the co-chairman of a bipartisan group last year to \nchoose two Senators' portraits to be painted on two ovals outside this \nChamber in the reception area. Slade Gorton from the State of \nWashington was the other member of this two-member commission. We made \nselections after deep discussions with the Senate historian and with \nother Members. In fact, I remember having a conversation with the \ndistinguished former minority-majority leader, Senator Byrd of West \nVirginia, about his ideas.\n  We went to our respective caucuses, shared these ideas, and, finally, \nafter having vented the entire process, came to the Chamber with the \nsuggestions of Senator Vandenberg and Senator Wagner of New York to be \nthe two suggestions. But we went through the process even before we \ndecided to put the portraits of the two Senators high up on the wall of \nthe reception area.\n  I would urge my colleagues, aside from this particular set of \ncircumstances, that rather than trying to compete with one another as \nto whether or not we are going to have a Republican or a Democrat or \nsome particular name on a building, that we slow down, think, and be \nmore careful about how we proceed on these matters.\n  That was the motivation, more than anything else, that caused me to \nobject yesterday to this resolution going forward, the concerns I had \nabout the naming process, in this particular resolution. So in no way \ndoes my lack of enthusiasm for this resolution, which is before us and \nwhich has just been adopted, suggest a criticism of Paul Coverdell's \ntenure at the Peace Corps. In fact, he was a very fine Director of the \nPeace Corps, who made a number of contributions to the organization, \nincluding the establishment, as we already heard, of the Worldwide \nSchools Program, and the dispatching of volunteers, for the first time, \nto Hungary and Poland.\n  As I said, there were also 14 other Directors of the Peace Corps who \nmade significant contributions. Paul was not the Peace Corps's first \nDirector. As I mentioned, Sargent Shriver was the first Director, who \ngave the organization the kind of direction and definition it needed at \nthe outset and during his entire tenure. Loret Ruppe, who I mentioned, \nholds the honor of having served as the longest Director of the Peace \nCorps, which was during the 8 years of the Reagan administration. I \nrespected Paul Coverdell enormously. I worked closely with him on Peace \nCorps issues when he was the Director between 1989 and 1991. I actually \nchaired his confirmation hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  He and I continued to work together on Peace Corps matters when he \njoined the Senate in 1993, and served, as he did then, as the ranking \nmember. I was then chairman of the subcommittee having jurisdiction \nover the Peace Corps. Whenever he would discuss any legislation related \nto the Peace Corps, the first thing Paul Coverdell would ask was, is it \ngood for the Peace Corps? Is it going to create problems? Is it going \nto fracture the bipartisan consensus that has existed for 40 years with \nrespect to this organization?\n  Paul always put the interests of the organization, and particularly \nthe volunteers, first. I believe we should do so as well. That is our \nresponsibility, in my view.\n\n  This year the Peace Corps will celebrate its 40th anniversary since \nbeing established by President Kennedy in 1961. The Peace Corps stands \nas a living embodiment of the well-remembered challenge that President \nKennedy posed to all Americans more than four decades ago: It is not \nwhat your country can do for you but, rather, what you can do for your \nNation.\n  The Peace Corps was first established by Executive order during the \nearly\n\n[[Page S1532]]\n\ndays of the Kennedy administration. Sargent Shriver was named as its \nfirst Director. Soon thereafter Congress enacted legislation to codify \nit into law.\n  The legislation is quite simple. It set forth three goals for the \norganization: to help the people of interested nations in meeting their \nneed for trained men and women, to help promote a better understanding \nof Americans on the part of peoples served, and to help promote a \nbetter understanding of other peoples on the part of Americans.\n  As the first Director of the Peace Corps, Sargent Shriver confronted \nthe special challenge of transforming President Kennedy's challenge to \nAmerica's young adults into an operation program that would meet the \nthree goals established by this organization.\n  During the 5 years of his tenure as Director, Sargent Shriver gave \nform to the dream of voluntary service. The 14 Directors who followed \nin his footsteps benefitted from the foundation that he had established \nfor the organization. However, each succeeding Director, in his or her \nown way, has also made significant contributions, which has kept the \nPeace Corps strong and vibrant over these past 40 years.\n  The heart and soul of the organization, however, is not the Directors \nof the Peace Corps, or the Peace Corps staff in Washington, or the \nbuildings; it is the volunteers--past, present, and future.\n  Over the past 40 years, more than 161,000 Americans, young and old, \nmen and women, have given up at least 2 years of their lives in service \nto our Nation, and in far flung corners of the world. I was privileged, \nas I said at the outset of these remarks, to be one of those \nvolunteers.\n  Peace Corps volunteers have served in 130 nations, working to bring \nclean water to communities, teaching their children, helping start \nsmall businesses, and more recently joining in the international \nefforts to stop the spread of AIDS.\n  Today, there are more than 7,000 volunteers serving in 76 nations, \nworking to put a living face on America for those people in developing \ncountries who might never otherwise have any contact with America or \nher values. Through the Peace Corps, the United States has shared its \nmost valuable resource in the promotion of peace and development--its \npeople. That is our greatest resource, and volunteers are the very \nembodiment of our best values.\n  The men and women who have served and answered the call of the Peace \nCorps reflect the rich diversity of our Nation, but they have one thing \nin common; namely, a common spirit of service, of dedication, and of \nidealism. We should not let politics or partisan bickering ever in any \nway diminish that spirit. Let us continue to respect the unique nature \nof the Peace Corps and show deference to the tens of thousands of \nvolunteers who have given their time to make the Peace Corps the \ninternationally respected organization that it is today. It is more \nthan one director. It is more than any one volunteer. In fact, the sum \ntotal of the Peace Corps is larger than all of its parts. That is why \nwe should not try to embody the spirit of the organization by placing \none of its elements above the others.\n  For those reasons, I raised the objections and the reservations about \nthis resolution. I withdrew those reservations in the spirit of \ncooperation, knowing it is important that the Peace Corps not be \nembroiled in this kind of battle.\n  I hope in the future more patience will be demonstrated, more \nconsultation involved, before we move ahead at the pace we did with \nthis particular proposal. My respect and admiration to Paul and his \nfamily, to his wife, and to his staff and others who have worked with \nhim over the years. Please understand that my objections raised here \ntoday, my reservations raised here today, have nothing whatsoever to do \nwith my deep admiration for him, his work as Senator, or his work as \nDirector of the Peace Corps during his 2 years of service.\n  I thank my colleague from West Virginia and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/15/senate-section/article/S1532-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1532]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BYRD.

Mr. President, one of the most significant pieces of \nlegislation ever enacted by Congress was the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974. In my capacity as Majority Whip, as well as Chairman of the \nSenate Rules Committee's Subcommittee on the Standing Rules of the \nSenate, I was deeply involved in the preparation of the Senate version \nof that bill, S. 1541. I assembled a staff working group to make \nextensive revisions to a bill that had been reported out of the \nCommittee on Government Operations. That staff group consisted of \nrepresentatives of the chairmen of the ten standing committees of the \nSenate, four joint committees, the House Appropriations Committee, the \nCongressional Research Service, and the Office of Senate Legislative \nCounsel, and the parliamentarian of the Senate--at that time, Robert \nDove.\n  On March 19, 1974, we took S. 1541 to the Senate Floor. At that time \nI stated that, ``when Senators look back some years in the future, many \nmay be able to say that this was among the most important measures \nacted upon during our entire service in Congress.''\n  As I pointed out in my remarks on March 19, 1974, ``In the fifty \nyears subsequent to the enactment of the Budget and Accounting Act, \nCongress had permitted its `power of the purse' under The Constitution \nto slip away, or diminish.'' That trend, as I further pointed out, had \nbeen magnified during the previous five years. While presidents over \nmany decades had occasionally seen fit to withhold funds appropriated \nby Congress, in the years leading up to the enactment of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974, the President had expanded this \npractice to cover programs throughout the Government. Many billions of \ndollars had been withheld, not because of any changes in circumstances \nafter the action of the Congress in approving the funding, but merely \nbecause the President did not agree with the priorities or the \njudgments made by the Congress. As a consequence, the confidence of the \npublic in its Government processes had been diminished.\n  In order to give force, then, to Congress's spending choices, and in \norder to stop this arbitrary withholding by the executive branch, it \nwas necessary to put into place a new Budget and Impoundment Control \nAct. S. 1541 established a comprehensive congressional budget process. \nUnder that act, a budget reconciliation process was established as an \noptional procedure to enhance Congress's ability to change current law \nin order to bring revenue and spending levels into conformity with the \ntargets of the budget resolution.\n  Let me repeat that sentence. There are probably Senators who wonder, \nwhy do we have a reconciliation process? Why was it created in the \nfirst instance? Let me say again, under that act, a budget \nreconciliation process was established as an optional procedure to \nenhance Congress's ability to change current law in order to bring \nrevenue and spending levels into conformity with the targets of the \nbudget resolution.\n  At the time of the enactment of the Congressional Budget and \nImpoundment Control Act of 1974, it was thought that Congress would \npass its first budget resolution at the beginning of the session, \nfollowed by the annual appropriation bills and any other spending \nmeasures.\n  Perhaps I should say that again, just to show how far we have \nwandered from the course originally conceived by the Congress as the \nreconciliation process. At the time of the enactment of the \nCongressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, it was \nthought that Congress would pass its first budget resolution at the \nbeginning of the session, followed by the annual appropriation bills--\nall of them; today that would be 13 annual appropriation bills--\nfollowed by the annual appropriation bills and any other spending\n\n[[Page S1533]]\n\nmeasures. Then Congress would issue any reconciliation instructions \nthat might be necessary to bring the spending and the revenues in line \nwith the budget resolution. That process was to then involve the \npassage of a second budget resolution.\n  Reconciliation involves a two-stage process in which reconciliation \ninstructions are included in the budget resolution in order to direct \nappropriate committees to achieve the desired budgetary results, and \nthen to incorporate those results into an omnibus bill which is \nconsidered under expedited procedures in the House and the Senate.\n  In its report entitled, ``The Budget Reconciliation Process: Timing \nof Legislative Action,'' updated October 24, 2000, the CRS states that \nreconciliation was first used during the administration of President \nCarter in calendar year 1980 for fiscal year 1981. According to the \nCongressional Research Service, then, reconciliation was not used at \nall from the time of enactment of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 \nuntil 6 years later, in calendar year 1980. During the period since \n1980, for fiscal years 1981 through 2001, there have been 14 \nreconciliation measures enacted into law and three that have been \nvetoed.\n  As was contemplated by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the \nreconciliation process has been a very important and powerful tool with \nwhich to enforce the policies of annual budget resolutions. As a \nproperly used deficit-fighting tool, reconciliation bills that have \nbeen enacted have resulted in well over a trillion dollars in budgetary \nsavings in the past two decades.\n  I have often--at least in recent years--referred to the \nreconciliation process as a ``bear trap.'' It is a bear trap because of \nthe fast-track procedures that were included in the Congressional \nBudget Act to help Congress enact quickly necessary changes in spending \nor in revenues to ensure the integrity of the budget resolution \ntargets.\n  This fast-track procedure limits Senate debate on reconciliation \nbills to 20 hours, and that time can be further limited by a \nnondebatable motion approved by a majority vote so that there being 20 \nhours on the resolution, a majority at any time could yield back its 10 \nhours, leaving only 10 hours, and then can proceed to move that the \nremaining 10 hours be reduced to 2 hours or 1 hour or a half hour or \nzero. That would be a nondebatable motion, and it needs only a majority \nto carry. Only germane amendments are allowed to reconciliation bills. \nTime on reconciliation bills, as I have already said, may be further \nlimited by nondebatable motion. A determined majority could, in fact, \nas I have indicated, limit Senate consideration of reconciliation bills \nto no more than 1 hour, no more than 10 minutes, or no time at all.\n  Reconciliation bills, unfortunately, have proven to be almost \nirresistible vehicles for Senators to use to move all manner of \nlegislation because of these fast-track procedures. At times, the \nmisuse has been gross. On June 22, 1981, when the Senate was \nconsidering S. 1377, the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1981, then-\nmajority leader, Howard Baker, called up amendment No. 171, which was \ncosponsored by me--I was then the minority leader--and by Senator \nDomenici of New Mexico, who is chairman of the Budget Committee, and by \nSenator Fritz Hollings of South Carolina, the then-ranking member of \nthat committee.\n  Let me read a brief excerpt from a colloquy that occurred during the \ndebate on that amendment:\n\n       Mr. Baker. Aside from its salutary impact on the budget, \n     reconciliation also has implications for the Senate as an \n     institution. So long as a preponderance of its subject matter \n     has a budgetary impact, a reconciliation bill could contain \n     non-budgetary amendments to substantive law, and still be \n     protected under the Budget Act. That notwithstanding, I \n     believe--\n\n  This is Senator Howard Baker talking--\n\n       that including such extraneous provisions in a \n     reconciliation bill would be harmful to the character of the \n     Senate. It would cause such material to be considered \n     under time and germaneness provisions that impede the full \n     exercise of minority rights.\n       That was the then-majority leader, a Republican, Howard \n     Baker, speaking with reference to the protection of minority \n     rights. His party was not in the minority. His party was in \n     the majority at that time. But he spoke out on behalf of \n     minority rights.\n       Senator Baker further said:\n\n       It would evade the letter and spirit of Rule XXII.\n       It would create an unacceptable degree of tension between \n     the Budget Act and the remainder of Senate procedures and \n     practices. Reconciliation was never meant to be a vehicle for \n     an omnibus authorization bill. To permit it to be treated as \n     such is to break faith--\n\n  This is Republican majority leader, Howard Baker, speaking now --\n\n       with the Senate's historical uniqueness as a forum for the \n     exercise of minority and individual rights.\n       For principally these reasons, I have labored with the \n     distinguished minority leader--\n\n  Referring to Senator Robert C. Byrd--\n\n       with the chairmen and ranking minority member of the Budget \n     Committee, and with other committee chairmen to develop a \n     bipartisan leadership amendment. This amendment would strike \n     from the bill subject matter which all these parties can \n     agree is extraneous to the reconciliation instructions set \n     forth last month in House Concurrent Resolution 115. What \n     will remain in the bill is directly responsive to these \n     instructions, has a budgetary savings impact, and plainly \n     belongs in a reconciliation measure.\n\n  That is the end of my excerpt of Senator Baker's remarks.\n  Mr. President, I followed Senator Baker's comments in 1981, as \nfollows:\n\n       Mr. Byrd. Mr. President, if the reconciliation bill is \n     adopted in its present form, it will do violence to the \n     budget reform process. The reconciliation measure contains \n     many items which are unrelated to budget savings. This \n     development must be viewed in the most critical light, to \n     preserve the principle of free and unfettered debate that is \n     the hallmark of the United States Senate.\n       The ironclad parliamentary procedures governing the debate \n     of the reconciliation measure should by no means be used to \n     shield controversial or extraneous legislation from free \n     debate. However, language is included in the reconciliation \n     measure that would enact routine authorizations that have no \n     budget impact whatsoever. In other cases, legislation is \n     included that makes drastic alterations in current policy, \n     yet, has no budgetary impact.\n       The reconciliation bill, if it includes such extraneous \n     matters, would diminish the value of Rule XXII. The Senate is \n     unique in the way that it protects a minority, even a \n     minority of one with regard to debate and amendment. The \n     procedures that drive the reconciliation bill set limits \n     on the normally unfettered process of debate and amendment \n     because policy matters that do not have clear and direct \n     budgetary consequences are supposed to remain outside its \n     scope, talking about the scope of a reconciliation bill.\n\n  I went on to say at that time:\n\n       The amendment offered by the majority leader--\n\n  Meaning Mr. Baker--\n\n       and me omits several nonbudget related authorizations which \n     should also be stricken from this bill. The fact that they \n     were not included in this amendment should not be construed \n     as accepting their inclusion in the bill.\n       We have gone as far as we can go in this amendment, but we \n     have not gone as far as we should go.\n\n  And then, Mr. President, the amendment was agreed to by voice vote.\n  The Senate's first several years' experience with reconciliation was \ndescribed in a Congressional Research Service report entitled ``The \nSenate's Byrd Rule Against Extraneous Matters in Budget Reconciliation \nBills,'' updated July 9, 1998. In that report, CRS states that \nreconciliation legislation often contained many provisions that were \nextraneous to implementing budget resolution policies. Reconciliation \nsubmissions by committees have included things that had no budget \neffect, that increased spending or reduced revenues when the \nreconciliation instructions called for reduced spending or increased \nrevenues, or that violated another committee's jurisdiction. It was for \nthis reason that I put forth what has come to be known as the ``Byrd \nrule'' as a means of curbing such practices.\n  The Byrd rule has been extended and modified several times over the \nyears and in 1990 was incorporated into the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974 as section 313 and made permanent, 2 U.S.C. 644.\n  I will not take the time of the Senate to go into great detail about \nthe operations of the Byrd rule as applied to reconciliation measures. \nSuffice it to say, however, that, in general, a point of order \nauthorized under the Byrd rule\n\n[[Page S1534]]\n\nmay be raised in order to strike extraneous matter already in the bill \nas reported or discharged--or in the conference report--or to prevent \nthe incorporation of extraneous matter through the adoption of \namendments or motions.\n  A motion to waive the Byrd rule or to sustain an appeal of the ruling \nof the Chair on a point of order raised under the Byrd rule requires an \naffirmative vote of three-fifths of the membership of the Senate. It \ntakes 60 votes to waive that Byrd rule.\n  That Byrd rule has been criticized up one side and down the other. It \nhas been criticized by the other body, by Members of the other body \ncritical of the Byrd rule, but they should be thankful for the Byrd \nrule.\n  What I am attempting to lay out for the Senate today is the fact that \nthis reconciliation process, while being very effective in enabling \nCongress to meet its deficit reduction targets over the past two \ndecades, is fraught with opportunities for abuse because of its fast-\ntrack procedures.\n  When we created this reconciliation bill process, it was unthinkable \nthat it would be used in ways that it has come to be used. The \nprocedures have been abused. The abuse consists in the fact that those \nprocedures take away from Senators the opportunity to offer their \namendments and to debate them fully. That is the Senate's raison \nd'etre, its reason for being.\n\n  Reconciliation is a nonfilibusterable ``bear trap'' that should be \nused very sparingly and, I believe, only for purposes of fiscal \nrestraint. That was the intention in the beginning. It was not intended \nto be used as a fast track in order to ram through very controversial, \nvery costly tax cuts or to ram through authorization measures that \notherwise might entail long and vigorous debate. In other words, \nreconciliation should be used only for reducing deficits or for \nincreasing surpluses in years when no deficits are projected.\n  Relevant to this matter is a statement made on the Senate floor by \nthe distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee, Mr. Domenici, and \nrepeated in the ``Budget Process Law Annotated, 1993 edition,'' on page \n204. Here is what he said:\n\n       Mr. President, will the distinguished minority leader--\n\n  Senator Byrd--\n\n       permit me to respond to what ``extraneousness'' means thus \n     far in its evolution in the Senate? Let me suggest that, \n     going back to 1981, we have evolved these four definitions, \n     and I believe they are used by minority and majority members \n     of the committee now. I would just read them quickly:\n       One, provisions that have no direct effect on spending and \n     which are not essential to achieving the savings.\n       Two, provisions which increase spending and are not so \n     closely related to saving provisions that they cannot be \n     separated.\n       Three, provisions which extend authorizations without \n     saving money, and which are not so closely related to saving \n     provisions that they cannot be separated.\n       Four, provisions which invade another committee's \n     jurisdiction, whether or not they save money.\n       And I am not saying that is all inclusive, but, up to this \n     point, that is what we have been using.''\n\n  So, Mr. President, there we have it, the statement in 1985 of Mr. \nDomenici, our distinguished Budget Committee chairman, as to what \nshould be considered ``extraneous'' in reconciliation bills going back \nto 1981.\n  Nevertheless, in recent years, regrettably, the Republican \ncongressional leadership has chosen to stray from the definitions set \nforth by Mr. Domenici. In fact, our distinguished Democratic Leader, \nMr. Daschle, came to the Senate Floor on May 21, 1996, during \nconsideration of the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution, and delivered \nvery eloquent remarks concerning the fact that the budget resolution \nthen before the Senate contained reconciliation instructions which in \nour distinguished leader's view should not have been in order, \nessentially because that budget resolution for fiscal year 1997 \ninstructed a committee to produce a reconciliation measure that \nactually increased the deficit. At that time, Mr. Daschle pointed out \nwhat I believe most Senators felt in their hearts was the proper use of \nthe reconciliation process, namely, that reconciliation instructions \nshould be used to ensure that authorizing committees achieved their \ndeficit- reducing targets and that they should be used as a way of \nforcing deficit reduction on committees. That should be the sole reason \nfor using the highly restricted vehicle called reconciliation.\n  As our Democratic leader, Mr. Daschle, stated, ``We deprive Senators \nof their normal right to debate and amend only because we seek to \nensure that the committees follow through in the crucial business of \nexercising fiscal responsibility.'' Nevertheless, the Chair ruled that \nthe reconciliation instructions in question were in order, and the vote \non the appeal of that ruling sustained the chair by a party-line vote \nof 57 yeas to 43 nays. And, so, those reconciliation instructions were \nincluded in the fiscal year 1997 budget resolution. It bears noting \nthat the conference report on the budget resolution for 1997, on pages \n82-83, contained a discussion concerning that year's reconciliation \nprocess. I quote from page 82 of that conference report as follows,\n\n       ``Notwithstanding the fact that the authors of the 1974 \n     Budget Act were neutral as to the policy objectives of \n     reconciliation, since 1975, reconciliation and reconciliation \n     legislation has been used to reduce the deficit. The \n     conferees note that, while this resolution includes a \n     reconciliation instruction to reduce revenues, the sum of the \n     instructions would not only reduce the deficit, but would \n     result in a balanced budget by 2002.''\n\n  So, Mr. President, the fiscal year 1997 reconciliation instructions, \naccording to the conference report, resulted in deficit reduction, \ndespite the fact that one of those reconciliation instructions allowed \nfor a tax cut.\n  Now that brings us to the problem we have faced in the last two \nyears. In 1999, the reconciliation process was used by the Republican \nleadership to allow for a $792 billion tax cut to be brought to the \nSenate using fast-track budget reconciliation procedures, taking away \nthe rights of Senators to debate fully and amend that tax cut bill. I \nbelieve this was the first time (or at least one of the rare times) \nthat reconciliation instructions were issued that mandated a worsening \nof fiscal discipline for the Federal Government. Unlike the fiscal year \n1997 budget resolution, I do not believe that the budget reconciliation \ninstructions in 1999 resulted in improving the fiscal status of the \nFederal budget. Again, in the year 2000, the reconciliation process was \nused to allow for major tax cuts to be brought before the Senate in \nreconciliation bills. In short, we have, in my view, abused and \ndistorted beyond all recognition the original, very limited purpose for \nthe optional reconciliation procedure.\n  Now, Mr. President, we have reason to believe the majority will again \nthis year, put together a budget resolution which will contain \nreconciliation instructions to the Senate Finance and House Ways and \nMeans Committees directing them, this time, to bring forth a $2 \ntrillion tax cut bill. Bad habits tend to perpetuate, it seems.\n  In a recent article entitled, ``Budget Battles, Government by \nReconciliation,'' in the National Journal on January 9, 2001, the \nauthor, Mr. Stan Collender, states that, ``. . . At this point, there \nis talk about at least five different reconciliation bills--three for \ndifferent tax proposals and two for various entitlement changes. Still \nmore are being considered. Taking advantage of the reconciliation \nprocedures in this way would not be precedent-shattering, though it \nwould clearly be an extraordinary extension of what has been done \npreviously. Nevertheless, it would be the latest in what has become a \nsteady degradation of the congressional budget process.''\n  Amen. Amen. A steady degradation of the congressional budget process. \n``Reconciliation, which was created to make it easier to impose budget \ndiscipline, would instead be used to make it easier to get around other \nprocedural safeguards with the result being more spending and lower \nrevenues.'' We have virtually turned reconciliation on its head.\n  Mr. President, there is no reason whatever to consider the \nPresident's tax cut proposal as a reconciliation bill. The Senate \nshould take up that massive tax cut proposal, which could result in \nloss of revenues to the Federal Treasury of over $2 trillion over the \ncoming decade, as a freestanding measure, and today I'm writing to the \ntwo leaders urging that be done. It should be fully debated and \namended. That is what was done in 1981 when Howard Baker was majority \nleader and I was minority leader.\n\n[[Page S1535]]\n\n  President Reagan sent to Congress his tax cut proposal, as well as \nnumerous proposals to cut spending. Appropriately, Congress used the \nreconciliation process to accomplish the spending cuts in the Omnibus \nBudget Reconciliation Act of 1981, but the Reagan tax cuts were brought \nbefore the Senate as a freestanding bill and were fully debated without \ndepending on reconciliation fast-track procedures. More than one \nhundred amendments were disposed of and the Reagan tax cut bill was \ndebated for twelve days prior to its passage. The Senate Republican \nleadership chose to do the right thing by bringing the Reagan tax cut \nbill to the Senate as a freestanding measure, rather than to use fast-\ntrack reconciliation procedures. It was thoroughly aired and the \nPresident's leadership was strengthened in the process. Taking the easy \nway, doing the expedient thing rarely requires much leadership. The \nRepublican Leader, Howard Baker, did the right thing for his President, \nfor the Senate, and for the country.\n  In 1994, my own leadership pleaded with me--my own Democratic \nleader--at length to agree to support the idea that the Clinton health \ncare bill should be included in that year's reconciliation package. Not \nonly did then Majority Leader Mitchell attempt to persuade me to go \nalong, President Clinton also pressed me to allow his massive health \ncare bill to be insulated by reconciliation's protections. And \nparticularly the request to me was, ``don't make a point of order under \nthe Byrd rule.'' That would require 60 votes to overcome. There was the \nkey: the Byrd rule.\n\n  Mr. President, I could not--and I stated so to my own majority \nleader, and I stated so to my own party leader in the White House--I \ncould not in good conscience look the other way and allow what was \nclearly an abuse of congressional intent to occur. I intended, if \nnobody else did, to make that point of order under the Byrd rule.\n  So confronted with that situation, our majority leader and the others \nwho were calling on me to go along accepted in good grace the fact that \nthere was no point in pursuing that course.\n  I felt the changes, as dramatic as the Clinton health care package \nwhich would dramatically affect every man, woman, and child in this \nNation, had to be subject to scrutiny by the people of this country \nthrough amendment and debate. I said to the President, and I said to my \nmajority leader, and I said to others who importuned me to go along, I \nsaid I cannot in good conscience allow the rule to be abused. The \npeople of this country are entitled to know what is in the bill. It is \na very complicated bill. It will be a very costly bill, a very far-\nreaching bill. Not only the people of this country but also the \nSenators who are voting on the bill need to know what is in it. They \nhave a right to know what is in it. So I could not and I would not and \nI did not allow that package to be handled in such a cavalier manner.\n  That wasn't easy to do. I stood up against my own majority leader. I \nstood up against the President of my own party and the White House.\n  It was the threat--the threat--of the use of the Byrd rule that \nbolstered my position. I had 60 votes; that 60-vote provision was in my \nhand. In other words, I make the point of order, and if the Senate \nwaives it, it takes 60 votes. It would be pretty hard to do. So my view \nprevailed, and ultimately, the Clinton health care proposal was not \npassed.\n\n  It is time for this abuse of the reconciliation process to cease. We \nshould not be using tight expedited procedures to take up measures that \nworsen the fiscal discipline of the Federal budget and that have far \nreaching, profound impacts on the people of this Nation.\n  Take up measures of that kind and debate them for only 20 hours, if \nthe full 20 hours allowed should be taken? Or debate them for half that \nlong? Is that the way to fulfill our obligation to the people of this \ncountry? Is that the way that we live up to the oath we take to support \nand defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, \nforeign and domestic?\n  It is an undermining of the legislative process to use the \nreconciliation instrument in order to enact a huge tax bill which is \nvery controversial. There will be a lot of division of opinion on it. \nThere are Senators who would want to offer amendments. But that \nbeartrap of reconciliation measures, if that instrument is used, \nSenators will be denied the right to stand on their feet and debate at \nlength and to offer amendments to that huge tax bill.\n  It is not just the Senators who would be denied the right to debate \nand amend, it is the people, the people who send Senators here, the \npeople back there on the Plains and the prairies and on the stormy \ndeep, in the coal mines of this country, in the factories, in the \noffices. They are the people who would be denied the opportunity. They \nare going to pay for whatever mistake or mistakes such a huge tax cut \nmeasure will promote.\n  The Bush tax cut bill should be brought up and debated as a \nfreestanding bill, just as all appropriations bills are handled. Even \nemergency supplemental bills, to provide assistance to those who are \nhit by natural disasters, are fully debatable and amendable by the \nSenate.\n  If any proposal ever did, the President's tax proposal requires \nextensive debate, thought, and caring concern. There are too many \nissues, too many unanswered questions. We are finding that out in the \nBudget Committee, which is chaired by Mr. Domenici and the ranking \nmember of which is Senator Kent Conrad. We have had good hearings, good \nwitnesses, good questions.\n  The tax proposal could sap the budget of the resources needed to \nsolve the Social Security and Medicare crises that loom just over the \nhorizon, due to the impending retirement of the baby boom generation. I \nam talking about those people who are sitting out there in front of me; \nthat is the baby boom generation. I was around a long time before the \nbaby boom generation came along. A long time. After just 4 years of \nsurpluses, this bill could put us back on a course towards deficits, \nreturning us to the days when we had to spend the Social Security \nsurplus for day-to-day Federal operations. Do you want to go back to \nthat? Is that where we want to go back to?\n  This bill would allocate over 42 percent of the tax cuts to the \nhighest 1 percent of the taxpayers; over 42 percent of the tax cuts to \nthe highest 1 percent of the taxpayers. One might say they are the \npeople who pay that, pay most of the taxes. Well, wouldn't you like to \nbe among that group? I would like to be in that group that pays most of \nthe taxes. So shouldn't we have a discussion about this? Shouldn't we \nhave a debate about it?\n\n  Hear me, shouldn't we have a debate on this matter? I urge the \nleaders of this body to consider this. Give us a debate on this matter. \nLet the Senate work its will, after thoughtful debate and with Senators \nhaving an opportunity to offer amendments.\n  If this bill undermines the financial markets' confidence that our \nGovernment is committed to long-term fiscal discipline, it could return \nus to the days of high interest rates, making the average wage earner's \nmortgage, education, and automobile more expensive. I think that \npossibility deserves a little debate. Don't you? How about you, who are \nwatching through those cameras up there?\n  Mr. President, the Budget Committee, to the credit of the chairman \nand ranking member of that committee, has held numerous thought-\nprovoking hearings, and the testimony from those hearings has provoked \nexcellent questions from the members of that committee. But the \ntestimony has been, by no means, conclusive about the wisdom of huge \ntax cuts.\n  I will support a tax cut. I like to vote for tax cuts. That is the \neasiest vote that one can cast. I have cast 15,877 rollcall votes in my \ntenure here in this body, and what an easy matter it is to vote to cut \ntaxes. It doesn't take any courage. It doesn't take any backbone to \nvote to cut taxes. That is easy.\n  But the testimony has not been conclusive about the wisdom of huge \ntax cuts, about the size of the surplus, about the accuracy of 10-year \nprojections--and they are all over the lot, those projections, believe \nme. It is like predicting the weather. To predict what a surplus will \nbe a year from now, 2 years from now, 10 years from now?--the efficacy \nof large tax cuts as a tool for stimulating the economy; the wisdom of \nhaving some sort of trigger mechanism before proceeding with these tax \ncuts; the ability to protect Social Security and Medicare in light\n\n[[Page S1536]]\n\nof giant tax cuts; or the ability of our economy to continue its \npresent rate of growth. Serious doubts have been expressed by many of \nthose testifying and in the Budget Committee, itself, by members on \nboth sides of the aisle.\n  Yet I believe that the majority fully intends to bring the budget to \nthe Senate floor with the President's tax proposal shrouded in this \nprotective armor of reconciliation, virtually shutting out debate and \nprecluding amendments by the full membership of this body--by the full \nmembership of this body.\n  Why hold these excellent, thought-provoking hearings at all, if that \nis the plan? Why do we have to have hearings, if that is the plan from \nthe beginning?\n  Hearings are intended to try to discover the flaws in a proposal, and \nto help Members make an informed judgment about the wisdom of \nproceeding with a matter. We who serve on the Budget Committee may have \nour chance to exercise our judgment on the budget, but what about the \nrest of the body? There are many, many views in this Senate on both \nsides of the aisle, and these views deserve to be heard.\n  We are talking about a gargantuan tax cut--a behemoth, which \nthreatens to eat up the surplus, drain the Social Security and Medicare \ntrust funds, cripple domestic discretionary spending, siphon off needed \ndefense dollars, and leave us fully unprepared to deal with natural \ndisasters or foreign upheavals. We are talking about making very \ndramatic changes in our fiscal policies based on--what? Based on \nprojections. And your projection is as good as her projection or as \ngood as his or as good as mine--projections which are admitted by the \nprojectors, themselves, to be very, very tenuous, indeed.\n  I believe that the American people, those people out there, out in \nthe mountains, in the coastal areas, those to the Pacific, to the \nAtlantic, from the Canadian-U.S. line to the Gulf of Mexico--all of you \nought to have the benefit of a full and thorough debate about the \nchoices before us. Do we pay down the debt with surplus monies? Do we \nreserve some of the surplus to protect the solvency of the Social \nSecurity and Medicare Trust Funds? How do we go about creating a wise \nand thoughtful plan concerning prescription drugs? Do we spend more on \neducation, and public infrastructure? Do we allow more for Defense \nabroad and anti-terrorism at home? These are questions which need to be \nput before the full membership of the Senate and the House, and, \nthrough spirited debate and the offering of amendments, before the \nAmerican people.\n\n  This Senator just strenuously, strenuously objects to having these \nfar-reaching, critical matters swathed in the protective bandages of a \nreconciliation process and ramrodded through this body like some self-\npropelled missile. Nobody who has listened to the testimony in the \nBudget Committee could possibly claim that the right choices are clear. \nThey are not clear. There is vast uncertainty and disagreement about \nnearly every aspect of our future budget policy.\n  The President's proposals are not an edict, and the Senate is not a \nquivering body of humble subjects who must obey under any and all \ncircumstances.\n  I suggest that, if the faint dream of effecting some sort of true \nbipartisanship in Washington for a time is ever to jell into something \ntangible, reliance on reconciliation as the torpedo to deliver a knock-\nout punch for the President is a tactic which must be abandoned.\n  It is not a fair course. It is not a wise course. And, it is a course \nwhich shortchanges the American people.\n  We must not shackle the intellects of one hundred Members of the \nSenate in this way.\n  That is what we would be doing. We would shackle, hand and foot, the \nintellects of 100 Members. One-hundred representatives of 280 million \npeople would be shackled in this body, and shackled, as well, on the \nother side of the Capitol in the House.\n  We must not ignore the viewpoints of millions of Americans. We should \nnot fear the wisdom of open and free-ranging debate about a proposal \nwhich is, at best, risky business. Now is no time to circle the wagons. \nNow is the time to hear all the voices and build consensus among \nourselves and among our people.\n  There will be no victory here, if we make the wrong choices and \nplunge this Nation back to deficit status. I implore the Leadership to \nbring whatever tax bill we write to the full Senate as a freestanding \nnon-reconciliation bill for a thorough examination by this body. The \nPresident has said that he wants bipartisanship. He has said that he \nhas faith in his plan. There is no need to hide behind the iron wall of \nreconciliation. Let us not damage the President's leadership with the \nruthless misuse of a process in this body, which may hand him a very \nhollow victory, indeed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I had the opportunity to hear a good part \nof the statement by the Senator from West Virginia. As on so many \nimportant occasions, he has spoken for this institution and for our \ncountry. He has reminded us once more that as we care about the sum and \nsubstance of an issue, the process can be a more powerful factor and \nforce as it is in this particular case almost on the substance because \nwhat we are looking at is a process and a procedure which will deny \nthis Senate its true role as defined by the Founding Fathers when they \nmet in Philadelphia and devised this institution of the Senate to be a \nplace where ideas clash and where the Nation's business is to be \nconsidered in an open and deliberate way. That was going to permit the \nopportunity for the fashioning and the shaping of the legislation after \nadequate debate and consideration.\n  He is reminding us once again about our responsibilities to meet our \nFounding Fathers' intentions for this institution and how their \ndefinition is actually being corrupted by a procedure which is known as \nthe reconciliation process, which is a phrase that is probably not well \nunderstood in terms of its significance and importance in the \nconsideration of this tax reduction but will have a very dramatic \neffect on the opportunity for the American people's will to be \nexpressed by a good debate and by the opportunity for the Senate to \nwork its will.\n  This is one of the most important speeches we will hear this year.\n  I commend the Senator for taking the Senate's time in making it. I \nhave listened to him as he has studied the propositions during the past \nseveral weeks. I watched him on CNN the other night while he was in \nattendance at the Budget Committee and listening to those talking about \nproviding adequate defense of our country. I watched him for several \nhours listening to those presentations. I watched him, as well, in the \nBudget Committee when he was listening to those who spoke about the \neconomic conditions in this country and about the details of the \nPresident's budget. As always, no one studies these issues more deeply \nand more thoroughly or more comprehensively.\n  His speech today is not one of partisanship but one of statesmanship \nin reminding the Senate and, most importantly, also the leadership \nabout its responsibilities to the American people. I thank him for \nmaking it.\n  I hope, although this Chamber is not well occupied at this moment, \nall of our colleagues will take the time to examine this speech in the \nRecord tomorrow.\n  I hope he will continue to press these points as we go through this \nprocess in the days and weeks ahead because it is in the interest of \nthis institution and our country.\n  I thank the Senator for the time he has taken and for the thoughtful \npresentation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, I thank the \nSenator from Massachusetts for his time, for his waiting, and for his \nvery wise words.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/15/senate-section/article/S1536-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1536-S1542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               LOW INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am introducing a resolution, which I send \nto the desk, that addresses one of the most urgent needs of citizens \nall across the country. That resolution is cosponsored by Senators \nSchumer, Harkin, Kennedy, Durbin, and Boxer.\n\n[[Page S1537]]\n\n  What it does is call on Congress to take immediate action to enact \nsupplemental appropriations that will include funding for the Low \nIncome Home Energy Assistance Program. This program helps more than 30 \nmillion of our fellow citizens in low-income households around the \nNation to pay rising energy bills. Every one of these households have \nfixed and low incomes, and many include children and elderly. More than \ntwo-thirds of the households eligible for this assistance have annual \nincomes of less than $8,000. As energy prices have risen and so have \nthe costs to heat or cool a home, those families face an unacceptable \nproposition of choosing between their food, medicine, and other basic \nnecessities.\n  Unfortunately, this program has literally exhausted its funds in a \nnumber of States, and it is nearly exhausted in many others. As a \nresult, thousands of households around the Nation--particularly in \nareas that may face several more weeks of the severe cold weather--are \nat risk. As many colleagues know, the price of heating oil, natural \ngas, kerosene, propane, and electricity has risen significantly over \nthe past year and in some areas sharply enough to cause a deep \nfinancial burden on many households.\n  It is my hope that President Bush and the Congress can work together \nto address this situation. I have talked with many of my colleagues. \nThey share my concern, and they, too, have constituents in need. We are \nonly in the middle of February at this point, and already some States \nhave exhausted their LIHEAP support. March and April can be very cold \nmonths in New England, New York, and throughout the Midwest.\n  This resolution calls on President Bush, who has been a strong \nadvocate for LIHEAP, to work with our leadership to craft and enact \nlegislation that would put $1 billion into the LIHEAP program to help \nthose in need now when they need it. It also calls on Congress to \nsupport supplemental appropriations of $152 million in weatherization \nand $37 million on State energy conservation plan grants. These \nprograms we believe can significantly help reduce energy use and reduce \nthe overall expense of the program.\n  There has been a lot of talk of bipartisanship in this Congress. I am \nreminded that bipartisanship really always counts the most when the \nnational needs blur the lines of ideology and party. These are the \ntimes when the Senate has been at its very best. I suggest, \nrespectfully, that with Americans struggling with their heating bills, \nand all of their bills as a result of their heating bills, and with \ncommonsense relief for so many people directly within our grasp, there \nshould not be an excuse for inaction. There would be every reason to \nact responsibly and rapidly. I hope my colleagues will join us in doing \nso.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska for his courtesy, and I thank the \nChair.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, let me thank my good friend from \nMassachusetts for his concern over energy efficiency and conservation \nassistance to low-income families. I am sure he will be pleased to know \nthat in my remarks today concerning the comprehensive energy bill that \nwill be introduced on the 26th, Monday, when we come back, about noon, \nwe cover under title VI an extensive area of concern not only to the \nSenator from Massachusetts, but I think the entire eastern corridor and \nother parts of the United States that are subject to cold winters and \ndependent on high-cost heating oil.\n  I think it is appropriate to also note the study that came out by the \nCSIS yesterday indicating a reality that some of us hesitate to take \nseriously, but on the other hand this study has been underway for some \n3 years. It simply states the harsh reality that we are going to be \ndependent on hydrocarbons for the foreseeable future. It was estimated \nin that study that the increase would go from about 83 to about 90 \npercent of the energy used in the world would come from hydrocarbons, \nprimarily from the developing countries.\n  So the reality that we are likely to suddenly relieve ourselves of \nour dependence on foreign oil, unfortunately, is probably not a \nreality. The rationale for that is obvious. We don't have the \ntechnology, very frankly, particularly in the areas of transportation, \nfor any other mode. That doesn't suggest we should not continue to \nfund, if you will, alternative energy, renewable energy and so forth, \nand continue to try to develop technology, such as hydrogen and various \nother things. But to suggest that somehow out of this energy crisis we \ncan do it through conservation and efficiency alone is unrealistic. I \nwish that were the case.\n  I encourage all of my friends to take a look at this report, which is \ndone by an objective, unbiased group.\n  Let me refer specifically to sections in our draft energy bill, and \nfor the benefit of my friend from Massachusetts, who I see has left the \nfloor, I will start from the beginning rather than what I was prepared \nto do, which was to comment specifically on the areas associated with \nthe concerns of low-income families and programs on energy efficiency, \nconservation, and so forth. I will be happy to do that now that I see \nmy friend is back. I think it represents an awareness and an \nacknowledgment of a situation that simply has to have relief.\n  In title VI--energy efficiency and conservation assistance to low-\nincome families--we propose an extension of low-income home energy \nassistance. That specifically extends authorizations for the low-income \nhome energy assistance programs, or LIHEAP, as it is termed, increasing \nauthorized amounts from $2 billion to $3 billion, and it increases the \nauthorized emergency funds from $600 million to $1 billion annually and \nextends programs making payments to States.\n  The other portion that we think is important is the energy-efficient \nschools program, which in draft section 602, which establishes a new \nprogram within the Department of Energy making grants to local school \ndistricts and improving energy efficiency of school buildings, expands \nthe use of renewable energy, and authorizes $200 million in fiscal year \n2002, increasing in subsequent fiscal years.\n  We have proposed amendments to the weatherization assistance program \nwhich expand eligibility and funding authorization for weatherization \nassistance--providing grants to low-income households to improve \nresidential energy efficiency.\n  Then we have a portion that provides amendments to State energy \nprograms. It sets procedures for regular review of existing State \nenergy conservation programs and encourages regional energy \nconservation and planning.\n  It sets State energy efficiency goals of reducing energy use by 25 \npercent by the year 2010, compared to 1990 usage, and expands and \nextends authorization for State energy programs of $50 million in \nfiscal year 2000, increasing in subsequent fiscal years.\n  I look forward to our discussion when we come back from our recess on \nvarious aspects of our comprehensive bill and the bill that has been \nintroduced by my good friend, Senator Bingaman, today which covers some \nof the areas in which the Senator from Massachusetts expressed an \ninterest. Certainly, we have the motivation to try to respond because \nthere is more than a need for LIHEAP. There is a need for more \ngeneration in this country to meet the crisis that is evidenced in \nCalifornia.\n  I am going to proceed with a general outline of the bill at this \ntime.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will my colleague yield for 30 seconds?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my colleague, I very much welcome what he is \nsuggesting, and this is a debate I will welcome and I know many of my \ncolleagues will because there is a great deal of difficulty for the \ncountry in deciding what we do about the dependency as described.\n  I say again to my colleague and to my other colleagues, there is a \ndistinction between the authorization that he is requesting, which is \nin the next budget cycle, and the supplemental appropriations that we \nare requesting to deal with the crisis now for families who are out of \nmoney and States that are out of money.\n  Regrettably, what the Senator--and I know the Senator knows the \ndistinction well--is proposing is down the road, whereas we face an \nimmediate crisis in LIHEAP funding at this moment. I think the Senator \nwill agree with me, will he not, that there is that distinction between \nthese bills?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am not going to get into a debate on\n\n[[Page S1538]]\n\nthe issue now. It was unfortunate today that both sides could not reach \na resolve on the resolution concerning energy. It went to the \nDemocratic side, and there was a reluctance on the other side because \nit did not include redress of the California dilemma, which is very \ndifficult, as you know.\n  A lot of people are working on that. We have to recognize, first of \nall, that we have an energy crisis in this country. It is not unique to \none area. California needs immediate assistance. All one has to do is \ntalk to the California legislators, and the reality is to sit down in a \ntimely manner and address this with some corrective action, which is \ngoing to involve a large segment of examination of not only \nconservation, weatherization, alternative energy, renewable energy, but \nmaking sure we go back to our conventional sources of energy--it has to \ncome from somewhere--and use our technology to produce it in a safer \nmanner with less of an environmental footprint.\n  As we all know, what we have concentrated pretty much on in the last \nseveral years is natural gas at the expense of coal and other things.\n  I am going to proceed with my remarks. I thank my friend from \nMassachusetts for his comments.\n  I alert all Members as to what is in this bill because it attempts, \nfirst of all, to address the broad interests associated with the crisis \nas we see it. It goes beyond the energy crisis because it is affecting \nthe economy of this Nation as we see higher prices, shortages, and we \nsee a growing consumer concern, a lack of confidence. A lot of it stems \nfrom the energy situation in this country.\n  What we are attempting to do, with the efforts of many people, is \nbring together a comprehensive outline. We will introduce the \nlegislation on Monday the 26th. It will be referred, I believe, under \nrule XIV to the calendar, and from there it is referred to the two \ncommittees of jurisdiction. There is a tax aspect, and I suspect that \nwill move to the Finance Committee on which I serve. The other portion \nwill move to the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which I chair.\n  It is our intention then to begin hearings on this legislation as \nsoon as possible, and other legislation that has been introduced. \nSenator Byrd has a coal bill. Senator Bingaman has a bill affecting \nLIHEAP. At the same time, I urge Senator Grassley, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, to begin holding hearings, as well, on the tax \naspects of this proposed legislation.\n  It is important to note the role of the administration. The Vice \nPresident has announced the formation of an energy task force. This \ntask force is unique because it attempts to set energy policy for this \nNation--what direction should we go. Unlike the previous effort where \nthe Secretary of Energy, the head of the EPA, and the Secretary of the \nInterior pretty much went their separate ways, he is attempting to \nbring them together to address how we are going to handle resource \ndevelopment on public land for oil and gas, what role the Department of \nEnergy is going to play in coordinating, if you will, an action that \nEPA may initiate that could put off the ability to produce more oil and \ngas--a coordinated effort to make policy.\n  We are going to get that from the administration, I imagine, 40 to 50 \ndays from now. That will be incorporated in either a substitute or \namendments to this proposed legislation.\n  Believe me, the legislation we will introduce is probably not in its \nentirety the legislation that is going to be adopted. It is going to be \nmassaged, it is going to be cut, it is going to be stricken, it is \ngoing to be added to.\n  We have to start. It is not going to be a piecemeal effort. It is an \nattempt to address, across the board, in a responsible manner, the \nconcerns affecting the dilemma in this country as we seek energy \npolicy, as we seek relief and address the economy that is being \naffected by this.\n  The first title covers general provisions to protect energy supply \nand security. It involves consultation and reports on Federal energy \nactions affecting domestic energy security and supply.\n  Then we have an annual report on U.S. energy independence. The idea \nis to what extent should we try and maintain a greater degree of \nindependence in this country from the standpoint of our national \nsecurity.\n  It covers the National Strategic Petroleum Reserve and requires a \nstudy and report. As my colleagues know, we try to keep a 90-day \nsupply. Today, we have about a 56-day supply, and the merits of having \nthat should our imports be interrupted is paramount.\n  We have a study of existing rights-of-way to determine capability to \nsupport new pipelines or electric power transmission. It is just not \nenough to have energy. We have to transport it. Some of our pipelines \nare old. Some of our transmission facilities are inadequate. We have \nproblems with eminent domain. How do you get there from here? How do \nyou cross public lands?\n  We have a section covering the expanded use of Federal facilities to \ngenerate hydropower. We have a section requiring a nuclear generation \nstudy. Twenty percent of our energy comes from nuclear energy, and we \nhave yet to deal with the nuclear waste issue. We were one vote short \nof a veto override in this body last year. We still, very frankly, are \nseeing the nuclear industry strangling on its own waste and our \ninability to address it with resolve. The French adopted in 1973 a \nnuclear program and they are almost 90 percent dependent on nuclear \nenergy. They recover the plutonium, reinject it in the reactors, and \naddress the waste in a responsible way. We cannot seem to get over that \nhump, yet we are 20 percent dependent.\n  We have a section on development of a strategy for spent nuclear \nfuel.\n  We have a section to study the status of the domestic refining \nindustry. It is interesting, during a portion of our previous \ndiscussion on this topic, when we brought 30 million barrels out of the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve, suddenly we found out our refineries were \nat full capacity. We have not built a refinery in 20 years. What a rude \nawakening.\n  We have a section to review the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission's annual reports on the availability of domestic energy \nresources to maintain the electric grid, a study of financing for new \ntechnologies, a review of regulations to eliminate barriers to emerging \nenergy technology, interagency agreements on environmental review of \ninterstate natural gas pipeline projects, a program for pipeline \nintegrity safety and reliability, and research and development for new \nnatural gas technologies.\n\n  For clean coal technology, we have cost and performance goals. We \nhave technological research and development programs, authorization and \nappropriations for R power plant improvement initiatives, various \ncoal mining research and development provisions, and programs to \nimprove railroad efficiency.\n  For oil and gas we have deepwater and frontier royalty relief which \nhas been so beneficial in the Gulf of Mexico where we have seen \ndrilling take place now in 3,000 feet of water. Lease sales are going \nas deep as 6,000 feet. The technology has been developed rapidly and \nsuccessfully.\n  Some in the media have picked this up and said this is a boondoggle \nfor big oil. There is no alternative minimum tax here. This isn't \nsomething for big oil. Big oil can do very well on its own. It does not \nneed assistance. However, the small guys do. The stripper wells do. \nSome of the independents do.\n  So we have a use of royalty in kind to fill the Strategic Petroleum \nReserve. We have improvements to Federal oil and gas lease management. \nWe have a royalty reinvestment in America provision. On nuclear, we \nhave the Price-Anderson amendments which address the liability on the \nnuclear plants. We have a nuclear energy research initiative, nuclear \nenergy plant optimization programs, nuclear energy technological \ndevelopment, nuclear energy production incentive, and nuclear energy \nimprovements.\n  We have a provision for the Arctic Coastal Plain Security Act Of 2001 \nwhich proposes opening up ANWR, which I will discuss in my concluding \nremarks because that seems to be the lightning rod in the whole bill.\n  I mentioned when my friend, Senator Kerry from Massachusetts, was \nhere, the title on energy efficiency conservation assistance to like \nfamilies. We have covered that. We also have enhancement and extension \nof authority relating to Federal energy savings, performance contracts, \nFederal energy efficiency requirements, energy efficiency science \ninitiatives. We also have\n\n[[Page S1539]]\n\nan alternative fuels and renewable energy section, a significant \nsection. We have an exception to HOV passenger requirements for \nalternative fuel vehicles. If you have an alternative fuel vehicle, \nsomething that doesn't run on gasoline, you can take it on the HOV lane \nall by yourself. We have alternative fuel credits for qualifying \ninfrastructure, State and local governments use of Federal alternative \nrefueling requirements, and mandates on Federal fleet fuel economy, and \nuse of alternative fuels.\n  If we are going to mandate things, the Government ought to lead the \nway, not the public. Our bill requires Federal agencies to increase the \nfuel economy of newly acquired Federal fleet passenger cars and light \ntrucks by at least 3 miles per gallon by the year 2005. We are putting \ngovernment where it ought to be, leading the way.\n  We have local government grant programs, extension of special \ntreatment of duel-fuel vehicles under Department of Transportation fuel \neconomy standards. We have renewable energy programs for residential, \naccess to renewable energy resources. We have hydroelectric relicensing \nreform, which includes processes for consideration of Federal agencies \non the condition of licensing of various facilities, including hydro \ndams, coordinating environmental review processes, and a study of small \nhydro projects. This bill helps ensure electric energy transmission \nreliability, and repeals PURPA mandatory purchase and sale \nrequirements. We also repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act, \nand encourage emission-free control measures under the State \nimplementation plans.\n\n  On the aspect of taxes, we have enhanced oil recovery credit extended \nto certain nontertiary recovery methods, such as horizontal drilling. \nWe have extension of Section 29 credits for producing fuel from \nnonconventional sources. We have 10-year carryback for a percentage of \ndepletion for certain oil and gas properties. We repeal the current net \nincome limitation on that percentage depletion. We clarify the \ndefinition of a ``small refiner'' as used in an exception to the oil \ndepletion deduction, and we accelerate depreciation of oil and gas \npipelines, petroleum facilities, and refineries. We also have capital \nconstruction funds for U.S. drilling vessels. We provide credits for \ninvestment to qualifying clean coal technology.\n  Regarding coal, we have huge coal reserves in this country. We could \nreduce our dependence on imported oil but we have not built a new coal-\nfired plant since 1985 because you cannot get a permit. We've used \nnatural gas for electric energy producing capability, but we have the \ncoal here. We have the technology to clean it up, and we should use it. \nWe may have to adjust the permitting process to expedite it, but not at \nthe sacrifice of the environment by any means.\n  We have new credits for investment for qualifying advanced clean coal \ntechnology, credits for production for qualifying advanced clean coal \ntechnology, and provisions relating to private loan financing for long-\nterm natural gas contracts. We include the electric power industry's \nagreement on so-called ``private use restrictions\": tax-exempt bond \nfinancing of certain electric facilities, and we allow expensing of \ncosts incurred for temporary storage of nuclear fuel. We have tax \nincentives for energy efficiency: credits for distributed power and \ncombined heat and power property, a tax credit for energy efficiency \nimprovements to existing homes and for construction of new energy-\nefficient homes, a tax credit for energy-efficient appliances and motor \nvehicles, and we have a credit for alternative fueled vehicles and for \nqualified electric vehicles, credit for retail sales of alternative \nfuels as motor vehicle fuel, extension of deductions for certain \nrefueling property, and an additional deduction for the cost of \ninstallation of alternative fuels.\n  For renewable energy, we make modifications to the Section 45 credit \nfor electricity produced from renewable resources, and extend it to \ninclude waste energy, and we establish a new tax credit for residential \nsolar and wind property. Finally, we treat facilities using bagasse, \nsugar cane waste, to produce energy as solid waste disposal facilities.\n  Now if your particular area of interest is not in here, let us know \nand we will include it. This is a comprehensive bill. I remind all of \nmy colleagues, this is an effort to start a process to address a \nproblem that is affecting not only our economy but is creating a \ngrowing energy crisis moving from California across the country.\n  One of the lightning rods in the bill is the issue of ANWR, which is \nin my State of Alaska. I have tried several times, but I can't seem to \nget across the significance of trying to put this in perspective. I am \nhappy to say that the occupant of the Chair is not from Texas because \nAlaska happens to be 2\\1/2\\ times the size of Texas. Put this in \nperspective: If we overlay Alaska on the United States, we get a \npicture of how big Alaska is. In the north it would touch Canada, and \nin the south it would touch Mexico; on the right it touches Florida, \nand on the left it goes to California. It is a big hunk of real estate.\n  What does it consist of? Anchorage is our largest city. In the upper \nright-hand corner is an area that is magically called ANWR. What does \nANWR mean? It means the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. That sounds \npretty significant. What does ANWR consist of? Congress in 1980 made \nsignificant decisions in determining what this area would consist of \nand be used for. Out of the 19 million acres in ANWR, they determined \nthey would designate 8.5 million acres of it as pure wilderness--that \nis the area in black with the slashes--8.5 million acres wilderness, no \ntrack vehicles, no activity of any kind. Visitors can go in on foot, \nand that is it. They decided to make 9.5 million additional acres a \nrefuge. This area below was designated a refuge, even though the whole \n19 million acres is classified as a refuge. But they did one other \nthing. They left out the Coastal Plain. This is the area in tan. That \nis 1.5 million acres. If you add all that up, you get 19 million acres. \nThat is all of ANWR. But the difference and the point is, there cannot \nbe any development in the wilderness. There cannot be any development \nin that refuge where the pointer is.\n\n  Congress has, solely, the authority to open up the ANWR Coastal Plain \narea. It is important to note what is in there because some people say \nit is the Serengeti of the West; it is the Grand Canyon--whatever. \nThere is an Eskimo village there. People are living there. There are \nabout 227 residents of Kaktovik.\n  Let me show you some pictures of Kaktovik. Here are some kids going \nto school in Kaktovik in the morning. You notice they didn't do a good \njob shoveling the walks. It is pretty harsh. It is winter about 10 \nmonths of the year. The kids are happy. One of them is getting some new \nteeth. You wonder why they are in the Eskimo parkas. Those ruffs are \nwolf ruffs. Do you know why they wear wolf ruffs? Because the breath \ndoesn't freeze on wolf fur, but it freezes on others.\n  Here is what it looks like in the summertime. To suggest this is a \npristine wilderness with nothing on it is a bit misleading. People live \nthere. They hunt.\n  You can see the radar site. That is the radar site, in part. That is \nthe DEW line, and the Arctic Ocean, and the ice is out there. There is \nan airfield and a couple of hangars, schools, little stores, and so \nforth.\n  We have another picture of Kaktovik. But my point in going through \nthis is to illustrate that, indeed, in ANWR there is a designated area \nwith only the authority by Congress to open it up, and it is that tiny \nfraction. Let's go back to the map again, the tiny fraction that we are \nconsidering, and that is the Coastal Plain.\n  If we do the arithmetic, we have already said it is 19 million acres \nin the ANWR area, and we are talking about leasing 1.5 million acres. \nAnd then the question is, What happens if you do that?\n  Let me show you a couple of things.\n  You see over on the left is what they call the Trans-Alaska pipeline. \nThat is a 800-mile, 48-inch pipeline. It was built about 26 years ago \nand runs from Prudhoe Bay the length of Alaska. That goes the whole \nlength of the State, 800 miles down to Valdez. That is where the oil \nflows. That is already there.\n  It comes, you will notice, from Prudhoe Bay. Prudhoe Bay is the \nlargest oilfield in North America. It has been producing about 20 \npercent of the total crude oil produced in the United\n\n[[Page S1540]]\n\nStates for about 26 years. That pipeline was built so we could move \nthat oil to market.\n  We tried to move it by tanker. We built the Manhattan and thought we \nwould take it through the ice to the east coast. It did not work. The \nice is simply too thick, so we built a pipeline. But the interesting \nthing is that the environmentalists said: If you build that pipeline \nthe length of Alaska, the moose and the caribou are going to be \ndivided. They will not be able to cross it. It is going to be an \nenvironmental disaster. That is a hot pipeline because that oil is hot \nwhen it comes out of the ground, and if you put the pipeline in \npermafrost, frozen ground, it is going to melt the ground, it is going \nto break, and you will have a mess on your hands.\n  All those doomsayers were wrong. It didn't happen. These are the same \narguments being used today. They are saying if you go up there and open \nup that area, you are going to have a disaster.\n\n  What you have is interesting. You already have, between Prudhoe Bay \nand ANWR, an area--BP has a discovery in Badami. Badami is about 40 \nmiles from Prudhoe Bay towards ANWR. There is a pipeline that goes out \nto Badami. Another 40 miles of pipeline added to that 20 and you will \nbe in ANWR.\n  Another significant thing, there was one oil well drilled in \nKaktovik, drilled there before 1980. It is what is called a tight hole. \nNo one knows what is there other than Chevron and BP, but the \ngeologists are excited because they say this area could contain a major \ndiscovery of a magnitude of ranging anywhere from 3.2 billion to 16 \nbillion.\n  When you look for oil, you usually don't find it. If you look for it \nin Alaska, you better find a lot or we can't develop it. If we can't \nget 5,000 barrels, forget it; it will not be economically viable. That \nis where Prudhoe Bay has been so prolific. If it is not there in the \nmagnitude it has to be, then the whole argument is academic. The \nquestion is, How significant is it?\n  I want to show a couple of photos of what the pipeline is used for. \nIt has a dual use.\n  Here are three bears going for a walk on the pipeline. The reason \nthey are walking there is it is easier than walking on the snow. It is \nlike a paved highway. Nobody is bothering them, nobody is shooting \nthem.\n  Here is a picture of what happens in Prudhoe Bay in the summertime, \nwhich doesn't last very long. These are the caribou. These are not \nstuffed; they are real. Nobody is bothering them, shooting them, \nrunning them down. This herd was 3,000 animals in the central Arctic \nwhen we started Prudhoe Bay. There are 26,000 caribou there now. We are \ndoing fine.\n  We talk about the polar bear. Let's show an ice picture. It is mostly \nice up there, but here is a nice picture. That is a nice ice picture. \nThat is the harsh, bleak ANWR area in the wintertime, 10 months of the \nyear. They say the polar bears are there--they are not there, they are \nout at sea.\n  Talk about polar bear, the U.S. has the greatest conservation for \npolar bear of any of our Arctic neighbors. If you want to trophy hunt \npolar bears, you can go to Russia or Canada, but you can't do it in the \nUnited States. It is prohibited. You can't take them. The Natives can \ntake them for subsistence. So that is a bogus argument. There is a new \nstudy out and the number of polar bears have increased dramatically.\n  Here is a picture of the technology we have today, as far as drilling \nin the Arctic. You notice the ice road? There is no gravel road. They \npour water on the snow, it freezes, and bingo, you have a road. OK?\n  That is a drill rig out in the middle of nowhere. You see the cars \nmoving, you see the Arctic Ocean out there. That is the footprint. That \nis directional drilling. We have technology that lets you drill 100 \nwells through one of these, one spot, with directional drilling. It is \nnot like in the old days.\n  What does it look like in the summertime? It looks like this for \nabout 2 months. There is the tundra and that is what comes out, and the \nfootprint is pretty small.\n  This is the drilling technology. This is out of the New York Times \nabout 2 weeks ago. It shows you how they drill from one spot and go \ninto various areas because they have a technology that they call 3-D \nseismic. It used to be 2-D. They can look down now and spot these \nlittle spots. Where they used to, if they hit the big one on the right, \nthey were lucky, but now they can go after those little ones and get \ngreater recovery through this from directional drilling technology. So \nyou don't get a footprint all over the place, but the footprint is \nestimated to be 2,000 acres out of 19 million.\n  We asked the geologists to tell us--Prudhoe Bay is a big oilfield--we \nasked what the footprint is total, all the pipelines, the gathering \nstations, the bunkhouses, the various things. I think the figure was \nabout 6,000 acres, but they said if they were going to do it today, \nthey could do a field the size of Prudhoe Bay with a technology of \n1,000 to 2,000 acres. So we are looking at the increasing manageability \nof the footprint.\n  I think I said enough about the technology. I think I have given you \na picture of what ANWR consists of in the 19 million acres. I have \ntried to portray what is at risk here, 1.5 million acres.\n  But I will conclude with a little reference to some of my colleagues, \nsome of whom said if this comes up, we are going to filibuster the \nissue.\n  Let me remind my colleagues. Don't they have an obligation to come up \nwith an alternative? What are the alternatives? If we look at reality, \nwe have to admit that with a 56-percent dependence on imported oil, and \nthe reality of EIA saying that is going to increase to 70 percent by \nthe year 2010, or thereabouts, and the CSIS study that says \nunfortunately we are going to become more dependent on the world for \nhydrocarbons and oil, that suggests there is not much relief in sight; \nwe are going to continue to become more and more dependent.\n  I was asked while giving a speech the other day: Senator, since it \nwas 37 percent in 1973 and now it is 56 percent, at what point do you \nbelieve our national security interest is compromised? I thought about \nit for a minute. I said: The best answer I can give you is that in 1991 \nwe fought a war. We fought a war over oil. We fought a war against \nSaddam Hussein to stop him from invading Kuwait. And ultimately his \nmission was to go into Saudi Arabia and control the world's supply of \noil. That is how important it was. Was it a national security issue? \nSure, it was. We don't want Saddam Hussein to control the oil. Where \nwould we be today if Saddam Hussein controlled the oil?\n  When you look at 56 percent and the reality of our increased \ndependence, the idea comes across that maybe we ought to try to reduce \nour dependence on imports. Then the question is, How do you do it? \nBefore I tell you how to do it--I will conclude with that. My wife \nkeeps reminding me: You keep saying that, and you never keep your word.\n  That reality is associated with where we are now acquiring our \ngreatest increase in imported oil. It is from Iraq. We fought a war in \n1991. We lost 147 lives. We had 400-some wounded. We had 23 taken \nprisoner.\n  Let's look at our foreign policy and try to make it simple so it is \nunderstandable, because we are flying sorties over Iraq; we are \nbombing. He sells us 750,000 barrels a day. It is increasing, I might \nadd. I met him. He is not a nice guy. You try to kind of figure out \nwhat he is up to, and you generalize by saying he is up to no good. We \nare getting 750,000 barrels a day. We are sending our money over there. \nWe get his oil, put it in our airplanes, and go bomb Iraq. We do it \nagain the next day. If you believe it, we have flown hundreds and \nthousands of sorties. We are buying his oil, giving him the money, \nputting it in our airplanes, and bombing him. I kind of question that \nforeign policy. It may seem a little oversimplistic.\n  Let's ask Saddam Hussein what he is doing with the money. He is \nbuilding a military capability, a missile delivery capability, a \nbiological capability, and where is it aimed? Our greatest ally, \nIsrael.\n  If I have made a full circle, which has been my intention, I hope I \nhave been able to communicate what I consider a terrible inconsistency.\n  What we have in this bill is a commitment and a goal to reduce our \ndependence on imported oil to 50 percent, or less, by the year 2010. We \ncan do it in a combination of ways. One is by opening up the area of \nANWR. One is\n\n[[Page S1541]]\n\nopening up the overthrust belt in Montana, in Wyoming, and Colorado--\nareas that have been withdrawn by the previous administration by the \nroadless policy. There are 23 trillion cubic feet of gas taken off \ncommercial availability by that roadless designation in those States.\n  We can do something about reducing our dependence. Then we can bring \non our improved technology of our conventional resources, such as \nnuclear, by addressing what we are going to do with nuclear waste; \nbring on our coal by developing our clean coal technology; and we can \nreduce our dependence, because it is in the national security interests \nof our Nation to reduce our dependence on the Mideast.\n\n  One thing the CSIS study points out is that for the foreseeable \nfuture the world will be looking at energy sources from unreliable, \nunstable areas of the world that foster terrorism. I get the message. I \nam sure you do, too.\n  The reality is that the argument against opening up this area is \nabsolutely bogus. The bottom line is, the extreme environmental \ncommunity needs an issue. And ANWR is their issue. It raises dollars. \nIt raises membership. It raises fear. It never addresses the advanced \ntechnology and whether we can do it safely. Of course we can. We have \nhad 30 years of experience in the Arctic. The footprint is smaller. The \ntechnology is better. But they need an issue that is far away, that the \nAmerican people and most of the press can't afford to go up and look \nat.\n  I have pleaded with Members to come up before they speak as experts \non what should be done in my State and look at it--take a look at it \nobjectively. One Senator said to me after we landed and got out of the \nhelicopter, after he looked around: All right, Frank. Where is the \nwilderness? It is a mentality. Where is the wilderness? That is the \nwilderness. It is like there ought to be a sign that says ``Wilderness \n2 miles around to the left''. You see. But I can't get Members to go.\n  We have a trip coming up. I implore those of you who feel strongly \nabout this issue to find out something about it, because your \ninformation is coming from one source--America's environmental \ncommunity. And this is their fight. They have to have it. It is their \nbread and butter. And they use scare tactics.\n  I am going to mention one more thing. This is a Canadian issue. We \nhad the Canadian Minister on Environment here. He says to his Foreign \nMinister that we ought to oppose opening this area. He went down and \ntalked to the Canadian Ambassador. Then he talked to our new Secretary \nof State. Canada looks on Alaska as a competitor for energy. That is \nneither here nor there. We get a significant amount, and a growing \namount, of our energy from our good neighbors in Canada. But they do \nnot practice what they preach, and they don't tell you the truth, \nunless you ask the right questions. Being on the Intelligence \nCommittee, you know how that works.\n  Let me show you what this is. You see Alaska on the left. Over on the \nright is Canada. That green line divides them. You see the Arctic \nCoastal Plain up at the top. This is the route of porcupine caribou, \nwhich is a different herd from the pictures I showed you before. These \nanimals migrate through northern Canada on that route that shows the \ntan area that moves around.\n  Up at the top, you see a lot of little things. Those are oil wells \nthat the Canadians have drilled in Canada. There are about 89 of them. \nYou see them particularly up at the top. They made a park out of that \narea because they did not strike any oil. That is Canada's own \nbusiness. I admire them for making a park out of it. But the caribou \nwere going through there when the oil wells were being drilled. The \npregnant cows were going through there and going back to the calves. \nThat is neither here nor there--just to point out an inconsistency.\n  They said they made a park out of it and that we ought to make a park \nout of ANWR. They don't tell you they built a highway through there. \nThere it is--the Dempster Highway right through the migration of the \ncaribou. It doesn't bother them. Trucks stop, and so forth. The \ngreatest danger to the caribou is people running them down with snow \nmachines and shooting them.\n  We have what we call the Gwich'in people. They are a fine group who \nlive partially in Canada, at Old Crow, and over at Fort Yukon on our \nside. So they cross the border. This group many years ago proposed to \nlease some of their land on the Alaska side for oil drilling. We have \nthe situation of the individual members on the leases. Unfortunately, \nthere was not any interest because the geology wasn't very promising. \nSo the oil industry did not choose to take them up on their leases. Of \ncourse, now they don't acknowledge they were ever willing to lease \ntheir land.\n  I just point that out as a bit of inconsistency. It is just part of \nthe history, and we move on from there. But the difference is the \nGwich'in people are two groups: The Gwich'in people themselves and the \nGwich'in steering committee, which is funded by the national \nenvironmental groups, such as the Sierra Club. They, unfortunately, \nhave a significant voice. And much of that voice is fear. They put fear \nin these people; that if we have this development up in ANWR, the \nlivelihood and the dependence on the porcupine caribou herd will be \nsacrificed to the point they will lose their subsistence.\n\n  The other group is a little more open. To make my point--and I think \nit is important--if you look at the other map, the one showing the top \nof the world, you will see Alaska over here, and you see Barrow above \nPrudhoe Bay. This is our northern most community. It is a large Eskimo \nvillage.\n  What they have been able to do is, they formed a borough or a county. \nThey formed their regional corporations. They formed their village \ncorporations. They tax the oil activity. They tax the pipeline. They \nhave the finest schools in the United States. They have indoor \nrecesses. You can't believe it. They have health care.\n  Every child has an opportunity for a full-blown college education \nfrom the revenues that come in to the Eskimo people. They manage. They \nhave become the strongest capitalists that I have ever seen. They do \nnot have time for the inefficiencies of the Federal Government. It has \nbeen an extraordinary transition because they have a revenue stream. \nTheir traditions of whaling are maintained.\n  What they have done is, they have invited the Gwich'ins up to see \ntheir standard of living on three occasions. The Gwich'ins almost came \nthe last time, until the Gwich'ins' steering committee said: You can't \ngo. You can't break the heritage. This is the influence, if you will, \nunfortunately, that exists.\n  Because the Barrow people now have educational opportunities, they \nhave a choice. They can follow subsistence--hunting and fishing--they \ncan go to college; they can move into jobs in the oil industry. There \nis very little employment in the Gwich'in area. That is their own \nbusiness. I respect their choice. What I don't respect is the influence \nof the outside groups that use them. That is what I object to.\n  That is what a lot of this debate is all about because, as I said \nbefore--and the bottom line is--the environmental community needs this \nissue. They are milking it for all it is worth. A few of us are trying \nto bring in the realities that the arguments today against opening ANWR \nare the same arguments that were used against opening Prudhoe Bay 27, \n28 years ago.\n  That is the extent of my harangue at this late hour, to try to put in \nperspective the debate. When my colleagues come to this floor and say: \nI am going to filibuster the issue, I think they ought to address the \nissue. I think they ought to go up and see for themselves. And I think \nthey have an obligation to address the alternatives because you are not \ngoing to conserve your way out of this energy crisis. I think all of us \nwho are realistic recognize that. We are going to need all of our \nsources of energy. We are going to need all of our technology. We are \ngoing to have to come together on reality.\n  There are two other things I wish to say. One is people might say, \nSenator Murkowski, this is only a 6-month supply based on the reserves.\n  First of all, nobody knows what is in there. But let's say it is a 6-\nmonth supply. When you say that, that is assuming there is not going to \nbe any other oil produced in the whole United States, in the gulf, or \nany place else for 6 months--pretty significant--no trains, no \nboats, no airplanes.\n\n[[Page S1542]]\n\n  If you turn it around--and from my point of view--if we do not allow \nthe development, that is like saying this country is not going to have \n6 months' worth of oil for its trains, so forth and so on.\n  So you can flip that ridiculous argument around and it still comes \nout a ridiculous argument. So I do not put much significance in it, \nbut, nevertheless, it is one of the arguments that is used.\n  Remember Prudhoe Bay? Ten billion barrels was the estimate. They have \ngotten 12 billion barrels already, and they are still kicking 1 million \nbarrels a day. The technology is there, and certainly the need is. \nAgain, I appeal to my colleagues who are still with us at this late \nhour, and all my colleagues, to recognize the national security \ninterests of this country. And when--and at what point--we become \nvulnerable to imports, we have to consider what it does to the security \nof this Nation. We have already fought one war over oil. To me, that \nsends a pretty strong message.\n  I will simply recall the remarks of our friend and former colleague, \nSenator Mark Hatfield, who said: One of the reasons I support opening \nANWR is I will never support sending another member of our Armed Forces \ninto harm's way in the Mideast in a war over oil.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/02/15/senate-section/article/S1542-1", "month": "02", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR MONDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 2001\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.
