Mr. President, I take to the floor this morning to talk \nabout an issue that is very near and dear to the hearts of the American \npeople. It is very near and dear to the hearts of Californians and very \nnear and dear to my heart. That is a clean and healthy environment for \nour people. I know the Presiding Officer shares my view on this very \nimportant issue.\n  When I was a little girl, my mother would say you can have \neverything, but if you don't have your health, you\n\n[[Page S4428]]\n\nreally don't have anything. She was right about that. The older I get, \nthe more I realize that is true. You can have a wonderful home, \nwonderful family, but if someone is ill, someone has chronic problems, \nit takes over. That is what a clean and healthy environment means. It \nmeans clean air; it means clean water, safe drinking water; it means \nbeautiful places to take your family.\n  In the old days, people used to say only the elitists were \nenvironmentalists. In other words, it was a movement about people who \nhad everything. The truth is, it is quite the contrary because the \npeople who have a lot of resources and a lot of money can buy their own \nenvironment. They can buy a big piece of property. It can have a lake \non it, beautiful trees, and mountains. They can enjoy it forever, as \nlong as they live. But ordinary families cannot do that. They need to \nrely on the environment that we all share.\n  Most of our people live in urban areas or near urban areas. In \nCalifornia, about 90 percent of our people live close to urban areas. \nIn the rest in the country as a whole, it is almost 80 percent. The \nfact is, most of us live near businesses, and some pollute. We live in \na shared environment. Sometimes it is an environment that is not as \nhealthy as it should be. We know now what causes the pollution. It is \nno great surprise.\n  What brings me here? To say that I am distressed at the record of \nthis administration on the environment. Almost every day we have \nsomething else to which we can say: Oh my God, what are they doing? We \nbelieve it is time to call attention to it. We think when we call \nattention to it, they may well change their ways. We have proof of that \nin one particular issue that I will discuss. But, also, the American \npeople need to know the values of this administration compared to their \nown values. When so many of our children have asthma, this is not a \ntime to turn away from the Clean Air Act and put up some phony proposal \nthat you say is better but is worse. We have a leader on that issue, \nSenator Jeffords, very clearly saying that is the direction in which \nthis administration is going.\n\n  When we have children who are suffering from too much lead in their \nblood and we know that leads to disability, sometimes coma, blindness, \nsometimes even death--certainly learning disabilities and mental \nretardation--it is not a time to float a proposal that says we should \nstop testing poor kids for lead in their blood.\n  What has happened as a result of this attack on the environment--and, \nby the way, I will go through more issues--is that our majority leader, \nTom Daschle, has appointed what I call the E team, the environmental \nteam. That team comprises several Senators: Bill Nelson, Cantwell, \nClinton, Reid, Wyden, Lieberman, Torricelli, and myself. We are \nexamining on a daily basis what this administration is doing to us on \nthe environment. We have created a Toxic Trophy Award to go to those \nparticular agencies that are doing the most damage.\n  Two weeks ago, we gave that award to the Department of Health and \nHuman Services for their proposal to consider not testing poor kids for \nlead in their blood. We pounded away pretty hard and we presented our \nToxic Award in a ceremony. They were not there, but in absentia we \npresented the award. Guess what happened. Yesterday we read in the \npaper that they decided they are going to back away.\n  We are really glad. We see this happening all over. My friend is very \ninvolved in education issues. Senator Kennedy and I know that the \nPresiding Officer, Senator Reed, and others were there to point out the \nadministration is going to make it more difficult for our young people \nto pay back college loans. You pounded on this administration, and \nguess what happened. They backed away.\n  We think this administration functions in a very interesting way. \nThey do a lot of things in the dead of night. They hope nobody notices. \nThe newspapers may write a couple of articles, but then they figure the \npublicity will die down. And the American people, frankly, are worse \nfor it.\n  The E team and the other teams Senator Daschle has set up, be it for \nprescription drugs or Social Security, the many issues we are looking \nat, are not going to allow these policy changes to go unnoticed.\n  Today I want to put on record and share with you, Mr. President, \nsince I see you are the one with whom I can share it, what has happened \nsince this administration took over in terms of the environment.\n  We think the place to start is an organization called the Natural \nResources Defense Council, the NRDC. This is a great organization. They \nare nonprofit and nonpartisan. They employ about 200-plus lawyers and \nscientists to follow what various administrations are doing with regard \nto the environment. As I say, they are very nonpartisan. They did not \nlike a couple of things the Clinton administration did, and they went \npretty heavily for it on a few issues. They are unrelenting in their \npursuit of a clean environment for our families.\n  Most of the time they agreed with the Clinton administration because \nthe Clinton administration, I would say, was probably the most pro-\nenvironmental administration we have seen in many years. But even then, \nwhen they believed the administration was wrong, they went after them.\n\n  They have kept a record of this administration's decisions on the \nenvironment. That is what I want to talk about. What they have found is \nthat there are more than 90 separate actions this administration has \ntaken that are bad for public health and the environment. Let me repeat \nthat. They have not been in office that long--it seems like yesterday--\nand already 90 separate actions that this administration has taken are \nbad for public health and the environment.\n  I do not have time to put this entire list in, but let me show you \nthe report. It is called ``Rewriting The Rules, The Bush \nAdministration's Assault On The Environment.'' It has a picture of some \nbeautiful land with a used tire in the middle. Everyone should get a \ncopy of this. You can go on their Web site, nrdc.org, and find out what \nis happening.\n  I am glad one of the members of my E team is here, Senator Nelson of \nFlorida. I am opening, and when I get to the Superfund, I would like to \nget into a colloquy with him, if he can.\n  Does the Senator have time to stay for about 15 minutes?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Certainly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Let's start from the beginning. The administration took \nover in 2001. One of the first things they did was to hold up proposed \nrules announced by EPA in December of 2000 that were designed to \nminimize raw sewage discharges and to require public notification of \nsewage overflows.\n  There is nothing more ugly than sewage overflows--without going into \nany detail. Why on Earth would they reverse the decision to minimize \nsewage overflows? You will have to ask them. Last year alone, there \nwere some 40,000 discharges of untreated sewage carrying bacteria, \nviruses and, frankly, fecal matter into basements, streams, \nplaygrounds, and waterways across the country. That rule is still \ndelayed today.\n  On March 13, 2001, President Bush broke the promise he made during \nthe campaign and he announced he would not regulate carbon dioxide, the \nchief contributor to global warming. He is not going to go after the \npowerplants. This is where Senator Jeffords is taking this \nadministration on, and I am right by his side, as is the E team.\n  On May 22, the administration suspended the new standard for arsenic \nin drinking water. My friend Senator Nelson and I just went wild on \nthat point. When we took to the floor and shined the light on this \nsubject, they changed their mind and they decided to let the Clinton \nrule go into place: 10 parts per billion. We know the old standard that \nthey seemed to want to have, because they delayed the new standard, \ncauses cancer in 1 in 100 people. So we had to fight very hard on \narsenic. By the way, the fight isn't over because now we are learning \nfrom scientists that 10 is too high, 10 parts per billion; we need to \ngo down to 3. So we have a fight there.\n  On May 3, the administration reversed a 25-year-old Clean Water Act \nrule that restricted the disposal of mining and other industrial solid \nwastes in our waterways. The EPA then issued a new rule, making it \nillegal for coal companies to dump ``fill material,'' which includes \nwaste material from mountaintop mining, into our\n\n[[Page S4429]]\n\nrivers, our streams, our lakes and our wetlands.''\n  I don't know whether the President really listens to the words:\n\n     O beautiful for spacious skies,\n     For amber waves of grain,\n     For purple mountain majesties\n     Above the fruited plain!\n     America! America!\n     God shed his grace on thee.\n\n  He doesn't seem to understand beauty that we have been given by God, \nto be honest. I don't see it. Either that or he has not taken an \ninterest. But, either way, the decisions of this administration--I have \njust shared a few. There are 90 of them. Go up on the NRDC site and get \nthe rest of them--would make you shudder. That is why Senator Daschle \nset up this E team--to take a light and shine it on what is happening.\n  I am going to get to the issue I know Senator Nelson is very upset \nabout, and that is the Superfund. Before I yield to him in a colloquy, \nlet me show, in a chart form, what is actually happening. I want to \nshow how many strip mine sites there are across this great land of \nours. This is the EPA's own Web site, and this is the NPL sites, which \nare the priority sites, the worst sites. You don't see much yellow \nhere. Yellow indicates the places that have no Superfund sites. Purple \nrepresents the ones that have the sites. So we are talking about an \nissue that impacts our entire Nation.\n  The health effects of these sites are very real. What are they? When \nwe say Superfund, it means these are the most toxic sites. When you \nlive near a Superfund site, studies show there are increased birth \ndefects, low birth weights, changes in pulmonary function--that is \nbreathing--neurological damaging--that is the brain--and leukemia.\n  If you live near one of these sites, you have a better chance of \ngetting really sick, and particularly your children because--what have \nwe said here so many times--children are the most vulnerable when it \ncomes to being exposed to toxins and pollution. Why is that? Their \nbodies are changing and growing in the midst of these toxins. And they \nare small, so when they breathe in the air in proportion to their body \nweight, it is much more of an important factor.\n  Now, I often say, children are not little adults. I am a little \nadult. I am stronger. If I lived near one of these sites, I could get \nsick because I am not as strong as a big 155-pound male, which is \nalways the standard on which we measure progress. But little kids, they \nare the ones who get hurt.\n  So there are 1,200 national priority list Superfund sites, NPL sites. \nAnd nearly 70 million Americans, including 4 million children, live \nwithin 4 miles of a Superfund site. Let me reiterate: 70 million \nAmericans live within 4 miles of a Superfund site. And we know if you \nlive near a site, you are at greater risk of getting very ill. We know \n4 million children live near Superfund sites.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I am happy to do so.\n  Mr. REID. One of the things I have been trying to do is tell people \nin Nevada we should not be afraid of Superfund sites. Let me give the \nSenator from California an example.\n\n  In northern Nevada, Sparks, which is a suburb of Reno, there was a \nhuge gravel pit, much larger than the Capitol Building. It was huge.\n  One day, a number of years ago, somebody started seeing black rings \naround this pit. And months and months went by and the State simply was \nill-equipped to handle the many problems involving a Superfund. I \nthought something might be involved.\n  So to make a long story short, the Senator from California and I have \nserved on the Environment and Public Works Committee for a long time, \nand I sent a staff person to look at it.\n  We held a hearing, and within 2 weeks that was declared an emergency \nSuperfund site because millions of gallons of oil had been spilled by \nthe oil companies into the ground. It could have been extremely \ndangerous.\n  Again, I will make this story shorter than it probably should be, but \nthat place now, after having been declared a Superfund site, is one of \nthe most beautiful places in all of northern Nevada. It is called \nSparks Marina. There are boats out in this beautiful area which used to \nbe an ugly gravel pit. Now it is a marina with recreation.\n  They are now going to build some apartments and homes next to it.\n  So I say to my friend from California, I appreciate very much, as \nsomeone from Nevada, that Senators are here this morning talking about \nthe inadequacies and fallacies of this administration relating to the \nenvironment. But I also want to pinpoint what Senators are talking \nabout with regard to Superfund sites because we should be spending more \nmoney on Superfund sites so we can have, across this country, more \nSparks Marinas rather than less Sparks Marinas.\n  So I appreciate very much the Senator from California bringing this \nto the Senate's attention.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I say to the Senator, that is the point. If we can clean \nup these sites, the Senator is so right--the same way with \nbrownfields--they are then safe, productive land, good for the \ncommunity. The reason we are on the floor of the Senate today--and the \nSenator is part of my E team, and he will understand this--this \nwonderful story occurred because the site was cleaned. If the site sat \nthere, people would have been fearful, and should have been fearful. \nAnd that is why I want to get to this next point.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator does, let me make one additional point. \nThat beautiful Sparks Marina was cleaned up without a single penny of \ntaxpayers' money. It was paid for by the polluters who were forced into \ncleaning that up when it was declared a Superfund site because had they \nnot come forward and then been found guilty, they would have been \ncharged three times the actual damages.\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend has now hit on the very two issues that we are \ngoing to talk about in the next few minutes. The first one is the \nimportance of cleaning up the sites and what it means when you do that. \nThe second point is the importance of ``polluter pays'' as a concept \nthat is now being threatened.\n  So what is happening under this administration, I say to my friends, \nis this: This administration is going to cut in half the number of \nsites to be cleaned up. I should not say they are going to; they have \nso stated.\n  So we are going from the Clinton administration, where the last \ncleanups reflected in the year 2000 were 87 sites cleaned up, to now, \nunder this administration, they are talking about cleaning up 47. They \ndid 47 last year. So that means it has already been cut in half. And \nthey want to continue to go down, down, down. So we see here a walking \naway from the Superfund Program.\n\n  I say to my friend from Florida, what is so stunning about this is \nthe only way we found this out was by digging and digging through EPA \ndocuments. We have asked in the Environment Committee--I am the chair \nof the Superfund Subcommittee--for a list of which sites are not going \nto be cleaned up. They first promised to do 75, and they did 47. Then \nthey said they would do 65, and now they have said they are going to do \n40. So they are down, from a high of 88 to 40. We cannot get the list \nof what sites they will not clean up.\n  I have a chart in the Chamber showing NPL sites. We do not know where \nthe sites are. Mr. President, they could be in your State. They could \nbe in Florida. They could be in my State. I have over 100 sites--100 \nsites--in my State, and 40 percent of my people--and that is a big \nnumber; we have 35 million people--live within 5 miles of a Superfund \nsite.\n  So we are all in this together. There is only one State that has no \nsites, and that is North Dakota. Lucky North Dakota. Well, there are \nnot that many people there. But the people who are there do not live \nnear a Superfund site. Every other State has a site in it, and no one \nknows where the sites are because the administration will not tell us. \nBy October, they have to expend the money, and the administration says \nthey don't have the list ready.\n  I believe at some point we are going to have to subpoena this \ninformation because how would you feel, Mr. President, if you were a \nproperty owner, and you anticipated a site near you was going to be \ncleaned, and suddenly you were told it would not be? You would want to \nhave some advance notice so you could protest, so you could call your \nSenator and say to him or her: Fight for me. This isn't right.\n\n[[Page S4430]]\n\n  We have a site in New Jersey where, honestly, the rabbits there have \nturned a horrible color of green because of the Agent Orange on the \nsite, arsenic on the site.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California has 5 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield to my friend some time to ask me some \nquestions. But I will say this: We are in a mess. Half of the sites \nthat we thought were going to be cleaned up will not be cleaned up.\n  The last point is the point on ``polluter pays.'' I have a chart I \nwill show you, and then I will yield.\n  ``Polluter pays'' has been a theory and a practice. Now what the \nadministration is doing--we always had a situation where taxpayer funds \nonly paid for about 18 percent of the cleanup, and 82 percent was paid \nby the responsible parties and other funds.\n  Now, under this administration, in 2003, because there is no \nSuperfund fee in place anymore, 54 percent of the program is going to \nbe paid by taxpayers.\n  So I ask a rhetorical question to this administration: Where have you \nbeen, when we have made a point that polluter pays is basic?\n  I yield to my friend for questions or comments, but I also ask \nunanimous consent for 5 additional minutes on our side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator from California for \nyielding.\n  I would like to talk about 1 of those 1,222 sites around the country, \n51 of which are in my State, 111 in the State of New Jersey, 100 sites \nin the State of California. One of those sites is about 12 miles west \nof Orlando near Lake Apopka at a site called the Old Tower Chemical \nplant which was shut down in 1980 after a plug of witches' brew that \nhad been created in a holding pond as a result of cooking DDT--I am not \nmaking this up; it sounds like a fantasy tale but it is true--after \ncooking this DDT in order to get a chemical byproduct, all of this \nresidue flowed into a holding pond.\n  What they didn't know was that the holding pond was a sink hole that \nallowed that cooked witches' brew to go right into the water supply, \nthe Floridian aquifer and, even with that sink hole, a plug escaped \nover the top of the holding pond and into a creek which flowed into \nLake Apopka.\n  Lake Apopka is a huge lake west of Orlando. It has had quite a few \nenvironmental problems, not the least of which is a lot of agricultural \nrunoff, and so forth. But this Tower Chemical plant was finally shut \ndown by EPA when it found that some of this holding pond brew went into \nLake Apopka.\n  Today Lake Apopka's population of 4,000 alligators is down to 400. \nAnd of those 400, they have found deformities in the alligators. You \nknow how tough an alligator is. This site, the Tower Chemical plant, \nstill sits out there, not treated, not cleaned up, and there are traces \nof these chemicals in the area in the water supply. There are eight \nresidences right in the immediate vicinity. I am trying to get EPA to \ngive filters for the water wells that tap the water supply right next \ndoor to the Tower Chemical plant, just for starters, not to speak of \nthe underlying point.\n  If we don't have a trust fund that is filled with money for that \nprinciple that the ``polluter pays,'' there is not going to be any \nmoney. The money in the trust fund is going to run out next year. So \nhow are we going to clean up the Tower Chemical site that could be \nthreatening a huge water supply for the State of Florida? There is \nsimply no way.\n  As to the Bush administration--I said this in Florida the other day--\nwhat has happened to them? Have they taken leave of their senses; to \nsay that they are not going to fund, through the principle of the \n``polluter pays,'' the trust fund so we can clean up these 51 sites in \nthe State of Florida, the 1,222 sites around the country? If you don't \ndo that, either you don't clean up the sites--and there is just too \nmuch environmental risk--ergo, witness the example I have just given \nyou west of Orlando and the Floridian aquifer being threatened--or if \nyou are going to clean them up, guess who is going to pay. The general \ntaxpayer is going to pay instead of the polluter paying.\n  When we passed this bill in 1980--I was a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, and I voted for it--it was with the understanding that \nthere would be a tradeoff, that the oil companies would trade off their \nliability in future lawsuits by agreeing to the principle of the \npolluter paying, and they and the chemical companies over the years \nwould pay into the trust fund. If we don't keep that same principle, \nthen the oil companies get off scot-free. They don't have any lawsuit \nliabilities now because of their agreement in exchange for paying in to \nhelp us clean up these sites. Are we to let them completely off the \nhook so that they will not pay?\n  I wanted to bring that one case to the attention of the Senator from \nCalifornia as she is talking about the national implications of this. I \nthank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague. We are not talking about theory. We \nare not talking about an academic proposition. We are talking about \nsites with horrible pollutants and toxins in them, close to people, \nthat have to be cleaned up.\n  This is the first time I have taken to the floor on this subject. I \nintend to come back. Other members of the team include Hillary Clinton \nand Ron Wyden and Joe Lieberman, and we think Bob Torricelli may join \nus. This is a big issue to the people of this country. We are all \npulling together on the challenge that was handed to us on 9-11. We \nwill pull together on that.\n  To me, the most important thing is to understand that there is a \nbalance. On domestic issues, when we see this administration going the \nwrong way, repealing laws that reflect values of the American people, \nthe value of a healthy environment, the value of a beautiful \nenvironment, we are going to be here.\n  Today we will with Senator Schumer give out another Toxic Trophy \nAward. Senator Cantwell is also on the E team. I think I have covered \nthen all of the members.\n  I know how strongly we believe in these issues. If we continue to \nshine the light on some of these outrageous proposals, we won't stop \nevery one of them, but we will stop some of them. At a minimum, the \nAmerican people will know what this administration is doing, sometimes \nin the dead of night when they are not watching. We intend to be here \nand call attention to these matters in the hope of winning this battle, \nwhen we consider that there has been a war waged on the environment. We \nwill be here as soldiers in that war. We intend to win it.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Under the previous order, the time until 10 a.m. is under the control \nof the Republican leader or his designee.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/16/senate-section/article/S4430-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4430-S4434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SOIL CONSERVATION\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor to comment on an \narticle that was in the Des Moines Sunday Register April 21 which \nspeaks to the point of conservation of farm land. There is nothing in \nthe article that is not accurate, but I think some things that are not \nincluded leave the impression that farmers of the United States are not \ngood stewards of the soil. The premise of the article, according to the \nheadlines ``Farmers' penalties rarely stick,'' is that under Federal \nlaw farmers must take certain action to conserve soil. If they do not \nconserve the soil and do it according to a plan, then they would be \nfined. And the article here is based on the premise that only a \nGovernment policeman from the U.S. Department of Agriculture is going \nto make the farmers conserve soil and that fines that might be imposed \nare the way of doing that because it says here that farmers' \nconservation fines rarely stick.\n  The bottom line of the article is that farmers are not conserving \nsoil, that\n\n[[Page S4431]]\n\nGovernment regulation is the only thing that is going to make the \nfarmers conserve the soil, and that there is not enough club on the \npart of Government because the fines in too many instances, according \nto the article, are forgiven.\n  As I said, there is nothing inaccurate in that, but I have prepared \nremarks in which I want to give both sides of the story. We do have a \nGovernment requirement for farmers to participate in farm programs they \nmust take appropriate action to conserve soil. There has been \ntremendous progress made in the conservation of soil, and it has come \nnot because of Government fines that might be imposed against farmers \nbut it comes because it is in the farmers' best interests to conserve \nsoil because, quite frankly, the soil is very valuable but in the \nprocess of growing crops you put tremendously expensive chemicals and \nfertilizers on the soil. And when you have soil erosion and that soil \nwashes into the streams, then obviously that investment to produce a \nbountiful crop goes with it. So it is to the farmers' advantage to keep \nthe soil on their land.\n  Over the past year, this body, along with our colleagues in the \nHouse, has engaged in a protracted discussion about the future of \nagriculture in the United States and how to best ensure a safe and \nstable food supply while providing an adequate safety net for farm \nfamilies. The farm bill was passed and signed by the President very \nrecently, which will be the safety net for the next 6 years.\n  Now that we have done that, I would like to take a step back and \naddress a concern that has been raised by many people I represent. For \nthose colleagues who have never had the good fortune to visit my State \nof Iowa, I would like to take a moment to talk about this State. While \nwe in Iowa may not be able to boast about majestic mountains or white \nsands on beaches along the oceans, my State has one natural resource to \nwhich I daresay no other State can compare--our rich, abundant, fertile \ntopsoil. This resource has given birth to a deep-seated agricultural \nheritage in every corner of my state. In fact, each year communities \nacross Iowa take to the streets to celebrate our rich heritage that \ncomes from this rich natural resource, our topsoil.\n  For example, the community of Conrad, IA, celebrates what they call \n``Black Dirt Days.'' Gladbrook celebrates ``Sweet Corn Days,'' and the \nlittle community of Dike celebrates ``Watermelon Days.'' You can go on \nand on with examples of the people of Iowa worshiping our great natural \nresource. And no one in Iowa cares more about this rich heritage and \nour precious natural resources than the farm families who depend on the \nland for their livelihood and their way of life. That is why I was \ndisturbed, as I already indicated to you, when the Des Moines Sunday \nRegister on April 21 accused Iowa farmers of failing to take adequate \nsteps to protect Iowa's soil and water. The article suggested that the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service \nProgram, as well as the Farm Service Agency, both failing to adequately \nenforce Federal conservation rules, often let our farmers off the hook \nwhen conservation violations occur.\n  The article suggests that the only way to achieve real conservation \nin rural America is for the Federal Government to carry a very big \nstick. Even more disconcerting, the article fails to address the \nsignificant conservation achievements that Iowa's farm families have \nalready attained in terms of reducing soil erosion and reducing the use \nof nitrogen fertilizers by using it more efficiently.\n  The Federal Government first significantly increased the prominence \nof conservation as a national priority in the 1985 farm bill. For the \nfirst time, that Food Security Act of 1985 required farmers to \nimplement sound conservation plans on their farms as a condition for \nreceiving Federal farm subsidies.\n  We were not controlling the farmers' land, but we were saying in \neffect, through that bill, if they are going to benefit from the farm \nsafety net, we expect everybody to be good stewards of their soil.\n  More importantly, the 1985 bill also recognized the desire on the \npart of farmers themselves to protect the land on which they live and \nraise their families from abusive farming practices. The bill created \nthe Conservation Reserve Program, sometimes called CRP, which allows \nfarmers to take our countryside's most highly erodible land out of \nproduction.\n  Since the 1985 farm bill, we have expanded the number of \nopportunities for farmers to voluntarily practice soil conservation \nprograms. Today, farmers have a full arsenal of conservation tools at \ntheir disposal, including the Conservation Reserve Program, the \nWetlands Reserve Program, the Emergency Watershed Protection Program, \nand the Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program, to name a few.\n  The response to these programs by farmers and landowners has been \noverwhelming. Today, in Iowa alone, the farmers have enrolled 1.8 \nmillion acres in the Conservation Reserve Program, including 337,000 \nacres in the Continuous Conservation Reserve Program, which allows \nfarmers to remove our country's most environmentally sensitive land \nfrom production. The Continuous Conservation Reserve Program helps \nfarmers make significant conservation improvements on their land, \nincluding riparian buffers, grass waterways, filter strips, and \nwindbreaks.\n  In addition, Iowa farmers are aggressively working to restore our \nNation's wetlands. Today, Iowa farmers have enrolled over 44,000 acres \nin the Wetlands Reserve Program. Wetlands provide a number of \nenvironmental benefits, as I am sure my colleagues understand.\n  These wetland reserves help filter out nitrates that leech into the \nsurface water from nitrogen fertilizers used by farmers to improve \nyields, as well as from naturally occurring nitrogen in Iowa's highly \norganic soil. They filter herbicides that seep into the ground, and \nthey provide valuable habitat for Iowa's wildlife.\n  As you can see, restoration of wetlands is important to all Iowans, \nboth rural and urban. And that is not all.\n  Iowa farmers have enrolled more than 60,000 acres in the Watershed \nProtection Program, and nearly 2,000 acres in the Wildlife Habitat \nIncentive Program. These programs have proven to be very successful.\n  According to the Natural Resources Conservation Service, Iowa farmers \ncut soil erosion in half over the past two decades. We used to lose 10 \ntons per acre in 1982. By 1997, because of these conservation programs, \nwe had cut that loss down to 5.3 tons per acre, and at 5 tons per acre, \nit is renewable.\n  Moreover, according to the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, over \n92 percent of Iowa's public water systems meet Federal drinking water \nstandards.\n\n  However, some critics of Federal conservation programs have asserted \nthat the 1996 farm bill actually weakened conservation efforts. These \ncritics may be interested to learn that throughout the duration of the \n1996 farm bill, over 313,000 acres of conservation buffers have been \nbuilt in the State of Iowa.\n  In addition, over 106,000 acres of wetlands have been created, and \nthere continues to be a waiting list of farmers who are eager to enroll \nfragile cropland in these programs, only kept from doing so because of \nthe amount of money Congress will appropriate for these programs.\n  It is important to keep in mind that sound conservation practices not \nonly improve the environment in rural areas, but they also can play \ninto the farmers' bottom line. Since 1996, Iowa farmers have increased \nthe use of no-till planting. No-till planting leaves the residue from a \nprevious crop on the ground, significantly reducing erosion. By not \ntilling the land, farmers reduce the number of trips across the field \nwith their tractors, saving time, reducing the use of limited fossil \nfuels, and reducing harmful emissions into the air.\n  In addition, technological advancements have improved the farmer's \nability to care for land while improving yields. Today, for example, \nmany farmers have turned away from the old method of applying \nfertilizer at an equal rate throughout the entire field. In fact, \nbecause of global positioning equipment, we can apply variable rates of \nfertilizer in different parts of the field in different quantities to \nsave money, but not to waste fertilizer as well.\n\n[[Page S4432]]\n\n  One concern I have expressed about the 1996 farm bill is that it \nfails to incorporate effective payment limitations that would target \nFederal assistance to family farmers.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has now passed the successor to the 1996 \nfarm bill. This legislation should be the incarnation of our principles \nand our vision for the role we see America's farm families playing in \nthe future.\n  I was pleased that 64 Members of the Senate joined Senator Dorgan and \nme in a bipartisan fashion to ensure Federal payments are targeted to \nsmall and medium-sized family farmers who produce the food and fiber of \nour Nation. Our amendment would have helped curb the overproduction and \ntarget assistance to family farmers who live on the same land they \nfarm. I am disappointed that the agreement reached in conference \nsignificantly weakens our provision.\n  In conclusion, this discussion raises the question of whether Federal \nfarm program policy should require farmers to conserve through strict \nenforcement of Federal regulations or whether the Federal Government \nshould encourage farmers to conserve through voluntary conservation \nprograms. In my State, we have witnessed the numerous benefits of \nvoluntary conservation to improving the quality of life and our \nenvironment.\n  It is in every farmer's best interest to conserve the soil, to \neliminate excessive use of fertilization, and ensure that chemicals are \napplied in an environmentally sensitive manner. After all, the farmers \nlive on the same land they farm. Farm families depend on the land for \ntheir livelihood and their way of life.\n  I have to say again, Iowa's rich topsoil is our most prized resource. \nOur economy and our rural heritage depend on it. We have heard much in \nrecent years about sustaining agriculture. No one cares more about \nsustaining agriculture in America than our family farmers. Our rich \nsoil is rivaled by only one other resource: the hard-working men and \nwomen who, day in and day out, work the land to feed the United States \nand the world.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record two \narticles.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Des Moines Sunday Register, Apr. 21, 2002]\n\n                    Farmers' Penalties Rarely Stick\n\n          (By John McCormick, Jerry Perkins and Perry Beeman)\n\n       In exchange for millions of dollars in federal subsidies, \n     Iowa farmers promise to protect the soil and water.\n       But a Des Moines Sunday Register analysis shows farmers \n     almost never lose their taxpayer subsidies, even when federal \n     officials discover they have violated their conservation \n     pledge.\n       Three percent of the $7.8 million in potential fines \n     farmers faced for soil and water conservation violations were \n     actually levied from 1993 through 2000. After appeals, \n     farmers were allowed to keep the rest--about $7.6 million.\n       ``You have to ask just how serious the enforcement effort \n     is,'' said Kenneth Cook, executive director of the \n     Environmental Working Group, an outspoken critic of U.S. farm \n     policy. ``There is almost no chance that you'll lose a \n     penny.''\n       With Congress poised to approve a new farm bill--\n     legislation that among other things will provide about $46 \n     billion over the next 10 years to supplement commodity prices \n     paid to farmers--few changes are planned for enforcing soil \n     conservation regulations.\n       That's probably best for Iowa farmers and agricultural land \n     owners, who between 1996 and 2001 collected $8.7 billion in \n     subsidy payments, more than any other state.\n       Federal agriculture officials maintain that they are doing \n     the best they can, within the limits of time and personnel, \n     to ensure that farmers do their part to preserve the \n     environment. Looking merely at enforcement, they say, ignores \n     the impact of effective voluntary conservation programs.\n       Though difficult to measure on a large scale, there is \n     little argument that soil erosion has left Iowa with dirty \n     water. There are 157 lakes and sections of river in Iowa on \n     the federal government's list of critically polluted waters, \n     and the state's waterways are known for having some of the \n     world's highest nitrate and phosphorus levels.\n       Soil and fertilizer are Iowa's two biggest waterway \n     pollutants. Much of the pollution comes from the runoff \n     that's gradually washing away the state's greatest asset: its \n     rich topsoil.\n       After promising starts, no-till farming has leveled off, \n     and conservation tillage has declined. Silt and soil erosion \n     also show few signs of slowing.\n       ``Now we're going backward,'' said David Williams, a former \n     soil and water district commissioner in Page County. ``We're \n     seeing more and more black dirt in the fields and they're \n     losing a lot of it, and that's hurting our water quality.''\n       Williams said conservation compliance requirements worked \n     reasonably well until passage of the Freedom To Farm law in \n     1996. He said the law made it more difficult to take away \n     farm payments from those who violated their conservation \n     plans, removing the programs's teeth.\n       There are no national data available on conservation \n     compliance, but environmentalists say enforcement is probably \n     just as lax in other states.\n       ``The problem we have in answering a lot of these questions \n     is that there isn't any real enforcement trace record to base \n     an answer on,'' said Craig Cox, executive director of the \n     Ankeny-based Soil and Water Conservation Society, a national \n     organization.\n       Sen. Tom Harkin, chairman of the Senate Agriculture \n     Committee, has requested a review of the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture's conservation programs by the General Accounting \n     Office, the investigative arm of Congress. He has asked \n     specifically for a look at the enforcement of conservation \n     practices.\n       ``I've been hearing that, quite frankly, we've been \n     backsliding,'' Harkin said late last week, between conference \n     committee meetings on the 2002 farm bill.\n       Harkin has pushed for a new conservation initiative in the \n     Senate version of the farm bill. The proposal would base \n     payments to farmers on their level of soil stewardship, \n     essentially paying more to those who voluntarily agree to \n     work harder on conservation.\n       ``They will actually get paid for doing these things,'' he \n     said. ``I think that's a much better way of approaching it \n     than the hammer kind of approach we've had in the past.''\n\n\n                          roots of the problem\n\n       Tying federal farm payments to sound conservation practices \n     started in the depth of the 1980s farm crisis, when farmers \n     agreed to new requirements pushed by environmentalists as \n     part of a deal to secure a greater financial safety net.\n       In return for taxpayer subsidies, farmers were supposed to \n     protect the land for future generations. That meant taking \n     steps such as planting field borders or leaving corn stubble \n     in a field after harvest. Both techniques can reduce erosion \n     of soil by wind and water.\n       Farmers who work land prone to erosion are required to \n     follow specifically designed federal conservation plans or \n     risk losing their federal subsidies.\n       The loss of federal payments is meant to be a huge club to \n     gain the attention of those few farmers who don't want to \n     protect their land for the long run.\n       The Register's analysis, however, shows that 97 percent of \n     the money Iowa farmers were at risk of losing because of \n     conservation violations was restored through ``good faith'' \n     and other exemptions often granted by county committees. \n     Those committees are largely composed of neighboring farmers.\n       Farmers were given several ways to sidestep penalties under \n     the Freedom To Farm law. For instance, they could point to \n     financial problems that might have kept them from following \n     their conservation plans.\n       Virtually any farmer was given a year to fix problems found \n     by federal inspectors, who say they check about 2 percent of \n     all farmland each year to see whether conservation plans are \n     followed.\n       In addition to the new exemptions, there has been a \n     dramatic decrease in the number of annual inspections since \n     passage of the Freedom To Farm law, according to data \n     provided to the Register by the Iowa office of the Natural \n     Resources Conservation Service, a branch of the USDA.\n       In 1993, the agency checked 2,536 tracts of farmland in \n     Iowa. The number rose to 3,407 in 1997 before dropping \n     sharply to 1,430 by 2001. Officials blame limited budgets and \n     other department responsibilities for the decline.\n       But over the years, farmers haven't been bashful about \n     complaining to members of Congress if their payments were \n     threatened, said Lyle Asell of the Iowa Department of Natural \n     Resources, who also used to work for the conservation service \n     in Iowa.\n       ``If they are going to lose payments, they could lose the \n     farm, and the first thing they do is call their \n     legislators,'' Asell said, adding that he still believes the \n     program has greatly improved soil conservation in Iowa.\n\n\n                         a carrot, not a stick\n\n       Jan Jamrog, a program specialist with the Farm Service \n     Agency in Washington, D.C., said enforcement statistics don't \n     give a complete picture of what's happening to the \n     environment. For example, they fail to take into account \n     farmers who don't bother to apply for subsidy payments \n     because they know they're in violation of conservation rules.\n       Given the massive undertaking of policing America's farms, \n     federal farm officials say they've learned that encouraging \n     voluntary conservation improvements can be more effective \n     than dropping the hammer on violators.\n       ``There was a move away from the time spent on compliance \n     in favor of voluntary programs,'' said Larry Beeler, a \n     conservation worker in the Natural Resources Conservation \n     Service's Des Moines office. ``Conservation compliance is \n     important, but so are the voluntary programs.''\n\n[[Page S4433]]\n\n       Beeler said the move reflects a nationwide trend to \n     encourage greater soil protection through voluntary programs \n     such as the conservation reserve and wetland reserve \n     programs. Such programs reward farmers for taking highly \n     erodible land out of production and for protecting and \n     enhancing wetlands.\n       Beeler said his agency's move toward greater voluntary \n     efforts has not hurt compliance: The proportion of inspected \n     farms found to be in violation in any given year has stayed \n     at 5 percent or less.\n       Many farmers agree that increasing enforcement isn't the \n     answer. They say most producers know it's in their best \n     interest to practice sound conservation.\n       ``If you don't, you're not going to grow anything,'' said \n     Tom Kohn, who farms 3,000 acres near Cushing. ``It will all \n     go down the river. . . . The farmers who haven't taken care \n     of the land aren't in business anymore.''\n       Changes in 1996 that gave local officials broad \n     discretionary powers can help and hurt a farmer, others say.\n       Glenn Marsh, who farms 550 acres near Mapleton, said he's \n     found different conservation rules in neighboring Monona and \n     Woodbury counties.\n       ``It has to be the same all over,'' he said. Marsh called \n     the linking of conservation inspections and farm subsidies \n     ``the biggest joke there ever was.''\n       Other farmers expressed concern about enforcement.\n       ``I've had some bad experiences with local, state and \n     national farm officials,'' said Mort Zenor, who farms 900 \n     acres in Woodbury County. ``They've got cold ears.''\n       Zenor, who received more than $225,000 in federal farm \n     subsidy payments from 1996 through 2001, lost $17,000 in the \n     mid-1990s for tilling 40 to 50 acres that conservation \n     officials had designated as no-till.\n       ``I didn't have a no-till planter, and we couldn't afford \n     to buy a new one,'' he said.\n       Zenor tried to fight the fine. He hired a lawyer and \n     appealed his case to a county committee, as well as district \n     and state offices, but the fine was upheld.\n       ``It's worse than an income-tax audit,'' he said. ``They're \n     right and you're wrong.''\n       Woodbury County led Iowa for violations of approved \n     conservation plans from 1993 through 2001, according to \n     federal data. Sixty-four tracts of land were discovered to be \n     in violation during those years.\n       Aster Boozer, a conservation worker for the Natural \n     Resources Conservation Service, said western Iowa's Loess \n     Hills make combining farming and conservation in the area \n     more challenging.\n       ``They are steep and highly erodible,'' he said of the \n     hills. ``It means our conservation plans are very complex.''\n       Jamrog, the program specialist with the Farm Service Agency \n     in Washington, said many violations are accidental.\n       ``FSA's goal is to not penalize producers, if they are \n     willing to get themselves into compliance,'' he said.\n\n\n                            progress is slow\n\n       Even critics of the 1996 changes acknowledge that the \n     evidence that programs aren't working is largely anecdotal.\n       Measuring erosion is expensive and extremely technical. The \n     Natural Resources Conservation Service tries to measure \n     erosion every five years. Its last survey came in 1997, just \n     a year after the farm bill changes cited by \n     environmentalists. Results of the 2002 survey may not be \n     available until 2003 or 2004.\n       Jeff Vonk, director of the Iowa Department of Natural \n     Resources and a former top Iowa official for the Natural \n     Resources Conservation Service, said that when he talks to \n     Iowa's local soil and water commissioners, he receives \n     conflicting signals.\n       ``In some counties, they reflect some frustration on their \n     perception of a lack of enforcement,'' Vonk said. ``In other \n     counties, they say enforcement is maintained.''\n       As Vonk drives around Iowa, he can see the good and the \n     bad. Some of the conservation programs begun in the mid-1980s \n     have made a huge difference in soil conservation, but Vonk \n     still sees muddy waters, fish kills and oxygen-robbing algae \n     blooms created by fertilizer runoff.\n       Others suggest that changes should have been made in the \n     farm bill currently under discussion to address conservation \n     compliance enforcement.\n       ``There seems to have been in this farm bill absolutely no \n     interest in compliance provisions as a way to achieve better \n     environmental progress,'' said Cox of the Soil and Water \n     Conservation Society.\n       The answers will undoubtedly come too late for the 2002 \n     farm bill, but Harkin is asking many of the questions that \n     would have to be answered before significant changes can \n     happen. His request to the General Accounting Office asks how \n     the USDA monitors producers' use of conservation plans, how \n     many exemptions are granted, and what the USDA does to \n     ``ensure that violations are consistently identified.''\n       While he sees problems in the system, Cox and others say \n     Iowa farmers have made great improvements in soil \n     conservation since the policy was initiated in 1985.\n       ``We're making progress, although it might be a little bit \n     slower for some,'' said Art Ralston, a soil and water \n     district commissioner in Woodbury County for more than a \n     decade. ``We just have to keep plugging away.''\n\n\n                      erosion: waiting for answers\n\n       The Natural Resources Conservation Service does an estimate \n     every five years of total erosion on cropland and \n     Conservation Reserve Program land. Environmentalists and farm \n     officials are eagerly awaiting the 2002 results, due sometime \n     in 2003 or 2004, because they might show whether total \n     erosion has been affected by the changes in the 1996 farm \n     bill.\n\n                          [In billions of tons]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                 Sheet and\n               Year                    Wind         rill        Total\n                                     erosion      erosion*     erosion\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1982.............................         1.38         1.69         3.07\n1987.............................         1.40         1.52         2.92\n1992.............................          .95         1.21         2.16\n1997.............................          .84         1.06         1.90\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n*Sheet and rill erosion is removal of soil by water runoff that is a\n  fairly uniform, usually imperceptible thin layer of soil.\n \nSource: Natural Resources Conservation Service.\n\n                    computer problems plague agency\n\n       Part of the problem in evaluating whether farm subsidiaries \n     are restored too easily for conservation violations lies with \n     the federal computer system.\n       Flaws: The federal employees charged with monitoring \n     conservation programs have yet to create a comprehensive \n     record-keeping system. That means they can't determine what \n     farmers on even what counties have lost the most money due to \n     violations. It also means federal officials can't say whether \n     the proportion of money returned to Iowa farmers found to be \n     in violation of conservation rules is greater or lower than \n     in other states.\n       Changes: ``We're in the process of developing a database \n     that will allow us to do comparison statistics,'' said Jan \n     Jamrog, a program specialist with the Farm Service Agency in \n     Washington, D.C. ``I really don't know if that is similar to \n     other states.''\n\n\n                            signs of trouble\n\n       It's hard to measure the impact of the 1996 changes in the \n     farm bill.

USDA officials, \n     in turn, complained they didn't have the staff or the time to \n     monitor farm practices so closely.\n       And in small, tightly knit farming communities, many \n     federal employees who ultimately were responsible for \n     carrying out the new approach were not comfortable with \n     policing their neighbors.\n       ``Nobody wants to stick it to somebody who is demonstrating \n     good faith,'' said Dan Towery, natural resources specialist \n     with the Conservation Technology Information Center in West \n     Lafayette, Ind.\n       Towery is a former farm official in Illinois who had to \n     investigate compliance cases there. ``Determining what is \n     `good faith' is very subjective,'' he said.\n       No definitive studies have been done to determine whether \n     erosion has increased significantly since 1997. The Natural \n     Resources Conservation Service looks at that issue every five \n     years, and its next study is scheduled for 2002.\n       However, survey work by Steven Kraft, chairman of the \n     Department of Agribusiness Economics at Southern Illinois \n     University in Carbondale, suggests farmers don't feel as \n     threatened by the concept of linking conservation practices \n     to subsidy payments.\n       Kraft, working with other researchers, surveyed farmers' \n     attitudes about conservation between 1992 and 1996. the study \n     looked at farmers in 100 different counties throughout the \n     Midwest.\n       Producers were asked, for example, how fair they thought \n     federal officials would be in implementing rules linking \n     conservation to subsidies. In the fall of 1992, almost 29 \n     percent said ``very fair.'' By the winter of 1996, the number \n     had increased to nearly 38 percent.\n\n\n                          how the system works\n\n       Two branches of the U.S. Department of Agriculture play \n     roles in enforcing conservation requirements:\n       NRCS: The Natural Resources Conservation Service helps \n     farmers develop conservation plans for their farms. Then it \n     polices their efforts to follow the plans.\n       FSA: If the conservation service finds that a farmer has \n     violated a plan, it reports that to the USDA's Farm Service \n     Agency, which can withhold a farmer's government subsidies.\n       Appeals: A farmer can appeal the penalty to Farm Service \n     Agency county committees, which are composed of farmers \n     elected by other farmers in the county. Adverse \n     determinations by the county committee can be appealed to the \n     state FSA committee and then to the national appeals division \n     of the Farm Service Agency in Washington, D.C.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

Under the previous order, there will now be 90 \nminutes of debate on Gregg amendment No. 3427.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as we go through the details of this \ndebate, I think it would be well for us to take a moment at the \nbeginning to look at the overall situation we face and try to put this \ndebate into some kind of context.\n  A fundamental principle that we need to remember in all of these \nconversations and discussions is this: All money comes from the \neconomy. It does not come from the budget. It does not come from the \nactions of the Congress. It comes from the economy. If there were no \nunderlying economy, there would be no money for the Federal Government \nto allocate. We have seen governments around the world that have tried \nto create money with no economy by passing budgets, and we have seen \nthe disaster that occurs.\n  So the fundamental principle that we need to address, to begin with, \nis what are we doing that will help the economy grow? What are we doing \nwith trade promotion that will make the American economy stronger? If \nwe can always keep that in mind as we address these various amendments, \nwe will not do harm to our Government or what it is we are trying to \naccomplish for our citizens.\n  The next principle that follows from that one is this: The most \nsignificant thing we can do to help the economy grow is to increase \nproductivity--increase productivity of capital, of labor, of our money, \nthat it is invested in the right places, so that we do not do things \nthat will cause the economy to be less productive than it would be \notherwise.\n  These are two very strong fundamentals. We must keep the economy \nstrong and growing. The way to keep the economy strong and growing is \nto increase productivity. That brings us to the Gregg amendment.\n  The Gregg amendment would strike out a wage subsidy program that is \ncurrently in the bill that is clearly antiproductive. That is, the bill \nas it currently stands, would decrease American worker productivity in \nways that we have already seen historically demonstrated in other \ncountries. We can go, particularly, to the European countries and \ndiscover that they have problems with productivity, and they have \nproblems with new job creation. One of the reasons they have problems \nis that they have structurally built into their economy a subsidy for \nnonproductive worker activity. It sounds very benign--indeed \nbeneficial--to say to a worker: well, you have lost your job and \ntherefore we will tide you over to another situation until you can get \nback on your feet. We have unemployment compensation for that. We have \nother safety net provisions.\n  But the Europeans, by and large, have adopted the notion that we not \nonly tide you over, we make you whole and keep you in your present \nincome circumstance regardless of our employment circumstance. I had \nthis brought home very dramatically when the company that I ran came \ninto difficulties and lost some clients and had to face laying off some \npeople--ultimately including me. One of my employees, who was in our \nEuropean subsidiary, said this with a complete straight face, not \nunderstanding how America works: How many months do we get from the \nGovernment in terms of maintaining our present salaries when this \ncompany fails?\n  I said: None.\n  He said: In the country where I am working, they get a year and a \nhalf to 2 years of continuation at present salary.\n  I said: Sorry, you are working for an American company--and he had \ncome back here from Europe--and you are here in America. You have to \nfind another job.\n  He did. He not only found another job, he found a better job than the \none he had with me. I had to find another job as my company failed. I \ndid.\n  If we had been under the circumstances of the language that is in \nthis bill, we could have said to ourselves that we did not have any \npressure to find another job; we could be subsidized where we were. We \ndid not need to move forward. We could go just\n\n[[Page S4435]]\n\nas things were, and the economy, as a whole, magnified from this \nexample, would become less productive.\n\n  Putting it into context again, looking at it as a general principle, \nhere are the principles: If the economy is not strong, we will not have \nany money to allocate. If the economy is not seeing increased \nproductivity every year, it will not remain strong, and we can look at \nour European friends and say, if we do what they have done, in the name \nof compassion for our workers, we will end up hurting our workers, our \neconomy, and our Government.\n  Sometimes it takes the spur of a little bit of pressure to keep \nAmericans going. But our historic pattern has been that the strong \neconomy helps not only the people at the top but, foremost, it helps \nthe people at the bottom. Keeping them in a temporary position of \nstability ultimately produces long-term detriment to the economy and to \nthe individuals themselves. For that reason, I support the Gregg \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to oppose the amendment \noffered by Mr. Gregg.\n  Let me say, first of all, that this bill represents a very balanced \ncompromise between Democrats and Republicans. I have worked hard to \ndefeat some amendments that I view as killer amendments, I am \ndisappointed that this amendment--which I also view as a killer \namendment--has even been offered. This amendment would strike an \nimportant provision in the TAA bill--wage insurance. Wage insurance, as \nmany now know, gives an incentive to displaced workers to find \nemployment more quickly. It does this by cushioning them against income \nlosses they might experience after losing a job and starting again in a \nnew field. Now, there have been some misstatements about when wages \ninsurance was added to this bill. I have heard some Members suggest \nthat this was added after the markup. That is simply not true.\n  Wage insurance was included in the original bill introduced by myself \nand Senators Bingaman and Daschle last July. And it was open to debate \nat the Finance Committee markup last December. As a part of a \ncompromise with Senators Grassley and Gramm, we have all agreed to make \nthis program a pilot program to see if it works. If it does, I suspect \nwe many want to broaden the program. If it does not, I expect that \nCongress will end this program. But it is hard to argue against, at a \nminimum, giving this widely-supported program a chance. So how does it \nwork?\n  We have drafted this as a pilot program for older workers. Due to \ntheir long tenure in a single job or industry, older workers tend to be \nthe hardest TAA participants to reemploy and the most likely to \nexperience significant earnings losses in a new job. So, under our \nbill, any worker who is at least 50 years old and certified eligible \nfor TAA can choose to participate in the wage insurance program.\n  To qualify for wage insurance, a worker must take a new job that pays \nless than the old one within the first 26 weeks of regular unemployment \ninsurance. By opting for wage insurance, a worker agrees to forego the \n18 months of additional income support the could get under traditional \nTAA. Wage insurance lasts 2 years and is capped at $5,000 per year. A \nworker would not be eligible for wage insurance if he made over $50,000 \nper year. Now, why should we try a wage insurance program as part of \nTAA?\n  First, I would note that this is an issue that has been championed by \nBoth Republican and Democratic leaders, and by academics. A number of \nRepublicans, including Secretary Rumsfeld and Ambassador Zoellick--as \nmembers of the Trade Deficit Review Commission--and former USTR Carla \nHills, have supported wage insurance. Alan Greenspan has also expressed \nsupport for such a program. These prominent individuals support wage \ninsurance because it uses market incentives to shorten the period of \nunemployment.\n  Second, this is an innovative way to get hard-to-employ people back \nto work faster. The idea behind wage insurance is that a worker will be \nmore willing to take a lower paying job--and get back into the \nworkforce sooner--if someone is making up part of the difference \nbetween the old and new wage. After a year or two of experience on the \njob, wages tend to rise, reducing the long-term wage losses.\n  Third, this program actually saves money. During the 26 weeks a \nworker receives unemployment insurance, they can choose traditional TAA \nbenefits or they can get a job and opt for wage insurance. The choice \nis up to the worker, but on average providing wage insurance will cost \nless than providing traditional TAA benefits. By getting people back \ninto the workforce sooner, wage insurance will reduce unemployment \nrolls, reduce traditional TAA participation, and reduce overall costs \nto the government. Basically, if a worker certified for TAA takes a job \nbefore the end of his 26-week unemployment insurance period, the money \nthat would have gone to fund income support starting in week 27 is \ninstead used to pay the wage insurance. The difference is that the \ntotal amount of wage insurance a worker could receive is much less than \nthe cost of traditional TAA benefits. One year of TAA income support at \nan average of $250 per week is $13,000, while wage insurance is capped \nat $5,000 per year. There are additional savings because the government \nwill also not be paying for training.\n\n  Fourth, on-the-job training works. Studies show that on-the-job \ntraining is better for both employers and employees. Wage insurance \ngives workers the incentive to take entry level jobs and train on the \njob and it gives employers more control over the kind of training that \nemployees receive.\n  I would also like to respond to some of the criticisms raised last \nnight about the wage insurance program. First, critics have suggested \nthat wage insurance will give people an incentive to lower their \nproductivity, that wage insurance will persuade workers to turn down \ngood-paying jobs that use their skills in favor of underpaid dream jobs \nlike a fly-fishing instructor or a Disneyland worker. That seems pretty \nfar-fetched to me. Workers in their 50s have kids in college, \nretirement nest-eggs to build, and mortgages to pay off. Research shows \nthat older workers are the most likely to have obsolete job skills that \ndo not lead to well-paying jobs they need to meet these obligations. I \nexpect that these workers will take the best job they can get.\n  We have an example in my own state of Montana. Last year the Asarco \nlead smelter closed in East Helena. Most of the workers have been with \nthe plant many years and are in their late 40s or older. There are no \nmore lead smelting jobs in the U.S. where they could match their wages \nand use their skills. Most ended up starting again in jobs that paid \nmuch less--if they could find jobs at all. This wage insurance program \ncould have helped many of them get back on their feet faster. In any \nevent, I would emphasize that this is a pilot. If it turns out that \ncritics are right and wage insurance leads to a glut of fly fishing \ninstructors, the program can be ended after the 2-year trial. But I \ndon't think that is what we will see.\n  The second criticism made of wage insurance is that it is \ninconsistent with the purpose of TAA, which is to provide retraining. \nNothing could be further from the truth. The purpose of TAA is not \ntraining for its own sake. The purpose of TAA is to get trade-impacted \nworkers back to work as quickly as possible by helping them get new \nskills. Wage insurance serves that goal, because it encourages on-the-\njob training. And on-the-job training is the best way to learn new job \nskills.\n  Finally, we have heard that this wage insurance program is a form of \nage discrimination. Giving older workers first crack at an alternative \nto traditional TAA is not age discrimination. But if this is truly a \nserious concern, I would be happy to amend this provision, and expand \nwage insurance to workers of all ages.\n  Mr. President, in concluding, let me say that there have been several \nMembers who have criticized TAA in the last several days. They suggest \nit does not work. Yet they reject new bipartisan ideas--like wage \ninsurance--that are offered as alternatives to TAA. I don't understand \nthat. This amendment puts at grave risk the bipartisan compromise that \nhas been struck in this bill. I oppose the amendment and I hope my \ncolleagues will work hard to defeat it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n\n[[Page S4436]]\n\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, in a few moments I believe there are other \nMembers coming over to speak, but let me outline once again some of the \nproblems of this language. Remember, the way this is structured is that \nif one loses their job as a result of trade activity, they can take \nanother job that pays less, and then the taxpayers pay them $5,000 a \nyear for taking a job that pays less if they are over 50 years of age. \nThere is no training requirement language.\n  There is no requirement that if there is a similar suitable job that \npays the same, you take that. Say you lost your job at a manufacturing \nindustry which was trade affected, and there was another job down the \nstreet in the manufacturing industry, in the same business, but that \ncompany had been able to compete effectively. You can take a job there \nat the same amount. There is no requirement you must take that; you can \nwork for your cousin, brother, anyone, take a less paying job, and get \npaid $5,000 from the taxpayer to do that.\n  There is no requirement to remain in the community. A key in the \ntrade adjustment language is that workers remain in the community. The \nconcept was to revitalize the community through the trade adjustment \nlanguage. There is no requirement to do that. I can see a lot of people \nlosing their jobs--hopefully not a lot--in the Northeast or the Chicago \narea or the northern part of the country. Say they are 50 years old. \nThey will say: Hey, I'm out of here; I'm going south where it is warm. \nI will get a job being an assistant golf pro, which is what I always \nwanted to do, and I will get $5,000 from the taxpayers to do that. \nThere is no requirement to remain in the community.\n  There is no requirement for economic damage. In other words, there is \nno requirement that you need the money. There is a $50,000 payment \nlevel, but if you have a lot of assets or your spouse happens to have a \nhigh income, you still can benefit from this program.\n  There is no arm's length requirement. I can see a situation where an \nagreement may have been reached in the small business just having tough \ntimes. They close the store and open across the street, and they get a \n$5,000 subsidy. Maybe it is just a family situation and you work the \nsystem so you can go to work for your son who is running a construction \nbusiness. The chances to manipulate the system because there is $5,000 \nof taxpayer money pouring in to support you are very significant.\n  There are a lot of structural problems as well as philosophical \nproblems that we as a society are going to begin to pay people to be \nless productive. That is a concept which goes against American \nentrepreneurship.\n  I would like to yield to the Senator from Missouri, but I believe we \nare going back and forth.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Senator Grassley and I have to go to a Finance Committee \nmeeting in 8 minutes. I would like Senator Grassley to have the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Obviously, the Senator is the leader on the floor, and we \ncertainly recognize that right.\n  I reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The Senator from Montana has laid out very clearly why this amendment \nmust be defeated. This is a carefully crafted compromise. The year 2002 \nis not like previous years in the Senate when we have devoted a lot of \nbipartisanship to trade agreements. There is bipartisanship, but it is \nnot as certain that we will pass a bill as in the previous 25 years \nwhen similar legislation passed.\n  I emphasize what Senator Baucus said: This is a carefully worked out \nagreement. It may not be entirely to the liking of Senator Baucus or \nperhaps not entirely to my liking, but we have to stick together to get \nthis legislation passed. It is probably one of the most important \npieces of legislation to be considered in the Senate.\n  Although the Senator from New Hampshire has some valid arguments, I \ncannot support an amendment that upsets the balance of the package by \nstriking these wage insurance provisions. There are things in the \npackage that Members on each side may not like. It is their prerogative \nto amend whatever they see necessary. I cannot support stripping out \nthis section of the package.\n  Another reason is, wage insurance provisions in the legislation have \nnot been tested, as some would say. Somewhere along the line, new ideas \nbecome law. Just because this is a new idea does not mean it is a bad \nidea.\n  I will read what Ambassador Carla Hills, former U.S. Trade \nRepresentative for President George Bush, said last year, a long time \nafter she left her position as Trade Representative, when she appeared \nbefore the Senate Finance Committee:\n\n       We should explore the concept of wage insurance to \n     supplement the incomes of displaced workers--whatever the \n     cause--who take an entry-level job in a different, more \n     promising sector at lower pay. This would respond to workers' \n     anxiety over near-term wage loss, encourage them to stay \n     productive in the work force and obtain the training that has \n     proved most effective--which is training on the job.\n\n  Carla Hills went on to say in a report called ``Getting Over the Fear \nof Free Trade'':\n\n       The key goal of all of these ideas, as unconventional as \n     they may seem at first, especially to the U.S. business \n     community or the Republican Party, is straightforward. It is \n     to educate and motivate more Americans to stand up in defense \n     of open markets lest we lose the benefits that come from the \n     free flow of ideas, capital, and goods.\n\n  We should listen to Ambassador Hills. I believe American anxiety \nabout globalization stems in part from job instability. Wage insurance \neases those fears.\n  As we consider voting on this amendment, I ask Members on my side of \nthe aisle to keep their eye on the ball. The ball happens to be trade \npromotion authority, a contract between the Congress of the United \nStates and the President of the United States, negotiated for 270 \nmillion Americans, a better world, a world that creates job \nopportunities. Trade creates jobs.\n  As President Kennedy said, trade, not aid, when it comes to helping \nthe rest of the world. The United States has full responsibility to \nlook out for our interests, the interests of the American people, but \nalso to be a leader in the world. Being a leader in the world involves \nour participation in not only the economic concerns of the world but \nmaintaining the peace. One of the tools of maintaining peace is \neconomic opportunity. The cooperation comes to the world because of \npeople trading. We often brag about political leaders and diplomats \ndoing so much for world peace. We obviously create an environment for \nworld peace, but there is nothing that works more for world peace than \nopportunities for individuals to interact with other individuals around \nthe world in a commercial way. That does more to break down barriers \nand establish world peace than anything else.\n  Trade promotion authority is one of the three or four parts of this \nlegislation. That is the 800-pound gorilla at which we ought to all be \npaying attention. It takes a carefully crafted compromise to get to \nthat point. Some of the items in the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act \nthat people on my side of the aisle might not like--and wage insurance \ncould be one--are very small compared to the ball that I am asking \nMembers to keep their eye on--trade promotion authority.\n  As the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board said regarding trade \npromotion authority and freeing up trade around the world, as a result \nof the agreements we last endorsed in this body, the North American \nFree Trade Agreement, 1993, the Uruguay Round of Tariffs and Trades, \n1994, those have helped reduce costs to the American consumer by $4,000 \nfor a family of four.\n  That is equal to more than we have given in tax cuts in recent years \nto American families. Think of the good that comes to the economy \nbecause we have an opportunity to export and our consumers have an \nopportunity to import. We have an opportunity to reduce costs because \nof increased efficiency. That is all going to come in the future, as it \nhas in the past, 50-some years under the GATT arrangements, because we \nare going to give our President trade promotion authority.\n  That is what we want our eye kept on. This compromise on trade \nadjustment assistance is part of that compromise.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will say this quickly and then I will \nyield to the\n\n[[Page S4437]]\n\nSenator from Missouri and then to the Senator from Tennessee, but I \nrarely disagree with the Senator from Iowa. I consider him to be one of \nthe best Senators in the Senate. He is certainly a thoughtful and \neffective Member of the Senate and a strong leader, especially for free \ntrade. I certainly support his commitment to the trade promotion \nauthority, but the price of that trade promotion authority should not \nbe the creation of a brandnew entitlement which has explosive potential \nand is regrettably not a new idea. In fact, it is a very old idea. It \nis a European industrial socialist policy idea which has failed in \nEurope, failed in the old countries. We should not bring it to the new \ncountry.\n  I yield to the Senator from Missouri 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New Hampshire. I say \nto my good friend from Iowa, I know he is a devoted, committed advocate \nof free trade. Coming from agricultural States such as his and mine, we \nknow our farmers absolutely depend upon access to the world market to \nmake sure they gain their return from the marketplace rather than from \nthe mailbox. When we see trade decline, we see agricultural prices drop \nto terribly low levels.\n  I think the problems we have in agriculture are largely attributable \nto the collapse in Southeast Asia. We are only going to get the markets \nback and our income back and the costs of the farm bill down when we \nopen up more trade agreements and see healthy trade with our partners \nthroughout the world.\n  Having said that, I come to the floor as a very strong proponent of \nfree trade. It is not just good for farmers; it is good for the people \nwho work in the industries. The exporting industries pay 13 percent to \n15 percent more than the nonexporting industries.\n  Our service sector is a leader in the world in exporting services of \nall kinds, and we benefit from that. When I go out to shop every day at \nhome in Mexico, MO, or St. Louis or Kansas City, I have better priced \ngoods and better quality goods because there is competition. I buy \nAmerican-made goods every chance I can if they are available. But I \nknow I am getting the best price and I am getting the best quality \nbecause they have to compete. So every one of us, as a consumer, \nbenefits from the competition through increased choice and lower \nprices. That is why I think trade promotion is so important.\n  That is why I am so disappointed today to see the trade promotion \nbill has been hijacked. This is no longer a trade promotion bill; it is \na welfare entitlement bill which talks about trade promotion, gives the \nPresident some authority, and then takes it away.\n  We failed to table the Dayton-Craig amendment. There were strong \narguments made for that amendment: We can't give up our sovereignty.\n  Let me tell you what it does. It essentially says to any country that \nis even thinking about negotiating a deal with the President or his \nTrade Representative: Forget about it. Forget about it because whatever \nyou negotiate with the President, the Congress can take it away when \nthey come back. That essentially kills the authority of the President \nto negotiate a trade agreement, authority that previous Presidents have \nhad in recent years as we made progress toward getting free trade.\n  I wish we would take the Andean Trade Promotion Act out of this bill. \nEverybody knows we need it. Today is the day one deadline occurs. We \nneed to reassure our partners in the Andean region that we want free \ntrade with them, to maintain it and not to see the tariffs come back. \nWe ought to pass that and send this turkey back to get some wings and \nfeathers on it so it will fly because this will not fly.\n  One of the amendments we have before us by the Senator from New \nHampshire is just one step we ought to take to clean it up. As the \nSenator from New Hampshire has so eloquently stated, this is a brandnew \nsubsidy without checks and balances. It does not guarantee that people \nwill get the benefits and the economic opportunities that we should \nseek. There is no limitation based on necessity. The subsidy would go \nto an older worker who simply chooses to quit the rat race.\n  As the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out, you can get a wage \nsubsidy for doing what you want--a former office worker could join her \ndaughter's catering firm or a factory worker who treats a trade-related \nplant closing as an opportunity not to take an equal job in the \ncommunity but to take early retirement, move to Florida, and maybe \nserve as a greeter at Wal-Mart or a groundskeeper at a golf course so \nhe could have a couple of rounds of golf in and have a little wage \nsubsidy.\n  I have nothing against that. I know some of my colleagues like to \nplay golf, but I would sure hate paying them for their privilege of \nplaying golf. My colleagues in this body who are good golfers do so on \ntheir own time, after they put in the 60-hour workweek, so it does not \nhold for them. But to encourage people without limit to do what they \nwish and take a subsidy along with the other entitlement programs is a \nbad precedent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair and thank my colleague from New \nHampshire. There are many other good arguments. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Senator from New Hampshire and help us go back to the job \nof cleaning this bill up to make it a trade promotion rather than an \nentitlement promotion bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Missouri for his excellent \nthoughts, and I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment of \nSenator Gregg. I think the debate on trade promotion authority is a \nclassic example of something that used to be nonpartisan, as I \nunderstand it, and that is trade--as was the consensus I thought we \ndeveloped that I believed was a good thing for our country. It is also \nan example of how often nowadays it seems we are asked to do some bad \nthings in order to do something that is any good.\n  We are urged to keep our eyes on the ball, which is trade promotion \nauthority, they say. I hope we all agree that free trade is good, that \ntrade promotion authority is good. I think standing by itself it would \npass overwhelmingly. But I am beginning to wonder what the ball is.\n  If, in fact, we are taking the first steps toward the Federal \nGovernment sending somebody a check for their insurance coverage, if we \nare taking the first step toward the Federal Government providing a \nwage differential for this group, that group, and then the next group--\nto me that is the ball. As important as trade promotion authority is, I \nam not sure I am willing to do that evil in order to do the other good.\n  If the idea is to load down something that is so clearly beneficial \nto this economy and this country such as trade promotion authority, the \nAndean trade agreement, with so many things that are so onerous that it \nis going to defeat the underlying bill--if that is the purpose, I think \nthose who seek to carry that out are very close to accomplishing their \ngoal.\n  It would be a pity, it would be a bad thing for this country, but I \nam afraid that is what we are looking at. Trade promotion authority and \nthe Andean trade agreement are being held as hostages for a series of \nnew entitlement programs, which really have nothing to do with trade \nbut have everything to do with a social agenda which, as the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire pointed out, has failed in other parts of the world. \nWhile they are scrambling to try to be more like us, we are scrambling \nto try to be more like them, it seems.\n\n  If there is anything we ought to agree to in this body, it is the \nimportance of trade promotion authority and the Andean trade agreement, \nat a time when our friends to the south of us, the Colombian \nGovernment, are about to be taken over by narcotraffickers, if they \nhave their way, and have the first narcogovernment in our hemisphere \ninstead of the democracy that is there now. Is anything more important \nthan stopping that? I don't know.\n  We have a relationship with the Government of Ecuador where we have a \nforward operation location to assist us in drug eradication. Fighting \ndrugs, terrorism, there is nothing more important than that. And \neveryone knows we need to have a trading relationship with these folks \nwho are trying to do the right thing, trying to impose the rule of law \nand other beneficial things that we stand for in their countries,\n\n[[Page S4438]]\n\nand yet that is being held hostage to these new entitlement programs.\n  The amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire, of course, has to do \nwith one of the more onerous ones, which is an open invitation to \noutright fraud and abuse. Every year we come up with new assessments of \nhow many billions of dollars we pay out to people who are dead or who \nare defrauding the Government or whatnot. This is an open invitation to \ndo that. It is a program that would make the European leftists blush, \nand yet we are trying to move in that direction. But it is only one \npart of the onerous provisions that have loaded up this trade promotion \nauthority bill.\n  So in order to do something good for our country, good for consumers, \ngood for folks in Tennessee, who go to the store and want to buy goods \na little bit cheaper--in order for us to do that, we are being asked to \nsign off on a bill that would triple the cost of trade adjustment \nassistance. We all agree that we need some trade adjustment assistance, \nbut now we are being asked, in a time of deficit, in a time of war, to \ntriple this program for this 2 percent of workers.\n  For this constituent group, in this election year, we are being asked \nto do that, to give this group of people--this small group of people--\nan additional 6 months of unemployment compensation. The average guy \nwho gets laid off gets 6 months. So now this 2 percent would get up to \n2 years. So this group goes from 6 months to 2 years, and it expands \nthe number of reasons they do not have to undergo any additional \ntraining.\n  Trade assistance was originally designed as a training program to \nhelp people get a new job. This bill has over a half dozen exceptions \nwhere people do not even have to take training, including a provision \nthat says you do not have to take training if there is another \ncomparable job. If there is another comparable job, why do you need \ntrade assistance anyway?\n  This bill would expand coverage to secondary workers, double or \ntriple the number of people eligible. It creates a new program to pay \nfarmers when commodity prices are below 80 percent of the previous 5-\nyear average and imports contribute in part to the decline in price.\n  We just passed $190 billion in entitlement spending for farmers in \nthe farm bill. This, in large part, duplicates that. There is a new \nprogram, a new bureaucracy in the office of the Department of Commerce. \nThis program duplicates existing programs that provide assistance for \ncommunities. And it is a new bureaucracy in the process.\n\n  All of this is at a cost of who knows what. Estimates have been all \nover the lot, but they are all based on assumptions that people would \nparticipate in this new program at the same level as they participated \nin the old program. This is a much more generous program. It stands to \nreason a much higher percentage of people are going to participate in \nit.\n  So you are probably looking at $1 billion, or between $1 billion and \n$2 billion a year for a 10-year period, something like that, for \nsomething that could never pass on its own, something that no one would \nhave the temerity to put in a piece of legislation. It is only because \nyou are trying to hold free trade hostage, the Andean trade agreement \nhostage to this new group of entitlement programs.\n  If this new wage guarantee provision, for example, really works out \nthe way we are talking about--that it is open and rife with waste, \nfraud, and abuse--what are the chances of this new entitlement program \nbeing canceled? Zero. It never happens. It never will happen. What are \nthe chances of it being expanded? Pretty good. It is up to $5,000 now \nfor the wage differential. What are the chances of that coming in and \ngetting more and more generous?\n  Look at where trade adjustment assistance has gone from when it was \nfirst passed to what is being proposed today. No one ever dreamed, when \ntrade adjustment assistance was first passed, that somebody would be \nproposing that we would do things in terms of 70 percent of their COBRA \nor wage differential, or all these other things that are being \nproposed. The same thing will happen with this new list of \nentitlements.\n  So I strongly urge adoption of the Gregg amendment. It would make a \nbad bill a little better. There are many of us who are tussling and \ngrappling with something--and that I think all of America should be \ngrappling with--and that is the balancing off of something so important \nas giving the President authority to get into the 21st century a little \nbit, and become a leader in this country, as we are supposed to be, in \nfree trade, put our money where our mouth is, giving him trade \npromotion authority that our Presidents have had up until President \nClinton, and get on with it.\n  If we cannot compete in this world economy with all the advantages we \nhave, I will be very surprised. We should not be afraid of it. As \nimportant as all that is, however, I am afraid there is an effort here \nto saddle it with things that are bad for this country, that are the \ncamel's nose under the tent, things that would never pass on their own. \nI say we have to keep our eye on the ball.\n  We are going to hold free trade hostage. We are going to hold our \nfriends in our hemisphere--whom we ought to be trying to do everything \nto help--hostage in order to get a new array of social programs and \nguarantees and things that are old and tired and have failed in other \nparts of this world and should never be started in this one.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the assistant leader, \nSenator Nickles.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant leader is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, one, I compliment Senator Thompson for \nthe speech he made as well as Senator Gregg from New Hampshire for this \namendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. This amendment would \nstrike the wage subsidy program. I am glad we are going to have an up-\nor-down vote on it; and I hope this amendment will be adopted \noverwhelmingly, because this wage subsidy program is a bad idea.\n  There are a lot of bad ideas floating around. The Senator from \nTennessee just mentioned a couple of them. It bothers me that evidently \nthe Democrats who put together this package--and I say that because the \nTrade Adjustment Assistance Program passed in the Finance Committee \nwithout adequate discussion. We spent all day on trade promotion \nauthority, and trade promotion authority passed, 18 to 3 in the Finance \nCommittee. Trade adjustment assistance was rushed through the \nCommittee. The two hour rule was raised and some would even question \nwhether we finished it in time because of this objection, and whether \nit passed too late. There was not enough discussion. I am on that \ncommittee.\n  Well, what is it? It is the Federal Government saying: if you lose \nyour job, presumably because of trade, and you take another job, the \nFederal Government will come in and pick up half the difference if your \nsecond job is less money.\n  I would like to have colleagues who support this come and defend it. \nWhy are we doing this for so many of people? I question the wisdom of \nthe proposal.\n  I will just give you an example. What if you are a Senator whose wife \njust happens to work. Maybe it is a high-tech firm, which closes. \nSomeone could say it was because of trade that it closed. And so she \nbecame unemployed, or became reemployed, and took a lesser paying job. \nSo Uncle Sam is going to write my spouse a check for $5,000.\n  As the Senator from Tennessee said, this is just an opening round. \nProponents will attempt to expand this program, should it pass. Why are \nwe going to have the Federal Government setting wage rates? And \nguaranteeing these wage rates? How ridiculous of an idea can it be? How \nsocialistic can it be? Maybe people don't not like to use that word, \nbut socialism is the Government setting wages and prices. This is \npretty socialistic.\n  I am embarrassed as to how bad this idea is. I compliment my \ncolleague and friend from New Hampshire for raising this, pointing this \nout to the Senate.\n  There is no income test. We could be writing checks for people who \ncould have $1 million in assets. Presumably, if they lost a job and \nthen took a lesser job, Uncle Sam will write them a check for half the \ndifference in many cases, even if they are millionaires. What kind of \nsense does that make?\n\n[[Page S4439]]\n\n  I am embarrassed for the Senate. I am bothered by this process the \nmajority leader has put in that says: To take up trade promotion, you \nalso have to take trade adjustment assistance. Incidentally, when we \nare doing this, we will also put in a new wage subsidy program. We will \nhave a brand-new benefit for trade adjustment assistance, including the \nFederal Government, for the first time ever, picking up 70 percent of \nhealth care costs not only for directly affected workers but for \nupstream workers as well, defined broadly enough to where no one knows \nhow many hundreds of thousands of people might qualify for that \nbenefit.\n  In addition, we will have a brand-new wage subsidy paid for by \ntaxpayers. I have an interest. I have a son. I have three daughters. \nThey are all taxpayers, and I am too. They don't want to pay for this \nbenefit. Their taxes are plenty high. All of a sudden, we are talking \nabout new entitlements for people. Where is the money coming from? We \nhave a deficit now.\n  Somebody said: If passed, this new program is limited to $50 million. \nWhat proponents are trying to do is get this new entitlement started. \nThen we will see how much it costs 10 years from now, and supporters \nwill probably try to raise the limit from $5,000 to such sums as \nnecessary. You name it. Entitlements can grow like crazy. I would hate \nto think we would adopt this, and then 10 years from now find out we \nhave a multibillion-dollar program and ask: Where did this come from?\n  This was a partisan proposal jammed in on top of trade promotion, \nbasically extortion, saying, if you don't give us this, we will not \ngive you trade.\n  The Senate needs to reject this proposal. This is a bad idea. When we \ntalk about other countries, we encourage them to move to free markets. \nI am embarrassed that some of us are trying to move in their \nsocialistic direction. Wow.\n  As a matter of fact, I had a constituent in my office a few minutes \nago. He was listening to the Senator from New Hampshire. I told him I \nhad to join this debate. I explained the amendment. My constituent's \nresponse was: I can't believe they are trying to do this.\n  This is about income redistribution where the Federal Government is \npaying wages, we will have a wage guarantee program. This is a wage \nsubsidy program; that is exactly what this is. This is part of a very \nbad idea, a very bad process. It needs to be resoundingly rejected.\n  I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to support the Gregg \namendment and strike this brand-new entitlement program.\n  If there are proponents, I would love to have a dialog and find out \nhow this will work and find out if a millionaire could benefit from \nthis program; and find out if someone's spouse, who maybe is from a \nvery wealthy family, if they could benefit from this program; or find \nout, if I was working for $50,000, and I happened to be over 50 and I \ndecided to take a job for $40,000, if I can use that money to cover my \ngolf bets. The Senator from Missouri mentioned maybe this is good for \nthe golfers. I happen to be a golfer. I like that idea. But I have \nnever thought of the Federal Government paying for my golf side bets.\n  I can't believe we are even considering this. What an embarrassment. \nThis amendment should be passed, and it should be passed \noverwhelmingly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I understand the other side is going to \nyield 2 minutes to the Senator from Texas, and then we will go to 5 \nminutes to the Senator from Arizona. We are alternating.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, we yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, I was asked \nby the White House and by the Republican leadership to try to negotiate \na package that would allow us to pass trade promotion authority. In the \nprocess, I found myself in a position of having to either kiss an ugly \npig on the mouth or send it off to the barbeque.\n  Through our negotiations, we were able to drop the steel legacy \nprovision. We also were able to dramatically reduce the proposed wage \ninsurance program, cutting its funding level from $100 million to $50 \nmillion and its authorization from 5 years to 2 years. But I am not \ngoing to stand here today and argue on behalf of the principle of wage \ninsurance. I can tell my colleagues that as a conferee, I am going to \noppose this provision, and I hope it will be removed.\n  I believe that our leader and Senator Grassley and I are in the \nposition where we have made an agreement, and therefore we must stick \nto it. I could stand here and say I am very unhappy that those who have \nentered into the agreement on the other side of the aisle nonetheless \nhave found it convenient to continue to load more and more and more \nonto this wagon, to the point where the axle is about to break. But in \nmy book, when you give your word, when you try to work out an \nagreement, when you try to make compromise work, you give up the luxury \nof coming back later and picking and choosing which provisions to \nsupport. In fact, it is sort of like fast track: you make a deal and \nyou must stick by the whole package.\n  This afternoon we are going to have several votes. First, we are \ngoing to have a vote on Senator Dodd's amendment, which effectively is \nthe same amendment as the one offered yesterday by Senator Lieberman. \nIf that amendment passes, I am off this wagon. We also are going to \nhave a vote on adding back the steel legacy provision. If steel legacy \ncosts are included in this bill, I am going to do everything in my \npower to kill this bill, even though I am for fast-track authority and \nbelieve it is critical. You simply reach a point where greed and \nirresponsibility so overwhelm the underlying cause that you just cannot \ntolerate it.\n\n  There's a bigger point to all this, and that is the question of \ntaking ownership. Quite frankly, I don't believe the chairman of the \nFinance Committee and the majority leader of the Senate have taken \nownership of this trade promotion authority bill. I think we have had a \ngame of piracy to try to see what can be gotten in return for this bill \nsince they know that the President wants this bill and that it is in \nthe national interest. They claim to be for the bill, but at every step \nalong the way, we are having piracy committed against this bill.\n  I gave my word when I signed on to the agreement. Had I been the \nprincipal instead of the negotiator, I am not sure I would have agreed \nto our agreement. In fact, I probably wouldn't have. But I did. \nHowever, if these other amendments pass, if the deal is not kept, if it \nis clear that this piracy is going to continue, then at that point I \nwould feel free to vote my conscience.\n  The point is that we have made an agreement. As appealing as it is to \nme to go back and undo the wage insurance part of it--a rotten, \nstinking part of it--I don't think that that would be responsible. But \nI will fight to get rid of this provision in conference and I hope that \nit will be dropped.\n  I have taken some degree of ownership of this bill, and feel a \nresponsibility for it. For this process to succeed, I believe that \nthose of us who want fast-track authority--the majority leader, the \nminority leader, the chairman of Finance, the ranking member of \nFinance, and those Senators who want this bill--have to begin to show \nsome ownership of and responsibility for the bill as negotiated.\n  If we do not, and instead keep seeing efforts to pile on, we are \ngoing to kill this bill. For example, if steel legacy is added to this \nbill, it is dead. If the Dodd amendment, which is effectively the same \nvote we had on Lieberman, is added to this bill, we won't have trade \npromotion authority and I therefore will be off the wagon and out of \nthe deal.\n  Today, I am in the deal. As I said, I have taken on partial ownership \nof the bill. When you sign on to a compromise, when you take partial \nownership, when you take responsibility, it means you have to stand up \nfor the deal and vote against even those amendments that you otherwise \nwould support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n\n[[Page S4440]]\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program \ndedicates a very small piece of what we gained from trade to help those \npeople who lose from trade, get back on their feet, and that is really \nwhat this amendment does.\n  The current TAA program helps some people but does not address some \nof the key problems people face; it leaves out too many other people \naltogether.\n  We fix some of these flaws. When a plant shuts down or moves \noverseas, workers lose their livelihoods and families face the \nuncertainty of not knowing how they are going to pay for food or a \nmortgage, or take their child to the doctor.\n  This bipartisan agreement will provide these workers with the \nopportunity to go back to community college to learn some new skills. \nThey will receive unemployment insurance and subsidized health care to \nhelp them get through the difficult times and help them get a new job.\n  To a 35-year-old worker facing a difficult circumstance of a lost \njob, this sounds like a potential lifeline. But for a 53-year-old \ncloser to retirement age, and less likely to be able to transition into \na new job or field, those benefits are largely an empty promise. And we \nknow it.\n  That is why we have worked so hard to keep the wage insurance \nprovision in the bipartisan package we negotiated with Senators \nGrassley, Lott, Gramm, and the White House. This provision was part of \nour agreement, and it must be retained.\n  Wage insurance is a pilot program--that is all it is--to test a very \npowerful idea. It says to older workers, if you take a lower paying job \nthan the one you lost, some of the money that you would have received \nin unemployment insurance will go to offset a portion of the wage loss \nyou will suffer.\n  By helping offset the loss of taking a lower paying job, wage \ninsurance discourages dependency and encourages work. Wage insurance is \nnot just compassionate policy, it is smart policy.\n  By getting people back into the workforce sooner, wage insurance will \nreduce unemployment rolls and the overall cost to Government. In \nreality, the provision will cost nothing more than what the Government \nwould have been paying in unemployment insurance because people will \nhave to give up their unemployment benefits to get the wage insurance.\n  This provision is prowork and it enjoys broad intellectual support on \nthe left and on the right. In 1998, partly because of the unintended \neffects of trade, Congress established the U.S. Trade Deficit Review \nCommission. Among the key members of the Commission were President \nBush's Trade Representative, Robert Zoellick; Defense Secretary Donald \nRumsfeld; and George Becker, former President of the Steelworkers.\n  This group doesn't agree on much. But wage insurance was one clear \narea of agreement. Here is what they had to say--a bipartisan \ncommission:\n\n       We recommend that Congress consider new ways to address the \n     broader cost of job displacement. Such consideration should \n     include assessing ways of filling the earnings gaps created \n     when new jobs initially pay less than previous jobs. As \n     discussed, wage insurance is one such option. It has the \n     advantage of encouraging displaced workers to accept new jobs \n     as quickly as possible.\n\n  Here is another voice:\n\n       It would be a great tragedy were we to stop the wheels of \n     progress because of an incapacity to assist victims of \n     progress. Our efforts should be directed at job skills \n     enhancement and retraining . . . and, if necessary, selected \n     income maintenance programs for those over a certain age, \n     where retraining is problematic.\n\n  That is not a Democratic Senator speaking. That is Federal Reserve \nChairman Alan Greenspan. In case my colleagues missed the translation, \n``income maintenance programs for those of a certain age'' is wage \ninsurance. Alan Greenspan is talking about wage insurance. Wage \ninsurance for older workers is exactly what we are talking about this \nmorning.\n  Finally, from a think tank:\n\n       The proposed wage insurance program would strongly \n     encourage workers to quickly find new jobs.\n\n  I will repeat that because it may resonate with some of my colleagues \non the floor.\n\n       The proposed wage insurance program would strongly \n     encourage workers to quickly find new jobs.\n\n  That quote comes from the Heritage Foundation, and it comes as yet \nanother endorsement of this amendment.\n  Older workers who lose their jobs and are struggling to find a new \none have enough uncertainty to worry about. They should not also have \nto worry about whether they can afford to take a new job. The wage \ninsurance provision gives workers something more than an empty promise.\n  We already scaled this proposal back from $100 million for each of \nthe next 5 years to $50 million for 2 years. But we cannot afford to \nlose it entirely. It is a central component of the bipartisan agreement \nwe made with Senators Grassley, Lott, Gramm, and the White House.\n  I urge my colleagues to keep this agreement intact and reject this \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment \nof the Senator from New Hampshire to strike this wage subsidy provision \nfrom the bill. In my view, if it stays in the bill, it could well sink \nit. It would be difficult for me to support the bill on final passage \nif this provision is in it, notwithstanding my support for the bill. I \nadmire the Senator from Texas because he was part of a group that \nnegotiated portions of this bill that would be on the floor before us. \nHe feels committed to supporting the version that was negotiated which \nincludes this provision. Of course, he should do that. I think he also \nmakes a good point to suggest that others who may be supporting other \namendments need to keep their commitment in mind.\n  But the statement here reminds me a little bit of the old politician \nthat said that it is important for us to always stand on principle and, \nin certain situations, to even be able to rise above principle. That is \nwhat is involved here unfortunately. The principle is to have a free \nmarket with labor and capital, people freely able to be hired. And it \nis possible sometimes through government decisions that people lose \ntheir jobs, through competition that people lose jobs. It is even \npossible that if there is a tariff reduced as a result of a free trade \nagreement, that could result in somebody losing their jobs.\n  People lose jobs for all kinds of reasons. The question, though, is \nwhether or not we should make an exception and provide that certain \npeople who work have rights more than others and are entitled to \ncertain kinds of subsidy benefits in their wages as a result.\n  If we decide that is a good idea, how are we going to explain to \nother workers that we are leaving them out in the cold? The reality is \nthat this is a foot in the door that will create an argument for \neverybody, regardless of their circumstance, to have a wage subsidy \nlike certain other countries in the world of GATT, competitors of ours \nwho cannot compete as well because they have these kinds of government \nsubsidy programs for wages. In fact, it is a transfer of payment from \nhard-working Americans, middle income Americans, to those who are more \nwealthy. It is blatant discrimination against hard-working Americans, \nan invitation to fraud and abuse. As I said, it is a very dangerous \nstep toward Government control. It is theoretically capped, but we know \nthe initial expenses will be a drop in the bucket compared to what it \nwill cost over the years.\n  Other constituencies will soon demand their own form of wage \ninsurance, whether subsidies or other wage controls, and I think it \nwould be virtually impossible to say no to them once we have \nestablished the principle. That is what I am talking about here--\nprinciple. There is no limitation in this program based upon necessity. \nIt is available to dislocated workers who simply choose to quit the rat \nrace and take an easier job. There is no training requirement, and that \nwas always a component of the program that has been supported here in \nthe past by the Senate. The Trade Adjustment Act has always included a \ntraining component to train displaced workers for new and better jobs.\n  But this wage subsidy program circumvents that and allows certain \nworkers essentially to opt out.\n\n[[Page S4441]]\n\n  There is no consideration in this provision of whether there are \nsuitable jobs available in similar circumstances. The older displaced \nworker is free to take the job, earn an entitlement, regardless of \nwhether equivalent work is readily available. For whatever reason, \nfamily health or personal preference, the individual is free to pull up \nstakes and move anywhere in the country, take a job, and receive the \nsubsidy.\n  There are some who suggest that would benefit my sunshine State of \nArizona. It would be pretty nice to quit the job in the Rust Belt and \nmove to Arizona because of the subsidy provided in this bill.\n  There is no protection against fraud and abuse. There is a perverse \nincentive in this provision for employers to reduce the wages they pay \nknowing the Federal subsidy will supplement their workers' income and \nmake up the difference.\n  There is no requirement the new employer and employee be at arm's \nlength. This is a very critical provision rife for potential fraud and \nabuse. There is no inquiry permitted as to whether the new job, perhaps \nwith a family member or friend, is a legitimate consequence of the \ndisplaced worker having to leave his former employment. Because the \nU.S. Government makes up the difference in wages, it is, as I say, rife \nwith potential for fraud and abuse.\n  We ought to go back to principle and not politics.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. I suggest my colleagues support the amendment of the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I yield myself 6 minutes.\n  Mr. President, I thank Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley \nfor their superb work so far on the trade bill.\n  These are complex matters of policy, with potentially far-reaching \nconsequences, that we are dealing with on this bill, and our two \nleaders on the Finance Committee have led us with foresight and wisdom. \nIt is so important, as always, that we carefully balanced both the \npositive and the negatives of the legislation at hand.\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, I have taken our role, as \nAmericans, in the global economic picture very seriously. Our \nleadership is crucial to the success of any efforts to open markets, \nwhether in a multilateral forum such as the World Trade Organization, \nor in a regional context, such as a proposed western hemispheric \narrangement. And let us make no mistake about the absolute need to open \nmarkets, to ensure the freer mobility of capital, to guarantee everyone \na chance at a more prosperous and more stable future.\n  The underlying trade bill helps us meet this need, helps us fulfill \nour vital role as the global economic leader, by extending to the \npresident the trade negotiating authority he needs to undertake more \neffectively the multilateral and other important negotiations that a \nstable global economy will require.\n  Once the President has negotiated an agreement, he brings it back to \nus for our consideration. If we support the agreement he has \nnegotiated, then we take another step into the future by opening more \nmarkets and further growing our economy.\n  But the underlying trade bill also meets another highly important \nneed: it gives us the resources and the authority to respond to those \nworkers and those firms that will inevitably be displaced by the \ngrowing, changing economy.\n  The wage insurance provision of the trade adjustment assistance \npackage helps us do just that. It offers a helping hand to older \nAmericans who have lost their livelihoods to the inevitable \ndislocations increased trade creates. It does so by recognizing the \nobvious reality that a time consuming return to school for job \nretraining may not be in the best interests of older workers who are \nclose to retirement age. It also recognizes the reality that older \nworkers have a much harder time than younger workers re-entering the \njob market, particularly at the same income level they enjoyed \npreviously. It meets the needs of these older workers by allowing them \nto insure wage loss. To receive the benefits of wage insurance, the \nolder worker foregoes the additional income support he could otherwise \nreceive if he or she went back to school. Thus, the worker receives \nbenefits while he or she re-enters the job market and without having to \ngo back to school, which, again, for this worker may not be the best \noption given his or her age.\n  I strongly support the wage insurance provisions of this bill, and I \nwould also have supported an even more generous version of this \nprovision.\n  Yet, with this trade bill, we have all made compromises, for the sake \nof getting a good, comprehensive piece of legislation to send to the \nPresident's desk. Wage insurance is a much needed part of the TAA \npackage. It is fair and it is responsible.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against the Gregg amendment as we \nproceed to that vote and remember that there is not a one-size-fits-\nall, but that all of our workers need the special attention and the \nability to move within the workforce in a way that is conducive to \nthem, to their lifestyle, and particularly to their age. I thank the \nChair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Did the Senator yield back the remainder of time?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Yes, I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will make my statement and then we can go \nto the vote.\n  First, I thank the many Members who have come to the Chamber and \nsupported this amendment. There have been a number of points made that \nI think have been extremely appropriate as to the failure of the \nlanguage in the bill and the need to have this amendment to correct it.\n  I want to respond to a couple points made by the Democratic leader. \nFirst, this issue of the deal. A number of Members spoke and said this \nis a lousy idea. It is really not a very good policy, the concept of \npaying people to take less productive jobs, having the taxpayers pay \npeople to take less productive jobs. This is not good policy, but I \nhave to be for it because there was a deal agreed to.\n  As far as I can tell, there were only six people in that room at the \nmost. So maybe those six people have reached an agreement, and around \nhere, if you give your word, you have to stand by it. I respect the \npeople who came to the Chamber and said they are going to stand by \ntheir word.\n  For the rest of us, we should look at the policy of whether or not \nthis is a good idea, and it is not. It is called a pilot program, and \nthe Democratic leader said it was a pilot program for which they wanted \n$100 million, and they agreed to $50 million over 2 years. As he \ndescribed it, it is a central component of the understanding they \nreached.\n  Mr. President, $50 million is a lot of money, but around this \nbuilding, it does not even deserve an asterisk. So there is something \nmore at work. We are not talking about $50 million if it is a central \ncomponent of the agreement. We are talking about something people \nexpect to expand radically over the years. This is a brandnew major \nentitlement which will expand dramatically. It is not some benign \nlittle pilot program. If it was, it would not be a central component of \nthis agreement. Thus, this attempt to dismiss it is as something \nmarginal clearly does not fly, even though it is alleged to be a pilot \nprogram.\n\n  There was also a statement made that this is an attempt to benefit \nolder workers. Actually, the language of this bill does the exact \nopposite. We have on the books the age discrimination language which \nsays you cannot discriminate against somebody in their job who is over \n50 years old.\n  We have on the books laws which say that older workers should be \ngiven deference and should be allowed to retain their jobs and should \nbe allowed to improve their position in the workplace and should not be \ndiscriminated against because of their age.\n  This amendment says exactly the opposite. It says to the older \nworker: When you lose your job due to trade, we are going to say you \nare not capable of getting a better job; we are going to tell you go \nfind a lesser job, and then\n\n[[Page S4442]]\n\nwe will pay you from the other taxpayers of America $5,000 to do that.\n  It takes the theory of ``you cannot teach old dogs new tricks'' and \nsays: Not only can you not teach old dogs new tricks, but we are going \nto pay you $5,000 to forget everything you have learned and take less \nof a job.\n  It makes absolutely no sense in the context of the other laws which \nwe have on the books relative to age discrimination. In fact, it flies \nin the face of years of attempts to make sure that as people get \nfurther into the workforce, they are not discriminated against.\n  Of course, as has been outlined, it has no structure to it, no \ncontrols to it. Under the trade adjustment concept, the whole idea is \nto train people who lose their jobs as a result of trade activity, to \ntrain them to get a better job, to give them opportunities to get a \nbetter job. This language says you should get less of a job. It reduces \nyour employment capability. There is no training language in this bill. \nIn fact, you cannot train under this bill. It basically rejects the \ntraining language of the trade adjustment language.\n  There is no requirement that you take a similar and suitable job. So \nif you have the ability to do something that is unique and you can take \nit across the street after you lose your job somewhere and get paid \njust as much or maybe even more, there is no requirement that you do \nthat. If you would rather do something that maybe pays you a lot less \nbecause it is more socially acceptable to you, it is more in tune with \nyour lifestyle--the example has been used of going and becoming an \nassistant pro at a golf course because you would rather play golf \nrather than work in a steel factory--you can do that; that is your \nright; you should be able to do that. Pursuit of happiness is part of \nour culture, but you should not get $5,000 from the taxpayers who are \nstill working somewhere on the line to do it, which is what this bill \ntells you.\n  If there is a similar and suitable job, you are not required to take \nit. You are not required to remain in the community, which means it \nundermines the community. I talked at length about that last night. You \nare not required to have a need for the job. Your spouse could be \nmaking $100,000, $200,000, or $300,000. If you had a job where you \nearned $50,000 and you take a lesser job, you still get $5,000 from the \ntaxpayers of America, even though your spouse may have a huge income.\n  There is no test relative to the manipulation of the system. An \nemployer may be closing down one plant on trade adjustment language, \nopening up another facility in a different area, moving people into \nthere, and getting a $5,000 payment. There is no language about that. \nThere are no controls.\n  There is no control in the area of meeting the needs relative to, as \nI said, staying in the community. And there is no arm's length control. \nYou could work within the family, for example, move from one job to \nanother. Maybe your son runs a construction company and you are working \nfor a steel mill and the steel mill goes out of business; you go to \nwork for your son's construction company and the taxpayers of America \nwould have to pay you $5,000. Those are the technical issues that lie \nwith this question.\n  The bigger issues are these: No. 1, it is a brandnew entitlement with \nimmense potential. No. 2, and most importantly, it undermines our basic \nphilosophy of how we have had our economy structured the last 200 \nyears.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Therefore, I hope people will join me in supporting this \namendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. On behalf of myself, Senator Gramm of Texas, and Senator \nGrassley of Iowa, I move to table the Gregg amendment, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the last vote today, May 16, the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 282, H.R. 3167, the NATO expansion bill, \nand that it be considered under the following limitations: that there \nbe 2\\1/2\\ hours for debate, with the time divided as follows: 60 \nminutes under the control of the chairman, Senator Biden, and ranking \nmember or their designees, 90 minutes under the control of Senator \nWarner or his designee; that no amendments or motions be in order--I \nunderstand there has been a change in plans. I withdraw that proposed \nrequest.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that in the sequence of the \namendments to H.R. 3009, the next three Democratic amendments be Nelson \nof Florida regarding dumping, Corzine regarding services, and Hollings \nregarding TAA expansion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, might I \ninquire of the Senator from Nevada, are these the three amendments that \nyou would put following the list of amendments that were agreed to \nyesterday?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from North Dakota is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to try to understand also, the \nprevious unanimous consent request of the Senator from Nevada, which he \nhas withdrawn--is it the Senator's intent, with the subsequent \nunanimous consent request, that we move off the fast-track bill and on \nto NATO expansion? And if so, what would be the length of time we would \nbe off the fast-track bill?\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding, I say to the Senator from North \nDakota, that we will do 2\\1/2\\ hours on this tonight and return to the \nfast-track bill tomorrow.\n  Mr. DORGAN. With votes, Mr. President? I inquire, will there be votes \ntomorrow?\n  Mr. REID. The majority leader announced yesterday there likely will \nbe votes tomorrow. So I say to my friend from North Dakota, I know his \nconcern is we have a long list of amendments and are we going to get to \nall the amendments.\n  I say to my friend from North Dakota, we are doing our very best to\n\n[[Page S4443]]\n\nwork our way through these. And the majority leader has said publicly, \nand on a number of occasions, he wants to allow people to have the \nability to amend this. I have not heard the leader say at any time that \nhe is contemplating, in the near future, a motion for cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, if I might continue to reserve my right to \nobject, yesterday, we created a sequencing of amendments. I was not \nconsulted in that. I was on the floor expecting to be recognized \nfollowing the Gregg amendment. And then the Senator brought to the \nfloor a sequencing of amendments that has me somewhere following some \nvery big, lengthy amendments that are going to take a lot of floor \ntime.\n  I was surprised by that and not consulted about it. So if we are \ngoing to sequence amendments--I regretted it all the way to work this \nmorning that I did not object yesterday. I think the way for us to do \nthis, of course, is to consult with each other. Since I was on the \nfloor expecting to be able to offer an amendment, and talked to the \nappropriate staff about doing so, I was very surprised about the \nsequencing that came yesterday. But I don't believe it is the fault of \nthe Senator from Nevada. It is not my intention to suggest that. But if \nwe are sequencing things, let's consult with everyone first.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from North Dakota, he is \nnot alone. There are a number of other people who have come to me today \nasking why they are not higher than the rest. But I do say, we have a \nlot of amendments, and certainly there was no intent to, in any way, \ndiscourage or prevent the Senator from North Dakota having his \namendment heard. In fact, it is my understanding that the Senator from \nNorth Dakota has other amendments that he wishes to offer. I apologize \nto him, and others, that perhaps we could have done more consulting \nwith others, but we didn't, and we are now in this posture. We will try \nto do better in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is not about being higher on the \nlist. It is about, if there is going to be stage management here, then \nthere should be consultation on how we are going to manage the stage. I \nwas expecting to be, and was told I would likely be, recognized \nfollowing the Gregg amendment.\n  Look, I am where I am at this point because of the unanimous consent \nrequest that I should have objected to yesterday and did not. I only \npoint out, as we proceed, it would be helpful to consult with the rest \nof us. If not, I will be constrained to object on future unanimous \nrequests.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Connecticut is recognized to offer an amendment.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3428 To Amendment No. 3401\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself and \n     Mr. Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered 3428 to \n     amendment No. 3401.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To clarify the principal negotiating objectives of the United \n           States with respect to labor and the environment)\n\n       Section 2102(b)(11) is amended by striking subparagraph (C) \n     and inserting the following new subparagraphs:\n       ``(C) to ensure that the parties to a trade agreement \n     reaffirm their obligations as members of the ILO and their \n     commitments under the ILO Declaration on Fundamental \n     Principles and Rights at Work and its Follow-up, and strive \n     to ensure that such labor principles and the core labor \n     standards set forth in section 2113(2) are recognized and \n     protected by domestic law;\n       ``(D) recognizing the rights of parties to establish their \n     own labor standards, and to adopt or modify accordingly their \n     labor laws and regulations, parties shall strive to ensure \n     that their laws provide for labor standards consistent with \n     the core labor standards and shall strive to improve those \n     standards in that light;\n       ``(E) to recognize that it is inappropriate to encourage \n     trade by relaxing domestic labor laws and to strive to ensure \n     that parties to a trade agreement do not waive or otherwise \n     derogate from, or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from, \n     their labor laws as an encouragement for trade;\n       ``(F) to strengthen the capacity of United States trading \n     partners to promote respect for core labor standards and \n     reaffirm their obligations and commitments under the ILO \n     Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work and \n     its Follow-up;''.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I offer this amendment on behalf of myself \nand my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Lieberman.\n  Before I get into the details of the amendment and why I think it is \nan important amendment, let me state what I think many of my colleagues \nmay have been aware of over the years.\n  I have been a longtime advocate of promoting free and fair trade \nthroughout my tenure in this body of more than two decades. I have \nhistorically supported the granting of fast-track authority. I voted \nfor trade agreements that have resulted from that authority. So the \nMember who offers this amendment is one who has a strong record over \nthe years of advocating and supporting expanding trading opportunities.\n  I come from a State that has been tremendously dependent over the \nyears on export markets for the health and well-being of the people who \nlive there.\n  I say that as a background so you understand what my thinking is \nabout this amendment, and why I think this amendment is so important to \npeople such as myself who have been supporters of trade agreement. The \nadoption or the defeat of this amendment could have a profound effect, \nI say to my colleagues, on someone such as myself, who likes to believe \nthat we have progressed, over the years, in trade agreements, expanding \nand fighting for the rights that we demand not only for our own \ncitizenry but in trying to expand around the globe to benefit and \nimprove the quality of life for people elsewhere with whom we have \ntrading agreements.\n  What I have observed over time is that the evolution and the content \nand scope of these agreements, their depth and their breadth have grown \ndramatically since I first arrived in this body more than 20 years ago. \nNo longer are we simply dealing with tariffs and duties and quotas to \nbe levied on tangible goods. That was the case when I arrived. But \nbecause good people in this body, of both parties, over the years have \nfought to expand what would be a part of these agreements, we have \nimproved dramatically these trading accords.\n  We now deal with virtually every facet of our economy. The process \nhas evolved. And matters once totally outside the realm of trade \nagreements no longer are. And that is good news for America.\n  I am thinking, for example, of the NAFTA agreement, which I supported \nand which passed the Congress only after the Clinton administration \nnegotiated side agreements related to labor and the environment. Those \nside agreements were controversial to some in this body, but they were \nso essential to the passage of NAFTA.\n  Throughout my 20 years in the Senate I have been a strong supporter \nof trading agreements and fast track.\n  I am very proud of my record of support for these agreements. It has \nbeen a critical issue for my State and the country. You are not \nlistening to a Member who historically has objected every time a trade \nagreement or fast-track authority has come up. Quite the contrary, I \nhave been one who has stood in support of these agreements because I \nbelieved they were in our country's best interest.\n  Over time there has been an evolution in the content and scope of \nthese trading agreements--that has been wonderful news for the United \nStates--as their depth and breadth have grown dramatically. It used to \nbe we just negotiated agreements that dealt with tariffs, duties, and \nquotas on tradeable goods. That was it. You didn't consider anything \nelse.\n  Those days are long since past. We now deal with virtually every \nfacet of\n\n[[Page S4444]]\n\nour economy in the context of trade negotiations. The process has \nevolved, and matters once considered totally outside the realm of a \ntrade agreement no longer are. I am thinking of NAFTA, which I strongly \nsupported, which was an important agreement that passed the Congress \nonly after the Clinton administration negotiated side agreements \nrelating to labor and the environment. Those side agreements were \ncontroversial to some in this body, but had they not been included, we \nwould never have passed NAFTA.\n  That is a fact.\n  What I am saying about the amendment I am proposing--I will get to \nthe details in a minute--for people such as myself, the adoption of \nthis kind of an amendment is critically important to our votes when it \ncomes to final passage. Maybe they are not necessary, but I would hate \nto think as we begin the 21st century that we would take a step back \nfrom exactly the progress we have made in the latter part of the 20th \ncentury when it comes to trading agreements. That is all I am \nsuggesting we do here: To maintain this progress as we go forward.\n  More recently, both the House and the Senate unanimously endorsed the \nUnited States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement. The Bush administration in \nfact urged Congress to do so. The Jordan agreement broke new ground and \nset a standard, a floor by which other agreements will be judged as \nthey relate to the support and protection of core internationally \nrecognized labor standards.\n  The United States-Jordan Agreement also contains a mechanism to \nresolve disputes related to violations of the terms of the agreement, \nincluding violations of labor rights equal to violations that in the \ncontext of commerce and other economic transactions between our two \nnations. The Jordan agreement was very forward looking, dynamic, and \nsupported by 100 percent of the Members of the Senate. As part of that \nagreement, the United States and Jordan pledged not only to uphold \nexisting domestic labor laws in conjunction with the trade agreement, \nbut we also recognized that ``cooperation between them provides \nenhanced opportunities to improve labor standards'' in the future.\n  Last week, King Abdallah of Jordan was in Washington. Many of my \ncolleagues had an opportunity to see him. The Middle East crisis was \nforemost on his mind for obvious reasons. He also took the time to \nmention that the implementation of the United States-Jordan Free Trade \nAgreement was working very well. For those who may say this places \nonerous burdens on developing countries, Third and Fourth World \ncountries, and this is too difficult a task, King Abdallah of Jordan \nmade the point that the United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement was \nworking extremely well.\n\n  No one expects every country with which we will be entering into \nnegotiations to have the same standards and protections the United \nStates has with respect to protection of workers' rights, just as they \ndon't have as well developed patent and copyright laws or environmental \nstandards. We know that. But we do believe that if every country had \nidentical standards and practices, negotiations would be unnecessary.\n  The purpose of engaging in negotiations and reaching comprehensive \ntrade agreements is to encourage other nations to stretch themselves to \ndo more in these areas. Trade agreements should be viewed as a dynamic \nprocess for ratcheting up global standards across the board.\n  The Jordan standards, unanimously adopted by Members of this body, \nare a mechanism for making that happen in the labor sector.\n  One of the reasons I am offering the Jordan standards as a part of \nthis bill is that they passed 100 to nothing here. There was no debate \nabout whether or not these standards ought to be included in that \nagreement. My concern is, if we don't raise the level on this trade \nauthority, we will be taking a step back.\n  My amendment merely takes three provisions of this agreement and \nincorporates them in the underlying bill. I commend the committee \nbecause they took three of the provisions of the Jordan free trade \nagreement included them in the legislation. But in the absence of these \nthree I will discuss shortly, this is a flawed proposal.\n  For those reasons, my amendment ought to be adopted. We don't expect \neveryone to have the exact standards we do. But we think these rights \nare not just unique to this country. We think the people's right to \ncollectively bargain, the people's right to be protected against child \nlabor are good standards. These are standards we want the rest of the \nworld to try to reach.\n  We don't want the world to hire children to produce products that are \nsold in America. We want the environment to improve not just in our own \ncountry but around the globe as well. By including the standards in the \nJordan agreement in this agreement, we advance the very cause of those \nideals which we have championed as a people, regardless of party. In \nmany ways it has been the bipartisan insistence on these inclusions \nthat has made them so important and so dynamic for the rest of the \nworld.\n  Is there any doubt that it is in the economic and foreign policy \ninterests of the United States to encourage respect for workers' \nrights, abolish child labor, or to protect the environment? Those ought \nnot belong to a party, they belong to a Nation. Is there any doubt that \ngovernments that treat their workers with respect, that allow them to \nfreely associate, that have adopted laws against child labor, that have \nestablished minimum wage standards, are governments that tend to be \nstrong and stable democracies, or that governments that don't value and \nprotect their citizens are generally tyrants who are not only a threat \nto their own citizens but to their neighbors as well?\n  President John Kennedy once said that a rising tide lifts all boats. \nThe growth in international commerce can certainly be that rising tide. \nBut it will only lift all boats if we ensure that increased trade goes \nhand in hand with respect for internationally recognized labor rights \nand have a shared commitment to making the lives of working people \nbetter. That is why I believe it is so critical that we send a clear \nsignal that we truly are seeking to get our trading partners to adopt \nstandards that our friends in Jordan readily agreed to and find are \nworking extremely well.\n\n  What an irony it would be that we demand it of Jordan, a country with \nall of its difficulties, with a remarkable leader in King Abdallah who \nfinds he can live with it, and we turn around, after a unanimous vote \nin the year 2001, passing the United States-Jordan agreement, and adopt \na trade accord here that would allow us to take a walk away from the \nvery standards that only months ago we applied to the nation of Jordan.\n  The Jordan Agreement is living well with the agreements and standards \nwe applied there. To now take a hike on the standards we agreed to \nunder Jordan, and to say to everyone else that they get to adopt a \nlower standard would be a tragedy. This agreement ought not to be \nadopted if we exclude these provisions that we have already adopted 100 \nto nothing in the Senate only a few short months ago.\n  Let me explain what the amendment does. It is not complicated. It is \nvery straightforward. My colleagues will understand this is not an \nexaggerated, new idea. I am merely taking the language that already \nexists, that was adopted unanimously in the year 2001.\n  The amendment, for those who want to follow the details of this, \nwould modify section 2102(b)(11) of the underlying managers' amendment \nas it relates to the principle trade negotiations with respect to labor \nby adding language drawn from the United States-Jordan Free Trade \nAgreement. The language proposed in my amendment is an addition to the \nlanguage included in the managers' package.\n  I commend the managers. They did include language, very specifically, \nfrom the United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement in this bill. That \nis very helpful.\n  But we are missing some language here. Let there be no doubt. When \nyou are dealing with traders around the world, they will make clear \nnote that the absence of language was not a mistake, not some \noversight; the intentions are quite clear that all of a sudden we are \nchanging the rules of the road. I don't think we want to send that \nmessage.\n  So I know there will be arguments that the United States-Jordan Free\n\n[[Page S4445]]\n\nTrade Agreement is included entirely in this bill. It is not at all. I \ncommend the managers for what they have done. The managers were \nworking, of course, from the House version of this bill. That placed \ncertain constraints on them in committee. I hope that the full Senate \nwill act on this matter now, so we can be more flexible and fully \nreflect the important precedent set by the United States-Jordan Free \nTrade Agreement in the areas of labor and the environment.\n  I have prepared a chart that replicates article 6 of the United \nStates-Jordan Free Trade Agreement. It relates to the obligations of \nthe United States and Jordan with respect to labor. Let's look to the \nprovisions of that agreement and compare it with the text of the bill \nand the additions my amendment would make to that text.\n  Article 6.1 of the U.S. Jordan Agreement, is reflected in section (C) \nof the pending amendment. This amendment would establish as a principal \nnegotiating labor objective, the reaffirmation by parties of their \nobligations and commitments as members of the ILO--International Labor \nOrganization--in the context of labor negotiations and in the context \nof future trade agreements and a commitment to ensure that domestic \nlabor laws are consistent with the ILO Declaration on Fundamental \nPrinciples and Rights at Work.\n  What does that mean? It is a lot of language. It means, in the \ncontext of the negotiating process, that governments that are members \nof the ILO, of which there are 163--virtually everybody we are trading \nwith--must be mindful of the obligations that have already been assumed \nas members of that organization. That is a radical thought, isn't it? \nIt was signed on to by 163 countries.\n  We are saying, if you want to trade with us, we want you to live up \nto the commitment you made when you signed on. That is what we said to \nJordan. We said: Look, you are a member of the ILO and we are going to \nsay if you want to have a trading relationship with us--and we want it \nwith you--we want to have clear language in the agreement that says you \nmust live up to those obligations that you already signed on to. That \nis not exactly a radical point in this context. What are those \nobligations? To respect, promote, and realize fundamental labor rights, \nsuch as freedom of association, elimination of forced labor, abolition \nof child labor, and the elimination of discrimination with respect to \nemployment.\n  I hope I will not have to debate in this Chamber, as we begin the \n21st century, whether or not it is in the interest of the United \nStates, when we enter trading agreements, that somehow we are going to \nsit back and remain silent when it comes to discrimination, child \nlabor, and the right to promote respect or fundamental rights and the \nelimination of forced labor.\n  I don't think that is terribly radical for the U.S. in this century \nto be talking about having or advancing those standards in future \ntrading agreements. So if you are going to defeat this amendment, \nunderstand we are going to step back to what we agreed to 100 to 0 a \nfew months ago and to say to every trading partner we have, you can \ndisregard this--disregard forced labor, child labor, and the notions of \nfree association and the elimination or discrimination with respect to \nemployment. I don't know of a single Member of this body, Republican or \nDemocrat, who wants to be associated with a trading agreement that \nretreats from those very principles we have adopted in this body \nalready. We are not asking these countries to do anything more than \nthey are obligated to do as members of the ILO. That is all. This \nprovision is not currently included in the managers' principal \nnegotiating objectives, and I think it should be.\n\n  Let's look at the next provision. Article 6.2, embodied in section \n(E) of my amendment, namely, that the parties recognize it is \ninappropriate to seek a competitive trade advantage by relaxing or \nwaiving domestic labor laws. I hesitate to even explain this one. We \nare saying we don't want you to step back in your own domestic laws in \norder to create a more favorable trade environment. That would be so \ndamaging to our own country. We are saying, if you want to have an \nagreement with us, if you want to sell your products in America, you \ncannot start retreating on your own laws and putting American workers \nand American companies at a disadvantage.\n  We included this provision in the United States-Jordan agreement. We \nsaid we want a guarantee that you are not going to slip back and undo \nthe laws you already adopted. You don't have to trade with us, but if \nyou want to, we insist that you live up to the laws you have already \nwritten. That is not a radical thought.\n  Certainly, it seems to me that by excluding specifically that \nlanguage from this agreement, having specifically ratified the trading \nagreement only a few short months ago, that we would be sending a \nsignal with which I don't think many people in this Chamber would want \nto be associated. So it is extremely important.\n  What is the harm in including this provision? Do we support other \ncountries gaining a competitive advantage over U.S. industries, \nbusinesses, and manufacturers by ignoring their own laws? I don't think \nso. And I certainly hope not.\n  Article 6.3 of the Jordan agreement is embodied in section (D) of my \namendment; namely, to recognize the rights of parties to establish \ntheir own labor standards, but also the commitment to strive to ensure \nthat their laws are consistent with the core labor standards, and that \nwe should be trying to, over time, improve working conditions. Again, \nthis doesn't seem terribly radical to me.\n  Articles 6.4 and 6.5 of the Jordan agreement are already contained in \nthe underlying bill, as is 6.6, the definition of labor laws. Again, I \ncommend Senators Baucus and Grassley, and other members of the \ncommittee, for already taking the United States-Jordan Free Trade \nAgreement and including the provisions I have just mentioned.\n  So we have already set the precedent of taking the exact language of \nthe United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement and explicitly included \nsome of the language in this bill. The obvious omission of the articles \nI have just mentioned, involving the points I have raised, I think, \nwould be glaring in terms of our retreat from those principles we think \nare extremely important.\n  My comparison of the agreement with the underlying bill and with the \nprovisions of my amendment show that this bill does not incorporate all \nof provisions in the United States-Jordan agreement. I believe that \nonly with the adoption of this amendment Senator Lieberman and I have \noffered can we fairly assert that there is parity between this bill and \nthe United States-Jordan accord. Let's assume for the moment that you \nagree with the managers of the bill, that they have already \naccomplished Jordan parity. I might ask, what is the harm of accepting \nthis amendment, which I clearly have shown is no more or less than what \nis in the United States-Jordan agreement? It seems to me by taking this \nadditional language, we have done nothing to damage the statements made \nby the authors of this bill. I fail to see what great damage could be \ndone to this bill or to the President's negotiating authority with the \naddition of a few additional negotiating objectives. There are \ncurrently 27 pages of principal negotiating objectives in the pending \nmanagers amendment, covering 14 areas, such as trade barriers, \nservices, investment, intellectual property, e-commerce, agriculture, \nlabor, environment, and dispute settlement.\n\n  I don't think we believe that U.S. negotiators will be successful in \ndelivering on every single one of these objectives. But the point of \nincluding them is to encourage U.S. negotiators to pay attention to the \nissues of discrimination in employment, forced labor, and child labor. \nWe think those are worthwhile objectives that should be payed attention \nto. If you can pay attention to e-commerce, to investments, to \nintellectual property, tell me what your rationale is for taking a hike \nand walking away when job discrimination, child labor, and forced labor \nought to be on the table as well as part of our standards.\n  If it is OK to watch out for the banks, for the high-tech companies, \nhow about watching out for people who have no one else to watch out for \nthem and to insist that if you want to trade with America, sell your \ngoods in Nevada, or in Connecticut, or in Texas, or anywhere else, at \nleast you have to put these standards on the table.\n\n[[Page S4446]]\n\n  So we urge adoption of an amendment to incorporate these standards, \nto encourage our negotiators to pay attention to these objectives that \nhave been delineated, and send a signal to our trading partners that we \ncare about them--at least the Senate does. Republicans and Democrats \ncare about these issues. We care about trade, but we also care about \nworking people. We care about them at home and around the globe. If you \nare going to have the luxury of selling your products and services \nhere, for the Lord's sake, please pay attention to some things that go \nto human decency.\n  That is all we are talking about. That is why we truly believe our \nnegotiators should be attempting to achieve standards that already \napply. I suspect if I were offering this language for the first time, \npeople would say I am breaking new ground. I am not breaking new \nground.\n  In the year 2001, this Senate unanimously voted for the agreement. \nThis body, at the urging of President Bush, adopted the United States-\nJordan Free Trade Agreement, and the very standards written here are \nwritten into that law. Should we say to other countries we insist \nJordan do something, but the rest of you can just ignore these \nimportant standards?\n  As I said earlier, our partners in negotiation are not foolish; they \nare not naive; they are not stupid. They are going to know there is a \ndifference between this bill and the Jordan agreement. They are going \nto assume rightly--or, more importantly, wrongly--that there is a \nmessage sent by that difference. If we do not want to send such a \nsignal--and I do not believe the managers of this bill do--then I think \nwe should be careful with the language we incorporate here.\n  I believe, without the adoption of this amendment, the Jordan \nstandards will not be fully on the table for discussion, and we will \nhave missed a unique opportunity to insist they be a part of all future \nagreements.\n  Madam President, I urge the adoption of this amendment. It is not \ncomplicated. It is very straightforward. It is not precedent setting, \nand I think it is where America is. These are American values. If we \ncan add standards in every other imaginable area to protect every \nfinancial interest one can think of, should we not also try to do \nsomething about kids who get hired to produce some of the very clothes \npeople are wearing every day; shouldn't we see to it that job \ndiscrimination and forced labor are not going to produce the products \nwe sell on the shelves of our small communities and large cities of \nthis country? I do not think that these ideas are radical. They are \nabout as American as it can get. I hope my colleagues will think \nlikewise and support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, for the benefit of Senators, we likely \nwill not have a vote on the Dodd amendment until about 4 o'clock today. \nThe President, if not on the Hill, will be here shortly. A number of \npeople are going to be meeting with him.\n  Of course, at 2 o'clock we are going to be in recess for the awards \nceremony for President Reagan and Nancy Reagan, and we will not be able \nto vote until 4 o'clock.\n  I hope that when debate is completed, within whatever period of time \nit might take, we can have a vote at 4 o'clock, and if Senator Kyl, who \nI understand is going to offer the next amendment for the Republicans, \ncan debate his amendment for whatever time is left until 2 o'clock, and \nthen from 3 to 4, and we can have two votes at 4 o'clock. That is what \nwe would like to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I welcome the opportunity to discuss the \nDodd-Lieberman amendment. The amendment is very similar to the \nLieberman amendment yesterday in terms of its impact, though the \napproach is very different, so I will not belabor it. But I do want to \nmake several points that I think are relevant to the amendment.\n  The first point is in response to Senator Dodd's argument that the \nlanguage he wants to impose on all future trade negotiations is \nidentical to the language included in the Jordan free trade agreement \napproved unanimously by the Senate.\n  That argument assumes that one size fits all. It is similar to the \nargument I might make if I were going to try to buy a tire \nmanufacturing company after buying a set of its tires. I might argue: \nYou were willing to sell me a set of tires on credit without \ncollateral. Now that I want to buy your whole company, how come you \nwant collateral?\n  What worked for Jordan does not necessarily work elsewhere. I want to \nremind my colleagues that we rushed to approve the free trade agreement \nwith Jordan because it was an important foreign policy action regarding \na friend in one of the most unstable and difficult parts of the world \nin a time of emergency. It was in effect a foreign policy decision, not \na trade policy decision. Indeed, our imports from Jordan are twenty-\nfive one-thousandths of 1 percent of all imports coming into the United \nStates. Trade, while not unimportant, clearly did not drive this \nagreement.\n  Yet Senator Dodd's point is that if this language was good enough for \nJordan, why is it not good enough as a general principle for all \ntrading partners? That question kind of answers itself. If a signature \non a note to buy a set of tires at a car dealership is good enough, why \nisn't the signature good enough to buy a car, or the car company? \nBecause the situations are different.\n\n  The point is that a trade agreement with, say, Europe would be very \ndifferent than a trade agreement with Jordan. In terms of trade, a \ntrade agreement with Europe would be shooting with real bullets in \nterms of trade, jobs, and economic growth, because we already have a \nwell-established economic flow between the United States and Europe. \nSuch a trade agreement would not simply be about foreign policy. In \ncontrast, we are just starting to increase our economic flow between \nthe United States and Jordan, and the agreement quite clearly had a \ncritical foreign policy component. Of course trade with Jordan is not \nsolely about foreign policy. But to say that the principles we set \nforth in the Jordan agreement ought to be the principles that dictate \nevery agreement we enter into in the future simply is not a valid \nanalogy.\n  My second point is that the document before us is the result of long \nhours of labor by the Finance Committee. Now, I am not saying that the \nFinance Committee has cornered the market on wisdom or is infallible, \nbut I will say that the Committee held numerous hearings and had days \nof debate. Eventually, we worked out a bipartisan compromise on these \nissues, and the bill was reported 18 to 3. The trade promotion bill \napproved by Finance is the bill that is supported by the administration \nand is broadly supported by every major element of the American \neconomy.\n  In that bill, we achieved a balance that preserves the flexibility of \nthe administration to negotiate different trade agreements depending on \nthe particular circumstances. To suggest that somehow we do not deal \nwith child labor is simply not valid. Labor issues are a factor through \nthis bill. For the first time, we have an extensive negotiating \nobjective in a fast-track bill dealing with labor and environmental \nissues. In addition, we have included language that refers to ILO \nconventions both those we have ratified and those we have not--on \nforced labor, minimum employment age, and similar matters. However, the \nbill as reported provides flexibility, rather than assuming that one \nsize fits all.\n  I do not think there is one size that fits all in almost anything \nthat government does, which is why so many of our programs fail. But \neven if there were one size that fits all, to suggest that the Jordan \nFree Trade Agreement, an agreement with a country that produces twenty-\nfive one-thousandths of 1 percent of the products that we import, \nshould serve as the mandate for all future agreements simply does not \nstand up to scrutiny.\n  In the Finance Committee bill, we have dealt with labor. We have \ndealt with the environment. And in both areas we have set standards \nhigher than we have ever set before. To suggest that we ought to go \nback to one particular trade agreement approved in the midst of a \ncrisis in the Middle East with a country that sells twenty-five one-\nthousandths of 1 percent of all\n\n[[Page S4447]]\n\nitems we buy from the rest of the world, and make it the ironclad \nstandard for every trade negotiation we enter into again from now on, \nseems to me to be putting us in the kind of straitjacket that we would \nnot want to put any administration in. That is why the Dodd-Lieberman \namendment is opposed by a broad cross-section of American business. It \nis opposed by the administration. It is opposed by the chairman and \nranking member of the Finance Committee.\n  It is one thing to try to add to the bill a totally new matter that \nwe have not dealt with before. But it is another thing altogether to \ncome in now, on the floor of the Senate, and try to rewrite heart of \nthe bill based on one agreement entered into largely for foreign policy \nreasons with a key country who happens to sell us just twenty-five one-\nthousandths of 1 percent of all imports that we buy. Given the current \ntrade flows between the United States and Jordan, any error in the \nagreement probably would not cause profound economic damage to either \ncountry. Our trade flows are just not large enough. Our overall \nrelationship was and is important enough to approve that agreement. It \nwas a good thing to do, and I supported it. But that agreement cannot \nbecome the ironclad standard for every trade agreement from this point \non.\n  A few points to sum up. This amendment is unnecessary and undoes the \nbipartisan compromise on labor issues. It is not as if we do not deal \nwith labor issues in the bill before us. In fact, we dealt with them in \ngreat detail. They were negotiated extensively, and as a result we now \nhave strong bipartisan support for the bill. To come in now and rewrite \nthe labor section based on one trade agreement we approved during a \nforeign policy crisis with a country whose sales to the United States \nare minimal relative to total world sales is just not sound public \npolicy.\n  Secondly, the amendment proposes a one-size-fits-all approach that \ntakes the smallest size as the base. The fact is that right now, there \nare few countries in the world from whom we buy as few goods as we do \nfrom Jordan. More imports are bought by some cities in Texas in a month \nthan are bought by the whole Nation from Jordan in a year. We all hope \nthat the agreement will promote greater trade with Jordan. But the fact \nis that its sales to us will remain relatively small compared to the \nsales by the rest of the world. To use the Jordan Agreement as the \nstandard and override the bipartisan compromise in a bill written to be \nas coherent and flexible as possible does not make any sense.\n  We are not in the welfare business when it comes to trade. It is one \nthing for a trade agreement to help a government in Jordan. But when we \nare negotiating trade agreements with the Europeans, or the Japanese, I \nwant the agreements to help us. I want them to benefit from a trade \nagreement too, but my first concern is to make sure that we benefit. In \nthis case, the negotiation with Jordan was for Jordan. But any \nnegotiation with Europe or Japan should be for America. To apply a \nforeign policy-driven standard to such negotiations just would not be \nsound policy.\n\n  It boils down to one point: different negotiations require different \napproaches. Any negotiations with China, for example, would be very \ndifferent from our negotiation with Jordan, just as buying a set of \ntires on credit is a little bit different than buying the tire company. \nWhen you're buying the tire company, you should expect standards that \nare vastly different in terms of obtaining credit.\n  I hope we will defeat the Dodd-Lieberman amendment. It basically \ntries to change the very heart of the bipartisan trade promotion \nauthority bill through an amendment offered on the floor. This is the \nsecond time we are seeing such an effort. Yesterday, we had an effort \nby Senator Lieberman to undo the bill. Today, we have a second effort \nby Senator Dodd and Senator Lieberman to undo the bill. I hope the same \npeople who voted against the effort to undo it yesterday will vote \nagainst undoing it today.\n  I am proud of the Jordanian agreement, and I gave it my support. But \nit should not be the be-all, end-all standard for all future trade \nagreements. I do not think anybody thinks that it should. It may very \nwell be that some colleagues with a certain bent on some issues like \nthe language of the amendment better than the language of the bill. But \nthe language of the bill is something that has been very carefully \nnegotiated. So I would urge those who want a trade bill to vote against \nthis amendment.\n  Let me conclude by stressing one point of concern. One of the things \nthat has disturbed me for most of this year, and that has become very \nclear on this trade bill, is that increasingly people are not taking a \nproprietary position on issues that are of vital national importance. \nCertainly I am not trying to judge anybody else's motives, but it seems \nto me that we are seeing votes cast on this trade bill where, from the \noutside, it looks as if nobody is taking ownership of this critically \nimportant bill.\n  In the 24 years I have served in the Congress, I do not think I have \never witnessed a Finance Committee that could not defend its own \nlegislation on the floor. We are seeing efforts to make wholesale \nchanges that would undo the entire agreement. We have what is close to \npiracy where people are trying to load one more item on this wagon, and \nthe wagon is now rickety and on the verge of running into the ditch.\n  Anybody paying attention to this debate knows that trade promotion \nauthority at this point is almost dead. Now we have an effort to \nrewrite the heart of the bill's bipartisan language on labor, and \nimpose a standard that we negotiated with a country whose trade with \nthe United States is a fraction of the trade we have with the world. \nUnder such circumstances, I will not be willing to pay the already \ngreat tributes of health insurance for unemployed that is paid by \nworkers who do not have health insurance, and wage guarantees that are \nhigher for the beneficiaries than the average wage of working people in \nthe country.\n  If we truly want this bill to become law, then we are going to have \nto begin to take some ownership of the bill. We can start by defeating \nthis amendment. Well intended though it may be, it is harmful because \nit makes the assumption that one size fits all, using a standard \napplied in an agreement driven by foreign policy to a nation whose \nsales by any measure are minor in the context of overall United States \ntrade.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that once the debate concludes on \nthe Dodd amendment--we are attempting to have a time set for this vote \non the Dodd amendment. As I indicated earlier, we will be out of \nsession from 2 to 3 because of the President Reagan and Nancy Reagan \naward, and other things will take place at 3 p.m. We will vote at 4 \np.m.\n  Mr. GRAMM. On this matter or any motion related to it?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. While we are waiting, my good friend from Texas and I have \nworked on a lot of things together. We disagree on this particular \npoint.\n  For clarity purposes, we are talking about 27 pages of standards that \nare part of this trade promotion authority. We are talking about the \naddition of three principle negotiating objectives. It is not one-size-\nfits-all any more than it is one-size-fits-all on the other 27 pages of \nstandards. We are taking, what is already partly in the bill, to the \ncredit of the manager of this bill, several provisions in the United \nStates-Jordan Free Trade Agreement. My colleague said this was a \nforeign policy document, not a trading agreement. If that were the \ncase, why did we add provisions that expanded the concerns about child \nlabor and discrimination in the workplace, forced labor, the rights of \nfree association? If we merely wanted to do a foreign policy document, \nwe would have had a barebones agreement with Jordan, if it was just to \nsend a message that we wanted to be of some help. But, no, we \nincorporated collective wisdom and included the dynamic principles we \ncare about into the Jordan Agreement.\n  This is about America. It is not fair to Americans who lose their \njobs because of a trading agreement, where some other country can hire \nchildren, discriminate in the workplace or disregard the rights they \nsigned on to in the International Labor Organizations. That gives them \na tremendous advantage at the expense of America.\n\n[[Page S4448]]\n\n  Jordan may be small; these principles are not small. They may \nrepresent twenty-five one-thousandths of 1 percent, but forced labor, \nchild labor, discrimination in the workplace, and the right of \nassociation are not twenty-five one-thousandths of 1 percent of what \nAmericans care about. We care about these principles. And we fight for \nthem. We eliminated them in our own country years ago. We struggle \nevery day to make them work, even in the 21st century. We are saying if \nyou want the right to sell your goods in America, these are principles \nand objectives we think you ought to try to achieve. They are \nobjectives.\n  The idea that we would exclude these objectives--I just don't \nunderstand the rationale of that. With 27 pages of objectives in this \nbill, that include objectives on e-commerce, investment, and many other \nstandards--how about including some standards that apply to working \npeople? How about that? Is that so radical a thought?\n  We have already adopted by 100 to zero a United States-Jordan Free \nTrade Agreement establishing principles, adding 3 more principles, to a \n27-page set of negotiating objectives. Not every country is America. We \nare not foolish. We do not say you must absolutely meet the standard of \nthe United States when it comes to job discrimination, child labor, \nforced labor. It would be ludicrous if I were to write and say you must \nabsolutely achieve the same standards we have. That is unrealistic. We \nhave not done that.\n  If I cannot write this into a trade promotion authority, where do I \nwrite it? Do I have to do it agreement by agreement by agreement? Why \nnot just make this part of the principles of our negotiators? These are \nnot radical ideas. All that I am saying is that as part of the \nprincipal negotiating objectives, including the provisions you already \nadded from the free trade agreement with Jordan, these three Jordan \nstandards ought to be included. It is not too much to ask.\n\n  I appreciate my colleague from Texas and his colleagues on the \nFinance Committee spending time getting their ideas incorporated into \nthe bill. I am chairman of the Rules Committee, and a bill recently \ncame out of the Committee. I had 100-some-odd amendments; 43 were dealt \nwith on the floor. I was not offended. I prefer that everyone did \neverything I wanted them to do. I don't know a Senator who doesn't feel \nthat way. The reason we have 100 Members representing 50 States is, \npeople have a right to raise concerns and offer amendments. We are \ndoing that.\n  I commend the committee for what they have done. The Finance \nCommittee, under the leadership of Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley, \nhave done a terrific job. It is not easy. They have incorporated parts \nof the United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement. But they left out \nthree that I think are important. I am merely suggesting, and I regret \nthis requires a recorded vote. These are objectives, that is all. My \nColleague from Texas mentioned Europe. We are worried about trading \nwith Europe? Is this such a difficult job in Europe, with forced labor, \nchild labor, and employment discrimination? I don't think so. The \nproblems arise with smaller countries that are still emerging where the \nproblems exist.\n  If, by requiring our negotiators to raise these principles, we might \nimprove the quality of life of people in these developing countries, is \nthat such an outrageous suggestion? Is that something that America \nshould retreat from as a nation that takes pride in the fact we try to \nrecognize the rights of all people? When our Founding Fathers wrote the \ncornerstone documents of this country, they didn't talk about these \nrights, those inalienable rights, only occurring if you manage to make \nit to America. Those inalienable rights are rights that are endowed by \nthe Creator to all people. In the 21st century, to try to slow down the \nabolition of child labor, forced labor, job discrimination, and to \nsuggest we ought to keep it out of this bill, this trade promotion \nauthority, I don't think reflects who we are as a people. It is a step \nback from where we are as a people.\n  This is not one size fits all. We know fully well as we enter trading \nagreements, there will be nations that will do a better job or not as \ngood a job in the areas I have mentioned. I don't think it is so \nradical to ask our negotiators to have these, along with the other 27 \npages of standards. Every business interest in America is guaranteeing \ntheir interests are going to be negotiated when it comes to reaching \nagreements. What about working people? Why can't they be on these 27 \npages, as they have in many places? I don't think it is a lot to ask by \nadding these three.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this effort. The role of the full \nSenate is not to be a rubber stamp. What I am offering I think is more \nof an oversight. The managers were dealing with a House version of the \nbill, and they added the three provisions of the Jordan agreement, and \nthey left these three out. I think it is the intent of the managers to \ninclude the principal negotiating standards of the Jordan agreement. \nAnd really denouncing this because the country we negotiated with was \nsmall--these principles are not small; the fact we negotiated with a \nsmall country does not mean the principles are not large in the minds \nof the American people. We ought to make them principles, regardless of \nthe size of the country with which we negotiate. It is a great tribute \nto the nation of Jordan, a small struggling country, one of the most \ncrisis-ridden areas in the world, that they could live with these \nstandards as part of the negotiation we entered with them. If a small, \nstruggling country can accept this, representing one tiny percentage of \nour trading partners, then certainly larger countries should do no \nless.\n  Therefore, the very argument of my colleague from Texas when he says \nthis is like arguing about the price of a tire when you try to buy GM--\nchild labor, forced labor, job discrimination are not tires. Those are \nnot just small consumer items in the list of human principles and \nvalues. We think they are important principles and they ought to be \ngiven a status--more than a sale of a tire on a car.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in this and support this language and \nput it in the bill. It makes it a stronger bill, a better bill, a bill \nwe can be proud of when we negotiate trading agreements in the future \nwith other countries.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I listened very carefully to my good \nfriend from Connecticut. I imagine people, while they are listening to \nhim, are wondering what is this debate all about, really? Certainly \nnone of us want to promote child labor. All of us want to discourage \nchild labor. All of us, as Americans, with the values we have as \nAmericans, want to promote our American values.\n  The question is, what is in this bill, what is not, what are we \ndebating, and what are we not debating? Essentially, as I listen to my \ngood friend, the Senator is arguing for the bill. What the Senator \nsuggests is virtually what is in the bill. There is really not any \ndifference. When I listen to the Senator, he makes it sound as if there \nis a huge difference, but there really is not.\n  First of all, we do incorporate the Jordan provisions in the \nunderlying trade promotion authority fast-track bill that are labor and \nenvironmental standards. Let's remember, the Jordan agreement is an \nactual trade agreement; whereas today we are debating whether to give \nthe President authority--along with passing the trade adjustment \nassistance and Andean Trade Adjustment Act--whether to give the \nPresident the authority to negotiate future trade agreements under a \ncertain procedure.\n  There is a difference between a current, existing agreement that was \nnegotiated--that is Jordan, on the one hand--and future agreements \nwhich have not been negotiated on the other.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is essentially saying the standards, \nexact language as in the Jordan standard, essentially should be the \nlanguage that applies to environmental and labor provisions and dispute \nsettlement provisions in all future trade agreements. Again, I think it \nis important to note that there is a difference between what is \nactually negotiated in an agreement and future trade agreements. That \ndifference is very important.\n\n  No two trade disputes are exactly alike. No countries are exactly \nalike. The matters over which they negotiate are different. Each \nnegotiation involves different issues, different complexities, and \nthese require us to be\n\n[[Page S4449]]\n\ncreative, to adapt, and not take--the common phrase is the cookie-\ncutter approach.\n  I also want to react to the argument of my friend from Connecticut \nwho implied that ILO negotiating objectives are not in the bill or \nnegotiating to reduce child labor is not in the bill. That is not \naccurate. It is in the bill.\n  There are three categories of objectives. This sounds a bit arcane. \nOne is principal objectives, overall objectives, and then other \nobjectives. But the language in the bill makes it clear that each of \nthe objectives has the same priority.\n  You may ask why they are not all in the same category. I am not sure \nI can answer that question, but the operating principle is that the \nlanguage in the bill provides that each of these objectives, although \nthey might be in different categories--one of them includes ILO labor--\nis a core labor standard. It also includes--promote respect for \nworkers' rights, the rights of children consistent with core labor \nstandards of the ILO, and understanding of the relationship between \ntrade and workers.\n\n  The main point, though, is respect for workers' rights and the rights \nof children consistent with core labor standards of the ILO. That is an \nobjective and it is an objective that has equal weight compared with \nall the other objectives. It is in the bill. To say it is not is simply \nnot accurate.\n  In summary, the concerns the Senator from Connecticut voices are met. \nThey are in the bill. They have equal weight.\n  One can argue: If it is in the bill, why not just accept what the \nSenator has suggested? We are in this unfortunate situation, though, \nwhere we have this bill put together, and it is a bipartisan bill. It \npassed the committee 18 to 3.\n  If we are to have trade adjustment assistance enacted into law, which \nI think is the most important part of this bill, and if we are going to \nhave the Andean Trade Preference Act extended, which is very important \nto South American countries, and if we are going to have fast-track \nauthority, which I think is necessary for these very complex trade \nnegotiations, otherwise other countries will not enter into \nnegotiations with the United States, this amendment has to be defeated.\n  The substance of what the Senator talks about is already covered in \nthe bill. It is substantially covered in the bill almost to the degree \nthe Senator wants. But to adopt the Senator's amendment will cause this \nagreement to unravel. It is already very precarious.\n  I remind my colleagues the other body passed the fast-track part of \nthis legislation by one vote. I know there are some Senators in the \nbody who do not want to pass fast-track legislation. They are opposed \nto it. But a very significant majority of Senators wants to pass \nlegislation. They are in favor of it. If this amendment were to \nsucceed, due to the very strong opposition to this amendment by a very \nsubstantial number, if not unanimously, of the Members of the other \nside of the aisle, this amendment could unravel this bill. It is a \ndelicate balance. That phrase is used over and over again, but I can \ntell you it is a delicate balance.\n  I wish I could help my friend and accept the amendment, but for all \nintents and purposes, to take care of all his concerns, if he were to \npush a little further, it could very well push us over the edge. And I \ndo not think we should take that risk.\n  We cannot let perfection be the enemy of the good. We can strive for \nperfection, but if we get too close to trying to get perfection it \ncauses unintended consequences elsewhere.\n  I urge my colleague to remember it is a very delicate balance we have \nbefore us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I will be very brief. My colleague and \nfriend from Montana has been very patient. He has an awfully difficult \njob chairing this important committee and dealing with the various \nissues that are raised.\n  As I said at the outset of my remarks, I commend the committee for \nits effort.\n  I thought this might be an amendment that would be easily accepted. I \ndid not expect it to evoke the kind of debate we have had from my \ncolleague from Texas because it really should not be a huge debate. My \ncolleague from Montana is right, we should just accept this and move \non. I will tell you why, very simply. Again, not to be arcane, but the \nlanguage of the bill, on pages B-4 and B-5, starting at the bottom of \npage B-4, says:\n\n       to promote respect for worker rights and the rights of \n     children consistent with core labor standards of the \n     International Labor Organization (as defined in section \n     2113(2)). . . .\n\n  Section 2113(2) defines those labor standards. They include:\n\n       the right of association;\n       the right to organize and bargain collectively;. . . .\n\n  It says:\n\n       a minimum age for the employment of children; and\n       acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum wages \n     [and the like].\n\n  That is very different from the ILO standards.\n  So the ILO standards, as defined in section 2113(2), are different \nfrom the ILO standards. The ILO standards say:\n\n       the effective abolition of child labour; and\n       the elimination of discrimination. . . .\n\n  ``The elimination of discrimination'' is not included in section \n2113. So they are different.\n  I thought the amendment would have just been accepted. It says: ILO \n``as defined.'' It is different from ILO. That is the reason we wanted \nto use the language as the principals in the Jordan agreement, because \nour trading partners are not foolish. They will understand there is a \ndifference.\n  So ``the effective abolition of child labour'' and ``the elimination \nof discrimination'' are in the ILO standards but not in the standards \nwe are going to negotiate. So that is the reason we offer the \namendment.\n  I really expected it, as I say, to be something that did not provoke \na significant debate. But there is a distinction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is absolutely correct. And as the Senator \nwell knows, in this ongoing evolution here, we have worked with the ILO \ndefinitions under the extension of GSP. And GSP is also in this bill, \nand that is the Generalized System of Preferences.\n  The question is: What are the ILO standards? I am sure the Senator \nknows better than any other Senator that the ILO standards were changed \nin 1998. The earlier version was enacted or stated in the early 1950s. \nWe, after great discussion, I might add, were able to get a modern, \nupdated ILO definition in GSP, although it is not in this bill.\n  My thought is, when we are in conference, that is an issue we can \naddress. The Senator raises a good point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, as I understand it, in the unanimous \nconsent agreement, we will come back to this debate, and there will be \n5 minutes, where the time will be equally divided, to make summations \nbefore the actual vote occurs.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I do ask unanimous consent that once \ndebate concludes on the Dodd amendment, the amendment be set aside to \nrecur at 3:55 p.m. today; that at 3:55 p.m. there be 5 minutes \nremaining for debate, with the time equally divided and controlled in \nthe usual form; with no second-degree amendment in order prior to a \nvote in relation to the amendment; and that upon the use or yielding \nback of time, without further intervening action or debate, the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if this debate concludes before 2 o'clock, \nSenator Kyl will come and offer an amendment. That debate will continue \nuntil 2 o'clock, and then from 3 to 4 he will also be debating that. We \nhope that during that period of time we can complete the deliberations \non the Kyl amendment and also set a time, shortly after the Dodd vote, \nso we can have two votes a little after 4 o'clock. But we ought to see \nhow the Kyl amendment goes before we make that decision.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I do not know if other Members want to be\n\n[[Page S4450]]\n\nheard on this amendment. I am prepared to yield the floor, and I will \nsuggest the absence of a quorum shortly, unless the Chair, obviously, \nwants to do something. If others want to speak, or if Senator Kyl wants \nto come over and start his debate, I am perfectly amenable to that.\n  If other Members, all of a sudden, want to come and discuss the Dodd \namendment, the Dodd-Lieberman amendment, there will be a period to do \nso before we actually get to a vote, I assume, at 4 o'clock.\n  With that, Madam President, I thank, again, the distinguished \nchairman of the committee and the ranking member and their staffs for \ntheir patience. They demonstrate great patience in these debates, and I \nthank them for that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/16/senate-section/article/S4450-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 3167\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, on four occasions since September \n11, 2001, I have come to the Chamber to recommend to my colleagues that \nthe Senate immediately consider the establishment of a national \ncommission concerning the events of September 11, 2001.\n  My request has been based on no motivation but the belief that the \nAmerican people deserve honest answers and that the only means of \npreventing another terrorist attack on the United States is a fair, \nhonest, and dispassionate view of what happened and what didn't happen, \nwhat was known, and what should have occurred.\n  The historic basis of such an honest approach to the tragedy of New \nYork and the Pentagon is overwhelming. Ten days after December 7, 1941, \nFranklin Delano Roosevelt recognized that he could not reassure the \nAmerican people about their Government and could not unify the country \nfor the war ahead unless he gave them an explanation about what failed \nat Pearl Harbor. Lyndon Johnson recognized almost immediately the same \nneed to reassure the American people about the operations of their \nGovernment and the integrity of its officers after the assassination of \nPresident Kennedy in 1963. Ronald Reagan drew upon the same precedent \nestablishing the Challenger Commission to assure the American people \nthat they would receive an honest answer to prevent any recurrence in \nthe loss of life in the Challenger.\n  What I recommend has not only had precedents, it was the rule. \nDemocratic and Republican administrations, for a century, have seen the \nneed to assure the American people about the operation of their \nGovernment and that indeed we were a confident enough people under the \nrule of law to face honestly our own failings--all based on the belief \nthat the only means of assuring that there would not be a recurrence \nwould be to discover the reasons for the failings of the past. On those \nfour occasions, there have been reasons to postpone, excuses to not \nact, and the debate has continued.\n  The debate continued after it was revealed that the FBI had in its \npossession Zacarias Moussaoui, a Frenchman of Moroccan descent who, in \nAugust, was discovered in a flight training school. The Justice \nDepartment denied access to his computer. The debate continued after it \nwas learned that French intelligence had warned American intelligence \nofficials that they had knowledge of a possible terrorist plot to \nhijack aircraft.\n  The debate continued after it was learned that Philippine \nintelligence and law enforcement authorities had warned United States \nGovernment officials of possible targeting of American aircraft.\n  The debate continued after it was revealed that the FBI office in \nPhoenix had written a memorandum warning that large numbers of \nsuspicious individuals were seeking pilot and security training at \nAmerican flight schools. The debate continued.\n  The debate has to end. Revelations that the Central Intelligence \nAgency might have intercepted suspicious communications as early as \nlast July indicating a possible terrorist attack on American \ninstallations or facilities and that indeed the President of the United \nStates himself was informed of this information should effectively end \nany debate.\n\n  I do not rise to cast blame or aspersions on any individuals or \ninstitutions. I believe the officials of this Government have acted \nhonorably, and I would never believe any American institution or \nindividual, for a moment, would not have done everything possible to \ndefend the people of this country if sufficiently warned.\n  Something is wrong. The United States of America has a defense \nestablishment of over $330 billion a year. Public accounts estimate \nintelligence budgets at over $30 billion a year. The heart of our \ngreatest city was struck, the center of our military power was hit by \n19 people, funded by $250,000. Something is wrong.\n  I do not know whether there has been a failure to collect \nintelligence or an inability to share intelligence. I don't know \nwhether law enforcement and intelligence agencies have failed to work \ntogether. I don't know whether they acted properly and a reasoned, \nrational person never could have put these pieces together. I don't \nknow. But neither does anybody else in this Government.\n  It was always going to be difficult to face the families of those who \nlost their lives on September 11. It just became impossible. Without \nsome dispassionate and honest review of what was known by this \nGovernment and its agencies, without an honest assessment of how \nagencies performed and coordinated their activities, without a \ndispassionate assessment of what failed, not only can we not look the \nvictims' families in the eyes and tell them, ``Your Government met its \nresponsibility,'' we cannot assure this country that it will not happen \nagain.\n  Franklin Delano Roosevelt didn't have a Pearl Harbor commission, Earl \nWarren didn't have a commission on the Kennedy assassination, and \nRonald Reagan didn't have a Challenger commission to assign blame. It \nwasn't about partisanship. It was about assuring the American people of \nthe future that the Government had taken actions to assure it would \nnever happen again.\n\n  Who here would assure one of their constituents in any of our States \nthat we have the confidence or the simple good judgment to undertake \nsuch a review?\n  On March 21 of this year, the Governmental Affairs Committee voted on \nS. 1867, introduced by Senators Lieberman, McCain, Grassley, and \nmyself, a bill to establish the National Commission on Terrorist \nAttacks upon the United States. That bill is ready for consideration. \nWhat reason do we offer for not acting immediately? What is the excuse \nto the American people?\n  I trust that based on current revelations, law enforcement officials \nof the Justice Department, intelligence officials of the National \nSecurity Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency, and, indeed, the \nnational leadership of\n\n[[Page S4451]]\n\nthe White House itself will now end all excuses, stop all efforts to \nblock this legislation or similar reviews, and join with us in one \ncomplete analysis of what happened, what went wrong, what was known, \nand, most importantly, what we do about it.\n  There will be those who say this is a matter for the Senate and its \nIntelligence Committee. This is a matter for this Government and all of \nits representatives. Some secret analysis by a committee reviewing one \naspect of the actions of the U.S. Government on classified material \nmaking recommendations unto itself is not what the country requires. \nEvery element, every aspect of the Government should be reviewed on how \nit acted and how it should be changed, including this Congress.\n  I suggest a reserve of analysis of no one and nothing from law \nenforcement, to the national intelligence community, to the executive \nbranch, to the operations of this Congress itself. We all share the \nresponsibility for the future of the country. We all share the \nresponsibility for the security of our communities and our families. An \nhonest analysis must involve all of us, including this Congress.\n  Madam President, I hope the President of the United States and the \nrelevant agencies accept this invitation to work with us. This \nlegislation should be offensive to no one and, if successful, provide \nreassurance to everyone. There may be attempts to delay this \nlegislation and put this review off for months or years.\n  History is a demanding master, and ultimately it governs all of us. \nHistory will never settle for the excuse that we are not ready or it \nneeded more time or it would offend someone. History will demand an \nanswer of how the greatest Nation on Earth, with the greatest \nintelligence and military capabilities ever conceived by man, was laid \nvulnerable by a small band of terrorists who brought destruction to our \ngreatest city and the very seat of our military authority. History will \ndemand it, and we should answer it.\n  It is not the responsibility of another generation to revisit this \nmatter in 20 years. It is not the responsibility of our successors to \nreturn to this in another decade. The responsibility for the safety of \nthe country and governance of its institutions is ours, and this \nlegislation is ours. It should be adopted.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak up to 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I rise to join with my colleague from New Jersey who \njust addressed the Senate in regard to a proposal that he, Senator \nMcCain, Senator Grassley, and I introduced some time ago which would \ncreate an independent commission to investigate the horrific attacks \nagainst the United States on September 11, 2001, a day that truly also \nwill live in infamy, a day of extraordinary suffering, of heroism, of \nanguish, of insecurity, of ultimately unity and strength for the United \nStates of America.\n  The idea of this commission which Senator McCain, Senator Torricelli, \nSenator Grassley, and I introduced was to build on the precedents of \nhistory, particularly the other day of infamy, Pearl Harbor, which was \nfollowed both by congressional investigations and by an independent \ncommission to review what happened and what could have been done, if \nanything, to prevent the attacks from happening, and what did we learn \nfrom Pearl Harbor and all that surrounded it that would enable us to \nraise our defenses so that nothing such as that would ever happen \nagain.\n  Sadly, history has turned in a way to put us in a similar position to \nwhere the previous generation of Americans was at the outset of World \nWar II. We were attacked on September 11, 2001, with an inhumane \nbrutality and a cunning lack of respect for human life that was \nshocking.\n  The other reality that was unsettling, of course, was that in the \nliteral sense, the American government, the great national security \napparatus that we have established, intelligence, foreign policy, and \nlaw enforcement, failed to protect the American people from the attacks \nagainst us on September 11 of last year.\n  Perhaps there was nothing more that could have been done to prevent \nthem. We understand that in an open society such as ours, a society \npremised on freedom as our highest value, if we are dealing with an \ninhumane enemy, lacking in regard for their own lives, let alone the \nlives of Americans, then there is only so much that can be done to stop \nsuch attacks.\n  Yet we have had the gnawing question: Was there something that could \nhave been done to prevent the attacks of September 11? Understanding \nthat hindsight is always clearer than foresight, is there something we \ncan learn from what happened on September 11 to strengthen ourselves, \nto raise our guard, to do whatever is humanly possible to make sure \nthat nothing like those terrorist attacks ever happens again to the \nAmerican people? That was the purpose that my three colleagues and I \nhad in introducing this bill to create an independent, nonpolitical \ncitizens commission to conduct the broadest possible review of what \nhappened on September 11: why did it happen and what can we do to make \nsure it never happens again?\n  In the last couple of weeks, there have been a series of revelations, \nbeginning with FBI disclosure of warnings, memos last year, in which \nagents of the FBI had reason to be concerned about activity of people \nin this country, particularly at the flight training schools, wondering \nwhether that might be related to a potential terrorist attack, linking \nit particularly in some minds to Osama bin Laden, who we knew had \nalready struck us in foreign places.\n  Add to this now the disclosure that President Bush received, as part \nof a daily intelligence briefing, indication that the Central \nIntelligence Agency had similar words from a different point of view; \nthe FBI and CIA apparently never coming together in one place to reach \nthe critical mass that would have engendered the kind of action that \nlooking back, painfully now, we wish someone had taken.\n  The reason why my colleagues and I introduced this bill creating an \nindependent commission, it seems to me, is based on the revelations and \ndisclosures of the last few weeks and are now even more significant and \nmore compelling. Our anxiety about what happened and whether something \ncould have been done by people working for the U.S. Government to have \nprevented the horrific acts of September 11, and the suffering that \nresulted therefrom becomes even more gnawing today.\n  I note the presence of one of the three cosponsors of this \nlegislation, the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley. I indicate to my \ncolleagues that I soon intend, I hope with my cosponsors, to find an \nearly opportunity to submit our proposal for an independent commission \nto review the events of September 11, and what was learned from them, \nas an amendment to a bill in the Senate. I think the moment is here.\n  I received a call about 2 weeks ago from some of the survivors and \nsome of the families of victims of September 11 who had heard about the \ncommission proposal. They are coming actually the first or second week \nof June--I do not remember the exact date--to lobby Members of the \nSenate and House to adopt such legislation so that the questions that \ngnaw at them because of the losses they have suffered of a spouse, of a \nchild, of a relative, a friend, will, to the best of our ability, be \nanswered.\n\n  This commission proposal, I am pleased to say, received a hearing \nbefore the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. It was reported out \nby the committee. I do think, in light of these events, that the \ngreater knowledge we have now of what may have been known before \nSeptember 11, it becomes even more urgent to move forward on it, and it \nis why I hope to soon join with my cosponsors in offering it as an \namendment to a pending bill.\n  I understand, of course, that the Intelligence Committees of the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S4452]]\n\nand House are proceeding with investigations related to the attacks of \nSeptember 11. I respect those committees. I support the investigations \nthey are conducting. But the idea in the commission proposal we have \nmade is broader than that. In the first instance, it is an independent, \nnonpartisan, nonpolitical citizens commission that would conduct this \ninvestigation and would have the credibility that would go with that.\n  Secondly, its purview is beyond intelligence, beyond whatever \nfailures may have occurred in the intelligence apparatus in the U.S. \nGovernment. It will go to law enforcement. It will go to the military. \nIt will go to foreign policy. It will go to America's communications \npolicy. I think, in that sense, it will supplement and complement the \ncritical work the Intelligence Committees are doing.\n  Again, I go back to, unfortunately, the comparable event which was \nthe attack against Americans at Pearl Harbor. There was not just one \ninvestigation by one or two committees of Congress; there were \ncongressional investigations and there were independent citizen \ncommission investigations. That is what I think the events of September \n11, and particularly the disclosures of the last few weeks, cry out for \ntoday if we are to learn in the fullest sense the lessons of recent \nhistory and apply them so we can better secure the future of the \nAmerican people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I would like to respond to some of the \ncomments which my colleague, the Senator from Connecticut, just made, \nif he has a moment to remain. I caught some of what he said, and I \nthink I caught the gist of what he said.\n  I want to be very clear about something. I am a member of the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence, and therefore I might be perceived to \nhave a bit of a conflict of interest since, as the Senator from \nConnecticut noted, we have an ongoing investigation. The investigation \nhas been authorized by the House and Senate committees. We are in the \nmiddle of that investigation now and plan to have a report ready around \nthe end of the year as to the full panoply of circumstances and events \nsurrounding the tragedy of September 11, with recommendations for what \nshould be done in the future to ensure, to the extent possible, that \nevent not be repeated, or that we be able to prevent it if it is at all \npossible.\n  I am troubled by a couple of the comments the Senator made, and I \nwanted him to hear this and respond, if he would like. Here is what \ntroubles me: I was accosted by numerous members of the media this \nmorning breathlessly asking me, as a member of the Intelligence \nCommittee, what I thought about the fact that the President had been \nbriefed that terrorists, al-Qaida terrorists, were going to hijack \nairplanes and didn't this require us to immediately begin some kind of \ninvestigation, fill in the blanks. Some of them sounded a little bit \nlike what the Senator from Connecticut is suggesting.\n  That would be the wrong thing to do, in my view, and there are about \nthree reasons why.\n  First of all, let us be clear: The President was not briefed in some \nemergency situation that he should expect al-Qaida terrorists or any \nother terrorists to hijack an airplane and fly it into the World Trade \nCenter. Nothing like that happened. So we should be very careful before \nwe begin calling for new mechanisms for investigating the September 11 \nevents when we already have a good investigation underway based upon \ninformation such as that. It is incorrect information.\n  I know the Senator from Connecticut is a very thoughtful person and \nwould never predicate his call for this activity on that kind of \ninformation. Let me hasten to say I know that is not what he is saying. \nPart of the impetus for that, and I am afraid part of the emotional \nreaction, could be to find a home in a suggestion like this of the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n  To clarify the record--I think the administration will clarify it in \nan appropriate way at some time soon--let me put it this way: Every \nmorning, the President of the United States receives a briefing from \nthe intelligence community. As the President just advised some Members, \nif he had been briefed about a threat that anybody thought was specific \nand credible and we could do anything about, does anybody doubt that he \nwouldn't have reacted in the strongest possible way? I know the Senator \nfrom Connecticut joins me, and everybody else, in answering that \nquestion: Of course he would have reacted.\n  That should give the first clue about what was actually done. Each \nmorning he receives a briefing. It should come as no surprise that \nduring one of those briefings when the subject is terrorists, al-Qaida \nwas one of the terrorist groups that was mentioned at that time. \nTerrorists have been hijacking airplanes for over 40 years. It is not \nexactly big, breathless news that this could happen, hypothetically. \nThat is a far cry from someone suggesting there is credible, specific \ninformation about a particular threat of hijacking.\n  We all need to take a deep breath. I particularly suggest these \nremarks apply to our friends in the media. Calm down a minute. Don't \njump to any conclusions about what the President was told. Don't take \nfrom that the intelligence community somehow messed up by not following \nthrough or taking sufficiently seriously some kind of threat. That is \nnot the way it happened.\n  The point the Senator from Connecticut makes, with which I totally \nagree, is there is a lot of information out there that we need to put \ntogether to tell the story about what did happen and determine what \nkinds of changes, if any, we need to make in the future.\n  My only concern about his suggestion is two things: One, as the media \nleaks themselves demonstrate, if it comes out in little dribbles and \ndrabs of incomplete bits of information, it is likely to be \ncounterproductive and to certainly delay the process of putting it all \ntogether in a coherent way to present a set of facts to the American \npeople on which conclusions can be based.\n  Since so much of this has to be done in a classified setting, the \nplace for it is the Intelligence Committee. It will be difficult to \neven have public hearings to discuss a lot of this while we are right \nin the middle of, one, the war on terror and, two, prosecutions in \nwhich the FBI is engaged.\n  Second, it is important the investigation already underway, which is \nalready putting demands on the time of the Justice Department and the \nCIA, not be further complicated by other investigations which would put \nfurther demands upon these peoples' time at the very time they are \npreparing for these prosecutions and conducting the war on terror.\n  Those are thoughts I have with respect to the Senator's suggestion. I \nwill appreciate the opportunity to visit with him more about them. I \nwanted the opportunity to express those concerns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair. Of course, I thank my dear friend \nand colleague from Arizona. Let me respond briefly to his thoughtful \nand thoroughly appropriate comments.\n  First, to restate: the proposal I am talking about for an independent \ncommission was made some time ago. We held a hearing on it in the \nSenate Governmental Affairs Committee, and it has been reported out and \nessentially is ready for action by the Senate.\n  We have said all along we respect and support the work the \nIntelligence Committees are doing. As in previous cases, such as Pearl \nHarbor, post-Pearl Harbor, the country would benefit from an \nindependent citizen commission inquiry--not accusatory but \ninvestigatory--which would have the power to obtain information which \nwould have the authority to go into classified, secret session because \nof the matters being considered. This would likely extend beyond the \nintelligence function to law enforcement, to foreign policy, to \nmilitary policy, to immigration policy--anything that might have \naffected\n\n[[Page S4453]]\n\nand contributed to the attack of September 11.\n  My point today is that the leaks, the disclosures of the last couple \nof weeks, both from the FBI and now the indication of the CIA briefing \nto the President, just reinforces within me the fact that we need such \nan independent commission. In fact, in some ways it may argue even in a \ndifferent more forceful sense for such a commission. If we don't have a \ncomprehensive, public, official investigation, I fear leaks related to \nSeptember 11 and the tragedy that occurred will continue for months, \nfor years. We ought to try as best we can through the intelligence \ncommittee investigations and through such an independent commission to \nanswer all the questions that can possibly be answered.\n  That is what I intend, I believe, with my colleagues: To offer this \nas an amendment at an early time.\n  I respond to the points the Senator from Arizona makes about the most \nrecent disclosures on briefing to the President. They are quite on \npoint. It is very important not to overreact to them. For the record, I \nhave not in this case received any of the classified briefings. I speak \nbased on publicly available sources in the media. Those are the reports \nof the various FBI memos that went into Washington and now this report \nof the CIA briefing of the President.\n  What truly troubles me and gnaws at me is not the President's \nbehavior because, of course, if he had any indication in the briefing \nthat an attack was imminent, he would have acted as Commander in Chief. \nMy concern is about the quality of the information working its way up \nto the President as Commander in Chief.\n  More particularly, was there any point of connection between what we \nnow know are the FBI memo's concerns about Moussoui's conduct in \nMinnesota at the flight school, the agent in Phoenix who had broader \nconcerns, very acute, and unfortunately turns out to be right to the \npoint, did those intersect on anyone's desk with the information that \nthe CIA had which was the basis of a longer briefing to the President \nlast summer in a way that would have led anyone to reach a more \nspecific conclusion that they could have taken to the President?\n  I agree, there ought not be an overreaction. My reaction is, as I \nstated, as to whether all the systems underneath the President, as \nCommander in Chief, worked together as we would want them to, to be \nable to alert him to what was about to happen. And in a more direct \nsense, was this in any measure preventable?\n  I even ask the question with a sense of humility because I know the \ndifficulty in an investigation of this kind. It is that which motivates \nme, and I am sure would motivate a commission and Intelligence \nCommittees more than any second-guessing on the President's behavior.\n  I know we have used our time. I thank my colleague. I look forward to \ntalking to him off the floor, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/16/senate-section/article/S4453-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today out of respect for and to \nspeak on behalf of the people I represent in New York. I am especially \nmindful today of the memory of those whom we lost on September 11, \ntheir family members and their loved ones who, until this very minute, \ngrieve for those who were sacrificed in the terrible attacks we \nsuffered on September 11.\n  We have learned something today that raises a number of serious \nquestions. We have learned that President Bush had been informed last \nyear, before September 11, of a possible plot by those associated with \nOsama bin Laden to hijack a U.S. airliner. The White House says the \nPresident took all appropriate steps in reaction to that warning. The \nWhite House further says that the warning did not include any specific \ninformation, such as which airline, which date, or the fact that a \nhijacked plane would be used as a missile. Those are all very important \nissues, worthy of exploration by the relevant committees of Congress. \nThe goal of such an examination should not be to assign blame but to \nfind out all of the facts.\n  I also support the effort by Senators Lieberman and McCain to \nestablish an independent national commission on terrorist attacks upon \nthe United States. That was reported out of the Senate Governmental \nAffairs Committee in March. Such a panel can help assure the people of \nNew York and America that every facet of this national tragedy will be \nfully examined in hopes that the lessons we learn can prevent disasters \nin the future.\n  I very much appreciated the remarks by Senator Lieberman in the \nChamber earlier today, indicating his desire to offer this proposal \nthat he and Senator McCain have put forth as an amendment at the \nearliest possible time.\n  Because we must do all we can to learn the hard lessons of experience \nfrom our past and apply them to safeguard our future, I also support \nthe call by the distinguished majority leader, Mr. Daschle, for the \nrelease of the Phoenix FBI memorandum and the August intelligence \nbriefing to congressional investigators, because, as Senator Daschle \nsaid this morning, the American people need to get the facts.\n  I do know some things about the unique challenges faced by the person \nwho assumes the mantle of Commander in Chief. I do not for a minute \ndoubt that any individual who holds that responsibility is the only \nperson who can truly know the full scope of the burdens of that office. \nJust the other day there was a survey about the most difficult job in \nAmerica, the most stressful position. It should not come as any \nsurprise that President of the United States ranked at the top.\n  I have had the privilege of witnessing history up close, and I know \nthere is never any shortage of second guessers and Monday morning \nquarterbacks, ready to dismantle any comment or critique any action \ntaken or not taken. Having experienced that from the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue, I for one will not play that game, especially in \nthese circumstances. I am simply here today on the floor of this \nhallowed Chamber to seek answers to the questions being asked by my \nconstituents, questions raised by one of our newspapers in New York \nwith the headline ``Bush Knew.''\n  The President knew what? My constituents would like to know the \nanswer to that and many other questions, not to blame the President or \nany other American but just to know, to learn from experience, to do \nall we can today to ensure that a 9-11 never happens again.\n  If we look back, we know that the Phoenix FBI memorandum in early \nJuly raised very specific issues about certain people of Arab heritage \nwho were taking flying lessons. For what purpose? To do what?\n  We know that shortly after there was at least the news report of the \nAttorney General sending a directive that people of the Justice \nDepartment should no longer fly commercially. In fact, the Attorney \nGeneral took a chartered plane for his own vacation.\n  We know that in August additional information came forward, including \nwhat we learned today about the intelligence briefing provided to the \nPresident.\n  The pain of 9-11 is revisited in thousands of homes in New York and \naround our country every time that terrible scene of those planes going \ninto those towers and then their collapse appears on television. It is \nrevisited in our minds every time we see a picture of the cleanup at \nGround Zero. It is revisited every time the remains of a fallen hero \nare recovered, as they were yesterday for Deputy Chief Downey. And it \nis revisited today with the\n\n[[Page S4454]]\n\nquestions about what might have been had the pieces of the puzzle been \nput together in a different way before that sad and tragic day in \nSeptember.\n  I cannot answer the questions my constituents are asking. I cannot \nanswer the concerns raised by the families of the victims. As agonizing \nas it is even to think that there was intelligence suggesting the \npossibility of the tragedy that occurred, particularly for the family \nmembers who lost their husband, their wife, their son, their daughter, \ntheir niece, their nephew, their mother, their father, it is a subject \nwe are absolutely required to explore.\n  As for the President, he may not be in a position at this time to \nrespond to all of those concerns, but he is in a position to answer \nsome of them, including the question of why we know today, May 16, \nabout the warning he received. Why did we not know this on April 16 or \nMarch 16 or February or January 16 or August 16 of last year?\n  I do hope and trust that the President will assume the duty that we \nknow he is capable of fulfilling, exercise the leadership that we know \nhe has, and come before the American people, at the earliest possible \ntime, to answer the questions so many New Yorkers and Americans are \nasking. That will be a very great help to all of us.\n  I know my constituents want those answers, particularly the families \nwho still today wonder why their loved one went to work that beautiful \nSeptember morning and did not come home from the World Trade Center or \nthe Pentagon or those airplane flights. After all, in the grieving \nprocess, it is often the not knowing that hurts the most.\n  I hope the President will address these issues, will do so as soon as \npossible, and will also authorize the release of any other information \nthat New Yorkers and Americans have a right to know. I certainly look \nforward to learning of and being able to share that information with \nthe people I represent.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have some remarks on another subject I \nwould like to make. I commend our colleague and friend from New York \nfor her comments. I associate myself with her remarks. I think all \nAmericans would.\n  Obviously, it is critically important we know all that we possibly \ncan of what occurred. If there was, in fact, information that should \nhave been acted on, it is critically important we know about it, what \nhappened, and why actions were not taken, so we minimize the \npossibility of the events of September 11 from occurring again.\n  We all realize, as our colleague and friend from New York has pointed \nout, it is a difficult job being the Chief Executive Officer of this \ncountry, the Commander in Chief. And there is a voluminous amount of \nmaterial that arrives every day from our national security agencies and \nservices. But when you get information this specific, this detailed, \narriving from a variety of different sources, then someone should have \ntaken better action, in my view.\n  So I am hopeful we will get a response. It is critically important \nfor the healing process and for understanding exactly what occurred. So \nI commend the Senator for her remarks and associate myself with them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/16/senate-section/article/S4454-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4454]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMENDING PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend our former Chief Executive of the \ncountry--former President Ronald Reagan. I just attended a ceremony in \nthe Rotunda of the Capitol honoring former President Ronald Reagan and \nNancy Reagan. We are from different parties, and we had disagreements \nduring his administration. But one thing can be said about \nPresident Ronald Reagan: Whatever disagreements or agreements you may \nhave had on specific policy issues, Ronald Reagan gave this country a \nstrong sense of confidence and optimism.\n\n  We had come through a difficult time in the 1970s, with Watergate, \nthe Iranian crisis, and the energy crisis that had been debilitating to \nour spirit. Ronald Reagan restored our Nation's confidence in itself. I \ncommend the President. I know he is suffering from Alzheimer's, and \nMrs. Reagan has taken on the heroic efforts of being his eyes and ears \nin the sense of speaking for him where appropriate. It was a very \nmoving ceremony in the Rotunda, where both the President and First Lady \nwere recognized with the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  So as one Democrat, to a former Republican President, but more \nimportantly a great American President, I express my gratitude to him \nfor his service, and Mrs. Reagan for her remarkable service both to her \nhusband and family and this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/16/senate-section/article/S4454-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4454-S4455]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMENDING PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER\n\n  Mr. DODD. Secondly, Mr. President, I commend President Carter for his \nwork this week. I have been so impressed with the efforts that \nPresident Carter has made in Cuba during the past 4 or 5 days. I think \nhe has spoken for many of us in this country during his visit to Cuba.\n  While in Cuba, President Carter addressed the Cuban people on \nnational radio and television--a unique opportunity in a country that \nis a totalitarian regime where democracy has had no expression now for \nmore than four decades.\n  In having been granted permission to address the Cuban people, \nPresident Carter was given a right that no Cuban other than the \nPresident of the country, and those who agree with him, has been \ngiven--the opportunity to speak freely about democratic values, values \nthat we embrace as a people and the 11 million people of Cuba embrace \nas well.\n  In his address, President Carter urged the government of Cuba to \nallow democracy to be restored, and asked that pro-democracy petitions \nbe allowed to be collected, and respected.\n  He simultaneously called for the U.S. government to allow free travel \nto Cuba and stated his belief that our government should begin to lift \nour embargo. I commend him for those comments.\n  The only place I know of in the world that we prohibit our citizens \nfrom traveling to is the island of Cuba. You can go to Iraq. You can go \nto North Korea. You can go to Iran. You can go to any other country \naround the globe, some of which are our most devout enemies when it \ncomes to terrorism. You may be stopped from entering by the governments \nof those countries, but our Government does not prohibit you from \ngoing. Cuba is the only country where Americans are prohibited from \nentering by our country.\n  And for the hundreds of thousands of Cuban Americans who have family \nand loved ones there, who are only allowed to go back once a year, who \nwould like to go and see their family members more than once a year, \nperhaps to go see an ailing parent or grandparent, I find this to be a \nparticularly onerous provision in American law. I hope it will be \nchanged, just as I am hopeful that change will come to Cuba and \ndemocracy will arrive on that island so the people will have the \nopportunity to elect and choose their political leadership.\n  In summary, President Carter, by calling upon the Cuban Government to \nchange its ways and our own Government to change some policies, I think \ngave the appropriate message; one that can be appreciated not only \nhere, but on the island of Cuba by the Cuban people and freedom-loving \npeople around the globe.\n  So today, I take this moment to express my gratitude to this former \nPresident who, in his retirement, has accomplished so many wonderful \nthings and become such a wonderful symbol for human rights and dignity \nand democracy around the globe.\n  I am proud to stand here and honor two former Presidents who faced \neach other in an election 1980, but in their own way have made unique \ncontributions to our Nation. President Carter continues to do so. I \ncommend him for his work in Cuba and look forward to his return and \nhearing from him. I am hopeful that he will come before us in Congress \nin some setting in which he might be able to describe his feelings \nabout events in Cuba while sharing his opinion of what the prospects \nhold for the future.\n  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4455]]\n\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment, No. 3429 to amendment \nNo. 3401, to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] for himself, Mr. Gramm, \n     Mr. Baucus, and Mr. Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3429 to amendment No. 3401.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To Require that any revenue generated from custom user fees \nbe used to pay for the operations of the United States Customs Service)\n\n       At the end of the matter proposed to be inserted, insert \n     the following:\n\n     SEC. 4203. LIMITATION ON USE OF CERTAIN REVENUE.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any revenue \n     generated from custom user fees imposed pursuant to Section \n     13031(j)(3) of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation \n     Act of 1985 (19 U.S.C. 58C(j)(3)) may be used only to fund \n     the operations of the United States Customs Service.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Nickles \nbe added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I will explain the amendment and discuss the \nreasons for it. I hope my colleagues will agree that this is an \namendment that can be adopted. We don't even have to have a rollcall \nvote, unless someone asks for it. I think it is fairly straightforward.\n  The amendment has to do with Custom user fees. Today, Custom user \nfees come in two separate categories, which I will discuss in a moment. \nAbout 300 million of them are statutorily designated to go to a \nparticular set of accounts in the Customs Service. For example, it pays \novertime for Customs Service personnel. There is about $1 billion in \nCustom users fees that takes a somewhat more circuitous route that goes \ninto the general fund--generally money which the Appropriations \nCommittee defines as funds for funding various functions of the Customs \nService, hence the name ``user fee.''\n  In fact, I will digress for a moment. We have taxes and we have user \nfees by which we raise revenue. User fees are generally targeted toward \npeople who use a particular service of the Government. So we generally \ntry to spend that money on the things for which they require us to use \nthe money. An example is, if you use the national forest, you are \nbeginning to find that you have to pay a little fee to go camping \nthere. That is because we are kind of hard on the forests when we camp \nthere, and somebody has to clean up the mess we leave behind, and so we \npay a little fee for that. It is more fair for those of us who may take \nour kids camping in the forest to pay for the user fee than it is to \ncharge the taxpayers generally.\n  The same thing is true with Customs. We charge a fee for people who \nhave their ships and their trucks and other things inspected by the \nCustoms Service, and some bring goods into the United States of \nAmerica. I am oversimplifying, but that is the general idea. So we take \nthose same moneys and put them back into the inspectors, into the \nequipment that is used to inspect their train, or boat, or truck, for \nexample, so that instead of waiting at the border for 2 hours, maybe we \ncan get them through in an hour or less, hopefully, so we can expedite \ncommerce at our borders, and for other purposes. That is the concept of \na user fee. They pay to have us do this. We take the money and apply it \nto that.\n\n  Now, what the underlying bill did--and I must say that as a member of \nthe Finance Committee, I was unaware of this and I objected to it being \ndone in an earlier bill, and I was distressed to learn it had been done \nin this bill--they extended the Custom user fees--that part is OK--and \nthe net result of that is to contend that the expenses of the TAA \nportion--the trade adjustment assistance portion--of these free trade \nbills is paid for by revenue generated by extending the Custom user \nfees.\n  Well, that is not true, and it should not be true. So what my \namendment says is, no, Custom user fees are used for Customs. Here is \nwhat it says:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any revenue \n     generated from custom user fees . . . may be used only to \n     fund the operations of the United States Customs Service.\n\n  That is the idea. That would be a good thing, especially at this time \nin fighting our war on terror. We are imposing upon the Customs Service \nmore and more responsibilities for doing a really good job of checking \nall of the modes of conveyance, and containers, and other kinds of \nshipments into the country. We read in the newspaper a couple days ago \nwhere 25 possible terrorists from Arab countries have been smuggled \ninto this country in the holds of ships.\n  I think the Customs Service can examine only 1 percent of the cargo \ncoming in on ships. They cannot examine every part of every hold of a \nship coming into this country, let alone every truck, train, or other \nmode of conveyance that brings goods into the United States. Yet we are \nasking them to be sure that nobody smuggles in contraband, drugs, \nnuclear bombs, biological weapons, chemical weapons, or illegal aliens \nwho could be terrorists.\n  We are asking a lot of the Customs Service, and we are not giving \nthem enough money to do the job, which is why they have asked for more \nmoney. And most of us, I believe, are willing to provide more money for \nthe Customs Service to do what we are asking them to do, not just for \ntheir general work but now enhanced by the requirements of the war on \nterror.\n  At the same time we are imposing that additional burden on them, \nsomebody had the bright idea to pay for the unrelated parts of this \nbill having to do with wage subsidies, health benefits, and so on, with \nCustoms user fees. That is not right, and it is actually not even \nnecessary.\n  Why is it being done? Because somebody had the idea they could avoid \na point of order being raised against the underlying bill so that \ninstead of having to get 60 votes to pass the bill, 50 votes, the \nusual, would suffice. The fact is there is already a different kind of \npoint of order that lies against the bill, so this serves no purpose.\n  That is why I think even those who wish to say they have a way of \npaying for the bill by using these Customs fees could easily agree that \nthere is no point in it, there is no purpose in it, and, therefore, \nrather than muddling up the law, rather than taking money from Customs \nwhen we are trying to fight the war on terror, they would be willing to \nadopt our amendment and not try to pay for the bill with Customs user \nfees.\n  This is a technique and, as a matter of fact, it even has a name in \nthe Senate, and it is called a ``pay-for.'' That is pretty inelegant. \nThe idea is when you have a program that is going to cost, say, $10 \nbillion or $11 billion, as this is, it is going to be hard to get it \npassed unless we show we can pay for it. So we raise taxes $10 billion \nor $11 billion or find some other source of revenue that will cover \nthat expense.\n  In this case, the pay-for is the Customs user fees. As I said, that \nis not necessary because nobody is saying you have to find a way to pay \nfor this. We are assuming that the general revenues of the United \nStates will pay for the expenses of the bill. I am assuming that.\n  I do not have any objection to the general revenues of the United \nStates paying for the cost for this bill. They are too high, in my \nview. I wish we did not have all these costs, but to the extent there \nare costs, the taxpayers of the United States will pay for them through \ngeneral revenues. We do not have to have a pay-for.\n  To the extent it is being used to get around a parliamentary point of \norder, it does not need to either because there is a different point of \norder that lies against the bill.\n  Instead of compromising our Customs Service, I plead with my \ncolleagues in the name of the war on terror, in the name of good sense, \nlet's adopt this amendment and eliminate the concept of the pay-for in \nthis legislation.\n  I have explained this in a more simplified form than it really is. I \nbelieve\n\n[[Page S4456]]\n\nI have been accurate in what I have said.\n  Actually, there are two specific kinds of Customs user fees, to \ncomplicate this just a little bit. What it also illustrates is that for \nabout $300 million of these user fees, we cannot do what this bill \npurports to do and pay for this bill with these fees.\n\n  This is an 8-year extension of two different Customs fees: One, the \nso-called COBRA user fees which raise approximately $300 million per \nyear; second, the merchandise processing fee. You can see what that is \nabout; it raises approximately $1 billion per year. CBO estimates that \nthe user fee section would increase revenue by about $11.54 billion \nthrough fiscal year 2011.\n  The problem is the COBRA user fees already by statute are designated \nfor use for a variety of other purposes. This is found in title 19, \nsection 58, subsection (f) dealing with Customs duties, titled \n``Disposition of Fees.'' I will read a little bit of it:\n\n       There is established in the general fund of the Treasury a \n     separate account which will be known as the Customs User Fee \n     Account.\n\n  It goes on to talk about how these fees will be distributed:\n\n       Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, all fees \n     in the Customs User Fee Account shall be used to the extent \n     to pay the costs incurred by the United States Customs \n     Service in conducting commercial operations, including, but \n     not limited to, all costs associated with commercial \n     passenger, vessel, vehicle, aircraft, and cargo processing.\n\n  And so on. Then there is a list specifically under section 3(a) of \nhow these COBRA fees are used. The one I specifically want to point out \nis paying overtime compensation and another is paying premium pay, and \nthere are others--foreign language proficiency awards, and so on.\n  This is important because earlier this year in the Terrorism \nSubcommittee of the Judiciary Committee, we had testimony by one of the \nofficials of the Customs Service in which it was pointed out why these \nfees are so important.\n  Again, these fees are already designated by statute to go for these \nspecific purposes. We cannot use them again to pay for what is in this \nbill. Out West, we have a saying: You can only sell your pony once. In \neffect, somebody is trying to sell this pony twice. It has already been \nsold: $300 million goes to these specific items in Customs. You cannot \ntake that same money and apply it to fund the underlying expenses of \nthis bill. Again, it is not necessary. Nobody is making you do it. So \ndo not try to sell this pony twice. You cannot do it.\n  Moreover, it is not good policy. According to testimony on February \n26 of this year--the witness was Bonni Tischler, Acting Commissioner of \nthe Office of Field Operations of the Customs Service. She gave some \nvery valuable testimony. I will quote some of her testimony.\n  I had said there is a lot to do with not only checking out the \ncommercial activities that go on that we ask Customs to do, but to \nbegin to deal better with terrorism. I asked if she had suggestions \nand, in particular, what the effect might be of taking Customs user \nfees away from the Customs Service in her ability to perform this task.\n  She said:\n\n       My personal opinion is it would severely hamper us.\n\n  Ms. Tischler identified the numbers, and she was just about exactly \non target with respect to the numbers, but regarding the merchandise \nprocessing fees, my question was:\n\n     . . . if you were not to have the benefit of that in your \n     appropriations, I presume it would be fairly devastating, \n     would it not?\n\n  Her response is:\n\n       It would absolutely be devastating. I think our total \n     budget is closing in on $3 billion thanks to Congress and the \n     administration. So to take that much out, if it were as the \n     offset, would be truly devastating.\n\n  I had put this in context and they did, too. This merchandise \nprocessing fee is not statutorily designated as the so-called COBRA fee \nis. This is not a matter of selling the same pony twice legislatively, \nbut it is from a policy standpoint, since as I pointed out in my \nquestion and as she pointed out in her answer and as we can document, \nas a practical matter this is what the Appropriations Committee uses to \ndefine what it has available to fund the Customs Service. That is the \nway it ought to be policy-wise anyway; otherwise, we should just \ncollect taxes from the American people.\n  Since we are collecting a user fee from the people who use the \nsystem, the money they pay in ought to go back to help them in how they \nare using the system. The commercial people who have trucks that go \nback and forth across the border all day and pay a fee ought to know \nthe fee they are paying is going to pay the people who are checking \ntheir trucks and getting them through the line as quickly as possible. \nThat is what a user fee is all about.\n  As a matter of policy, we should not be assuming that in order to \nhave some way of paying for the expenses of this legislation that money \nis now available for that purpose.\n  Some of my colleagues might say: This is all a ruse; this is all a \nfiction anyway. Indeed, to some extent, it is a fiction, which goes to \nshow why this is not necessary.\n  In effect, we are robbing Peter to pay Paul. We are saying: We have \nto find a way to fund the legislation that is before us, the trade \nassistance legislation. So instead of raising taxes, we are going to \nextend these user fees and, voila, we now have it paid for.\n  As I pointed out, $300 million of it is not paid for because that \npony has already been sold, but as to the remaining $1 billion, it \nshould not be that we consider this the appropriate fund to pay for the \nexpenses of the bill because it is user fees paid by people who are \nusing the system.\n  If you say, But it is all the same pot of money; money is fungible, \nso we will say we are funding this trade adjustment assistance out of \nthe user fees, but then we will have taxes to pay for that, to pay for \nCustoms, what we are really doing is acknowledging that we are going to \nhave to find the money in the general budget; in other words, taxes are \ngoing to have to be found to pay for this.\n  So it does not matter whether you acknowledge upfront that it is \ngoing to require $10 billion or $11 billion in taxes to pay for this \nbill or you say we are going to get the money from Customs and then we \nare going to have to find $10 billion or $11 billion in taxes to pay \nfor Customs. It is the same deal. So why go through this fiction?\n  If, as I said, it is to avoid a point of order on the legislation, I \nsay, A, that is wrong; B, it is bad policy; but, C, it is not \nnecessary.\n  This was tried earlier with respect to the Patients' Bill of Rights, \nand I will quote briefly from a memorandum from the Acting Commissioner \nfor James Sloan, the acting Under Secretary for Enforcement:\n\n       The COBRA fees collected by Customs are used both to \n     reimburse Customs appropriation for certain costs, such as \n     overtime compensation, and to offset a portion of the Customs \n     Service salaries and expense appropriation. As an example our \n     FY 2001 collections will offset approximately $1 billion or \n     almost 50 percent of Customs appropriation this year. \n     Authorizing a COBRA extension to offset costs for something \n     other than the Customs Service could negatively impact our \n     available funding. Additionally, the Merchandise Processing \n     Fee authorized in the COBRA is a fee that is paid by \n     importers for the processing of merchandise by the Customs \n     Service. Directing the funds collected from this fee for \n     something other than Customs operations could pose GATT \n     interpretation issues.\n       While Customs supports the extension of the COBRA fees, we \n     also acknowledge that changes are warranted with the manner \n     in which we collect those fees. We intend to review this in \n     the near term.\n\n  In other words, when this issue came up in another context and \nCustoms was asked about it officially as opposed to my unofficial \nquestion in the hearing we held earlier this year, the answer was the \nsame. This would be harmful to the Customs Service, and this was prior \nto September 11, 2001. This was June 20, 2001.\n  Now that we have imposed this additional burden on the U.S. Customs \nService to help us fight the war on terror, it would be unthinkable for \nus, even as a ruse, to say we are going to use Customs fees to pay for \nthe wage insurance or health benefits under this tariff legislation. \nLet's be truthful about it and say it is going to cost $10 billion or \n$11 billion, we will find that money out of general revenues somehow or \nanother, and that is the cost of the program. That would be an honest \napproach.\n  Let's not try to suggest it is already being paid for because we \nfound the money in the Customs Service, because\n\n[[Page S4457]]\n\nunless we are not going to fund the Customs Service, we are going to \nhave to offset that loss by finding $10 billion or $11 billion then in \nthe rest of the budget to pay for the Customs Service obligations.\n  I do not know what could be more clear, but I will just make this \npoint and then see if any of my colleagues would like to ask any \nquestions about this, or make any comments, because I really do not \nwant to oversell the proposition. Perhaps this amendment could just be \ntaken and we could move on.\n  I do not mean to force a vote on it if people are willing to take it, \nbut I will begin to discuss this in very thorough terms, with a lot of \ninformation that deals primarily with how it would adversely impact the \nwar on terror, if there is going to be opposition to this amendment, if \nthere is going to be an insistence that somehow or another we keep the \nCustoms user fee as a pay-for, and object to my amendment which simply \nsays Customs user fees should go to pay Customs expenses.\n  If we are not willing to accept the amendment, then get prepared for \na lengthy discussion about the impact of the war on terror. I am \nprepared to engage in that, but it is not going to be necessary, as I \nsay, if there is an agreement on the other side that we are able to \ntake the amendment.\n  I know it is time to go to the vote on the Dodd amendment, or there \nwill be a brief discussion beforehand, but might I inquire of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee what the process would \nbe after the Dodd amendment? Would we go back to the discussion of this \namendment or could there be a discussion about whether to take it and \nmove on to another amendment? What would the pleasure of the chairman \nbe at that point?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We are prepared to take the amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. In that case, Mr. President, I learned a long time ago in \narguing before the judge when he says, I am inclined to rule for you, \nyou say, thank you, Your Honor.\n  Could we do that by unanimous consent at this point and then move on \nto other business?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We could voice vote the amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I express my strong support for this \namendment.\n  The amendment sends a strong signal from the U.S. Senate.\n  Customs user fees should be used solely to fund the U.S. Customs \nService, not as some offset for unrelated programs.\n  Let's put this in context. When Congress first authorized these \ncustoms fees the avowed purpose was to underwrite the costs of Customs \ncommercial operations.\n  We should make sure these fees are being used for customs. That is \nwhat this Amendment does.\n  Allow me to read just a few of the letters I received over the last \nseveral months on this issue.\n  The National Association of Foreign Trade Zones writes:\n\n       [We] recently learned that the Trade Adjustment Assistance \n     Bill . . . includes language that would provide for extension \n     of the Merchandise Process Fee to offset the cost of the TAA \n     program.\n       As you are aware, the fee was originally established by \n     Congress to cover the costs of the commercial operations of \n     the U.S. Customs Service.\n       The [National Association of Foreign Trade Zones] is \n     strongly opposed to any extension or reauthorization of the \n     [Merchandise Process Fee] from their congressionally intended \n     purpose.\n\nAnd the National Association of Foreign Trade Zones is not alone.\n  The National Customs Brokers & Forwarders Association of America \nwrites:\n\n       [We are] aware of pending legislation due for consideration \n     regarding Trade Adjustment Assistance. While [we] support \n     TAA, we cannot support the use of user fees to ``pay for'' \n     this program.\n       Merchandise processing fees need to be directed to the \n     agency for which they were collected--the U.S. Customs \n     Service.\n\n  Aligent Technologies, a Fortune 500 company and one of the top 100 \nimporters in the Nation writes:\n\n       The Merchandise Processing Fee is a ``user-fee'' paid by \n     importers to cover the cost incurred by Customs to process \n     imports.\n       . . . If US Customs is to continue collecting [the fee], it \n     must directly fund Customs processing improvements, \n     specifically for the new Automated Commercial Environment and \n     other initiatives that are greatly needed to improve the \n     trade process.\n\n  Members may be under the mistaken impression that extending these \nfees without ensuring that they go for customs is simply keeping a \nconvenient money stream flowing.\n  That is not so.\n  You will hear that extending the fees without ensuring they are used \nfor customs purposes will have no impact on Customs' budget.\n  If it has no impact, why is it in the bill? It's in the bill because \nit has an impact on budget scoring. Once CBO scores these funds against \ntrade adjustment assistance, they cannot be used by Customs for Customs \nmodernization.\n  These funds are no longer available to offset the costs of Customs \nmodernization.\n  So I think the Senator's amendment is very simple and very \nreasonable.\n  I just want to make sure that Customs user fees are being used for \ntheir intended purpose.\n  In fact, we included a similar sense-of-the-Senate resolution during \nmarkup of this bill.\n  This is a commonsense amendment and I urge my colleagues to support \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, very briefly, I think we are reaching time \nfor the votes. I think it is proper that the Senate vote in favor of \nthe amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona because basically, \nunder current law, passage of fees does go back to Customs. The \nmerchandise fees that are collected go into the general revenue, but \nthey have always historically been appropriated right back to the \nCustoms Service. So the amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona \nsimply confirms existing practice.\n  Basically, the Senator is correct on how the actual dollars are \ncollected and should be collected and then transmitted back to the \nCustoms Service. We are prepared to accept the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 3429.\n  The amendment (No. 3429) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3428\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, my understanding is that there are 5 minutes \nof debate equally divided on the Dodd amendment. I was going to ask for \nthe yeas and nays on the amendment, but I understand that it will be a \ntabling motion, so let me hold on that.\n  Briefly, I will describe what I thought would be a fairly \nstraightforward, small, uncontroversial amendment, but some have not \nmade it as such. What I tried to do with this amendment was to take \nthree provisions of the United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement out \nof the six that are incorporated in the agreement. The three that are \nmissing, are critically important to have as part of the 27 pages of \nstandards that we ask our negotiators to try to pursue as we enter \ntrade negotiations with individual countries.\n  The United States-Jordan Free Trade Agreement was adopted 100 to zero \nonly a few short months ago in this body, and as part of that agreement \nwe added the three standards that are excluded in this bill. The three \nstandards ensure that other governments will not relax or ignore their \nown domestic labor laws to gain a competitive advantage, to strive to \nensure that other governments' labor laws are consistent with core \nlabor standards that have already been agreed to with the ILO and, \nthirdly, to agree that core labor principles, freedom of association, \nprohibitions on child labor, elimination of discrimination in the \nworkplace, are all going to be efforts we would strive to promote. They \nare goals. They are objectives. Unfortunately, they have been excluded \nfrom the underlying bill.\n  My purpose in offering this amendment is to include those important \nobjectives. If we can include objectives dealing with e-commerce, \ninvestments, insurance, is it really asking too much, out of 27 pages \nof standards, to add 3 that would deal with child labor, job \ndiscrimination, and seeing to it your domestic labor laws are not \neroded, making it disadvantageous for U.S. workers as we try to compete \nwith these countries? I hope this amendment can be adopted. I regret it \nhas come to a vote of motion to table.\n\n[[Page S4458]]\n\n  It seems to me we have had a dynamic process with regard to trade \nnegotiations over the years. It used to be in the past we dealt with \ntariffs and quotas, and that was it. Over the years, we have added a \ndynamism to that, so we have added other interests that we want our \nnegotiators to pursue when we are allowing countries to have access to \nour markets.\n  I do not think it is asking too much to ask our negotiators, in the \nprocess of negotiating with countries, that they try to abolish child \nlabor. The International Labor Organization has been signed by 163 \ncountries. We have already agreed to these provisions under the Jordan \nFTA.\n  It seems to me that including these provisions in the trade promotion \nauthority legislation now before us is a modest request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, to be quite candid, I wish we could accept \nthis amendment. The Senator makes some very good points. The fact is \nthat all those standards that he seeks are in the underlying GSP \nprovision that is a part of the underlying legislation. That just \nbrought our definitions of core worker rights up to date. As I \nmentioned before, I hope we can bring the definition of core worker \nrights in the fast track part of the bill also up to date. The overall \nobjectives and the priority objective in the underlying bill have equal \nweight. We are splitting hairs.\n\n  This amendment is very much opposed by many Senators. I am duty-bound \nas part of the agreement to oppose it. I wish we could accept this \namendment because it is one we should be able to accept.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, once again, repeating what my colleague \nfrom Montana has said, this part of this legislation, not only in the \nSenate but also in the House of Representatives, is so carefully \nbalanced, bringing in the labor and environmental issues, if you do \nsomething to pick up one vote on the liberal end, we lose a vote on the \nconservative end.\n  I ask my colleagues to not in any way upset that balance. That is why \nthis amendment should be defeated.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is always a very sincere Senator on any \nsubject. He presents his case well. This is one place where his ideas \nmay be well for the country of Jordan, where we do $40 million a year \nin business, but it is not good idea when we look globally at \nnegotiations with 142 countries. We cannot use the country of Jordan \nnecessarily as a pattern for the whole organization.\n  I am strongly opposed to this amendment. I think anyone who wants \nthis President to get trade promotion authority, or trade adjustment \nassistance for that matter, should be too.\n  Basically, the amendment takes the very carefully crafted House to \ncompromise language on labor and Add-to it language negotiated by the \nClinton administration in a bilateral agreement with Jordan.\n  In my view this is not thoughtful trade policy. If this language is \nintended as a broad policy statement, it is unnecessary.\n  The negotiating objectives in the bipartisan compromise already \ncapture the key trade and labor provisions of the U.S. Jordan Free \nTrade Agreement.\n  Taken literally, the language dictates the specific details of future \nlabor provisions--saying that they have to look almost exactly like our \nbilateral trade agreement with Jordan. This simply does not make sense.\n  The labor text negotiated with Jordan is not a one-size fits all way \nto address all labor issues with every U.S. trade partner, nor was it \ndesigned to be. The President will be negotiating regional, \nmultilateral, and bilateral agreements using trade promotion authority. \nAny one of these may require a different approach to labor issues. He \nneeds the flexibility to address labor issues in a variety of \nsituations.\n  That is what the bipartisan TPA bill does. In fact, I would say if \nyou really want to improve worker rights around the world, you should \nsupport the bipartisan compromise. There is more in this bill designed \nto improve labor rights than any TPA bill that has passed the Senate.\n  For the first time every, the ``core labor standards'' of the ILO \nwill be referenced in U.S. trade negotiating objectives. Further, the \nbill directs the President to seek a commitment by other governments to \neffectively enforce their labor laws. These provisions will encourage \ncountries to improve their labor laws, without infringing on their \nsovereignty.\n  The bill also directs the President to seek to strengthen the \ncapacity of trading partners to promote core labor standards.\n  In addition, the Secretary of Labor will be directed to consult with \nany country seeking a trade agreement with the United States concerning \nthat country's labor law. U.S. technical assistance will be available \nto help other countries raise their labor standards.\n  Whenever the President seeks to implement a trade agreement with a \ncountry, he will submit a report to the Congress describing the extent \nto which that country has laws in place to govern the exploitation of \nchild labor. This will focus attention on any problems which will help \ndirect appropriate resources to solve these problems.\n  Requiring a one-size fits all policy like this amendment does is not \ngoing to enhance labor rights. It will upset the careful political \nbalance incorporated into the bipartisan TPA Act and kill the very bill \nthat is best equipped to improve worker rights.\n  If you want this bill or TAA to ultimately make it to the President's \ndesk, I urge you to oppose this amendment.\n  There is a fundamental truth about trade that a lot of Senators who \nare trying to amend this bill ignore--trade in of itself can lift \npeople out of poverty and improve worker rights around the world.\n  It is no coincidence that the wealthiest nations on Earth are those \nwho embrace trade. And these are the nations that are most likely to \nhave the highest labor standards in the world. The fact is, by passing \nthis bill we can help poorer nations grow.\n  Trade promotion authority will help us establish trading \nrelationships with many developing nations. The poorest countries in \nthe world desperately want the United States to trade with them and \ninvest in them.\n\n  Open trade and investment have helped to raise more than 100 million \npeople out of poverty in the last decade, with the fastest reductions \nin poverty coming in East Asian countries that were most actively \ninvolved in trade. We can see similar results in the next decade if we \npass this bill.\n  A recent report by the World Bank called ``Global Economic Prospects \nand the Developing Countries'' shows this to be true. According to this \nstudy, a new WTO trade agreement could lift 300 million people out of \npoverty. Helping nations help themselves is surely a better path to \nglobal prosperity than mandates.\n  The Senator from Connecticut stated several times in his remarks that \nif you vote against his amendment, then you are voting against the \nopportunity to do something about slave labor, child labor, and prison \nlabor. This assertion is simply wrong.\n  The United States already has standards relating to internationally \nrecognized worker rights. We have had these standards for a number of \nyears. In fact, U.S. standards on worker rights are nearly identical to \nthe ILO standards that Senator Dodd wants to put into the Finance \nCommittee's trade bill.\n  For example:\n  The First ILO standard relates to freedom of association. This is \nalso the same standard the U.S. recognizes.\n  The second ILO standard relates to the right to bargain collectively. \nThis is the same standard we recognize.\n  The third ILO standard relates to forced, slave, or bonded labor. \nThis is exactly the same standard that we recognize.\n  The ILO's fourth standard related to child labor. The fourth United \nStates worker rights standard also relates to child labor.\n  So to say that the United States needs ILO standards on worker rights \nbecause we aren't currently doing anything about these issues, or \nbecause we\n\n[[Page S4459]]\n\ndon't have the ability to do anything about the problems addressed by \nthese standards, is simply wrong.\n  I again urge my colleagues to oppose this bill and support the \nbipartisan compromise.\n  I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I rise this afternoon to talk for a \nfew minutes about the need for trade adjustment assistance as a program \nand also an addition to it, something that meets the real needs of \nworkers as currently contemplated, and then what is also contemplated \nin our amendment which is to add, at very small cost, about 125,000 \nsteel retirees.\n  I want to talk about them. Their health benefits have been lost due \nto the import surge that has taken place. I passionately believe the \ntrade adjustment assistance concept has to be considered an integral \npart of U.S. trade policy.\n  When U.S. trade policies result in American workers losing their jobs \nthrough no fault of their own, much less Government inaction to protect \nthem in a legitimate forum, then I think we owe them help.\n  I want to take a moment to highlight the importance of the TAA health \nprovisions that will hopefully be included in the final package the \nSenate passes.\n  Majority Leader Daschle, Chairman Baucus, Senators Bingaman, Conrad, \nMikulski, Wellstone, myself, and many others have fought to include \nhealth protection as part of TAA for the first time. Workers want to \nget it. If workers lose their jobs as a result of imports, they deserve \nto get something back. They deserve to be on their feet, they deserve \nto have access to retraining, and they deserve to get cash assistance. \nThey also deserve to have something called health care, which is what \neverybody talks about and nobody does anything about, but we would like \nto. What has been lacking has been some help for displaced workers to \nretain their health care coverage. I am not talking about just \nsteelworkers, I am talking about the general population.\n  Under the Baucus-Grassley amendment that is under consideration now, \nthey will have that help. I want to extend my sincere appreciation to \nthe majority leader for his advocacy for provisions to provide health \ncare assistance to displaced workers who lose jobs due to imports. This \nis a tremendous improvement to the existing program.\n  I also thank him, as I believe all steelworkers do and should, for \nhis support of our upcoming amendment that will extend the new TAA \nhealth benefit for steel retirees who have also lost their retirement \nhealth coverage due to closure of their former employer.\n  The majority leader had originally agreed to include this as a \nprovision in his substitute amendment. But as we all know, that effort \nwas undermined by a point of order and a threatened filibuster. So we \nhad to make an adjustment.\n  The majority leader agreed to support the inclusion of the steel \nretiree health benefit as part of the overall Trade Adjustment \nAssistance Program because he understands what is at stake. He \nunderstands that steel retirees have lost their health benefits as a \ndirect result of imports--the most ferocious assault of imports, with a \nblind eye from the U.S. Government and,\n\n[[Page S4460]]\n\nparticularly in the last several years, just as surely as TAA-eligible \nworkers, active workers, lost their jobs because of imports.\n  If steel retirees have lost their health care coverage because their \ncompany closed as a result of this massive insurge of imports, they \nshould get some temporary relief. In fact, we are giving them only \nbridge relief--1 year's relief--but it is a full year, which they would \nnot now have. I am talking about 125,000 people right now in the \ncountry. They would get 1 year's health benefits. This amendment would \nprovide it to them.\n  As we seek to improve benefits for employees who lose their jobs \nbecause unfair--and in many cases illegal--imports have ravaged their \nindustry, we cannot forget the former employees of these same \nindustries--the retirees. Under the current TAA system, an active \nworker can get help in health care--if we pass it--because they are \ndisplaced by imports, but retirees are left behind. The people who have \ngone belly up and who are no longer working at all but who worked for \nyears and years in the steel mills got nothing; they are shut out.\n  The pending amendment will eliminate that disparity by affording \nretirees access to health care coverage that displaced workers \nhopefully will soon also be able to receive.\n  If a steelworker retires and they have lost their health care because \ntheir company closed, they will now be eligible to receive the same \ntemporary health benefits for 1 year as other workers--active workers \nwho have lost their jobs and health coverage due to imports.\n  These steelworker retirees are also victims of imports. They have \nlost health care because their companies closed. Their companies closed \nbecause the import crisis in the domestic steel industry became \noverwhelming. I call it a crisis because the International Trade \nCommission called it a crisis and said unanimously that it was due to \nserious damage caused by imports, imports from which our Government--\nnot just this administration but the previous one--failed to defend \nAmerican interests.\n  We have national laws on our books. We failed to defend them. They \ndon't allow other countries to dump their steel products into our \ncountry. We failed to defend that. That is not true in other cases \nparticularly, but it is true with steelworkers. They have been \nclobbered by this, and they have no health care retiree ability \nwhatsoever right now.\n  Health care coverage for steel retirees, who often live on fixed \nincomes, is incredibly important to them. It can mean the difference \nbetween all kinds of things that make their lives miserable or OK. I \nwant to clarify this because it is confusing. Whom are we talking about \nin this amendment? Active workers and retirees. Active workers is the \nTAA category; active retirees is the steel category. Those are the \npeople we want to add to the TAA for 1 year.\n  Active workers who lose their jobs are not retirees, they are \nunemployed workers. Retirees--the steel folks--have met years-of-\nservice requirements--vested 15 years working and this kind of thing--\nand they are out in the cold. Now their companies have closed and, for \nthe most part, have filed chapter 7. LTV in Ohio filed for chapter 7--\nno health benefits, no light bulbs, nothing; everything is shut down. \nThe health benefits they used to plan for in their retirement are now \ngone. These are not people who can retain and find new jobs, they are \nretirees who have finished, for the most part, their working years.\n  Under the new and improved TAA program, for active workers, if a \nworker loses his job, he will now be eligible for cash assistance, \nretraining, and health benefits. In the case of a retiree in the steel \nindustry, they may not be eligible for any retirement benefits from the \njob that they have lost, and under the current plan retirees are \neligible for nothing at all--unless my amendment is adopted, and that \nwill only be for health, not for cash, not for training, or anything \nelse. The money will only go to the retiree, not to the company.\n  Retirees are eligible under my amendment for the TAA health benefits \nonly if they were already eligible, going through this vested process, \nfor retiree health benefits and if their former employer permanently \nshut down.\n  We have created a small universe of 125,000 people. When I get to the \noffset in a minute, people are going to be shocked by how cheap it is, \nhow easy it is to do. But the steel retirees will not be eligible for \nany of the cash assistance, or anything else that active workers who \nare otherwise displaced under the TAA will get. Active workers are \neligible for TAA health assistance for the duration of the TAA cash \nassistance, which goes on. On the other hand, eligible steel retirees--\nthe subject of our amendment--would only be eligible for 1 year of \nhealth benefits. That was the bridge we talked about, to give everybody \na chance to regroup and see what we can do to retain the steel industry \nand for them to be able to get health care.\n  So this isn't a Cadillac plan we are talking about. This is a slimmed \ndown version. If retirees don't have health care coverage because \ncompanies shut down due to imports, they should not be left behind--\nparticularly when the Government is responsible for not defending their \ninterests over the past 30 years and not protecting the Federal law \nagainst dumping and willingly letting people do it. Of course, in the \nUnited States we are suckers for anything that is cheaper. It doesn't \nmatter if it was made in America. Well, it matters in the steel \nindustry, and we are about to lose it. Thirty-three companies have shut \ndown in the last couple of years, and most of the others are on the \nbrink. We could very well have no steel industry in 2, 3 years.\n  Today, there are only about 125,000 retirees. That is what my \namendment is about, along with Senator Mikulski and Senator Wellstone. \nSo 125,000 retirees and their dependents, who worked for companies such \nas LTV in the steel industry do not have any health coverage. They have \nnot, in fact, had any for the last several months, since March.\n\n  These people live in Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, New York, Alabama, \nIllinois, Utah, Louisiana, North Carolina, Missouri, and they do not at \nthis point live in West Virginia. Without the steel retiree provision \nin this bill, those retirees will continue to go without health care. \nIs that what we do here? Is that what we do as a legislative body?\n  Many of these retirees are not Medicare eligible and have no other \nrecourse. We all know about the terrible human scourge of Americans \nwithout health care coverage. We have done a lot of talking about that, \nbut we have not done much to cure it. This is not what retirees who \nspent a lifetime working in the harsh conditions of a steel mill--which \nmy colleagues, Senators Mikulski and Wellstone, have been in. Many \nothers have, too. I have not. It is like a coal mine; you do not go in \nvery often. It is dangerous, terrible work. They helped us win the war, \nand now we have a chance to do something for them.\n  I come back to the fact that the Federal Government has failed the \nsteel industry by not enforcing our national trade laws against \ndumping, which is what puts them out of work. Steel companies were \nforced into bankruptcy--as I said, 33 companies since the year 2000--\nbecause our trading partners were dumping steel on our shores, and this \nis not my opinion. This is what the International Trade Commission \nfound unanimously: That our industry had been seriously injured by \nimports.\n  Because of the Government's inaction for so long on those unfair \ntrading practices by our trading partners, our domestic steel industry \nhas suffered irreparable harm. People look at that and say: OK, we do \nnot have steel in our State; maybe it is true, maybe it is not. It is \ntrue. The Presiding Officer knows it. It is absolutely true. They are \nfalling like flies. Their stock is selling at $1, $2. It is awful.\n  Section 201 gave them a little bit of a boost, but it is a boost that \nwill only last 6 or 8 months or a year at most, and then it will go \nright back down. Here we come to the workhorse.\n  The provision is simply this. The provision will give retirees, many \nof whom are entering, as I indicated, their second month without health \ncare coverage--85,000 of these workers are former LTV workers, which \nwent chapter 7. They were in Ohio or they may have moved elsewhere. It \ntries to give them some breathing room.\n\n[[Page S4461]]\n\n  They will receive the same benefit we are giving TAA-eligible workers \nto keep their health care. It will allow these retirees some time to \nfigure out how to secure other forms of health insurance. It will allow \nus who care about the steel industry to figure out how we keep them \ntogether in America so we can consolidate and keep a steel industry \nwhich a country such as America ought to have.\n  The amendment has been officially scored by the Joint Tax Committee \nas costing--and please listen--$179 million over 10 years. The White \nHouse has been putting out figures six, seven times as large. It is \ndramatically less than what people claim this provision would cost--\n$179 million over 10 years. It is paid for with two IRS administrative \npositions. The offset is in. It is there. It allow taxpayers to \naccelerate their payments to the IRS if they so choose to do that. \nUnder current law, they cannot do that. The House has already passed \nthis. They have already agreed to it. It was one of Chairman Bill \nThomas's ideas.\n  I do not believe any of my colleagues will object to this pay-for and \nshould understand we worked hard to find agreeable offsets, thanks \nprimarily to Chairman Baucus and his staff.\n  This amendment improves upon an essential reform of our existing TAA \nprogram. It gives us health care. It targets temporary assistance to \nthose who really need it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment for retirees who are \nentitled to our help.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I join with pride and enthusiasm my colleagues, \nSenator Rockefeller and Senator Wellstone, in supporting this amendment \nto provide a safety net for American steelworkers who have been \nbattered by decades of unfair and illegal trade practices.\n  American steelworkers and their retirees worked very hard and played \nby the rules. They have served our country in war, building our ships, \ntanks, and weapons. I was so proud of the fact that in my own hometown \nof Baltimore, at Bethlehem Steel, we made the steel to repair the \nU.S.S. Cole so it could go back out to sea and continue to defend \nAmerica.\n  That is what steel is all about. It builds America. It makes us \nstrong. It has made us strong in war, and it has made us strong in \npeace, making the steel for our buildings, our cars, our bridges, our \nroads.\n  Yet for decades, our Government has watched as the steel industry \nwithered, not because steel was unproductive, not because steel was \noverpriced, but because of cheap, subsidized foreign steel that has \nbeen dumped on our markets and, I might add, below the cost of \nproduction. That is what makes it illegal.\n  The goal of the foreign steelmakers is to destroy our American steel \nindustry. Then foreign producers will be free to raise prices and \ncontrol production, and the United States of America, the home of the \nfree and the land of the brave, will be dependent on foreign steel for \nkeeping our domestic economy going and keeping America strong.\n  What would it have been if the U.S.S. Cole, banged by a terrorist \nattack, had had to limp home only while we dialed Russia, Thailand, or \nBrazil to get the steel parts to send them out to sea? I think it is \nwrong to let our steel industry die.\n  While we are going to fight for steel and its future--and we thank \nour President, President Bush, for the temporary tariffs to give steel \na break--our steelworkers are facing a crisis because so many steel \ncompanies are in bankruptcy. What that means is, their health care \nbenefits are now at risk. The Rockefeller-Mikulski-Wellstone-Stabenow \namendment seeks to help those steelworkers who have suffered the most \nfrom unfair trade practices: the retirees whose companies are now \nbankrupt and whose health care benefits are now at risk.\n  Our amendment is a simple one, and it is an affordable one. It would \nprovide a 1-year temporary extension of health care benefits for steel \nretirees who lose their health insurance because of trade-related \nbankruptcy of their company. Guess what. We have even sunsetted it in \nthe year 2007. This is a bridge to help them.\n  Madam President, about whom are we talking? Who are the steelworkers? \nWho are the steel retirees about whom we are talking?\n  First, the numbers: 600,000 retirees and their dependents; 33,000 in \nmy own home State of Maryland are retired. But it is not about numbers \nand statistics. It is about people and it is about families. Who are \nthey? Guess what. They have two characteristics in common: One, they \nall work for steel; two, they have all been good, outstanding citizens \nof the United States of America.\n  In my hometown, Bethlehem Steel every year has been the largest \ncontributor to United Way. Those men and those mills, those hot, steamy \nmills, are the first to sign up for dues checkoff so the Girl Scouts, \nBoy Scouts, Legal Aid, Meals on Wheels could have their contribution. \nThey are also very often the first to volunteer for any good cause in \nour community.\n  When you also look at the data on who are the steelworkers, you find \nthat a high percentage of them are veterans. They were called up and \nthey went to World War II. They went to Korea. They went to Vietnam. \nAnd guess what. While they were busy storming Iwo Jima or climbing the \ncliffs at Normandy, they were fighting for America. When they tried to \nmake their way up Pork Chop Hill to plant the flag, they were fighting \nfor America. When they were in that hell hole of the Mekong Delta in \nVietnam, they were fighting for America. Now when is America going to \nfight for them?\n  I think it is time America fights for them. The industrial unions had \nthe highest compliance with the draft than any other sector of our \nsociety. They did not take academic deferments. They did not go to \nHarvard to get a theological degree. They did not get a parade when \nthey came home. By God, they ought to at least be able to get their \nhealth care in their retirement.\n  Now that is about whom I am talking. We are talking about the \nlifeblood of our communities and people who have been giving their red \nblood for America. This generation has the values that we cherish: Hard \nwork, patriotism, habits of the heart, neighbor helping neighbor. Can \nwe not at least find a couple of million bucks to provide a 1-year \nbridge to help them get the health care they need?\n  Last week, I told my colleagues about Gertrude Misterka. Gertrude and \nI grew up in the same neighborhood. It is a neighborhood called \nHighlandtown. Our Baltimore neighborhoods have names like that. I know \nGertrude because we not only grew up in the same neighborhood, but when \nI was first running for the city council, going door to door, she and \nher husband Charlie were living in the neighborhood and said they \nabsolutely would back me.\n  It was great to see her at my hearing in March, but, my gosh, what an \nincredible reunion. Gertrude is now a widow. She was married to a \nBethlehem Steel worker named Charlie. Charlie worked with Bethlehem \nSteel for over 35 years. He was also a veteran. Charlie thought that \nfor his 35 years at Bethlehem Steel, he would have a secure pension for \nhimself and his bride. He also believed if he passed away, she would \nhave a widow's benefit, she would have Social Security, and his mind \nwas at peace because she would have her health care.\n  Even after his death, he thought he could provide for her because the \nmen at the mills believe you ought to really provide for your family.\n  Well, Gertrude relies on this health care at Bethlehem Steel. She has \ndiabetes, high blood pressure, and asthma.\n  I said: Gertrude, the naysayers are saying you get gold-plated, \nlavish health care. Tell me what you get.\n  She said: Barb, guess what. I get a $100 monthly pension. I do not \nget a COLA. When you retire at Bethlehem Steel you take what you get, \nbut you do not get a COLA. My pension is frozen.\n  Out of a $100 monthly pension, she pays $78 each month for her health \ncare premium. So she has this little pension. She has Social Security, \nbut out of her Bethlehem Steel, frozen with no COLA, she pays 78 bucks.\n  She told me she asked her pharmacist what her medications cost. If \nshe did not have health care, she would have to pay $6,716 for her \nmedication.\n\n[[Page S4462]]\n\n  Now, she is a diabetic. You do not cheat on your diabetes medicine. \nWhat are we going to do if Gertrude goes into a coma? She is going to \ngo into the hospital, and that is mega bucks. You have to take your \ntest. You have to take your insulin. You have to regulate your blood \npressure, and you have to take care of that asthma so it does not cause \nother complications.\n  I listened to Gertrude that day and my heart went out to her and \nother steel retirees. I promised her I would fight to help those \nretired steelworkers. They need a safety net so they do not lose their \nhealth care. Then the only reason they will lose their health care is \nbecause their companies are in trouble and are going bankrupt because \nof documented unfair trade practices.\n  These families worked hard for America, some for nearly 50 years, \ndoing back-breaking work in hot mills and in cold mills. Families now \nneed our help. Retired steelworkers who thought 30 or 40 years of hard \nwork meant security for their families, widows who sent their husbands \noff to these mills every day: these are the true victims of years of \nunfair trade practice. So this is why we have our amendment.\n  American steel is in crisis. Our steel companies are filing for \nbankruptcy protection; 31 since 1997, 17 last year. Steel mills are \nshutting down. Steelworkers are losing their jobs. Why are they doing \nthis? Again, this is not happening because of the steelworkers being at \nfault, the retirees being too greedy, or the companies being poorly \nmanaged. The cause of the steel crisis is well-known: Unfair foreign \ncompetition has brought American steel to its knees. Foreign steel \ncompanies, subsidized by their governments, are dumping excess steel \ninto America's open market at fire sale prices. This is not rhetoric. \nThis is fact, documented by the International Trade Commission.\n  Last year, they found these violations unanimously.\n  Let me give an example. The Russian Government keeps about 1,000 \nunprofitable steel plants open through subsidies. That is not 1,000 \nsteelworkers; that is 1,000 steel companies. Well, it is real easy to \ncompete with them, is it not?\n  The Russians are our newfound friends, but the Russians will not let \nus export our chicken legs to them. South Korea has nearly doubled its \nproduction capacity since 1990, without the domestic demand to support \nit. So, zip, in comes their steel. When Asian countries had the \ncollapse of their economies, they again dumped the steel. Was any \naction taken? Oh, no. The globalizers backed it.\n  I know we are going global, but while they are going global, we do \nnot have to abandon the people who fought for America. I said earlier \nin my remarks about why steel is important: The railroads, the bridges, \nthe ships, the tanks. Saving steel is not an exercise in nostalgia. It \nis a national security issue. We need to maintain production in very \nimportant sectors. No more than we want to be food dependent should we \nbe steel dependent.\n  Our President, George Bush, said steel is an important issue and he \nsaid it is an important national security issue. I could not agree with \nhim more. Quoting Senator Stevens, a great patriot:\n\n       During World War II, we produced steel for the world. We \n     produced steel for the allies. We rebuilt Europe. Could we do \n     it again?\n\n  I am not so sure.\n  America must never become dependent on foreign suppliers such as \nRussia or China for the steel we need to defend our Nation and keep our \ncountry on the go. Tariffs have been imposed by President Bush. I am \ngoing to reiterate what I said earlier in my remarks: I really do thank \nthe President for doing that. Those tariffs were temporary, limited to \n3 years. They were specific and they were well documented through the \nITC. I appreciate the President's action, and that was a very important \nstep, but now we need the next step. Tariffs help the industry. Now it \nis also time to help the workers and their retirees who will lose their \nhealth care if their companies go under.\n  Senator Daschle has led the way to provide a temporary 1-year \nextension of health benefits to qualified steelworkers. I sure support \nthat. We are also helping with other issues related to current \nworkers. Like the temporary work tariffs gave the companies breathing \nroom to recover, we need a temporary extension of benefits to give \nworkers and retirees breathing room to find health care. This is what \nwe need to do.\n\n  I was moved at a hearing by the stories of people such as Gertrude \nMisterka and others. I have been to the rallies. I have been to the \nmeetings. I feel very close to these workers. I grew up in Baltimore in \na neighborhood where most of the people in that community worked either \nat Bethlehem Steel, Western Electric, or General Motors. Western \nElectric has since closed. General Motors, we are not sure about its \nfuture there. Bethlehem Steel is in bankruptcy. We have real problems. \nThis is our industrial base.\n  In that neighborhood where I grew up, my father had a neighborhood \ngrocery store. He opened it early every day so that the steelworkers on \nthe early morning shift could come by and buy their lunch. These were \nthe people I knew. These are not numbers and statistics, these are \npeople with names such as Stanley, Henry, and Joe. These workers at \nBethlehem Steel were not units of production, they were our neighbors. \nThey were my neighbors, but they are your neighbors.\n  What did we know about Bethlehem Steel? In Baltimore, we thought it \nwas a union job with good wages and good benefits. Our neighbors could \ngo to work and put in an honest day's work, get fair pay, and come back \nand build our communities. Right now, most of the Bethlehem Steel \nworkers work very hard. Their commitment to Bethlehem Steel is a \ncommitment to America, doing the work that needs to get done for fair \npay and a secure future. We are proud of our workers at Bethlehem \nSteel. We are proud of what they did at the mill. We are proud of how \nthey defended America. We are proud of the way they prepare the U.S.S. \nCole.\n  I think it is time we repair the agreements to assure our retirees \nhave the health care they need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senator \nRockefeller, Senator Mikulski, and other Senators who have joined in \nthis amendment. I thank Senator Mikulski for her remarks and for \nreminding Members we are not talking about statistics, we are talking \nabout men and women whom we know and love and in whom we believe. I \nthank Senator Rockefeller for his painstaking work putting this \namendment together.\n  I am not the insider politician, but I want steelworkers--and not \njust steelworkers; I want people in the heartland of America, in \nindustrial America--to know exactly what the situation is. It is 5:10 \non Thursday night in the Senate Chamber. Here is what is going on. We \nhad an amendment originally as part of the trade adjustment assistance. \nIt was an amendment that said part of trade adjustment assistance ought \nto be to build a 1-year bridge where we can at least make sure the \nsteelworker retirees--in the case of Minnesota, taconite workers on the \nIron Range--who worked hard all their life, and now over 30 companies \nhave declared bankruptcy, including LTV company, a classic example, \nreceive retiree health care benefits. People are terrified.\n  We said, let's have a 1-year bridge. This was in the original \namendment. Senator Rockefeller worked very hard on it. Jay took the \nlead. Senator Daschle deserves a lot of credit. He is the leader of our \nparty. We have this as part of trade adjustment assistance.\n  The administration came out Wednesday of last week with a letter. \nThey said the cost would be about $800 million in 1 year. They were \ndownright untruthful with the figures. Actually, we were talking about \n$180 million over 10 years, not $800 million over 1 year. The \nadministration said it was adamantly opposed. It was crystal clear \nthere was no way to move this package forward, and therefore this \nprovision was removed.\n  I was presiding in the chair when Senator Daschle said: I make it \ncrystal clear that all amendments to try to modify this trade \nadjustment assistance package, I will oppose--but not the amendment \nthat will deal with steelworkers, trying to give them help; I will \nsupport that.\n\n[[Page S4463]]\n\n  Now we bring the amendment to the floor. What does the amendment say? \nIt says as part of this trade adjustment assistance package, $180 \nmillion over 10 years, can't we build this 1-year bridge to provide the \nhelp to the people who have worked so hard, now terrified they will \nlose their health care benefits? It is cost effective. It helps people. \nIt is compassionate liberalism, compassionate conservatism, \ncompassionate Democrats, and compassionate Republicans. We ought to do \nthis. It is the right thing to do.\n  I want steelworkers and their families to know, this is now being \nfilibustered. There are Senators who I assume will be debating this--I \nhope; certainly not the majority. The good news, Senator Rockefeller: \nClearly, we have the majority of the votes. What we have now is no \nagreement on time, no agreement for an up-or-down vote. This bill is \nbeing filibustered. That is where we are. We are in a filibuster \nsituation. One would think it was a cardinal sin and the most terrible \nthing in the world to try to provide some help to people--which is what \nthis is about. Therefore, this is being filibustered. Therefore, we are \ngoing to continue with this debate. There won't even be a vote until \nnext week. That is what is happening right now.\n\n  I am pleased we have a majority of the votes. That is obvious, since \nthe opponents do not want an up-or-down vote. We have a lot of support \nfor this amendment. The question is whether we can overcome the \nfilibuster, whether we can overcome the efforts to block this \namendment.\n  I remember Jerry Fallos, president of Local 4108 on the Iron Range of \nMinnesota, came here within the last month and testified. I cannot say \nit as well as he can say it. It is amazing. He has seen 1,300 people \nout of work. People are out of work, and these are good-paying jobs. \nAnd now you wonder how you will support your family, and 6 months or a \nyear later you do not have health coverage, and you worry about that. \nFor a lot of the taconite workers, it is their parents about whom they \nworry.\n  That is what we focus on, people who are vested, worked a lot of \nyears for companies, and now they are terrified their health care \nbenefits are going to be canceled. Jerry said the people from the Iron \nRange are used to hard times: We are survivors, though. We work hard. \nWe have always responded to our country in times of need. This steel \nindustry has always been there for our country in times of war. But now \nwe are asking for some help.\n  I say to the 100 Senators, as you decide how to vote on this \nfilibuster, this is $180 million over 10 years. That is all it is. If \nyou made the estate tax permanent, which mainly goes to millionaires, \nplus, you would be talking about $8 billion over 5 years. If we can \nhelp out the wealthiest people, if we can have all kinds of tax breaks \nto multinationals, one would think $180 million over 10 years to \nprovide help to retirees, a 1-year bridge before we finally put \ntogether a package that will help these people, would not be \nfilibustered.\n  I cannot even believe we are now out here fighting a filibuster, but \nthat is the situation. I ask the question, Where are our values? Where \nis our collective humanity? Are we going to step up to the plate and \nhelp people? This is a very modest amendment. We have passion about \nthis because it is people we know and we love and in whom we believe.\n  I told Senator Rockefeller about one discussion I had with one \nsteelworker. He said to me: Now we are counting on you all. A lot of \nour lives are at stake. People's lives are at stake.\n  That is not being melodramatic. Senator Mikulski used the example of \nprescription drugs. Elderly people are terrified. They do not know how \nthey will afford the costs. They worked hard. They did everything for \nour country. Companies now declare bankruptcy and walk away, and they \ndon't know what they will do.\n  We say can't we, over 1 year, provide help while we work together and \ncome up with a package to help the retirees and help the steel industry \nget back on its feet? That is no small issue to the economy of the \nUnited States of America.\n\n  I want to talk a little bit about the position the administration has \ntaken. I will try to be well behaved.\n  I do want to say on section 201 that the administration has already \nentertained all sorts of exemptions. There are now a thousand \nexemptions to the President's section 201 decision and Secretary \nO'Neill is reported as saying that a significant portion of them will \nbe favorably decided. So it may not provide us with the trade relief we \nwere hoping for, though as Senator Mikulski said, it is surely a step \nforward.\n  On the Iron Range it was not. On the Iron Range you have tariff rate \nquotas, so basically until you have 7 million tons of slab steel, that \ncan come into the country without any help whatsoever. That is what we \nhave right now. That is what has put our taconite workers out of work. \nSo it simply does not help at all.\n  Then you have 32 U.S. steel companies in the last 2 years that have \nfiled for bankruptcy. That is just unbelievable. That is 30 percent of \nthe domestic steelmaking capacity. When they file for bankruptcy, this \nis terror that people then have to deal with because then they can walk \naway, and they do walk away from retiree health benefits. That is what \nwe are speaking to.\n  Let me just be really clear. There is a bipartisan group of Senators \nwho have been working on the Steel Industry Retirees Benefits \nProtection Act, Democrats and Republicans. We all know there is a lot \nof work to do. The question is whether or not we can have this 1-year \nbridge. We can do something for people who, right now, are flat on \ntheir backs, who are terrified, who are worried. We can get some help \nto them because they are in this position through no fault of their \nown. Nobody can say that retired taconite workers and steelworkers are \nin the position they are in right now, worried about how they are going \nto afford health care costs, because they are slackers or because they \nare cheaters or because they don't work hard or because they are not \nloyal or because they are not patriotic or because they don't love \nAmerica or because they have not done everything to serve our country. \nThey have done all of that and more.\n  The only thing we are asking is whether or not the Senate and this \nadministration will help these families.\n  I do not have the years or the savvy of either of my colleagues out \nhere, but I have been here now 11\\1/2\\ years. I can figure out what is \ngoing on. This is an amendment that is tough to be against. This is a \nhigh moral ground amendment. There is a lot of passion behind this \namendment. There is a lot of decency behind this amendment. Frankly, it \nis all about helping people--people who richly deserve and need the \nhelp.\n  I think we have a majority vote, but the opponents will not give us \nthat vote. They will not agree to a time limit. So we will be at this \nfor the next several days. We will be at this over the weekend.\n  I hope steelworker families and other families all across the \nheartland of America are in touch with all Senators because we are \ngoing to do everything we can to overcome this obstacle, this \nfilibuster. A good, strong vote is important, and I am delighted \nbecause we have that; otherwise, there would not be a filibuster. Now \nwe have to deal with the filibuster. I hope Senators will be there to \nsupport these steelworker retirees.\n  I do not know about my colleagues, but for me, I have been waiting \never since this debate started on fast track for this amendment because \nhere is where I think Tip O'Neill's adage about ``all politics is \nlocal'' is absolutely true. I would not make any apology to anybody \nabout this.\n\n  Senator Rockefeller and Senator Mikulski, there is nothing I want \nmore in the world than to pass this amendment. We passed it already. We \nhave over 50 votes. That is why it is being filibustered. There is \nnothing I want more in the world than to make sure we are able to come \nthrough for people. That is why this amendment is important: Not \nbecause of some strategy, not because of some tactic, but because it is \non the floor of the Senate, it is 5:30 Thursday night but, darn it, \nthis amendment is directly connected to the concerns and circumstances \nof the lives of people we represent.\n  This is the right amendment. There is no other reason to be in the \nSenate than to try to pass this kind of legislation to help people--no \nother reason.\n\n[[Page S4464]]\n\nNothing can be more important, and I hope we will have the support of \nour colleagues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I would like to introduce a few \nthings in the Record.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania \nbe added as a cosponsor. He is the cochair of the steel caucus.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I also ask to have a letter from the vice chairman, \npresident, and CEO of Nucor, which is the largest minimill in the \nUnited States, be printed in the Record.\n  In the steel industry you have some conflict between integrated steel \nmills and minimills which take scrap and turn it into steel. It is an \narcane but nevertheless very real conflict.\n  I called Dan DiMicco in California about this amendment. He has \nwritten me a letter saying they have no problem with it at all. In no \nway will they oppose this proposal.\n\n       Nucor has long advocated consideration must be made for \n     displaced steel workers or retirees in transition due to \n     permanent plant closures.\n\n  One of the reasons he is for this is a point I made earlier. This \nmoney does not go to companies. It does not go to integrated steel \ncompanies or minimills. It goes to human beings.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                            Nucor Corporation,\n\n                                       Charlotte, NC, May 6, 2002.\n     Hon. John D. Rockefeller IV,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Rockefeller: I understand legislation pending \n     before the Senate would make certain steel industry retirees \n     who have lost their health care coverage eligible under the \n     Trade Adjustment Assistance program for federal assistance in \n     obtaining health insurance coverage through COBRA or state \n     sponsored plans for one year.\n       Nucor Corporation will not oppose this proposal. Nucor has \n     long advocated that consideration must be made for displaced \n     steel workers or retirees in transition due to permanent \n     plant closures. The continued surge of illegally traded steel \n     has devastated communities across America and left many \n     retirees and their families without access to health care.\n       As I understand the proposal under consideration, it would \n     help the retirees who have lost health care coverage due to \n     permanent closure of capacity directly and is for a limited \n     period of time. As such, I do not believe it would adversely \n     affect Nucor because it would not allow companies to \n     discharge their legacy obligations onto the federal \n     government. We continue to believe that pension and health \n     commitments of surviving mills should remain the \n     responsibility of those mills, not of the taxpayers or the \n     rest of the industry.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Daniel R. DiMicco,\n                                   Vice Chairman, President & CEO.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I also called Governor Bob Taft of \nOhio yesterday afternoon. I told him we have this situation, we have \nthis amendment. Yes, of course, LTV is located in his State, but that \ndoesn't mean necessarily all the 85,000 steel retirees are located in \nhis State. I met Governor Taft back in the 1960s. I don't know him \nwell, but he is a fine Governor. He is a conservative Governor, a \nresponsible Governor, and he did something I thought very unusual.\n  What I was asking for was a letter of support for my amendment. The \nGovernor gets this phone call from some United States Senator at 6 \no'clock in the evening saying: Can I have a letter from you by noon? \nThat is when this Senator thought we were going to be doing this \nlegislation today.\n  He sent it. He sent it to Senator Voinovich, which is what he should \nhave done. He is a cosponsor of the bill. But in it he says:\n\n       Retired steel workers, similar to their currently employed \n     counterparts [active workers], are suffering irreparable harm \n     as a result of unfair trade practices. This amendment offers \n     temporary relief for those retirees in the greatest need.\n       I urge you to support this amendment and thank you for your \n     attention to this important issue.\n\n  He says a lot of good things about the amendment. I ask unanimous \nconsent that also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                State of Ohio,\n\n                                       Columbus, OH, May 16, 2002.\n     Hon. George V. Voinvich,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Voinovich: I am writing to express my support \n     for an amendment planned to be included in the trade \n     adjustment assistance section of the trade bill being \n     considered today by the Senate. As you are aware, the health \n     benefits of retired steel workers have been terminated as a \n     result of failed steel companies. Tens of thousands of \n     retired steel workers, concentrated in Northeast Ohio, are \n     now without health care or are struggling to pay expensive \n     premiums.\n       I commend the President for his imposition of significant \n     remedies to defend our nation's steel industry from the \n     unfair trade practices of some foreign producers. \n     Unfortunately the relief did not come soon enough for some \n     companies. Major steel manufacturers have permanently closed, \n     health care and pension funds are exhausted and retirees are \n     left with few and costly health care options.\n       The Health Care Benefits Bridge program will allow retired \n     steel workers to receive a health care credit for one year \n     equal to 70 percent of the total cost of premium of health \n     care coverage under COBRA or state established plans. The \n     retirees would be responsible for the remaining 30 percent. \n     The bridge plan would limit eligibility those retirees who \n     have lost health care coverage because of the permanent \n     closure of their former employer.\n       Retired steel workers, similar to their currently employed \n     counterparts, are suffering irreparable harms as a result of \n     unfair trade practices. This amendment offers temporary \n     relief for those retirees in greatest need.\n       I urge you to support this amendment and thank you for your \n     attention to this important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Bob Taft,\n                                                         Governor.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I also want to make one point clear. Some people \nsay: Why can't the Department of Labor--which sort of decides on TAA \nmatters--why doesn't it just include, administratively, steel retirees?\n  They cannot. They do not have the power to do that. They do not have \nthe authority to do that. The retirees we are talking about--Senator \nWellstone, Senator Mikulski, myself, and Senator Stabenow, who \nobviously wants to say something--they do not have the power to do \nthat. They cannot include them on their own. It can only be done \nthrough action of the Congress, which is why this amendment is before \nus.\n  Back last summer, a number of us were doing the legacy bill, which is \nsort of the big solution, a $16 or $17 billion solution. And there is a \ngreat reason for that; it just did not happen to be a very compelling \none at the time we were doing it. But you have to do three things to \nmake steel work.\n  I apologize to my colleague from Michigan, because I know how much \nshe wants to speak.\n  You have to invoke section 201. That is the International Trade \nCommission. The Finance Committee had voted to do that. Oddly enough, \nthe Finance Committee has the same power under the law to invoke the \nInternational Trade Commission on the subject of imports and the damage \nfrom imports as does the President of the United States. So does the \nWays and Means Committee. They did not choose to invoke it. We did. So \nhad the President not invoked section 201, we would have, and already \nhad voted to do so. So the same process would have taken place.\n  The first thing you have to do is invoke section 201. What does that \ndo for you? It gives a little bit of a lift in the market, as I \nindicated, for 6 or 8 months. People feel a little bit better. But it \ndoes not last. It did buy us time, and we needed time. Because we have \nto think, how are we going to keep the steel industry together? How can \nwe have a 40 or 50-million-ton steel industry in a place called the \nUnited States of America, which sort of started this whole thing?\n  All around the world, everybody, when they want to get into the \nUnited Nations, they start a steel industry and they buy a 747. Now, \nthat is a little crude, and I apologize for saying that, but, frankly, \nthat is what you do to establish yourself as a real country: You have a \nnational airline--it might be one plane--and you have a steel industry. \nSo these imports just come flowing into our country from all over the \nworld. People underestimate the power of that. Of course, they are \ncheap because they are dealing with $1-an-hour labor, a little more or \na little less. And\n\n[[Page S4465]]\n\nthen sometimes our industries have to buy that because they have to \nsurvive.\n\n  So I want to stress the urgency of particularly what has happened \nbetween 1998 and 2000 and 2001, where this enormous import surge \novertook the United States in steel at the same time as another surge \nof total neglect on the part of the Government. This is not a partisan \nstatement about this administration. It was the same thing in the last \nadministration.\n  I can remember endless hours in the steel commission arguing with Bob \nRubin, Gene Spurling, and Charlene Barshefsky, and all kinds of high \nand mighty people. And they said: No, globalization is the deal. I \nsaid: I agree; it is the deal, and I voted for PNTR, and all the rest \nof it. But, frankly, we have something called a steel industry in \nSenator Stabenow's State and my State, and it is sort of the heart and \nsoul of America. But they were not interested.\n  I think Senator Wellstone's $800 million figure was, in fact, e-\nmailed by the White House to a whole lot of Senate offices just as late \nas this afternoon, trying, again, to scare us away from this amendment \nbased on cost.\n  I will just end with this thought. It almost seems impossible we \nwould be bringing an amendment to this body, an amendment which only \naffects 125,000 people at the present time, and they have to go through \nso much to even qualify. They have to have worked in the mill 15 years, \nand all the rest of it. And if the mill goes chapter 7--that is, goes \nbelly-up, completely--it has to do so by January of 2001. And then it \nonly lasts until January 1 of 2004. That means, if a West Virginia \nplant or a Michigan plant went belly-up and shut out the lights, sent \nout pink slips, with no health benefits, nothing, everything goes. The \nPension Benefit Guaranty Corporation does take care of the pensions, \nbut nobody takes care of health care. Nobody takes care of health care \nfor these people.\n  We still provide this amendment, which is so tightly constricted to \n125,000 people, costing $179 million over 10 years. Frankly, I don't \nknow why the White House does not say: We want this. We accept this. We \nwill take credit for it. It is a no-brainer. Yet, obviously, it is the \nsubject of filibustering and all kinds of divisions. And I regret that \nvery much.\n  There is really nothing quite like a steelworker. They sweat and \ntoil, as you can imagine. It is so dangerous. They lose arms, fingers, \nlegs. They work in 125 to 130-degree heat in the summer. I am not \npleading for them. I am just simply saying that when their company goes \nbelly-up because of Government inaction, by not enforcing the Federal \nlaws against imports, they deserve--if not to get cash, if not to get \ntraining, if not to get other benefits--at least to get health care \nbenefits.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise with great pride to be a \ncosponsor of this amendment. I thank my colleague from West Virginia \nfor his passion, his compassion, and his advocacy for great Americans--\nour great American steelworkers. He has been here over and over again \nfighting on behalf of the industry, fighting on behalf of workers, many \nof whom are in Michigan. I thank him for his leadership. I also thank \nSenator Wellstone from Minnesota for his ongoing leadership and \nadvocacy for our steelworkers, as well as thanking Senator Mikulski \nfrom Maryland.\n  This is a dynamic trio that I am very proud to join, and I very much \nappreciate the fact that they are coming back over and over and over \nagain until we can get this done.\n  I share my colleagues' view that we are coming with a critical yet \nmodest proposal in terms of how we debate in the Senate, covering \n125,000 retirees with health benefits at a cost of $179 million over 10 \nyears, which certainly sounds like a lot of money, but in terms that we \nare debating, it is a very small amount to put aside for a group of \npeople who have worked their whole lives to build America.\n  I find it so amazing, as we debated other bills--and we have talked \nabout our overreliance on energy and the need to do more domestic \nproduction--that we, at this time, would not be up in arms about the \npossibility, hopefully not probability, of losing an American steel \nindustry. I cannot imagine, in this time that we are focused on \nnational security and war on terrorism, that we would even, in any way, \nallow the possibility that we might lose our domestic steel industry. \nYet that is what is happening in our country.\n  We have only six iron ore mines in the country: four in Minnesota and \ntwo in Michigan. When they are closed, we will no longer have the \nability to pull the raw materials out of the ground.\n  The men and women in the upper peninsula of Michigan work very, very \nhard. They and their families have gone through layoffs. They have gone \nthrough mine closings. They are on the edge. This proposal is simply to \nsay that for those who are already retired, who had health benefits, \nwho were promised health benefits, whose companies closed--and we had \nover 33 of them closed since the year 2000--we would give them a 1-year \nreprieve, 1 year of health care benefits, to try to help in the \ntransition.\n  I very much appreciate the fact that the President has acknowledged \nthe concerns about steel and taken some action. There are efforts right \nnow to help the industry, to address the question of unfair dumping. \nThis is a small bridge for 125,000 people who are retired from an \nindustry that is critical. They built America. And I believe we owe \nthem at least that.\n  For those who are now working in the great State of Michigan, whether \nit is in the upper peninsula or whether it is in the lower peninsula of \nMichigan, down river or metro Detroit, we owe them, as well, to stop \nthe dumping, the unfair competition, so that we can give them an \nopportunity to succeed and give our steel companies, which are making \ninvestments, are efficient, and doing everything they can to stay \nafloat, the opportunity to succeed because we, as a country, need them \nto succeed.\n  The issue of steel in our country today is absolutely critical. While \nwe are working to find ways to stop unfair trade practices and, \nhopefully, the mechanisms and remedies that have been put into place \nwill have some kind of positive effect--we certainly hope so--while we \nare working for other ways to support the steelworkers and their \nfamilies, to support the businesses, this is a small way to acknowledge \nthe significance and the importance of the steel industry and the \nsteelworkers in the United States and to say for those who are \nretirees, who assumed when they would retire that they would have their \nhealth care benefits and who have lost them because of unfair \ncompetition, because of dumping in our country from other countries, \nthat we, in fact, will recognize them in this whole question of trade \nadjustment assistance.\n  I am proud to stand with my colleagues. I ask that we come together \nin a bipartisan way. With a small amount of investment, we can make a \nmajor statement and help 125,000 great Americans. I hope we will do \nthat.\n  I urge strong support for the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I see a few of the sponsors of the \namendment are present. Maybe either one of the sponsors, since they \nknow more about this amendment than I, might be able to respond.\n  I am wondering how much this amendment will cost. How much does it \ncost per family, per beneficiary? Would either the Senator from West \nVirginia or the Senator from Maryland tell me that? Many times health \ncare per family costs $7,000; sometimes steelworkers have very generous \nplans. Could they give me some idea of what it costs per family?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. As to the matter of how much it costs each family, \nthat is not yet available because the circumstances vary enormously. \nSometimes there might be a little bit of health care left over. In \nvirtually all cases, there was none left over.\n  The fact is the Joint Tax Committee, which looked at this in a rather \nconservative fashion, came out with a $179 million cost over a period \nof 10 years. I don't think the Senator from Oklahoma would challenge \nthat.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Per year or $179 million over a 10-year period?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Over a period of 10 years.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Does the program last for 12 months? How many months of\n\n[[Page S4466]]\n\nhealth care are we providing for retired steelworkers?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If the underlying amendment, referring to the TAA in \ngeneral and health care, prevailed----\n  Mr. NICKLES. Just the steelworkers.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I am answering, if the Senator would allow me to \nanswer the question the way I would like to. That can provide health \ncare for a couple of years, but not with the steelworker retirees. That \nis only a 12-month period, and that is it, once.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am just trying to learn what is in the Senator's \namendment. I am going to debate against it in a minute, but I want to \neducate myself on what I am debating.\n  The cost is $179 million over 10 years, but the program for \nsteelworkers only lasts for 1 year, the 12 months' benefits. So it is \nactually about $179 million for 1 year's benefits for the eligible \nsteelworkers in the Senator's amendment?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. That is correct. I think I understand what the \nSenator is also asking. And that is, if it is a 1-year program, we are \nonly talking about 10 years. I would be happy to hand over a chart \nexactly of what is proposed. In fact, the funding is zero for this \nyear, 86 for next year, 25 for following, 15, 16, 2, and then there is \na series of just dots and dashes, not contemplating that there will be \nanything in the succeeding 10 years. That is what it was done for. It \nwas done for 10 years.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will ask either Senator, the duration of the amendment \nto benefit only the steelworkers is for 12 months. I happen to have \ngreat respect for the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from West \nVirginia. I have a feeling that if that 12 months was expiring, that \nyou would be coming for an extension of the 12 months.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. The Senator is entirely wrong in that. I apologize \nto the Senator from Maryland. That is incorrect. This is not a question \nof something which comes up for reauthorization. This will not happen. \nOne year, once.\n  Mr. NICKLES. In the underlying Daschle amendment that was introduced \na week or so ago, it was a 2-year program; isn't that correct?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. In the underlying amendment for TAA workers who are \ndifferent than steel retirees; those are active workers you are talking \nabout. I am talking about steel retirees.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Correct me if I am wrong, active steelworkers would \napply and would benefit under the TAA proposal as any other TAA \neligible employee. The Senator's amendment applies only to retired \nsteelworkers?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. And correct me if I am wrong, you are talking about \nretired steelworkers basically in two plants, is that accurate? Or is \nthis retired steelworkers, any steelworker who happens to be retired? \nOr is it specifically to steelworkers who are in chapter 11 or chapter \n7?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If I can answer the Senator's question, it is not \nany steelworker. It isn't anybody in chapter 7 or chapter 11. It is \nonly to those who are vested, which by itself is a 15-year requirement. \nThey get nothing that TAA, if it were to pass, would get in the way of, \nsay, 2 years of health care. They don't get any cash. They don't get \nany transition. They don't get any retraining. All they get is 12 \nmonths of bridge health care, period, once.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Since we are not going to vote on this today and you are \nsponsoring the amendment, I have heard the arguments made. We want to \nhelp these families. And you are providing health care for the \nfamilies, 125,000 families, I believe I heard you say. I would like to \nknow, health care costs so much per month, so much per year per family. \nI would love for my colleagues to tell me how much these plans cost so \nwe would have a little better idea of the per-family benefit.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. It is 70 percent of the COBRA cost. That is what this \namendment is about. It is the same. COBRA costs on average about $700 a \nmonth. This picks up 70 percent. That is what we do for other \nemployees. That is the cost.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to know that. So if COBRA costs $700 a \nmonth----\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is an average.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am just trying to make sure we find out what we are \ntalking about. If COBRA costs $700 a month and you are talking about 70 \npercent of that, that is $500 a month. And you are talking about 12 \nmonths, so you are talking about $6,000 benefit per year. Is that \npretty close to accurate? I am just trying to figure this out so I will \nknow, if we are getting ready to give benefits to one particular \ngroup--as a matter of fact, a couple of companies--I kind of need to \nknow. I think it would be nice for the taxpayers to know.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. First of all, I am so glad that the Senator from \nOklahoma is in the Chamber. We are glad that Members who have concerns \nor even opposition are here. Let's do the clarification.\n  The Senator asked about the annual cost, $179 million over 10 years. \nFirst, in the year 2003, $85 million; 2004, $25 million because of a \npopulation dip; then up to $50 million in 2005; $18 million in 2006; \nand $2 million in 2007. And this is sunsetting at 2007. So the bill has \na sunset.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I think I have the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I just wanted to add about the complexity of going to \nthe family because you see these retirees, and the way this would work \nis that it is a tax credit to the risk pool that takes this on. So we \nare not quite sure what the individual family premiums would be. We \nasked Joint Tax and the Budget Committee, those who advise us, to tell \nus what would be the annual estimates, and then an estimate between now \nand 2007.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Well, I am not a big fan of tax credits, just so the \nSenator from Maryland knows--and the Senator from West Virginia already \nknows this about the Senator from Oklahoma. Therefore, I question the \nwisdom of doing this in tax credit form. It would be a lot more direct, \nlegitimate, for scorekeeping and otherwise, to say we are going to \nwrite a check, and here are thousands of people, and say pay for your \nhealth care, than to try to go through silly system of tax credits, \nwhere it doesn't work very well. I think maybe I will explain that at \nsome point.\n  I am trying to have a better understanding. If you have a 12-month \npayment--or assistance in payment, 70 percent--for steelworkers, and we \nare doing that for 12 months, this is 2002; why are we making payments \nin 2004 and 2005? I don't understand that.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I will be happy to try to answer that. First of all, \nincluded in the $179 million--which I assume came as some surprise to \nthe Senator from Oklahoma, because that is the entire cost over the \nentire amendment--the scoring group took into account what would \nhappen, for example, not with just the 125,000 we have this year, but \nsuppose Bethlehem Steel in Maryland, as could happen, went chapter 7, \nwent belly-up next year; the Senator from Oklahoma should know--and \nthere might be some residuals; there might be a caretaker or \ngrandmother who has a dependent. If that company goes belly-up, that is \nalready included in the $179 million. They looked at the condition of \nwhat they adjudged to be the steel industry and its future, and the \nhealth care cost attending to that and made their judgment. So your \nquestion still comes back to $179 million.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate the clarification. If a company went \nbankrupt in 2004, they could receive benefits under this amendment, is \nthat correct, up to 12 months?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If one takes the scoring of this offset, one could \nposture that, and one could also raise the question that it might not \nhappen. They were trying to figure out as best they could--and who can \nfigure these things out absolutely perfectly--what is likely to happen \nin the steel industry and what the health care consequences are for \nretirees. All of that fits within the $179 million.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I wonder, as well, as the sponsors of the amendment are \nvery close to the steelworkers, if they can provide this Senator, over \nthe next couple of days, what the benefits are and what the benefit \npackage costs for retirees. Those are collectively bargained packages. \nI could probably find\n\n[[Page S4467]]\n\nthat on the Internet. These are packages they provide for retirees. \nGiven this fact, I would like to know, are we subsidizing plans that \nare very generous, comparable to Federal employees? I don't know.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. If I may answer the Senator, unlike the coal \nindustry, the steel industry has a whole series of different bargained \nhealth benefit packages. I don't know exactly, but my guess is that \nright now the steel companies probably pay about 90 percent of the \nhealth care costs of the steelworkers, and the steelworkers pay 10 \npercent. So they have already gone from 90 percent down to 70 percent, \nand then they have their choice, as the Governor of Ohio, Governor \nTaft, indicated, of using a variety of risk pools. It could be a \nvariety of programs, but it is not a constant figure. It could vary, \nand it is definitely not based upon what it is they negotiated. They \nhave made tremendous cuts and sacrifices from the agreements they \nnegotiated with the steel company.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. What age of eligibility can people--when you think of \nretirees, you think of somebody at age 65. What is the earliest age a \nretired steelworker might be who might receive benefits under this \nproposal?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. As best we can figure, 25 percent of the \nsteelworkers who might receive this proposal are not receiving \nMedicare. As such, none have prescription drugs.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Correct me if I am wrong, so you have it that 75 percent \nof the pool are now Medicare eligible, is that correct?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Without the prescription drugs, correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. And 75 percent of the beneficiaries--the 125,000 \npeople--are eligible for Medicare, is that correct?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. That is correct.\n  Mr. NICKLES. And 25 percent are not eligible for Medicare, so \npresumably under the age of 62, is that correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Under 65.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I stand corrected, 65. So what is the earliest age that \na beneficiary can receive benefits under the Senator's proposal?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I don't think it is a question of what is the age. \nIt is a question of what happened to the company, when did it fit into \nthe dates. We have constricted it by saying that the company had to go \nbelly-up, so to speak, by January 1, 2000, until the year January 1, \n2004. You cannot tell what the age might be. We could presumably find \nout what the ages are right now, but you cannot predict that in the \nfuture because it does not depend on the age; it depends upon whether \nthe company has gone out of business.\n  Mr. NICKLES. One additional question. If a young person--say my son, \nor your son, is twenty-years-old, goes to work for a steel company and \nworks there for 12 years or 15 years. Now they are 35 years old. \nCompany XYZ goes bankrupt, so now that individual would they be \neligible for this benefit at the age of 35?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes. The eligibility is based on the status of the \ncompany, meaning is it bankrupt; No. 2, if the individual has worked \nfor the company for 15 years, not less, and if they have taken \nretirement. Now, they could be 38 years old. The company could be \nbankrupt. They could be out of work. That doesn't mean they have become \nretirees. So your scenario, though I think it would be technically \ncorrect, is not operationally correct.\n  So 75 percent are Medicare-eligible. The other 25 percent usually are \nover 55, but are primarily between 60 and 65. This is why we are \ncalling part of this a bridge. For some, it would be 1 year to even get \nthem to Medicare.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Let me ask one other question. To be eligible, then they \nhave to be receiving retirement pay to be called a retiree?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. NICKLES. So you could work 15 years and I don't know how many \nyears you have to work--\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. May I correct the Senator for a second? Remember \nthat the company they are working for no longer exists in order for \nthem to qualify.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I understand. I am trying to figure out who is eligible. \nSo I think I heard the Senator from Maryland say they are eligible if \nthey are receiving retirement checks. They may be receiving the checks \nfrom the steel company, which even though the company went bankrupt, it \nmay well still be making payments for pension benefits, or maybe it \ndumped their liabilities on the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation, \nor there may be some other consortium employer payment plan. But if \nthey are receiving their retirement check, they are classified as \nretiree. What is the earliest age a person can be receiving a \nretirement check as a steel worker?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. That would vary company by company.\n  Mr. NICKLES. After 15, 20 years of service?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Usually after 20.\n  Mr. NICKLES. A couple other questions, and then I will make a few \ncomments.\n  If we are doing this for the steelworkers, how can you say we should \nnot do this for the textile workers?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Can I answer the Senator's question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Why shouldn't we do it for the communication workers or \nthe airline workers or the hotel workers in Nevada?\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. May I answer the Senator's question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. Yes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. There has never been a case I know of in American \nhistory where the Government, over a period of 30 years, since the \npassing of the Trade Act in 1974, has been so absolutely unilaterally \negregiously negligent of the interests of fulfilling American law which \nsays that steel cannot be dumped at lower than its cost of production \nby other countries into this country.\n  As my colleague may remember, President Clinton promised--actually it \nturns out it was West Virginia--he would not allow dumping to happen. \nThe present administration has made similar types of promises. They and \nall other administrations have egregiously ignored the law. That is why \nI keep saying the Government's negligence is what makes the steel \nretirees so different in what they deserve and what they should get in \nthe way of this modest health benefit for so few, primarily because, \none, they have been injured by imports--that is what the International \nTrade Commission said--and second, the Government has been so totally \nnegligent. Much of this is the Government's fault they are out of \nwork--our Federal Government.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I appreciate my colleague's response. I want to make a \nfew comments, and I appreciate the patience of my friends and \ncolleagues from Maryland, West Virginia, and Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, can I say one thing? I am not taking \nthe floor. I know the Senator from Oklahoma wants to speak, and I will \nhave a chance to respond. I thank him for his questions. It is \nimportant to get all of this information out. It is important for \npeople to understand the human crisis.\n  I say to my colleague, there are a lot of people who are really \nhurting out there, as my colleague from West Virginia has said; people \nwho have been on the short end of the stick for over three decades of \nnegligent policy. I thank my colleague very much for his questions.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friend from Minnesota.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield so I can make an \nannouncement to the Senate?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the majority leader asked me to announce \nthat there will be no more rollcall votes tonight. Also, tomorrow, \nafter we have the vote at 10:30 a.m., there will be ample opportunity \nfor those who are on the list to offer amendments if the Senators \ninvolved in the steel issue have nothing more to say and they have no \nobjection to setting aside their amendment.\n  Also, we will be in session on Monday. People who are complaining \nabout not having an opportunity to offer amendments, tomorrow and \nMonday there will be adequate opportunity to do that. There will be no \nvotes, but there will certainly be opportunities to offer amendments.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, can I ask the whip one question?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I know other Senators have amendments. I gather there\n\n[[Page S4468]]\n\nwill be some opportunity for discussion in the morning on this \namendment, and there will be other amendments. On Monday, is it the \nwhip's intention we will be in session Monday evening as well for time \nto discuss this amendment?\n\n  Mr. REID. The Senator should know, there are no votes on Monday, so I \ndo not know how late the leader will want to stay in session. I assume \nwe will come in around 1 o'clock on Monday and work all afternoon. If \nthe Senator from Minnesota wants to talk about steel, that will be the \nfirst priority. If Senators no longer want to talk about steel, we can, \nif Senators agree, set that amendment aside so other amendments can be \noffered. There will be adequate opportunity Monday evening to talk on \nthis all the Senator wants.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Then Tuesday we will have time for final debate as \nwell.\n  Mr. REID. We will make sure that is the case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The assistant Republican leader.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Nevada. I also \nurge colleagues if they have amendments to bring them down. I hope and \npray we will be ready to conclude this bill soon.\n  I do not think the amendment my colleagues from West Virginia and \nMaryland offered should be included in the bill. I think it is a killer \namendment. I am concerned what people are trying to do in loading up \nthe trade promotion authority bill. They know President Bush wants \ntrade promotion authority, as every President has wanted trade \npromotion authority. Every President wants to negotiate trade deals \nbecause they realize if we are going to be the world leader in trade, \nwe need to expand trade.\n  We have been the beacon, the leader for trade all across the world. \nPresident Reagan, whom we honored today with a Congressional Gold \nMedal, was adamant in saying we want to expand trade. We did so, and \nthat greatly contributed to the fall of communism. It opened up \nmarkets. It created jobs. It led to a robust world economy. Everybody \nstarted realizing that trade is mutually beneficial, we should pass \ntrade promotion authority, and every President has had trade promotion \nauthority going all the way up, including President Clinton. He had it \nin his first couple years but lost it in 1994, and did not ask for it \nuntil after the 1996 election.\n  When President Clinton asked for it, he could not get it through the \nHouse. He could have gotten it through the Senate. We had the votes for \nit. The Senate traditionally has been more free trade. Unfortunately, \nhe did not get it for the duration of his term, and many of us \nsupported giving it to him.\n  Whether the President was Republican or Democratic, we felt it was \nimportant. We happen to be supporters of free trade enough to know we \nhave to be the leader in free trade if we are going to make it happen. \nIt did not happen. President Bush asked for it and got it through the \nHouse. It is always more difficult to get it through the House than the \nSenate. President Bush got it through the House. Everybody said it was \ngoing to go through the Senate.\n\n  Senator Daschle said: I support trade promotion authority, but we are \ngoing to add two other bills to it. Senator Baucus agreed. I disagree \nwith it strongly.\n  When we passed these bills out of the Finance Committee, they were \nnot together. They were individual bills, as they always have been. We \nhave always had trade promotion authority as one bill. We have done the \ntrade assistance bill separately and both passed with large margins, \nusually a 70-vote margin. We did not have to tie the two together.\n  Unfortunately, Senator Daschle and Senator Baucus tied in the Andean \ntrade bill, which actually has to pass today, and it is not passing \ntoday. Now we could have imposition of tariffs on poor countries, \nAndean nation countries. It would be a disgrace for us to let that \nhappen.\n  Yet the Democratic leadership said we are going to tie all three \ntogether. Basically, what they were saying--and not hiding it--is we \nare going to hold trade promotion authority and Andean trade hostage \nuntil we get a lot of other things added to the trade adjustment \nassistance bill. I supported trade adjustment assistance, but let's \nlook at how they are trying to expand it.\n  They said: Let's have trade adjustment assistance, which is supposed \nto train people if they lose jobs due to imports, to learn a new job, \nnew business, new trade. I fully support this. Usually it costs about \n$10,000 per person. Only one out of four who is eligible applies. The \nDemocrats are saying now we want health care to be a benefit for this \nand have the Federal Government pay three-fourths of the cost. That was \ntheir original proposal. Now it is 70 percent. We do not pay three-\nfourths for anybody. Why is it a Federal responsibility to pay now a \n70-percent tax credit? Most corporations get a deduction. That is 35 \npercent of a deduction. There is a big difference between a 70-percent \ncredit where the Government is writing a check and under this proposal. \nThis proposal is a refundable credit, it is a welfare payment, it is \nthe Government writing a check. That is very expensive.\n  Then some people say: Maybe we can do that. That is not enough. Now \nwe are going to have steel legacy costs for one industry, and now we \nfind it is not just one industry, it is not just retired steelworkers, \nit is retired steelworkers for a couple of bankrupt companies. These \nare companies that went bankrupt, and we are going to pick up their \nhealth care costs.\n  Three-fourths of these individuals are already eligible for Medicare. \nThey are in the same Government health care program that my mother is \nin and that most senior citizens are in, but my colleagues are saying \nthat is not good enough; we have to have the Federal Government provide \nadditional health care.\n  A lot of companies do offer Medicare supplements. Great. And they do \nthat in a way that says: We do not want anybody to go out of pocket for \nanything. That is nice. It is a fringe benefit. Only some companies do \nthis, as it is not available for everybody. There are a whole lot of \npeople who only have Medicare. My colleagues want the Federal \nGovernment to pay for Medicare supplements for retired steelworkers if \ntheir company went bankrupt.\n  Why are we going to do that? If we do it for them, why not do it for \ntextile workers? They have the same problems. Why do we not do it for \ncommunication workers? Senator Lott--WorldCom is going through a heck \nof a debacle. They have laid off thousands of people.\n  What about other communications companies? We see layoffs after \nlayoffs. Is the Federal Government picking up their health care costs? \nWhere are we going to stop this march toward socialism with Government \nsaying: We will benefit this group and this group.\n  We benefited the railroad retirees. We helped take care of their \nrailroad retirement plan. Yes, we have done that. Let's take care of \nsteel.\n  We have already imposed tariffs that are supposed to help the steel \nindustry. That is not enough. So even though we are going to have all \nkinds of tariff protectionism for the steel industry, that is still not \nenough. Now we are going to pick up the retirement costs for some of \nthe bankrupt companies. Why do we not have a real incentive for people \nto sign any kind of contract, whether they can afford it or not, \nbecause Uncle Sam is going to pick up the cost? Wow, that is terribly \nirresponsible policy. How can it be done for this group and not for \nanother group?\n  When we start this policy where Uncle Sam is going to start picking \nup retiree costs, I am figuring out you can be 35 or 37 years old and \nget benefits under this proposal. Most people who are 37 years old--my \nson is about that age. I do not think of him as being retired, but to \nthink my daughter is going to have to be paying taxes for him to get \nhealth care benefits is absurd. Yet that is what we are trying to do in \nthis legislation.\n  I am amazed at the fiscal irresponsibility that people are trying to \nput on this, and when I say ``people,'' I am thinking right now of the \nDemocrats who are trying to run the trade adjustment assistance and \ntrying to attach more and more stuff on it, and maybe it is because \nthey really do not want trade promotion authority in the first place. \nMaybe some of the people are saying, we did health care, we did not \nthink some of the Republicans could agree with that, now we will try to \nsee if we can't put steel legacy; let us put more and more on this \nwagon and see if\n\n[[Page S4469]]\n\ntrade promotion can keep pulling more and more along. They are going \ntoo far. This is terrible policy.\n  I used to run a company that had the steelworkers in our plan. I have \nnegotiated steelworker plans, so I know a little something about health \ncare costs and I know a little something about plans. You can negotiate \ncontracts you cannot afford. That is an easy thing to do. You go along \nto get along. You sign contracts. You have peace and harmony, and all \nof a sudden you have a contract you cannot afford, and you go bankrupt. \nWhy in the world should the Federal Government be bailing out?\n  I do not think you can do that. If you do it here, why don't you do \nit for every other union contract that has found itself on the wrong \nside of the economic chain? Why don't we pick up the health care costs \nfor railroad retirees? We took up their pension costs. Why don't we do \ntheir health care costs? Why don't we do that for other unions? I do \nnot know where you would stop if we agreed to this.\n  We have already had a battle on, are we going to have wage insurance \non this bill? Unfortunately, Senator Gregg's amendment did not pass. \nWage insurance, which is about as socialistic a direction as one could \ngo, was put on this bill. It is almost like people are saying we are \ngoing to keep loading up trade adjustment assistance, where we know \nthey cannot swallow it, where we know we are going to bog down this \nbill, and the bill will not pass. This bill is just going to be loved \nto death. We are going to keep piling it on, piling it on, and piling \nit on.\n  I hope people will step back a little bit and say a couple of things \nare happening. One, we happen to have a deficit. We do not have a \nsurplus. So we are going to be taking taxes and we are going to be \nborrowing money to pay for a brandnew benefit for one little group of \nworkers. Now, maybe that group of workers has a lot of political clout, \nmaybe they contribute to a lot of campaigns, maybe they have a lot of \ninfluence, but I do not see why we should do it for this group and not \ndo it for others.\n\n  Maybe some people think we should do this for everybody. Maybe that \nis the objective. I do not know. But I do not think it is affordable \nwhen I start looking at the costs.\n  The Senator from Minnesota was very generous to say the cost of COBRA \nis typically about $700. That is for a family plan. Then you multiply \nit by 12, and that is $8,400. Seventy percent of that is about $6,000; \n$6,000 per year for which Uncle Sam is going to be writing a check. \nThat is a lot.\n  The reason I was trying to compute this was, well, $125,000, and it \nis going to cost $179 million. Trying to figure that out, it is a lot \nless than that. The difference is, three-fourths of these people are \nalready on Medicare. They already have health care. They happen to have \nthe same health care my mother has, but my mother is going to be paying \ntaxes so some individuals can get their Medicare supplement? I do not \nknow that that is right.\n  I do not know why the worker in Wal-Mart, who may not even have \nhealth care, has to pay taxes so somebody else can get not only \nMedicare but a Medicare supplement. This is pretty much a stretch.\n  There are 40 million Americans who do not have health care insurance. \nThey have health care, possibly through the emergency room or \nsomething, but a lot of them pay taxes. They may not be able to afford \ntheir own health care, but we are going to increase their taxes or make \nthem go into debt so they can provide health care for somebody else who \nalready has health care, who is already paying a lot because they get \nMedicare.\n  Medicare is not a perfect system. I think it needs to be reformed. It \nneeds to be fixed. It needs to include prescription drugs, and we ought \nto be doing that this year. We ought to be working in a bipartisan way \nto make it happen. To say we are going to be increasing taxes or debt \non the rest of America so one group can have their Medicare supplement \nor people in their thirties or forties can get health care for a year--\nand we all know the original proposal was 2 years. I also happen to \nbelieve that some people are going to try to extend this year after \nyear, after year, after year. If they get it for 1 year, they will be \nfighting to get it extended for the next year. I am just guessing that \nmight happen.\n  I am going to work very hard to see that this bill does not happen, \nso we will not get started down that slippery slope of ever increasing \nentitlements, ever increasing expansion of spending, ever increasing \nloading up the trade promotion authority with things that are not \naffordable, that frankly should not become law. My guess is that if \nthis amendment is adopted, we will not have trade promotion authority \npassed this Congress.\n  Maybe that is the sponsor's objective. Maybe not. I do not know. But \nsome people are trying to kill trade promotion authority. They are \ntrying to load it up with too much. This amendment is too much, and I \nurge my colleagues to oppose this amendment when we vote on it next \nTuesday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do not know if the other side has had an \nopportunity to speak. I know they have had an exchange of questions. I \nneed 3 or 4 minutes, if I may, and I will use my leader time for that \npurpose.\n  I enjoyed Senator Nickles' remarks, and I associate myself with them. \nI agree with him, and I certainly hope we can prevail in not adding \nthis amendment to this legislation. It would be a further blow to the \nlegislation that has certain problems now. We need to get the trade \nlegislation done and not further encumber it with other issues such as \nthis one. One can argue about the steel legacy costs one way or the \nother, and I am sure we could get a pretty good debate here. I \npersonally think we should not go down that trail, certainly not on \nthis legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/16/senate-section/article/S4469-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4469-S4470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      QUIETING TERRORISM RHETORIC\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I did not intend to use my leader time for \nany purpose today other than to honor a true American hero: Ronald \nReagan. We just had a fantastic ceremony in the Rotunda of the Capitol \npresenting Mrs. Reagan the Congressional Gold Medal for President \nReagan and for Nancy Reagan. It was a beautiful ceremony attended by \nRepublicans and Democrats. I think we all agree that he was an unusual \nPresident and a great President. He did make us proud again. Democrats \nwere there, and they said, while we may not agree with him \nphilosophically, we agree that he did a great number of good things \nduring his time as President, and I am glad we honored him and Mrs. \nReagan this afternoon.\n  President Reagan lifted our country when we had a lot of despair, \nmorale was low, and freedom was kind of under attack. He banished that. \nHe rose above it. He made us proud again, and he led the way in getting \nrid of the ``blame America first'' crowd. He said: That is poisoning \nthe American spirit; let's not do that.\n  Much to my outrage today, I have heard a chorus reminding me of that \n``blame America first'' that I thought President Reagan had helped us \nput on the ash heap of history and get rid of once and for all. I think \nthere is nothing more despicable--and that is a tame word compared to \nwhat I really feel--in American politics than for someone to insinuate \nthe President of the United States knew that an attack on our country \nwas imminent and did nothing to stop it.\n  Now, there is a lot of revisionist history, people insinuating that \nPresident Roosevelt knew about Pearl Harbor. I do not know all the \nfacts of what went on then, but I do not believe that. I would never \nbelieve that. I have to say, does anybody really think that this \nPresident, or any President of either party, at any time, would know \nthat we were going to be attacked and not take necessary actions to try \nto deal with it? I do not believe the American people really think \nthat. I know it is not accurate.\n  The President, Members of Congress, the Intelligence Committee, \nleadership, we get threat assessments daily. They come in every day, \nand they get to be pretty depressing if you get to reading them. When \ngetting the briefings every day, you have to assess them: Are they \nserious, not serious? Should we take actions? Do we put out a notice? \nWhat do we do with them?\n  I get nervous that we put too much in the press. We tell the \nterrorists, who\n\n[[Page S4470]]\n\nmay not have an idea of where we are vulnerable: Oh, by the way, why \ndon't you try this?\n  Why don't you come after our ports? I worry a tramp steamer will come \ninto the Port of Baltimore loaded with explosives and blow half of \nBaltimore away. I worry about my hometown. These are serious threats. \nWe have a lot of work to do.\n  I have an expectation that we need to ask our law enforcement \nagencies--the INS, the Customs Service, the FBI, the CIA--how did this \nhappen? Why didn't we know more? Should we have gone to a higher alert? \nCIA, were you talking to the FBI? We found out we had laws that made it \nhard for that to happen. We have taken action to make sure they hand \noff and communicate and use each other's resources.\n  I have no doubt in my mind the FBI needs a lot of reform. I don't \nthink they are up to date with technology and other problems. But \nDirector Mueller is trying to correct that. Maybe they knew something \nin Phoenix they didn't know in Washington. Is there a way to integrate \neverything?\n  A couple of days ago, the Director said we will have a superoffice to \nbring in this information and make sure we look at it all and see if \nthere is a pattern.\n  I think we should ask questions. We have an Intelligence Committee, \nHouse and Senate, meeting; Senator Graham, Senator Shelby, and the \nHouse side will get into this. By the way, I think the FBI and CIA \nshould not delay turning over information. They should cooperate. It \nshould not be about blaming someone.\n  We could say it goes back to the Church Commission in the 1970s. That \nis when we did damage to the intelligence communities. Or it was during \nthe Clinton administration. The important thing is not how we get \nthere, but what we are going to do. What are we doing about it today? \nWhat actions do we take to make sure the intelligence information is \nproperly accumulated and evaluated and we can take action?\n  Someone deserves a medal for the fact we have not been hit again \nsince September 11. I have been worried thinking something was going to \nhappen. Why hasn't it happened? Because the INS and the Justice \nDepartment, the FBI, picked up people. They have taken certain threats \nseriously. They picked up mules delivering information. Probably there \nare commendations in order for the last 6 months, but I am worried \nabout what will happen next. It could happen tomorrow. Then we will say \nit was the Bush administration, when we need to put more resources into \nit. We need to help our first responders.\n  The Intelligence Committee voted to add $1 billion to the \nintelligence funding. We are still exposed. When we have terrorists, \nsuicide bombers as in Israel, willing to blow themselves up to kill \ninnocent men, women, and children, it is hard to prevent it. When we \nhear the noise and daily threat assessments, it is worse, and we do not \nknow which should be taken seriously.\n  To talk as if our enemy is George W. Bush instead of Osama bin Laden \nis not right. We get partisan and political sometimes around here \ntalking about a delayed bill or stimulus bill, but in the fight against \nterrorism we have risen above that, for the most part.\n  Congressman Gephardt said yesterday, this has to be bipartisan, \nnonpartisan. I am disturbed by this attack today that I think is \nuncalled for. It is very malicious in its sound. I hope we will stop \nthat. Let's not go down that course. Let's keep the pattern of working \ntogether. Let's not start impugning the motives of the President of the \nUnited States.\n  Was there anyone here that did not realize we were threatened a year \nago by the possibility of an airliner being taken hostage? Hijacked? \nWho among us thought they might actually use it as a missile to fly \ninto a building? I got a lot of briefings. Is it my fault? Should I \nhave known more? We should knock down the rhetoric. Yes, it is a \npolitical season, an election year. But this is serious. We should not \nbe doing this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I will not take more than about 10 minutes. I said to \nmy colleague from Oklahoma as he left, I wanted to respond to his \ncomments. There will be more time for discussion later. What is at \nissue, the Senator from Oklahoma does not agree with the heart of the \ntrade adjustment assistance package, and he has been clear about this. \nHe does not like the fact that with the trade adjustment assistance we \nare now going to help people who are out of work, cover health care \ncosts.\n  People were saying: We are out of work. The COBRA monthly payments \ncould be $700, maybe $900 a month, and they cannot afford it, they are \nout of work.\n  I heard the Republican whip say this was like the road to socialism. \nThe ideological objection is in the trade adjustment package we are \nactually going to provide some help for people to be able to afford \nhealth care costs. That is a good part of his indignation. He goes on \nto say we are extending it to steelworkers.\n  That is true. We are talking about people who have bled for an \nindustry and have been abandoned by trade policies for the last 30 \nyears, including the taconite workers on the Iron Range.\n  This small, modest amendment says, for 1 year, let's include these \nretired workers, whose companies, such as LTV, have declared bankruptcy \nas a result of Government abandonment and neglect, and who are now \nunder very hard times through no fault of their own. We should at least \nfor 1 year pick up the health care benefits of the retirees because the \ncompanies have walked away.\n  There is a window, all together, 4 years to pick up, if other \ncompanies go under; a 1-year bridge for people who are terrified they \nnow are going to incur all the health care costs that they never \ndreamed they would ever be faced with as they planned the later years \nof their life.\n  My colleague has trouble with the numbers. Last week, the \nadministration came out and said it would be $800 million in 1 year, \nand now we have, from the Joint Tax Committee, $180 million over 10 \nyears.\n  My colleague from Oklahoma says: Why should we be spending this kind \nof money? We are helping people. This is the road to socialism. We are \nhelping people. If we help these people, there might be other help for \nother people on health care benefits.\n  Maybe someday we will have universal health care coverage, health \nsecurity for all. Most citizens in the country want that.\n  I say one thing to the Senator from Oklahoma--and I am sure we will \npick up on this debate tomorrow--any day of the year I will stake my \npolitical reputation, being a Senator from Minnesota on $180 million \nover 10 years to help steelworker retirees, people who have given a lot \nof blood, sweat, and tears to our country over $108 billion--I didn't \nsay $180 million--$108 billion to do away with the estate tax, with the \nvast majority of the dollars going to millionaires.\n  Those are the priorities we have here. I hear my colleague say: By \ngosh, we don't have the money. We are running into budget problems and \nthe question of the deficit. Vote for tax cuts; Robin Hood in reverse; \n40, 50 percent to the top 1 percent, and then eliminate the alternative \nminimum tax; more loopholes for multinationals. On the House side, do \nan energy bill of $32 billion; about two-thirds of the benefits going \nto energy companies, oil companies, that made $40 billion in profits; \nthen talk about completely doing away with the estate tax. Give it all \naway. Then bleed the economy further of another $400, $500 or $600 \nbillion over the second 10 years and then say: We don't have the \nmoney. We can't possibly help people who are out of work. We can't help \nthe retired taconite workers. We can't help people who do not have any \nhealth care coverage. We can't help senior citizens on prescription \ndrug benefits.\n\n  I heard my colleague say we should do that together. Yes, we should. \nBut you watch and see what it is going to be. What I hear so far coming \nfrom Republicans is: We will help only those who are low income; we \nwill not help the other 75 percent of senior citizens; and/or: The \npremiums will be too high, or the copays will be too high, or the \ndeductibles will be too high, or it will\n\n[[Page S4471]]\n\nnot be catastrophic coverage. And they will say we cannot afford to do \nit and we cannot afford to provide help for education for our schools, \nfor our kids in Minnesota or anywhere in the country. Each time, it is \nthe same argument: We do not have the money.\n  Here is what is going on tonight. You basically do tax cuts so you \ndon't have the resources, and then you come out and say we don't have \nany money. Then you come out and say you are opposed to this because it \nis the road to socialism because you don't like the trade adjustment \nassistance package because it provides some help for people who are out \nof work so they can afford health care coverage.\n  The most terrifying thing for people when they are out of work, next \nto losing the job, is they know, depending on their seniority, in 6 \nmonths or a year they are not going to have any health care coverage. \nThat is one of the best things to this bill. We come up with a small \namendment saying we represent steelworkers, taconite workers, and we \nhave this crisis, and we have this industry that has been torn asunder \nas a result of horrible, horrendous trade policies.\n  People who bled for the industry, bled for the country, worked hard \nall their lives, now are terrified. They never thought these companies \nwould declare bankruptcy and walk away from them. Can't we provide them \nwith some help for 1 year?\n  You would think, from listening to my colleague from Oklahoma, this \nis just about the most irresponsible, horrible thing that could ever be \ndone on the floor of the Senate. I disagree. I think it is a good thing \nto help hard-working people. I think it is a good thing to help \nfamilies. I think it is a good thing to help retirees who now no longer \nhave their health care benefits because the steel companies, the LTVs \nof this world, have declared bankruptcy and have walked away from them.\n  I think it is a good thing to have trade adjustment assistance. I \nthink it is a good thing that it is more generous. I think it is a good \nthing to help people who are flat on their backs through no fault of \ntheir own, not because they are slackers or lazy or don't want to \nwork--just the opposite. I think it is a really good thing. I think \nthis should be what our priorities are about. I think it is all about \nvalues. I think it is all about helping people.\n  So I beg to disagree with the Senator from Oklahoma. He has a passion \nfor his point of view. I have passion for my point of view. He argues \nhis case well. I give him full credit. I think it is important that \npeople do that. But any day of the year--any day of the year--I would \nrather be out here for taconite workers on the Iron Range, as would the \nPresiding Officer, Senator Dayton. Any day in the year, I would rather \nbe out here talking about health care benefits and prescription drug \nbenefits, affordable housing, education--and, yes, we have a difference \nof opinion.\n  I am sorry my colleague from Oklahoma is not here right now. We will \ndebate it more. I will never say this in a shrill way. I think my \ncolleague from Oklahoma--listening to what he said--states his \nideological position. And I don't mean that in a bad way. That is to \nsay he has a set of beliefs which basically say that when it comes to \nmany pressing issues of people's lives, there is not much that \ngovernment can or should do. I think that is what his position is.\n\n  That is not my position. I think this philosophy when it comes to the \nmost pressing issues of people's lives--and we are talking about a very \npressing issue for retired taconite workers on the Iron Range, and for \nretired steelworkers, that there is nothing the Government can or \nshould do--I think it works well when you own your own large \ncorporation and when you are wealthy, but it does not work well for the \nmajority of people in the country.\n  So I think it is a very good thing we are doing here. I hope we will \nget support against what is an effort to filibuster this amendment.\n  Again, I finish tonight because we are going to debate on another \nbill and this amendment will be out here until Tuesday. Frankly, \nsteelworkers, I will tell you what. Union people, workers, other \nneighbors, families, hard-working people, people who believe that \nsomething ought to be done to help people who are really hurting right \nnow, you are going to need to be in touch with Senators because right \nnow we have a majority of votes but they are filibustering this \namendment. They do not want this amendment to pass. I think in the next \nseveral days there will be a very important debate, and I hope we will \nhave strong support from our colleagues.\n  I am delighted there are Republican Senators who are supporting this \namendment. Frankly, I think--I hope and pray--almost every single \nDemocratic is supporting this amendment. I think it is very consistent \nwith what Democrats believe.\n  Maybe that is what this debate is about. Maybe it is just a good, \nhonest difference of opinion between Democrats and Republicans. We \nbelieve there is a role for government to provide help for people. We \nbelieve it is a good thing to do. Government can play a positive role.\n  This is 1 year, and, God knows, Senator Mikulski was saying we have \nan identification and connection to people here and we are not going to \nlet up on it.\n  So I have spoken my piece in response to what the Senator from \nOklahoma said. I know there will be more debate and discussion. I know \nthere are Republicans who support this amendment. We are dealing with a \nfilibuster in an effort to block this. We have a majority vote, Senator \nMikulski, I believe, but now we have to continue to work hard, and I \nthink working families all across the country are going to have to be \nheard from over the next several days. I believe that will help.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I \ncongratulate the Senator from Minnesota. I thank him for his passion. I \nthank him for his persistence. I thank him for his eloquence on this \nissue and others on behalf of people from his own State and all over \nour country who feel pretty powerless. They feel powerless because of \nforces outside of their control, such as unfair trade practices. We \nthank you for speaking up about this. I look forward to our continued \ndebate.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland and \ntell her there is nothing I am more proud of than to be on the floor \ndoing this amendment with the Senator from Maryland and Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Stabenow and the Presiding Officer, Senator \nDayton, Senator Specter, and others.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We know there is an important debate on NATO, so we are \nnot going to continue this discussion until later on, over the weekend.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. I wanted to get your attention and that of the Senator from \nMinnesota before he leaves. I have watched this debate all day. Of \ncourse, I have listened to these Senators many times off the floor, \nboth of them, as it relates to steelworkers. I would say the same thing \non behalf of Senator Rockefeller.\n  We do not make steel in Nevada. We have some retired steelworkers in \nNevada who have conversed with me, and this issue is important to them. \nBut I want everyone within the sound of my voice to understand how the \npeople of Maryland, West Virginia, and Minnesota should feel about the \nadvocacy of these three Senators on this issue.\n  I haven't been in Congress as long as the Senator from Maryland, but \nI have been in Congress a long time. I have not seen the passion on an \nissue, that I can recall, that I have seen on this issue with these \nSenators. If these three Senators are not true believers on this issue, \nthey do not exist on any issue in the world.\n  I cannot say enough: I support what you want 105 percent. You have \nmade a case so clear that I cannot imagine that people would in any way \nwant to stop these steelworkers from getting what they are entitled \nto--what I believe they are entitled to. They went to work for these \ncompanies in good faith. I think they should get what they deserve.\n  I just didn't want these two Senators to leave--I am sorry Senator \nRockefeller is not here--without speaking for virtually every \nDemocratic Senator and a few Republican Senators who are supporting us \non this issue: I think it is too bad there is a filibuster.\n  I think it is too bad. I hear all the time--I spend a lot of time on \nthis floor--``give us an up-or-down vote.''\n\n[[Page S4472]]\n\nThat is what we want, an up-or-down vote. That is what we want on this \nissue.\n  Let's come out here. They are always saying: Let us have a vote. I \nwant to have a vote on this. I would like to test this to see how many \nvotes we can get. I think it is too bad we are going to be forced to \ntry to get 60 votes. And I think, for the work that has been done on \nthis issue, it is too bad.\n  But I hope with the time that goes by, that by next week people in \nthese States will rise up and say: You better vote for this. I am not \ncounting out, by one second, the fact that we can't get 60 votes. I \nthink we can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for not \nonly his kind but encouraging words. You see, I agree with him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will please suspend.\n  Anyone else who wants to have a conversation, leave the floor. The \nSenator from Maryland has the floor.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  Again, I know Senator Biden is bringing a very important NATO debate \nhere, and I do not want to delay it.\n  What concerns me about our amendment is that we are not going to get \nan up-and-down vote. It is going to be hidden behind parliamentary \nprocedures. We thank Senator Nickles for coming and at least engaging \nin an honest set of questions with us. They were questions worthy of \ndebate: How much does it cost? Is a 35-year-old eligible? All those \nquestions.\n  But to have an empty Chamber, to threaten a filibuster, and not even \ncome here and talk, and then, again, hide behind a filibuster, where we \nhave to get cloture, and go through so many hoops, I think the \ndiscussion of trade is important, I think our amendment is a critical \none, but let's have it, and get rid of all this hiding behind \nparliamentary maneuvers that require 60 votes.\n  So we really ask our colleagues who agree with us to come to the \nfloor. And for those who don't, let's just have it out. We respect \nthem. We respect their opinions. We think ours are the best. We hope we \nprevail. We think the Senate way, the American way is, let's just come \nand let the majority prevail and not need a supermajority to overcome a \nparliamentary obstacle. Let's have a majority vote on a policy issue.\n  I thank the Chair and look forward to continuing this conversation \nlater on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank both Senators.\n  I say to the majority whip, Senator Reid, that the thing I like best \nabout his comments--and I appreciated them all--is that I, too, think \nwe can get to 60. That is now what we have to do because there is an \neffort to filibuster this bill. But we are going to do everything we \ncan.\n  There are a lot of working families who are going to be heard from \nover the next several days. And that is what we are going to do. I \nappreciate so much what he said. We have the majority.\n  Now we have to deal with an effort to block this with a filibuster. \nThere will be more debate and more discussion. Believe me, this is \ngoing to go on for some time.\n  I know we are going to move on to other important legislation for \ntonight.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Commending the Presiding Officer\n\n  Mr. REID. I would just comment, I appreciate very much your \npresiding. You have done such a great job upon coming to the Senate and \npresiding. You make sure that the Senate has the dignity that it is \nsupposed to have. And I know you were taught by Senator Byrd. And he is \nthe best teacher we have for Senate procedures.\n  I personally appreciate your action taken just a few minutes ago. And \neveryone should understand, the Senator from Minnesota is bipartisan in \nkeeping this place quiet. Whether it is a Democratic Senator or a \nRepublican Senator, Republican staff member or Democratic staff member, \nyou treat them equally. I appreciate that very much. And I speak for \nall Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, now that the debate has concluded--and under \nthe previous order, it indicates that when the last vote occurred, we \nwould move to the NATO matter--I ask the Chair to call it up.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/16/senate-section/article/S4472-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4472-S4486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         GERALD B.H. SOLOMON FREEDOM CONSOLIDATION ACT OF 2001\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 282, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3167) to endorse the vision of further \n     enlargement of the NATO Alliance articulated by President \n     George W. Bush on June 15, 2001, and by former President \n     William J. Clinton on October 22, 1996, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the quorum call \nthat I will suggest in just a moment not be charged against the bill. \nThere is 2\\1/2\\ hours. It is not to be charged.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, may I ask what the business before the \nSenate is?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is H.R. 3167.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to support H.R. 3167, the \nGerald B.H. Solomon Freedom Consolidation Act of 2001. This bill adds \nSlovakia to the countries eligible to receive assistance under the NATO \nParticipation Act of 1994 and authorizes a total of $55.5 million in \nforeign military financing under the Arms Export Control Act to seven \ncountries--Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Bulgaria, \nand Romania.\n  This bill is a symbolic one. It authorizes funds that have already \nbeen appropriated, repackages them in order to highlight the ongoing \nprocess of NATO enlargement. Symbolism, however, in this case matters. \nMillions of central Europeans and east Europeans, and millions of \nAmericans of central and eastern European descent, will welcome this \nrestatement of NATO's so-called open-door policy--the policy of the \nClinton administration and which had been continued by the current Bush \nadministration.\n  At the end of March, Prime Ministers and Presidents of all the NATO \ncandidate countries, plus several leaders from current alliance \nmembers, met in Bucharest, Romania, to discuss the next round of NATO \nenlargement. Deputy Secretary of State Armitage led a high-level U.S. \ndelegation to the meeting, which was characterized by a spirit of \ncooperation among the aspirant countries, many of which had been \nancient rivals, which itself validated the process of enlargement, in \nmy view.\n  Parenthetically--I note that I have said before--even if the \nexpansion of NATO in the last round did not materially impact upon the \ncapacity of NATO and security of Europe, it did one incredibly \nimportant thing: Each of the aspirant countries, in order to be \nadmitted to NATO, had to settle serious border disputes that existed; \nhad to make sure their militaries were under civilian control; had to \nmake sure they dealt with, in some cases, decades-old open sores within \ntheir society in order to demonstrate that they were part of the \nvalues, as well as the capacity, of NATO; that they shared the values \nof the West.\n  I would argue that much of this would not have happened were it not \nfor the aspirant countries seeking so desperately to become part of \nNATO. I think that, in and of itself, would be rationale enough to \nmove. Much more than that has occurred.\n  Four years ago, I had the honor of floor managing the resolution of \nratification of an amendment to the Washington Treaty of 1949 whereby \nPoland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic were admitted to membership in \nNATO. On the night of April 30, 1998, in a dramatic rollcall vote in \nthis Chamber,\n\n[[Page S4473]]\n\nthe resolution passed by a vote of 80 to 19.\n  In November of this year, there will be an important NATO summit \nmeeting in the ancient Czech capital of Prague. Several fundamental \nissues will be on the agenda in Prague, among them charting a new \ncourse for the alliance in the aftermath of September 11 and the \nantiterrorist campaign in Afghanistan, a qualitatively new relationship \nbetween NATO and Russia and a new round of enlargement of NATO.\n  Last spring, NATO publicly declared that there would be no ``zero \noption'' for enlargement at Prague. Translated from diplo-speak, this \nmeans the alliance anticipates there will be at least one candidate \ncountry qualified for membership at Prague, and that country, and \nprobably others, will be extended an invitation to join NATO.\n  I have stated many times, including in the last round, that Slovenia \nhas been qualified for NATO membership for several years and should \nhave been invited to join the alliance as early as at the 1997 Madrid \nsummit or at least at the 1999 Washington summit.\n  My strong suspicion is that several other countries will be judged \nqualified for membership as well, but naming names at this time I think \nwould be premature. Later this year, the alliance will evaluate how \nwell each candidate country has fulfilled its so-called membership \naction plan and, equally important, will judge the strength of its \ndemocratic institutions and society. By late summer, the list of \nqualified aspirant countries should become much clearer than it is \ntoday.\n  Meanwhile, this legislation wisely authorizes military assistance to \nall seven of the candidate countries generally judged to be in the \nrunning at this time and thereby sidesteps the pitfall of prematurely \ndesignating those to be invited.\n  It seems to me this is not the time for lengthy debate on the merits \nof the next round of NATO enlargement. There will be ample opportunity \nfor a thorough debate after candidates have been invited and their \ncredentials submitted for ratification to the parliaments of the \ncurrent 19 members of the alliance, including us.\n  The rationale for enlargement, in my view, remains as valid as it was \n4 years ago when this body overwhelmingly ratified the entry of Poland, \nHungary, and the Czech Republic. NATO enlargement significantly \nfurthers the process of moving the zone of stability eastward in \nEurope, thereby hastening the day when the continent will be truly \nwhole and free.\n  The three new members of NATO have made major contributions to the \nalliance campaigns in Bosnia and Kosovo and lately in the war against \nterrorism. Contrary to occasional sensational articles in the press, \nthey are loyal, democratic allies contributing to the security of the \nNorth Atlantic area.\n  Finally, NATO enlargement, contrary to the gloomy predictions of some \npundits and some Members of this body, has not worsened our ties with \nRussia.\n  A man I admire as much as any and with whom I served in the Senate, \nthe distinguished former Senator from the State of New York, Patrick \nMoynihan--I hardly disagree with him on foreign policy. The one time we \nhad a serious discussion and debate was on this issue. He was opposed \nto NATO enlargement. The basis for his rationale for being opposed to \nenlargement was that this would significantly damage bilateral \nrelations with Russia at the time we needed to nurture that \nrelationship.\n\n  I argue--not that I was right--that the end result in 2002, after \nenlargement--I am not saying because of enlargement--the relationship \nbetween the United States and Russia is better than it was before \nenlargement, and it is as good as it has been since the last czar was \nin control in Russia. We have a leader in Russia now, who, for his own \nreasons--and I am not offering him as a Jeffersonian Democrat--is \nleading his nation to an open democracy. I suggest that not since Peter \nthe Great has any Russian leader looked as far west as this man has and \ncast his lot with the West as much as he has.\n  The predictions of doom and gloom relative to the relationship, for \nwhatever reasons, have not turned out to be true. On the contrary, \nearlier this week, on May 14 at the NATO ministerial meeting in \nReykjavik, Iceland, the alliance and Russia put their relationship on \nan unprecedented cooperative basis for creating a new NATO-Russia \nCouncil to deal with a variety of security issues.\n  The Bush administration strongly supports this Freedom Consolidation \nAct. In a joint letter to me on May 7, Secretary of State Powell and \nSecretary of Defense Rumsfeld wrote that the bill would ``reinforce our \nnation's commitment to the achievement of freedom, peace, and security \nin Europe . . . [and] would greatly enhance our ability to work with \naspirant countries as they prepare to join with NATO and work with us \nto meet the 21st century's threats to our common security.''\n  Mr. President, I have no doubt that sometime next year this body will \nratify the further enlargement of NATO by an overwhelming vote. For \nnow, I urge my colleagues to join me in voting for the Freedom \nConsolidation Act as a symbolic gesture to support this so-called open-\ndoor policy that has served the alliance and this country so well.\n  As I said, there will be time for us to debate whether or not the \naspirant countries that are picked in Prague should or should not be \nthe ones that are picked. I am sure we will have some disagreement in \nthis Chamber about that. This is not to pick winners and losers. This \nis picking the aspirant countries that are known to everyone to have \nthe most reasonable prospect of being issued an invitation to better \nsituate themselves in meeting the criteria to be offered that \nmembership.\n  I look forward to discussion on this issue. I do not know there is \nall that much to discuss right now, but I look forward to discussion of \nthis issue and to being in the Chamber with my two friends who are here \nto hopefully usher in a new round of members in the NATO enlargement \nscheme that will take place later in the year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator Warner is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have under my control as one in \nopposition to this measure how much time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 90 minutes.\n  Mr. WARNER. And my colleagues have an equal amount, I presume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They began with 60 minutes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, how much time does the Senator \nfrom Delaware have under his control?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 49 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will continue to yield for just a moment, \nunless responding to questions, I do not plan on taking any more time. \nI am happy to yield the remainder of the time to Senator Lugar and \nother Senators. I am told Senator Durbin and others may want to speak.\n  For the information of my colleagues, I do not plan, other than \nresponding to questions if my good friend from Virginia has any, on \nusing any more time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I have notified several colleagues who have expressed \nan interest in utilizing some of the time in opposition. I wish to \nenter into a colloquy. I must say, in my years in the Senate, I do not \nknow of anyone I enjoy having a colloquy with more than my great friend \nfrom Delaware. I hope he does not disappoint us tonight, but just a \nlittle rise in temperature at some point as we go along.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I am sure my temperature will not rise as \nlong as my good friend from Virginia continues to be the gentleman he \nalways is.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague. I see my other dear friend from \nIndiana. There is no one in this Senate whom I admire more than my dear \nfriend. I regret we have some differences on this issue.\n  First, I ask unanimous consent to print in this Record a letter \naddressed to me from Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, jointly signed \nby Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld, in which they support, on \nbehalf of the President, the measure before the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S4474]]\n\n\n                                                      May 7, 2002.\n     Hon. John W. Warner,\n     Committee on Armed Services,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Warner: The Administration strongly supports. \n     S. 1572, the Freedom Consolidation Act. This bill, which \n     reinforces the efforts of European democracies preparing \n     themselves for the responsibilities of NATO membership, will \n     enhance U.S. national security and advance vital American \n     interests in a strengthened and enlarged Alliance.\n       Speaking in Warsaw last June, President Bush said that \n     ``Yalta did not ratify a natural divide, it divided a living \n     civilization.'' From the day the Iron Curtain descended \n     across Europe, our consistent bipartisan committee has been \n     to overcome this division and build a Europe whole, free, and \n     at peace. The 1997 Alliance decision to admit Poland, \n     Hungary, and the Czech Republic brought us a step closer to \n     this vision.\n       Later this year at NATO's Summit in Prague, we will have an \n     opportunity to take a further historic step: to welcome those \n     of Europe's democracies, that are ready and able to \n     contribute to Euro-Atlantic security, into the strongest \n     Alliance the world has known. As the President said in \n     Warsaw, ``As we plan the Prague Summit, we should not \n     calculate how little we can get away with, but how much we \n     can do to advance the cause of freedom.''\n       We believe that this bill, which builds on previous \n     Congressional acts supportive of enlargement, would reinforce \n     our nation's commitment to the achievement of freedom, peace, \n     and security in Europe. Passage of the Freedom Consolidation \n     Act would greatly enhance our ability to work with aspirant \n     countries as they prepare to join with NATO and work with us \n     to meet the 21st century's threats to our common security.\n       We hope we can count on your support for this bill, and \n     look forward to working closely with you in the months ahead \n     as we prepare to make historic decisions at Prague.\n           Sincerely,\n     Donald H. Rumsfeld,\n       Secretary of Defense.\n     Colin L. Powell,\n       Secretary of State.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, if I can get my colleague's attention, \nthis debate we are having tonight arose because last fall in December, \nas our Chamber was quite properly moving towards closing down--the \nChristmas season was upon us--I discovered we were about to authorize \n$55.5 million to seven nations without a moment's debate.\n  The time was not there to have that debate. So I objected.\n  I do not object to the money proceeding to these seven nations. I \nhave supported it in years before. I support the flow of money. My \nconcern, I say to my colleague from Delaware, is the rhetoric in which \nthat money is wrapped in this resolution.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Excuse me?\n  Mr. WARNER. The rhetoric, the verbiage, that is in the House measure. \nWe are about to adopt the House measure, if my understanding is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I believe that is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is in honor of a very valued former colleague of the \nCongress whom I respect. All of that to one side, I believe the \nrhetoric as written and as framed could send the wrong message. That is \nthe sole reason I am here tonight, because if we were to separate the \nmoney from the rhetoric, or portions of the rhetoric--and this, of \ncourse, is not open to amendment--I would be voting with the Senator. \nSo it is the verbiage that surrounds this.\n  I will ask my friend from Delaware a question or two. I am not \nentirely sure, procedurally, what it is we are going to achieve by this \nvote because the money has already been appropriated. Even though the \nSenator from Virginia stopped the authorization, as we know that does \nnot necessarily stop the appropriators. I share a good laugh with my \ncolleague because they are a law unto themselves.\n  This magnificent Senate is predicated on the rules that we have the \nauthorizing committee, of which my colleague from Delaware is the \nchairman--I am the ranking on the Armed Services Committee--and we \nauthorize. The appropriators then agree or disagree with regard to the \namounts of money, but in this case, as they have done in others, they \nwent ahead and appropriated the funds. So in a sense, we are talking \nabout a hollow victory tonight, but I direct my attention, once again, \nto the rhetoric.\n\n  My friend from Delaware said the open-door policy, but I go to the \nletter from the Secretaries of State and Defense which says the \nfollowing:\n\n       Later this year at the NATO summit in Prague we will have \n     an opportunity to take a further historic step to welcome \n     those of Europe's democracies that are ready and able to \n     contribute to Euro-Atlantic security into the strongest \n     alliance the world has ever known.\n\n  I agree with that. I am not opposed to any further enlargement, but I \ndo not subscribe to this concept of open door. I say to the \ndistinguished chairman, at what point does the Senate have the \nopportunity to make an assessment as to what each of these countries \nbring, so to speak, to the table? How well prepared are they?\n  What we are doing is saying to the American taxpayer, and we are \nsaying to the men and women of the Armed Forces of the United States, \nan attack against one is an attack against all. Such new members as we \nmay admit, what do they bring to the table to participate in, first, \ndeterring an attack, and then, if necessary, repelling that attack? Do \nthey bring sufficient to hold their own, or is there going to be an \nincreased dependency, I say to my two good friends, on the American \nmilitary?\n  In Kosovo, over 70 percent of the airlift was U.S. Approximately 50 \npercent of the combat missions in bringing ordnance from air to ground \nwere U.S. Now, that is disproportionate. At another time--I am not \ngoing to belabor this tonight, but if one looks at the NATO budgets, \nthey are not all increasing, as our President is increasing, by 44-plus \nbillion dollars, a bill for the American taxpayers, our budget, to \nstrengthen our military.\n\n  I say to my colleagues, they cannot point out one single NATO country \nthat proportionately is increasing their military budget as great as \nours. So my question to my friend--he used the phrase ``open-door \npolicy,'' but I presume he subscribes to what is in the Secretary's \nletter; namely, ``that are ready and able to contribute to security.'' \nAm I correct in that analysis?\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield for me to answer, the answer is: \nThe Senator is correct in his analysis as it relates to what the \nSecretary said.\n  Let me speak to the first question, as I understood the specific \nquestion: When will the Senate get an opportunity to ascertain whether \nor not the countries chosen to be invited to become members of NATO are \nworthy of invitation and membership, and to answer indirectly the \nquestion, able to contribute to our mutual security?\n  The answer is: We will do that at the time of the ratification \ndebate. In the meantime, as my friend pointed out, the money has \nalready been appropriated. The money is already going to these aspirant \ncountries. I think it should have gone by the authorization process, \nand then the appropriations process. That is why I was smiling.\n  We share a similar fate in armed services and foreign relations, more \nin foreign relations, quite frankly, than armed services, where the \nappropriators move in the absence of our moving.\n  Let me be more specific. I argue that, even if not a single state \nthat was, in fact, the recipient of any of this money, was invited to \njoin NATO, it is in our interest that the money goes because the money \nis going for those aspirant countries to meet criteria we have set out, \nthat we believe to be in the U.S. interest. It is in the U.S. interest \nthat every one of the militaries in aspirant countries is under \ncivilian control. It is in the U.S. interest that they have \nparticipatory democracies. It is in the U.S. interest they have no \nborder disputes with their neighbors. It is also in the European \ninterest.\n  So even if not a single aspirant country meets the criteria that must \nbe met, as cited by the Senator from Virginia quoting the Secretary of \nDefense, it is money well spent.\n  The second reason we are doing this now is that it is important, in \nmy view, to continue to display to these European aspirants that we are \nserious about considering them. What I do not want to see happen is us \nsaying, well, we know only one of you are going to get in, and the \nother six say, well, what am I doing this for? Why am I making this \neffort? Why am I engaged in this? I want them to know we are serious \nabout this. So even though the money is going forward, you say, well, \nthey already know we are serious. We have already sent the money. It is \nbeing spent; it is being used. This authorization--which is putting, as \nmy grandpop used to say, the sleigh before the horse--demonstrates to \nthese folks that, if and\n\n[[Page S4475]]\n\nwhen the President of the United States and NATO pick aspirants to join \nand the President sends the treaty up for amendment to the Senate, we \nare serious about it as well.\n  This is not a game. This is not a game in our separation of powers--\nmost countries do not have the same system as we have. We confuse \npeople a little bit because they have a parliamentary system. We have \nan executive branch and a legislative branch and never the twain shall \nmeet, and constitutionally you have to get both of our \napproval. Notwithstanding the fact that the President may say we want \nto see Slovakia or Slovenia or whomever to join NATO, that is not good \nenough. It has to have a supermajority of the Senate saying yes as \nwell. This legislation is an authorization after the fact.\n\n  I promise there is not a single solitary ambassador representing any \none of the countries who does not have C-SPAN on now listening to us. \nThey know it doesn't mean much now. This is not going to resolve \nanything tonight, tomorrow, or next month, until the meeting in Prague, \nand it may not resolve anything then.\n  This is to send the signal that we are serious, we mean it. You go \nout and do the things that are necessary to meet the criteria set out \nby the President, and the additional requirements, and we will \nseriously consider you. We are in the game with the President.\n  The third point is the issue of whether or not these aspirant \ncountries, if invited by 19 members of NATO to become a member of NATO, \nthe question is, will they contribute to the security of the United \nStates of America? Or will they be, as my friend implies or states--I \ndon't want to put words in his mouth--a drag on our military?\n  He cites Kosovo. It is true what my friend cites about the percentage \nof the airlift, the percentage of the air missions, the percentage of \nthe munitions used, et cetera. But I also point out only 10 percent of \nthose forces that remain in Kosovo are American forces. Mr. President, \n85 percent are European and other willing nations there, keeping the \npeace. And I might add that if we do something too well, it is taken \nfor granted and we forget what we did in the first place.\n  I remind my friend that before we got into Kosovo, before we went to \nBosnia, there were over a quarter million people killed, women and \nchildren. There were close to half a million people in the hills, \nfreezing in the middle of the winter and we worried about them \nfreezing. Every European capital was on edge worrying about immigration \nflows. It started this xenophobia about minority portions of the \npopulations of Germany, France, and other countries.\n  It is in our interest that there be a stable Europe. It is in our \ninterest that a LePen is not getting 50 percent of the vote instead of \n15 percent of the vote. It is in our interest that the skinheads in \nGermany do not become a morph of the neo-Nazi organizations that impact \nGerman policy. They have not. But I believe had another million people \nflowed out of the Balkans into those capitals, it would have further \ndestabilized the political circumstance.\n  It is true that no nation, none of our NATO allies, have kept their \ncommitment to expand their military capability as we have. None have. \nHe is absolutely right. Where does our interest lie?\n  A number of our colleagues very much want to see us move into Iraq. \nIt would be very useful if Bulgaria were part of NATO. We don't have to \nworry about overflight rights. They are part of NATO. We do not have to \nworry about a little thing like we worry about with our fickle Saudi \nfriends as to whether they allow us to use an airbase we built for them \nand their protection. So I argue when we were trying to deal with this \nsituation in Kosovo, Hungary became a valued ally.\n  The issue for me is not so much that I think any aspirant country is \ngoing to be able to be the one man for a U.S. Air Force stealth \naircraft moving on a precision-guided mission against an enemy. That \nwill not happen. If the measure is, can they keep up with our \ntechnological capability, the answer is that none of the countries will \never qualify. I might add that some of our greatest and oldest allies \nmay not qualify.\n\n  Conversely, though, if the measure is, does their membership in NATO \nlend an additional capacity that impacts positively on U.S. interests, \nand they pay their way, then the answer to that question is, yes, they \nshould be a part of NATO. That is a debate I am sure my friend and I \nwill have when the President of the United States, if he does, comes \nback from Prague and says, I am sending up to Senator Warner and \ncompany an amendment to the Washington treaty asking for the \nfollowing--1, or 7, or whatever--nations to become part of NATO. He \nwill because he is so diligent and so knowledgeable about the U.S. \nmilitary and military matters. I know him too well. And he should do \nthis. We are lucky to have someone who will have the ability to do \nthis.\n  And then we will debate whether or not they warrant membership. What \ndoes Slovenia bring? What does so and so bring? That is the moment when \nthat debate will take place.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say to my good friend, and then I hope our good \ncolleague from Indiana will join, I can see that day. It will be \nbeautifully embossed, a document on every desk. Do you think the Senate \nin that period of time, in that debate, will turn down one of those \ncountries?\n  That is the flaw in this process which eventually I will point out in \nmy direct statement. We are going to be handed a fait accompli. We will \nnot have had the opportunity, unless your committee or mine--and I \nshall press in my committee--have some advance hearings on the likely \nnominee countries and using the criteria in the Secretary of State's \nletter ``ready and able to contribute to security.''\n  That is what we should be doing, not waiting until that resolution \ncomes up. That is an obligation. We have so much invested in NATO. It \nis a treaty that has worked beyond expectation. I remember on the 50th \nanniversary engaging in that marvelous debate we had in the Senate, \nextolling the virtues of this treaty.\n  What I am trying to do is to preserve it so it remains strong and any \nnation that comes in is able, willing, and ready to pick up its share \nof the load and carry it and not be dependent, as we saw in Kosovo, \nupon the good old USA, its service persons, and its taxpayers.\n  Some Members around here with gray hair remember things. Do you \nremember the Libya operation? Did we get overflights of NATO countries \nin that operation? Go back and check it, Senator. Go back and check. \nNATO did not open its airspace for that operation. It was a vital \noperation at that time.\n  Do not say to this Chamber that by virtue of a nation joining NATO it \nwill automatically open the skies, automatically open its borders. No, \nit will be the individual nations that make a decision. That Libya raid \nis the case in point.\n  I invite our colleagues, tell me, is it a fait accompli that we will \nbe handed in November all the panoply, the ceremony, and this Chamber \nwill get up and reject the Nation? I don't think it will happen that \nway.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Let me respond briefly and then yield to my friend from \nIndiana or whoever seeks the floor.\n  What I think we should be straight about here--I am not implying in \nany way the Senator from Virginia is not being straight--is that there \nis a growing school of thought that reflects the underlying view of my \nfriend from Virginia--and, I might add, is made up of some of the most \nseasoned Members of the Senate, some of whom are World War II veterans, \nmen who have been strongly supportive of NATO in the past and of our \nmilitary--who basically do not think NATO is worth much anymore.\n  The fact of the matter is, the indictment that the Senator paints is \nequally applicable to Britain, Germany, Spain, Italy--every NATO \nnation. Not the new guys. It was the old guys who did not let us have \nthe overflight, remember?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The new guys are so gung ho being part of NATO, they would \nprobably decide to give each of us citizenship if we asked for it. I am \nnot at all worried about the new guys. I am worried about the old guys.\n  We should have a debate someday on the floor, unrelated to expansion, \nabout the utility of NATO because, in\n\n[[Page S4476]]\n\ntruth, many in the Defense Department and many--some on this floor--\nthink we are misallocating our resources to NATO, period; unrelated to \nKosovo, unrelated to anything else.\n  So I call everyone's attention to the subtext in this debate that \nreally doesn't relate to new members. It relates to whether NATO has \noutlived its usefulness and whether we should be spending billions of \ndollars on NATO without any new members. It is a legitimate debate. I \nthink it is dead wrong, but I think it is a legitimate debate.\n  With regard to the issue of whether there is a fait accompli when an \nembossed document ends up on our desk, I might point out that my friend \nfrom Virginia had no difficulty with an embossed document that was the \nsingle most important treaty in the minds of our NATO allies--no \ndifficulty rejecting it. It was called the Comprehensive Test Ban \nTreaty. It did not slow you up a beat.\n  Mr. WARNER. Not only didn't it slow me up, it was our committee, not \nyour committee, that held the hearings that adduced the facts and \nbrought them to the floor of the Senate which resulted in the rejection \nof that treaty. Our committee did that work.\n  Mr. BIDEN. That may be. We can argue about that.\n  Mr. WARNER. It is a fact.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I don't doubt that. You were wrong then, you are wrong \nnow. But that is irrelevant.\n  The point is this. I was responding to a specific assertion. The \nSenator said: How will this body ever reject something that is put on \nour desk that is embossed, that has worldwide publicity, that the whole \nworld is looking at, that all of our European friends are seeing? How \ncould we ever reject anything like that?\n  I point out that we have done that. We have no problem rejecting \nthings in this place that we don't think we should do. I might add that \nwe had multiple hearings in my committee--I don't remember, but I \nsuspect also in my friend's committee, the Armed Services Committee. We \nhad more than a dozen hearings before we voted on expansion, on whether \nor not the aspirant countries were qualified.\n  Some of us, I think including the Senator from Virginia, traveled to \nthe aspirant countries, sat down with their leadership, sat down with \ntheir chiefs of staff, sat down with their military and parliamentary \nleaders, and looked at their books--literally, not figuratively.\n\n  I know I spent, with my colleague Dr. Haltzel, about 7 days doing \nthat in the aspirant countries: Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and the Czech \nRepublic. I spent that time as my other colleagues did.\n  So I have no worry that we are going to have time. I am responding to \nthe point made by the Senator, which is: Hey, look, this is a fait \naccompli. We are getting set up here. You guys passed this; you \nauthorized this in addition to the money already going. What is going \nto happen here is we are going to come bouncing along and on December \n9, or next January 14, or whatever date, we are going to have an \nembossed treaty, and it is going to be done, and there is not going to \nbe any real debate, and it is going to be all over.\n  I would say the past is prologue. The Foreign Relations Committee \npublished a 550-page report on the last round of NATO enlargement. It \ncontained the transcript of the hearings, a lengthy report on the trip \nthat I took to Russia, Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovenia, \nand many other reports. I do not remember--I do not want to state \nsomething I am not certain of--but I think the Armed Services Committee \nhad hearings as well.\n  So there is going to be no doubt there will be hearings. If the \nSenator, in Armed Services--if they want to hold hearings, I think that \nis a fine thing; no problem. I think it is premature now to hold those \nhearings. We had 7 days of debate on the floor the last time on NATO \nenlargement.\n  I understand the concern of the Senator that we are going to, in \neffect, be presented with a fait accompli. Maybe his real worry is it \nis a fait accompli because he is a Republican and a Republican \nPresident would be submitting this. But I tell you, we Democrats are \ngoing to have no problem. We didn't have any problem with the last guy \nwho submitted it, and my Republican friends had no problem when the \nlast guy submitted it, a Democrat. I think it is an unfounded worry. If \nI believed the Senator was correct and the Senate is going to be put in \na position of rubber-stamping or walking away, I would say you are \nright, Senator. But I see nothing from the past NATO enlargement round \nwe went through, and I do not anticipate anything in this round, that \nwill preclude a thorough investigation giving all 100 Members of the \nSenate and the American public an opportunity to make their own \njudgments about it, whether or not to accept the President's \nrecommendation.\n  When I say President's recommendation, if he doesn't sign on in \nPrague to the expansion, then there is no expansion. All 18 other \nnations can sign on, it doesn't matter. If he says no--no. Done. \nFinished. So that is what I mean when I say the President's \nrecommendation.\n  I have no doubt we are going to have an opportunity to fully explore \nthis. My guess is--I make a prediction, which is a dangerous thing to \ndo. The bulk of the debate on this floor will be why wasn't so-and-so \nincluded, as opposed to why did you include such-and-such country.\n  But that remains to be seen. The bottom line is--and I will yield the \nfloor to whomever seeks it--the bottom line is that we will have plenty \nof opportunity to debate whether or not the named countries--if there \nare any named countries, and there will be, I believe--whether they \nwarrant the supermajority of the Senate to say: Yes, you are now a \nmember of NATO because you met all the criteria and including the \nparagraph read from the Secretary of Defense's letter.\n  I further state that the criticisms we can debate in other contexts \nthat the Senator from Virginia raises about NATO aspirants are equally \napplicable to the original NATO members--that is a different story.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, just a short comment and then I hope \nothers will engage in the debate.\n  If the Senators from Delaware and Indiana would be willing to just \nstrip out a lot of rhetoric which causes me a problem--because I think \nfor those who do not follow the key debate that we are having, and this \nis a good debate--I would simply say I would voice vote the \nauthorization for this money and let's get on with it. But just take \nout this rhetoric which gives rise to expectations in all of these \ncountries. That is my concern. It gives rise to it. Implicitly it says, \nby the Senate voting on this tomorrow: Oh, the Senate has now said this \nrhetoric is correct, that all nations should be this, and all nations \ndesiring it--I think it can be misconstrued and misinterpreted.\n  If you want the money, sever the rhetoric and I will voice vote it \ntonight.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, we have the votes to win this anyway, \nnotwithstanding the fact I truly appreciate the Senator's generous \noffer. I would be happy to try to accommodate him if I could. You \ncannot amend this.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is by unanimous consent. We could amend it tomorrow.\n  Mr. BIDEN. The idea of us getting unanimous consent--he can seek \nunanimous consent. I imagine there are enough people--I don't think \nthat is possible.\n  The bottom line is I understand the Senator. I do not have the same \nconcerns with any of the rhetoric. The rhetoric of George Bush:\n\n       [a]ll of Europe's new democracies, from the Baltic to the \n     Black Sea and all that lie between, should have the same \n     chance for security and freedom--and the same chance to join \n     the institutions of Europe--as Europe's old democracies have \n     . . . I believe in NATO membership for all of Europe's \n     democracies that seek it and are ready to share the \n     responsibilities that NATO brings . . . [a]s we plan to \n     enlarge NATO, no nation should be used as a pawn in the \n     agenda of others . . . [w]e will not trade away the fate of \n     free European peoples . . . [n]o more Munichs . . . [n]o more \n     Yaltas . . . [a]s we plan the Prague Summit, we should not \n     calculate how little we can get away with, but how much we \n     can do to advance the cause of freedom.\n\n  That is the most shining rhetoric in here. I am not prepared to \nsupport the withdrawal of the President's rhetoric from this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Then I ask a question of my friend. I realize you have \nthe votes. It is going to stay in, but at\n\n[[Page S4477]]\n\nleast I make the gesture. But I say to my friend, other than the money, \nwhich I agree should flow, has flowed, been appropriated, to what does \nthis bill commit the United States and the Congress?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, it does not commit the United States and \nCongress to anything, except it communicates----\n  Mr. WARNER. That is an important statement, Mr. President.\n  Mr. BIDEN. It communicates to all of the European aspirants that if \nthey meet the requirements in the eyes of the Senate, and if they are \nrecommended by our President, we will seriously consider their \nadmission to NATO. We, the U.S. Senate, if they meet what each of us \nindividually thinks is the minimum criteria or the maximum criteria, we \ntake it seriously. This is not just a gesture of sending you money to \nhelp you move toward democratization to modernize your military. We, \nlike the President, mean it.\n  So if the Senator does not agree with--and I understand--the \nstatement by President Bush, which I happen to agree with, which I \nfully respect, then he should not support this. I happen to agree with \nPresident Bush and the other, as the Senator says, ``rhetoric'' in this \npiece of legislation.\n  So all it commits the United States to is to say the same thing \nPresident Bush said: We believe that all of Europe should be open and \nfree, and that we will consider NATO membership for all European \ndemocracies that seek it and are ready to seek the responsibility NATO \nbrings. That is what it commits us to, and that is why I support this.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I say, then, Mr. President, the purpose for my initiating \nthis debate has been accomplished. I respect my President. I largely \nagree with him. But you have now stated your views, and I hope my \ncolleague from Indiana will join you.\n  Beyond the authorization of these funds, this document does not \ncommit us--this Senate, this Congress--to anything beyond the \nauthorization of specific amounts of dollars. It is simply a statement \nwith regard to the future.\n  I also received the assurances from my colleague that this body, \nthrough its committee hearings, and otherwise, will eventually be able \nto look at each country individually and their criteria by which \neventually they can be judged as to become members or not.\n  I thank my colleague from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nVirginia for the questions as well as the conclusions. I would simply \nsuccinctly join my colleague, the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, in saying that S. 1572, the legislation before us now, \nendorses the continued enlargement of the NATO alliance and assists \npotential members in meeting membership criteria. Very clearly, that \nleaves open the question of whether they meet the criteria, and who is \nselected, and when that occurs.\n  But the President of the United States, in his Warsaw speech, talked \nabout enlargement. He talked about it, but he gave a grand vision. That \nwas important.\n  Mr. President, before I commence my statement, I ask unanimous \nconsent that Senator Cochran be added as a cosponsor of S. 1572.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Freedom \nConsolidation Act of 2001 because I believe this legislation makes \nimportant contributions to the future of European security and trans-\nAtlantic relations by endorsing the continued enlargement of the NATO \nalliance and assisting potential members in meeting membership \ncriteria.\n  Last year, President George Bush delivered a visionary speech in \nWarsaw Poland on NATO's future. He noted that ``all of Europe's new \ndemocracies, from the Baltic to the Black Sea and all that lie between, \nshould have the same chance for security and freedom.''\n  He went on to say that he believed ``. . . in NATO memberships for \nall of Europe's democracies that seek it and are ready to share the \nresponsibilities that NATO brings.'' And he concluded that ``we should \nnot calculate how little we can get away with, but how much we can do \nto advance the cause of freedom.''\n  Some believe the United States-European relationship should be \ndiminished. I can hardly imagine a more strategically shortsighted or \ndangerous policy shift by the United States or Europe. Such arguments \nignore a basic fact: Europe and America are increasingly intertwined in \nsecurity, economic, and cultural matters. The cold war may be over, but \nthe security and welfare of America and Europe are closely linked. Our \ncommon goal must be to complete the building of a Europe whole and free \nin strong alliance with the United States of America. Now is not the \ntime to discuss withdrawal. Now is the time to strengthen the NATO \nalliance. This legislation--the Freedom Consolidation Act--makes \nimportant and encouraging strides in that direction.\n  The last round of enlargement was a tremendous first step. The lines \nof Yalta have begun to recede. Central Europe is not only free but \nsafe. And now, 10 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, it is time \nto finish the job and make Europe whole and free. It is my belief that \nthe continued enlargement of NATO is the best means to achieve this \ngoal. President Bush has laid out such a vision and has committed the \nUnited States to its implementation.\n  I might add that a reason we are debating this issue at this late \nhour on a Thursday evening is that the President of the United States \nvery much wants to have this legislation as he goes to a historic \nsummit with President Putin of Russia and as he proceeds on to visits \nwith European allies.\n  The President has not only given a visionary speech in Warsaw, he is \nabout to embark upon an extraordinary trip on behalf of our security \nand our foreign policy. He has asked us to consider this legislation, \nand to pass it enthusiastically, to join our colleagues in the House in \nthat endorsement.\n  Continued enlargement provides an opportunity for NATO to be \nproactive in shaping a stable security framework in Europe. Potential \nNATO membership has given countries the incentive to accelerate \nreforms, to peacefully settle disputes, and to increase cooperation. \nThese hopes have been a tremendous driving force of democratization and \npeace. Those nations who have made the most progress should be rewarded \nwith an invitation to join NATO. Such a move will ensure that NATO's \naspirations will continue to spur reform and purge cold war ideologies \nand dividing lines.\n  While maintaining NATO's high standards, we should invite those \nnations ready to assume membership responsibilities and contribute to \nEuropean stability and security to be a part of NATO.\n  If countries such as Slovenia and Slovakia stay the course, they \nwould be among the strongest candidates. Given the importance of \nstabilizing southern Europe, I also believe we should invite Bulgaria \nand Romania. I am hopeful they will continue their remarkable progress \nand become strong members of the alliance.\n  The defining issue will be the Baltic States, Latvia, Lithuania, and \nEstonia. They are among the great success stories of Europe's post-\nCommunist transition. Their illegal annexation by the former Soviet \nUnion 60 years ago should not determine Western policy today. If the \nBaltic States continue to perform and meet our standards, we should \nbring them in, all of them, at the Prague summit.\n  I have addressed that issue, at least to give my personal views as a \nSenator, for the last year. I felt it was important, as the Senator \nfrom Virginia has pointed out in this debate, for us to consider \nindividually each of these countries, to initiate that debate a long \ntime before the Prague summit or even before the trip our President is \nto take to visit with President Putin.\n  As the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee has \npointed out, he has made a number of trips to Europe to visit not only \nwith the aspirants in the first round of NATO enlargement but with the \ncurrent group. I went to Europe last September for a similar purpose. I \nmade it a point to visit each of the Baltic\n\n[[Page S4478]]\n\nStates to meet with the leadership of those countries, with their \nmilitary people, as well as their diplomats, and continued on to \nRomania and Bulgaria for an equally interesting and important visit to \nenlarge my own understanding of where they stood, what they were doing, \nwhat kind of criteria they understood membership required.\n  I visited the NATO headquarters in Brussels in January at the \ninvitation of our Ambassador Burns to address a NATO workshop which \nincluded 10 aspiring countries in a roundtable discussion. Of those 10, \nI have identified 7 that I believe are logical candidates if they \nfulfill the criteria. But that is a rigorous course. Ambassador Burns, \non behalf of this country, has visited each of the countries that I \nhave mentioned recently. He has gone through a rigorous outline of what \nour anticipations would be. This is not a free ride for any country, \nand meeting those criteria will take some doing in each of the seven \ncases that I have cited.\n  This legislation does not make that decision, even if this Senator \nand others have come to some conclusions about the merits of various \ncountries. That is a debate still ahead of us. I would simply counsel \nmy friends who are interested in this issue and all who have spoken \nthis evening to continue visitation of the countries, to continue \nencouragement of meeting the criteria, to show interest on behalf of \nthe United States in these countries. Those are the steps we ought to \nbe taking presently, and they will lead to a formal and, I hope, a wise \ndecision, long before there is a final Prague summit and our President \nmakes a commitment, at least of his own resources, on behalf of the \nUnited States.\n  NATO's open-door policy toward new members, as established in article \n10 of the Washington treaty, is truly fundamental. To retract it would \nrisk undermining the tremendous gains that have been made across the \nregion. The result of a closed-door policy would be the creation of new \ndividing lines across Europe. Those nations outside might become \ndisillusioned and insecure and thus inclined to adopt the competitive \nand destabilizing security positions of Europe's past.\n  NATO's decision to enlarge in stages recognizes that not all new \napplicants are equally ready or equally willing to be security allies, \nand some states may never be ready. But the maintenance of the open \ndoor to future membership will continue to be a powerful motivating \nforce in Europe.\n  NATO has launched a new initiative to expand cooperation and \nconsultation with Russia. From my perspective, NATO enlargement need \nnot be a zero-sum game. One can be a strong supporter of NATO \nenlargement and of a new United States-Russian strategic partnership, \nas I am. We need to continue to invest in the promotion of the security \nand the stability of Russia and the other newly independent states, and \nit is in the interest of both NATO and Russia for a democratic Russia \nto emerge and to regularize its cooperation with the alliance.\n  For this reason, I support the Bush administration's efforts to draw \nRussia closer to NATO, to deal with mutual security concerns in \nreciprocal fashion, and to support Russia's consolidation of a \nnonimperialist, peaceful democracy.\n  If NATO is to continue to be an effective organization meeting the \nsecurity needs of its members, it must play a central role in \naddressing the major security challenges of our time, which in my \njudgment are the war on terrorism and the threats posed by weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  That will require NATO to change, and in a very large way. But the \nalliance has demonstrated in the past that with U.S. leadership, it has \nthe capacity to adapt to new challenges. We must take the next logical \nstep in a world in which terrorist ``Article V'' attacks on our \ncountries can be planned in Germany, financed in Asia, and carried out \nin the United States. Under these circumstances, old distinctions \nbetween ``in'' and ``out of area'' have become meaningless. If Article \nV threats to our security can come from beyond Europe, NATO must be \nable to act beyond Europe to meet them.\n  If we cannot organize ourselves to meet this new threat, we will have \ngiven the terrorists a huge advantage. There is nothing they would like \nmore than to see Western democracies divided on this key issue. We are \nnow cooperating closely with our European allies. While we don't \npublicize it for understandable reasons, the security cooperation, the \nintelligence sharing is unprecedented. Today there are more Europeans \non the ground in Afghanistan than Americans. It is Europe, not America, \nthat is going to foot much of the bill for Afghan reconstruction. In \nthose areas, Europeans have been exceptional allies.\n  But I have a sober understanding of where we differ with our allies \nand the hurdles we need to overcome if we are going to succeed. The \nEuropeans have neglected their defenses. While I detect a growing \nwillingness to try to remedy that, it is not going to be easy so long \nas their economies are in recession. It would be a historic mistake to \nlet this opportunity to forge a new transatlantic understanding slip \nthrough our fingers. America is at war. The threat we face is global \nand existential. We need allies and coalitions to confront it \neffectively, and NATO is our premiere military alliance. Therefore, \nNATO enlargement should be pursued as part of a broader strategic \ndialog aimed at establishing common transatlantic approaches to meet \nthe key strategic challenges in Europe and around the globe.\n  Fifty years ago, NATO's founders made a political decision that the \nUnited States and Europe needed a common strategy to meet common \nthreats. Today we need to make a similar commitment with our allies to \ncomplete the vision of a united, free Europe, and to defend our common \nvalues and interests in Europe and beyond.\n  President Bush and his administration placed a continued NATO \nenlargement at the core of the transatlantic agenda. I ask unanimous \nconsent to print in the Record a letter sent to leaders of the Senate \nfrom Secretary of State Colin Powell and Secretary of Defense Don \nRumsfeld.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                      May 7, 2002.\n     Hon. Jesse Helms,\n     Committee on Foreign Relations,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Senator Helms: The Administration strongly supports S. \n     1572, the Freedom Consolidation Act. This bill, which \n     reinforces the efforts of European democracies preparing \n     themselves for the responsibilities of NATO membership, will \n     enhance U.S. national security and advance vital American \n     interests in a strengthened and enlarged Alliance.\n       Speaking in Warsaw last June, President Bush said that \n     ``Yalta did not ratify a natural divide, it divided a living \n     civilization.'' From the day the Iron Curtain descended \n     across Europe, our consistent bipartisan commitment has been \n     to overcome this division and build a Europe whole, free, and \n     at peace. The 1997 Alliance decision to admit Poland, \n     Hungary, and the Czech Republic brought us a step closer to \n     this vision.\n       Later this year at NATO's Summit in Prague, we will have an \n     opportunity to take a further historic step: to welcome those \n     of Europe's democracies, that are ready and able to \n     contribute to Euro-Atlantic security, into the strongest \n     Alliance the world has known. As the President said in \n     Warsaw, ``As we plan the Prague Summit, we should not \n     calculate how little we can get away with, but how much we \n     can do to advance the cause of freedom.''\n       We believe that this bill, which builds on previous \n     Congressional acts supportive of enlargement, would reinforce \n     our nation's commitment to the achievement of freedom, peace, \n     and security in Europe. Passage of the Freedom Consolidation \n     Act would greatly enhance our ability to work with aspirant \n     countries as they prepare to join with NATO and work with us \n     to meet the 21st century's threats to our common security.\n       We hope we can count on your support for this bill, and \n     look forward to working closely with you in the months ahead \n     as we prepare to make historic decisions at Prague.\n           Sincerely,\n     Donald H. Rumsfeld,\n       Secretary of Defense.\n     Colin L. Powell,\n       Secretary of State.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. They write, in part, Mr. President:\n\n       We believe that this bill, which builds on previous \n     congressional acts supportive of enlargement, would reinforce \n     our Nation's commitment to the achievement of freedom, peace, \n     and security in Europe. Passage of the Freedom Consolidation \n     Act would greatly enhance our ability to work with aspirant \n     countries as they prepare to join with NATO and work with us \n     to meet the 21st century's threat to our common security.\n\n  We must seize this unprecedented opportunity to expand the zone of \npeace and security to all of Europe. It is time\n\n[[Page S4479]]\n\nto finish the job and the next step in passage of this important \nlegislation is to act, and to act promptly.\n  Mr. President, I note the presence of the distinguished Senator from \nOhio.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Indiana for \nhis courtesy. I am pleased to have opportunity to speak today on behalf \nof the Freedom Consolidation Act.\n  I have long supported expansion of the NATO alliance to include \nEurope's new democracies, and I believe this piece of legislation sends \nan important signal to countries aspiring to join the alliance. The \nU.S. Senate supports the process of enlargement that began in Madrid in \n1997, and believes NATO should remain open to Europe's new democracies \nable to accept the responsibilities that come with membership in the \nalliance.\n  During the cold war, as a public official in the State of Ohio, I \nremained a strong supporter of the captive nations, who were for so \nmany years denied the right of self-determination by the former Soviet \nUnion. That strong support of the captive nations was generated back in \nmy youth. As a matter of fact, the first paper that I wrote in \nundergraduate school at Ohio University was about how the United States \nsold out Yugoslavia at Tehran and Yalta. That grieved me, and I \nwondered whether those nations would ever have the self-determination \nthat they were promised.\n  When I was mayor of Cleveland during the 1980s, we celebrated the \nindependence days of the captive nations at city hall--flying their \nflags, singing their songs, and praying that one day those countries \nwould know the freedom that we enjoy in the United States.\n  In August of 1991, as communism's grip loosened, I wrote a letter to \nthen-President George H.W. Bush urging him to recognize the \nindependence of the Baltic nations. Now these countries are among those \nbeing considered for membership in the NATO alliance. I know the \nPresident remembers last year when we were in Vilnius, Lithuania, on \nthe square before 2,000 Lithuanians. I could not help but think back 15 \nyears and being at the Lithuanian hall of Our Lady of Perpetual Help \nand wondering if the Lithuania people would ever enjoy freedom. There \nthey were before us, and I had tears rolling out of my eyes. They \nwanted to join NATO.\n\n  Last month, I had the opportunity to meet with representatives with \nties to NATO-aspirant countries at a meeting organized by the Embassy \nof the Slovak Republic and cosponsored by the Polish American Congress, \nstrong supporters of the Solidarity movement in Poland and great \nadvocates of Poland becoming a member of NATO. The meeting included \nindividuals from nine aspirant countries, including Albania, Bulgaria, \nEstonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Macedonia, Romania, Slovenia, and Slovakia, \nas well as Croatia, which was formally invited to join the NATO \naccession process at the NATO ministerial meeting this week. \nRepresentatives from the Czech and Hungarian communities were also \nthere, who were also in favor of continued expansion of the alliance.\n  They came together to promote the merits of enlargement as a single, \nunified group, and to deliver the message that NATO expansion is in the \nbest interest of the United States of America, Europe, and the broader \ninternational community of democracies.\n  The spirit of that meeting I think is encapsulated in this bill; it \ndoes not divide; it does not endorse one candidate country over \nanother; rather, it encourages emerging Central and Eastern European \ndemocracies to continue reforms to promote democracy, the rule of law, \nthe merits of free market economies, respect for human rights, and \nmilitary reform. These values are the hallmark of the NATO alliance. \nAnd I can tell you that the progress that we have seen in those \ncountries toward the issues I have just enunciated would not have been \nas aggressive if it wasn't involved in their trying to prove to the \nother NATO members that they were worthy of membership in NATO.\n  I strongly support that message, and I share the sentiments expressed \nby President Bush in remarks he delivered in Poland last June, when he \nwas at the NATO summit in Prague. He said:\n\n       We should not calculate how little we can get away with, \n     but how much we can do to advance the cause of freedom.\n\n  When NATO heads of state join in Prague this November for the summit \nof the alliance, three primary items will fill their agenda: First, \ndiscussion about capabilities and the future of the alliance; next, the \nselection of new members; and, finally, new relationships with Russia, \nUkraine, and other members of the international community.\n  As the Senator from Indiana said, without a doubt, the events of \nSeptember 11 have dramatically impacted the conversations that will \ntake place in Prague. As the United States and other members of NATO \nconsider each of these issues, it is within the broader context of a \nchanged world post-9-11.\n  This reality was seen this week when Secretary of State Colin Powell \njoined his NATO colleagues for a NATO ministerial meeting in Reykjavik, \nIceland. New threats facing the alliance in the aftermath of the \nterrorist attacks against the U.S. influenced discussions on Russia, as \nNATO foreign ministers reached a historic agreement on a new NATO-\nRussian Council, and they certainly influenced conversations about the \nurgent need to address the growing capabilities gap between the United \nStates and our European allies, which I am sure the Senator from \nVirginia is very much concerned about.\n\n  They also influenced discussions on NATO enlargement, as the foreign \nministers reaffirmed their support of the alliance at Prague.\n  Although there are, without a doubt, a number of pressing questions \nthat the alliance must begin to answer, I believe NATO enlargement is \nstill a high priority because of its importance to U.S. national \nsecurity and peace in the world.\n  I strongly support a statement made by Under Secretary of State Mark \nGrossman in his testimony before the Foreign Relations Committee \nearlier this month, when he said:\n\n       The events of the September 11 show us that the more allies \n     we have, the better off we are going to be; the more allies \n     we have to prosecute the war on terrorism, the better off we \n     are going to be. And if we are going to meet these new \n     threats to our security, we need to build the broadest and \n     strongest coalition possible of countries that share our \n     values and are able to act effectively with us. With freedom \n     under attack, we must demonstrate our resolve to do as much \n     as we can to advance our cause.\n\n  Since September 11, the United States and NATO have called on members \nof the international community to provide critical assistance in a \nnumber of areas outside of the traditional military realm. While these \ndo not outweigh the need for improved defense capabilities, such as \nstrategic airlift capabilities and improved communication systems, they \nare nonetheless critical to thwarting future terrorist attacks.\n  We have seen the benefit of these contributions as the international \ncommunity continues to engage in a global campaign against terrorism. \nThe nine NATO aspirant countries, as well as Croatia, have reached out \nto the United States in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. They \nhave pledged their solidarity, volunteered their resources, and shared \nintelligence information with the United States and NATO. They have \ndecided to not act as aspirants, but as allies, and their strong \nsupport is highly important. Senator Lugar, in his remarks, pointed out \nhow much help they have given us so far.\n  As significant as this cooperation has been, the work is not done. It \nis critical that countries aspiring to join the alliance continue their \nefforts to make progress in areas outlined in the membership action \nplan--developing free market economies, promoting democracy and the \nrule of law, respecting the rights of minorities, implementing military \nreforms, and committing resources to their defense budgets, just as we \nare doing.\n  I have made it clear to all of these countries that are seeking \nmembership in NATO that it is the MAP, the membership application \nplan--we are going to watch what you do, and there is not going to be \nany automatic entry into NATO; you are going to have to prove you are \nworthy and show us through your actions and also in your ability to use \na good portion of your budget and invest it in defense.\n\n[[Page S4480]]\n\n  As a Member of Congress who has long been involved with transatlantic \nissues, I understand the importance of NATO expansion to strengthening \nsecurity and stability in Europe. I supported the enlargement of the \nalliance in 1997, and I will again support enlargement at Prague. I \nbelieve NATO should be open to further expansion in the future.\n  There are probably very few Members of this body who have visited all \nof the NATO aspirants. I have, with the exception of Slovakia. I have \nbeen impressed with what they are doing. I will visit Slovakia, \nMacedonia, and Slovenia after attending the National Assembly meeting \nin Bulgaria later this month.\n  Last year Senator Durbin and I visited Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania \nand were impressed with the commitment they were making to qualify \nthemselves as members of NATO.\n  I remember before we attended the OSE meeting in Paris we visited \nwith General Ralston at Normandy, and he spoke eloquently about what he \nhad seen when he visited the Baltic countries, with heavy emphasis on \ncommunications, the BaltNet they put in place, which he said was better \nthan countries that already belonged to NATO, and then being in \nSlovenia 2 years ago and seeing the communication system they put in \nplace.\n  I will never forget General Kronkaitis, a former U.S. Army General \nwho is now the adviser to the Lithuanian army, and how he really made \nme very proud of how he had inculcated the spirit that he received from \nbeing a member of our U.S. military.\n  I strongly support and believe NATO expansion demonstrates our \ncountry's commitment to freedom and democracy in the global arena, and \nI will continue to promote expansion of the alliance to include \nEurope's new democracies which demonstrate the ability to handle the \nresponsibility of NATO membership.\n  Ronald Reagan used to talk about trust but verify. Although we have \nentered into some new negotiations with President Putin and Russia, my \nhistory makes me a little bit uneasy. One of the thoughts I had is that \nnow that these countries, which I so longed to have freedom, have \nfreedom, we verify they will continue to have freedom.\n  In other words, they have their self-determination, they have \nfreedom, but the only thing that will make me comfortable before I am \ntaken to some other place is that we verify this trustful relationship \nwe have with Russia.\n  Mr. President, the only way I think we can verify that relationship \nis to make sure these democracies become part of NATO. That will assure \nme that the big boot of someone will not again step on those nations \nthat have been through so much during the last century.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this important \nlegislation which makes clear the Senate's strong support for NATO \nenlargement in Prague this November.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend my good friend from Ohio. He has \na very clear understanding through many long years of travel experience \nand, indeed, his proud heritage. In many debates we have had in this \nChamber, particularly with regard to the Baltics, he has brought an \nimportant perspective, and I commend him.\n  I am glad the Senator spoke with reference to Russia. I join with my \ncolleague from Indiana. I hope our President is able to make further \nprogress with President Putin. They made good progress to date. I am \nsupportive of the arms control initiatives that will soon be brought to \nthis Chamber. Ronald Reagan's credo, ``trust but verify,'' we should \nall follow.\n  I remember, I say to my colleagues, by coincidence I was visiting \nwith Secretary of Defense Cohen, our former colleague, in NATO, sitting \nin the council room of the North Atlantic Council when for the first \ntime a Russian marshal walked in and was seated those many years ago, \nand they started a relationship with Russia. Does my colleague remember \nthat? I also remember there came a time when Russia abdicated that \nrelationship and walked away from it.\n  I support the initiatives by the President, but let's be mindful of \nthe past.\n  I wish to say to my good friends in the Chamber of the Senate \ntonight, I seem to be the sole vote of the conscience that I worry \nabout this expansion. If we were to admit nine nations, I say to my \ndear friend from Ohio, nine nations--and that is what this document \nbasically says. It sort of endorses, to use Senator Lugar's word, this \ndocument we are about to adopt tomorrow morning endorses--does my \ncolleague realize that if all nine go in, that will be 28 nations, give \na nation or two; that is just about double the original size of NATO.\n  I am heartened by this debate because we have succeeded in this \ndebate tonight to establish, No. 1, that the Senate will have the facts \nbefore it is to act intelligently at such time--I say intelligently, I \nalso mean being well informed to make an intelligent decision about the \nfacts of each of the aspirant countries before we hand them a final \ndocument as submitted by our President.\n  I say to my good friend from Delaware, in his earlier debate he said: \nWe will have a chance to act. The President will send up a list of \nnations, and I was proud to do it last time. I remind the Senator, that \nwill be too late for the Senate to act in an informed way.\n  If we examine the record tomorrow of this very fine debate, we will \nsee he now recognizes that we need time, as does the Senator from \nIndiana, and both Senators committed to bringing the Senate through a \nhearing process on the facts on which to make a judgment.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, will the Senator from Virginia yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. From what the Senator from Virginia just said, is it \nhis understanding that if this bill passes tomorrow, that means we are \nautomatically going to----\n  Mr. WARNER. No, and I am glad the Senator has raised that point. It \nwas drawn up very skillfully in the House of Representatives, picking \nselective quotes from our great President, whom I support, but those of \nus in the Chamber recognize, and as I have elicited from the chairman \nof the Foreign Relations Committee, and as agreed upon by \nmy distinguished friend from Indiana, the ranking member, this document \ncommits us to nothing more than the authorization of specific amounts \nof dollars to the nations that are aspiring to join. That is all it is. \nBut as it is reproduced and sent across the ocean to Europe and printed \nin the papers, I think people can say: Oh, the Senate has now acted; \nnot maybe in finality, but we are one step closer before we have the \nfacts before the body.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I must tell the Senator that my support does not \nguarantee I will support all nine of those countries coming in because \nwe are going to distinguish between those that are qualified and not \nqualified. As I mentioned in my remarks, I made it very clear to the \nleaders of these aspirant countries that they cannot take for granted \nthat they are going to be admitted into NATO unless they comply with \nthe requirements of the membership application plan.\n  I was with the President last Friday and discussed this issue with \nhim. He made it very clear to me that in spite of the fact he has made \nsome very strong statements about NATO expansion, he has made it very \nclear to those aspirant countries, to their Prime Ministers and \nPresidents, that they had to meet the requirements.\n  I want to make it clear, no one should assume from my vote on this \nand I hope a lot of others, that this is a layup shot and all these \ncountries are going to be coming into NATO because they have a long way \nfor that to happen.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I draw to my colleagues' attention, ``this \nact may be cited as the Gerald B. H. Solomon Freedom Consolidation Act \nof 2001.''\n  What is freedom consolidation? I am not sure. That is what concerns \nme. There are a number of phrases in here carefully elicited from \nspeeches, documents by our President and others, which portray--I know \none of my great loves in life is to paint a little bit. It is like a \nmontage. It is rather pretty. It is like a great painting, but if you \nlook at\n\n[[Page S4481]]\n\nit from afar you might say, ``We hear that we're in.''\n  I am glad tonight the distinguished Senators from Ohio, Indiana, and \nDelaware have made it very clear in response to my questions, this \ndocument upon which we are about to vote tomorrow does nothing more \nthan authorize sums of money.\n  Mr. LUGAR. May I respond to the distinguished Senator on that point?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I think the Senator is correct. I add that the actual \nauthorization of money will go to seven of the nine countries.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. LUGAR. The Senator is correct that the MAP program refers to \nnine, and therefore vigilantly we are looking at those criteria. I \nwould further offer my assurance that I plan to work with the \ndistinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee so that \nhearings will elicit from the administration what the findings have \nbeen from this MAP program, and that will have some bearing upon the \nvote of the Senator for various individuals.\n  My purpose in giving speeches early on this issue--and the \ndistinguished Senator has likewise been doing this--was to make sure \nthe debate was of a better quality than the last time around, when in \nfact at the summit some decisions were made in what otherwise would be \ncalled international horse trading. Granted, criteria had been met, and \na lot of debate had occurred, but in fact we are ahead of the game, as \nwe ought to be.\n  I respect the Senator's questions to make certain we are vigilant in \ngetting the facts and evaluating these countries closely.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for those comments.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I strongly support this bill, but at the \noutset I want to make clear what this bill does and does not do.\n  This bill makes a clear and unequivocal statement endorsing further \nenlargement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and it authorizes \nassistance to aspirant countries.\n  The bill does not choose which countries will be asked to join NATO \nin Prague in November, nor does it prejudge the vote in the Senate when \nthe treaty changes that includes new members comes before the Senate \nfor its advice and consent.\n  We want to pass this bill today to make a strong statement prior to \nthe President's trip to Europe that the Senate welcomes another round \nof enlargement to include those countries that are ready to accept the \nresponsibilities of membership.\n  Many nations aspire to join NATO including Estonia, Latvia, \nLithuania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Romania, Bulgaria, Macedonia, Croatia, \nand Albania. It will be up to NATO to decide which countries have met \nthe criteria of democratic governance and military preparedness.\n  I want to focus my remarks on the Baltic states, not because I oppose \nthe membership of other aspirant states. I always confess my prejudice \nwhen I speak about the Baltic states. My mother was born in Lithuania. \nSo when I speak of the Baltic countries, it is with particular personal \nfeeling. I have visited Lithuania on four or five different occasions \nand have also visited Latvia and Estonia several times.\n  I went to Lithuania a few years ago, along with my late brother, \nBill. We went to see the tiny town where our mother was born, \nJurbarkas. When we were there, we found that we had relatives, cousins, \nthat we never knew we had--family separated by the Iron Curtain.\n  I did not believe in my lifetime that I would see the changes that \nhave taken place in those three tiny countries. When I first visited \nLithuania back in 1979, it was under Soviet domination, and it was a \nrather sad period in the history of that country. The United States \nsaid for decades that we never recognized the Soviet takeover of the \nBaltic States. We always believed them to be independent nations that \nwere unfortunately invaded and taken over by the Soviets.\n  But in 1979, I saw the efforts of the Soviet Union to impose Russian \nculture upon the people in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia.\n  The Soviets expatriated many of the local people and sent them off to \nSiberia and places in the far reaches of Russia; and then they sent \nRussians into the Baltic states in an effort to try to homogenize them \ninto some entity that was more Russian that it was Baltic.\n  But it did not work. The people maintained--zealously maintained--\ntheir own cultures, and they kept their own religion, their own \nlanguages, and their own literature and their own dreams. I did not \nimagine in 1979 that I would ever see these Baltic states once against \nfree, and yet I lived to see that happen.\n  On March 1, 1990, Lithuania re-asserted its independence from the \ndomination of the Soviet Union. Latvia and Estonia followed with \ndeclarations canceling the Soviet annexation of their countries.\n  These declarations were not without cost. In January 1991, Soviet \nparatroopers stormed the Press House in Vilnius, injuring four people. \nBarricades were set up in front of the Lithuanian Parliament, the \nSeimas. On January 13, 1991, Soviet forces attacked the television \nstation and tower in Vilnius, killing 14 Lithuanians. One woman was \nkilled when she tried to block a Soviet armored personnel carrier. Five \nhundred people were injured during these attacks. In Latvia, peaceful, \nbut courageous crowds surrounded the parliament building in Riga to \nprevent a Soviet attack.\n\n  The images of crowds of unarmed civilians facing down Soviet tanks to \nprotect their parliaments in Vilnius and Riga was a powerful message of \nresistance that shocked Moscow and resonated throughout the Soviet \nUnion. Their courage led the way for other Soviet Republics to throw \noff the yolk of Soviet Communist imperialism, resulting in the \ndisintegration of the Soviet Union in August 1991.\n  Today these three nations have worked hard to become market \neconomies, to watch their democracies flourish. The fact that they want \nso much to be part of NATO is an affirmation of great hope and great \noptimism for the future of Europe. As countries like Lithuania, Latvia, \nand Estonia, and so many others that were either part of the Warsaw \nPact or even Soviet Republics become [part of NATO, they show the \ndramatic transformation into a democratic form and a new democratic \nvision in Europe, whole and free.\n  The Baltic countries have nurtured their relations with the West, but \nthey have also worked to have good relations with Russia. Despite the \nbitter experienced of years of Soviet occupation each Baltic country \nhas worked to be sure that its citizenship and language laws conform to \nEuropean standards, taking care not to discriminate against ethnic \nRussians.\n  As a result of these steps, and because of the United States and \nNATO's efforts to engage Russia in a positive relationship with NATO, \nRussia's opposition to Baltic membership in NATO has evaporated, or at \nleast receded to grudging acceptance.\n  The Baltic countries have also taken steps to fact up to the bitter \nhistory of the Holocaust, when hundreds of thousands of Lithuanian, \nEstonian, and Latvin Jews perished, by setting up a Holocaust museum, \nteaching about the history of the Holocaust in school, returning Torah \nscrolls, and working to restore Jewish property.\n  If we refuse to enlarge NATO further, we would have told these \ncountries that despite their epic and inspiring struggle to liberate \nthemselves from communism, the West had once again turned its back on \nthem. We must make it clear that Russia is welcome to cooperate with \nthe undivided, free, pros, and secure Europe that is being built.\n  Some people have questioned what these tiny countries would bring to \nNATO. NATO is not a country club, after all it is a military alliance.\n  When the Soviets troops finally left the Baltic countries, they took \neverything. There wasn't even a toilet seat left in a barracks, the \ndrain pipes were cemented shut, and the military hardware was gone. \nThey started from scratch. This has made their effort to building a \nmilitary harder and more expensive, but in some ways, it has been a \nblessing. The old Soviet ways disappeared along with their equipment. \nWestern ways of thinking about military organization were welcomed. In \n10 years, with the help of the United States, Poland, Great Britain, \nGermany, the Nordic countries, and others\n\n[[Page S4482]]\n\nin Europe, these countries have built new militaries on a Western \nmodel.\n  To be sure, they are small countries, but they have their niche. The \nBaltic countries can and will make a positive contribution to NATO. \nThey are building small militaries with a reserve system that can be \ncalled up in time of war. They have specialized in peacekeeping and \nlogical support and have participated in missions in Bosnia, Kosovo, \nand now in Kyrgyzstan. They each are spending the requisite 2 percent \nof GDP on defense, but have also pooled their resources and cooperated \non a Baltic Naval Squadron, a Baltic Defense College, and a Baltic \nPeacekeeping Battalion. They have worked together to create a joint air \nsurveillance network that NATO will be able to use and are contributing \nsome facilities, including an important former Soviet airbase.\n  When we ratified the membership of Poland, Hungary, and the Czech \nRepublic, some in the Senate doubted their contributions, worried about \ncost burdens, and feared adding these new members would have NATO \ncumbersome and unworkable. These problems have not materialized; \nrather, Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have been our staunch \nallies in NATO.\n  The model of the last round serves as well for this one. I believe we \nmust complete the job we started in 1999 to expand NATO and cement a \nstable, democratic, whole, and free Europe.\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of HR 3167, the \nGerald B.H. Solomon Freedom Consolidation Act. I am a cosponsor of S. \n1572, the Senate companion to this important bill.\n  Today freedom and democracy flourish from the Balkans to the Black \nSea. One cannot help but marvel at the transformation over the last \ndecade in Central and Eastern Europe. These countries have moved from \nmembers of the Warsaw Pact to allies of the United States in military \noperations in Bosinia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan.\n  An issue that has united these nations during this time of historic \ntransformation has been the commitment to democratic reforms and closer \nrelations with the United States. NATO membership, the strongest link \nbetween Europe and the United States, has been a cornerstone of the \nforeign and security policy goals of each of the member countries.\n  On May 19, 2000, the Foreign Ministers from nine NATO aspirant \ncountries met in Vilnius, Lithuania to jointly reiterate their desire \nto firmly entrench their nations in the western community of \ndemocracies. Latvia, Lithuanaia, Estonia, Slovenia, Slovakia, Albania, \nMacedonia, Romania and Bulgaria were at various stages of readiness for \nmembership. But from that day forward, these nations have demonstrated \nthat they could work together to pursue their individual goals for \nsecurity. In May 2001, Croatia joined this group--now called the \n``Vilnius 10.''\n  NATO has recognized their aspirations and has made clear its \nintention to extend invitations for membership at the Prague summit \nthis November. Each candidate nation will be judged on its own merits \nand progress.\n  And as the process of NATO enlargement moves forward, it is important \nto ensure that it does so in a way that enhances NATO and peace and \nstability in Europe.\n  The standards for new members are most clearly stated in Article X of \nthe Washington Treaty of 1949 the founding NATO document, which \nprovides two major criteria for membership. First, a nation must be, \n``in a position to futher the principles of this Treaty.'' In other \nwords, a nation must have a strong and demonstrated commitment to \ndemocratic ideals.\n  Second, the nation must be in a position ``to contribute to the \nsecurity of the North Atlantic area.'' NATO is a military alliance, and \nnew allies should strengthen, not weaken, transatlantic security.\n  Economic stability is part of these two requirements for joining the \nalliance. Military reforms and military commitments cost money, these \nnations must be able to pay for the commitments they make to the \nalliance. And economic stability also means political stability, a \ntheme that has underlined our current debate on trade policy.\n  Each of the Vilnius nations will be examined on the criteria. I \nmentioned above. This leglslation does nothing to prejudge the \ndecisions that will be made by the NATO member countries on which of \nthe aspirant nations will be invited to join the alliance.\n  This legislation unequivocally declares congressional and \nPresidential support for continued responsible enlargement of NATO.\n  This legislation also provides financial assistance, in the form of \nforeign military financing, to NATO candidate countries as they conduct \nthe reform and restructuring of their military forces to meet NATO \nrequirements.\n  We must be wise enough to seize this moment of dramatic and positive \nchanges in Europe, building onto what has been accomplished during the \nfirst 50 years of NATO. NATO expansion will help consolidate the \nfreedom the nations of Central and Eastern Europe have secured by \nincluding them in the world's most successful alliance, NATO.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today we are considering the \nGerald B.H. Solomon Freedom Consolidation Act. This bill, which passed \noverwhelmingly in the House of Representatives is identical to S. 1572 \nand has over 30 cosponsors here in the Senate was reported out \nunanimously by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in December of \nlast year.\n  The Gerald B.H. Solomon Freedom Consolidation Act reaffirms the \nSenate's support for continued enlargement of NATO, without naming any \nnames of who should receive an invitation to join. It also demonstrates \nthat extending security and stability in Europe through the enlargement \nof the most successful military alliance in modern history is not a \npartisan issue.\n  The bill endorses the vision of further enlargement of NATO \narticulated by President Bush on June 15, 2001, when he stated that, \n``all of Europe's new democracies, from the Baltic to the Black Sea and \nall that lie between, should have the same chance for security and \nfreedom.''\n  It also endorses the statement of former President Clinton, who in \n1996, said, ``NATO's doors will not close behind its first new members \n. . . [but] NATO should remain open to all of Europe's emerging \ndemocracies who are ready to shoulder the responsibilities of \nmembership.''\n  While President Bush said we should see how much and not how little \nwe can do, inviting new members into the alliance is a serious exercise \nrequiring careful consideration of applicant countries' capabilities \nand their commitment to democratic values.\n  When the time comes to select which countries should receive an \ninvitation to join NATO, we should ensure that the inclusion of a \nparticular candidate will make the alliance stronger.\n  In other words, does its military, geographic, political and public \ncommitment strengthen the Atlantic alliance and its ability to preserve \na stable and secure Europe?\n  NATO membership is not based solely on military capability. If NATO \nwere only about aligning the worlds greatest militaries then its \nmembership roster would include Israel and Russia or China and North \nKorea rather than Iceland and Norway.\n  I think we can all agree that values matter. Democratic values, the \nrule of law, religious freedoms, protection of minorities.\n  When the time comes to look at which countries should be invited to \njoin the alliance from those participating in the MAP, Membership \nAction Plan, process, we certainly should examine what capabilities \nthey bring to European security, the trans-Atlantic relationship and \nthe global war on terror.\n  However, perhaps what is more important than what contribution they \nhave made to KFOR, SFOR or Operation Enduring Freedom, or more \nimportant than their geography or the overflight rights they have \ngranted, is what they are doing within their own country.\n  Are they advancing a democratic society, working to eliminate \ngovernment corruption, preventing their country from being used as a \ntransit for the trafficking of women and children, protecting the \nrights of minorities and settling regional divisions?\n  Is bigger better? It can be.\n  The countries actively being considered for NATO membership that are \nin\n\n[[Page S4483]]\n\nthe MAP process all see the value of revitalizing the Atlantic \nalliance. They have demonstrated that they are ready to be an ally \nthrough contributions in Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan.\n  Every Slovak, Latvian, or Romanian that is back filling NATO in KFOR \nor SFOR or engaged in Operation Enduring Freedom means one less \nAmerican that is in harms way.\n  The time has come for NATO to address how decisions are made as not \nto repeat what came to be known in Kosovo as ``war by committee'' when \ntarget selection had to be cleared through the NATO capitals rather \nthan the NATO military commander.\n  Supporters and opponents to NATO Enlargement agree that the growing \ncapabilities gap between the United States and our European allies must \nbe addressed and will be addressed at the NATO summit in Prague.\n  We in the United States must be able to turn to our NATO allies as \nthey do us for capabilities to face the threats of today.\n  The world that we face has in fact changed and we, as well as our \nNATO allies, must do the real work of building the capabilities to \naddress what Secretary Rumsfeld called asymmetrical threats even prior \nto September 11.\n  It seems to me that top on the list of threats that both we and \nEurope face is the growing threat of weapons of mass destruction.\n  At the Prague Summit in November, NATO must properly address what we \ncan do together to address the threat posed by weapons of mass \ndestruction in the hands of our new common enemy, global terrorism.\n  What NATO's mission will be in the future is an important question. \nThirty-six years ago, in ``The Troubled Partnership,'' Henry Kissinger \nwrote of the difficulties in the Atlantic Alliance, and queried whether \nwe and Europe had the same vision for the future of NATO.\n  Differences still exist, however, we should not jeopardize all that \nNATO is by focusing on what it is not; rather we should see how NATO \ncan better address the threats that we see so clearly since September \n11.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, when I first came to Congress, Slovakia \nand Slovenia didn't exist at all, Bulgaria and Romania were hostile \nstates in the darkest depths of the Soviet empire, and the Baltic \nstates of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania lived only in the hearts and \nsouls of their people, their sovereign nationhood snuffed out by Soviet \nannexation. This evening, we debate a clear and noncontroversial Sense \nof the Senate resolution expressing our support for these same nations' \naspirations to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the \nalliance we formed to counter the aggression that once placed each of \nthese nations on the far side of the Iron Curtain, in one of the \ngreatest organized assaults on our values since we claimed them as our \nown.\n  Our consideration of these nations' candidacy to join NATO at the \nPrague Summit in November is a victory for democracy, for freedom, for \nwhat we fought from 1941 until 1989 to bring about: a Europe whole and \nfree. Our Alliance reflects Europe's continuing and historic transition \nfrom hostile division to a continental zone of enlightened rule within \nsecure borders. But that transition remains incomplete.\n  NATO's fate, and that of Europe, rests upon completing the job we \nstarted at the 1999 Washington summit, and which we will continue in \nPrague this November. As President Bush stated last summer in Warsaw: \nall of Europe's new democracies, from the Baltics to the Black Sea, \nshould have a chance to join the North Atlantic Alliance.\n  The last round of NATO enlargement demonstrated the importance of the \nalliance as a living, vibrant institution, committed to meeting the \nsecurity challenges of the Euro-Atlantic region. Cold war-minded \ncritics contended then that we were creating a new dividing line in \nEurope. But the result of enlargement was to extend stability and \nsecurity eastwards, into lands where the absence of these qualities has \nfrequently led to armed conflict in the past.\n  Critics of the last round of enlargement said NATO's consensual \ndecisionmaking process would become bogged down by the addition of new \nmembers. But to the extent that consensus over NATO's response to \nSlobodan Milosevic's crimes in Kosovo was difficult to achieve, the \nnewest members of the alliance often provided the strongest support \nwithin our councils for joint military action. NATO's newest members \nalso made important human, material, and geographic contributions to \nthe alliance's mission.\n  Now, critics argue that the new threats of terrorism and mass \ndestruction bring NATO's mission and future into question. It is hard \nto understand why. Yes, America and some of our European allies have \ndisagreed about how best to pursue the war on terrorism. But our shared \nconviction about the common values that require our defense is not in \ndoubt. NATO is not less important after September 11; it is more \nimportant. For the first time in its history, the alliance invoked \nArticle V, the mutual self-defense clause binding upon all members, \nafter the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. Until very \nrecently, allied aircraft patrolled America's skies. Today, 16 of the \nexisting 19 members of the alliance have boots on the ground alongside \nAmerican forces in and around Afghanistan. Remarkably, a number of the \nnations that aspire to NATO membership have also deployed forces to \nsupport allied military operations. They don't yet have a treaty \ncommitment, but they are acting like they do, in a gesture of goodwill \nthat transcends mere rhetoric about our common values by putting men in \nharm's way to defend them.\n  Our fundamental goal at Prague must be to transform what has become a \nsomewhat divisive trans-Atlantic debate about the role and relevance of \nour NATO partners in the war on terrorism into a concrete plan of \naction to align the alliance's purpose of collective defense with the \nthreats of terrorism and weapons of mass destruction--dangers that \nthreaten the people of Europe no less than the American people, as we \nsaw most recently in the tragic bombing in Karachi, Pakistan that took \nthe lives of 11 French nationals.\n  I believe the hand-wringing in Washington academic circles and the \ncorridors of Brussels about the alliance's existential crisis is \nmisplaced. Rather than engaging in a stifling, bureaucratic debate \nabout NATO's core purpose, we should devote our attention to sustaining \nthe success our Alliance has enjoyed in deterring Soviet aggression, \nbringing a stable peace to the Balkans, and uniting our community of \nvalues. The Bush administration's far-sighted agenda for Prague \nreflects an effort to build on NATO's successes in concert with our \nallies, in order that its future in the defense of freedom may be as \nstoried as its past.\n  The Freedom Consolidation Act addresses the enlargement pillar of \nthis agenda. We do not require the mere ceremonies of enlargement, and \nthe new faces it brings to our councils, for fear of institutional \nfailure, or for lack of some higher purpose. We must enlarge this \nalliance to complete the task we started in 1949: to create an \nimpregnable zone of stability, security, and peace in Europe that is \nupheld by our joint military power, rooted in our resolve to defend \nthis territory against aggression, and inspired by our commitment to \nthe principles of liberty, to which we pledge our sacred honor.\n  In doing so, we replace the containment strategy of the cold war era \nwith the enlargement of our community of values. We relegate Yalta's \ndivision of Europe to the history books. We forge a new Euro-Atlantic \ncommunity, transformed by the values we fought the cold war to defend. \nAnd we celebrate the freedom that almost all European peoples enjoy \ntoday as a consequence of our mutual sacrifice.\n  Our task is to invigorate our alliance with this premise: that the \nAtlantic community is not a group of cold war-era military allies \nlooking for new missions to stay relevant, but a political community of \nlike-minded nations, challenging the cruel dictates of history and \ngeography, that is dedicated to the principles of democracy, and to \nfostering a continent where war is unimaginable and security, \nguaranteed--even as it faces new and grave threats to these core \nprinciples. The threats have changed since 1949; our commitment to the \ndefense of freedom has not. NATO's purpose remains sound, and its role, \nindispensable.\n\n[[Page S4484]]\n\n  Seven nations are serious contenders to receive invitations to join \nour alliance in November. Three more are engaged in a longer-term \nprocess of preparing themselves to meet NATO's membership criteria. I \ncannot think of a better example of the triumph of our values, and the \nsuccess of the institutions we have built to serve and protect them, \nthan the urgency with which the aspirant nations now pursue membership \nin our alliance. We should welcome them, when they are ready. I believe \nthe seven serious candidates for this round of enlargement will be. \nThey hold their destiny in their hands, and we wish them well in \nworking aggressively to meet the criteria for NATO membership. I hope \nwe can soon call these nations our allies, in the truest sense of the \nword.\n  While I support a ``Big Bang'' enlargement of the alliance into \nnorthern, central, and southern Europe, I believe the southern \ndimension of NATO enlargement is perhaps the most compelling on \nstrategic grounds. NATO's southeastern expansion into Bulgaria and \nRomania would secure Europe's southern flank, enhance stability in the \nwestern Balkans, and end Turkey's strategic isolation from the \nalliance. It would help diminish continuing frictions in Turkey's \nrelationship with the EU, minimizing Turkish grievances over the \nquestion of an independent European security identity and opening the \ndoor to the development of effective coordination between the EU and \nNATO. A visionary enlargement of the NATO alliance to the south \ncombined with the EU's historic expansion to the east would bring about \na new and welcome cohesion of Turkey to Europe. This is in the \ninterests of Turkey, the European Union, the United States, and NATO.\n  The most compelling defense of war is the moral claim that it allows \nthe victors to define a stronger and more enduring basis for peace. \nJust as September 11 revolutionized our resolve to defeat our enemies, \nso has it brought into focus the opportunities we now have to secure \nand expand freedom.\n  Senate passage of the Freedom Consolidation Act sends an important \nsignal to our allies, present and future, about America's commitment to \nsustaining the success our alliance has enjoyed for 50 years. It \nprovides the administration an enthusiastic vote of confidence in its \nvisionary campaign to enlarge and transform NATO to meet the new \nthreats. It reminds us all that freedom's power is multiplied, not \ndiminished, as more people share in it.\n  Former Estonian Prime Minister Mart Laar wrote a wonderful book about \nthe Estonian resistance to Soviet occupation. He recalls the fervor \nwith which Estonian patriots resisted Soviet aggression, and their \ndreadful realization that no outside power would intervene to save \ntheir nation from Soviet tyranny. He writes:\n\n       Nobody believed that Estonia would, for decades and \n     decades, be left in the hands of the Soviets. That wasn't \n     even a possibility. It's only a question of time, everybody \n     thought. But after decades went by, the idea about the West \n     coming to their aid disappeared. The fight in the forest \n     became a personal thing. These people fought because they \n     simply wanted to die as free men.\n\n  Today, Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, Slovenians, Slovakians, \nBulgarians, and Romanians live as free men, and women, in testament to \nthe same values for which patriots before them lived, and died. The \nvalues we in the U.S. Senate invoke today as we express our support for \nthe right of these nations to choose their destiny in the collective \ndefense of freedom.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization, is an alliance of free, democratic nations, unique in \nhuman history for its characteristics and its success. Today, the \nalliance's principled strength not only protects the peace and freedom \nof the transatlantic community, but contributes to building a world \nthat is ever more free, more democratic, and more prosperous.\n  For years, physical defense of member nations' home soil, as defined \nunder Article V of the North Atlantic Treaty, has been the core of our \nalliance. Since the end of the cold war, NATO has constantly \nreconsidered the landscape of threats to security and freedom and has \nresponded to that changing landscape by defining new missions and new \ncapability needs. In Bosnia and then Kosovo, NATO applied appropriate \nforce just outside its immediate borders for the common good of \nstability in Europe. And it did so successfully with partner forces \nfrom non-NATO European states.\n  Partner states are learning from NATO and striving to emulate the \nalliance's standards of military professionalism, transparent civilian \ncontrol of military power and resources, and the legal and civil \nfoundations of popular legitimacy. Many of those partner states aspire \nto full membership in the alliance. I believe that opening membership \nto a large number of nations will make NATO an even more potent \nprotector of transatlantic and global security from threats including \nterrorism, a better facilitator of regional conflict resolution, and a \nmore influential incubator of democracy.\n  Senator Warner reminds us, correctly, that the alliance is so \nsuccessful because it provides history's standard for rigorous and \nprofessional military planning and execution. But NATO is also the \nflagship institution in America's post-WWII success in widening the \ncircle of democracy, stability, and prosperity across the transatlantic \nregion. The achievement of ``Europe, whole, free and at peace'' will \nlikely be remembered as the greatest legacy of American foreign policy \nin the 20th century, because it is the foundation for greater \nopportunity in this century, as well as greater collective security.\n  I believe that any democratic European nation that meets NATO's \ncriteria and can be a net contributor to the security of the alliance \nshould be admitted. I support welcoming into NATO at the Prague summit \nas many candidate nations as meet these criteria.\n  Let us focus for a moment on the alliance's adaptation to new \nmissions. The awful events of September 11th prompted NATO to invoke \nArticle V and respond to attacks on American soil by supporting a war \nagainst an enemy half a world away from the United States. Technology \nhas collapsed geographical distinctions to the point that today, a plot \nconceived anywhere in the world can pose just as serious a threat to \nNATO members' security as an aggressive military movement across a \nEuropean border. Clearly, NATO accepts this new reality and must \nembrace a more expansive geographical understanding of its mission. \nThis evolution in alliance thinking is realistic and healthy.\n  The aspirant states embrace this mission, too. Declaring their intent \nto act as de facto allies of the United States, partner states have \noffered enhanced information sharing, overflight rights, transit and \nbasing privileges, military and police forces, medical units and \ntransport support to U.S. efforts. Most of the aspirant states are \nparticipating in some fashion in the International Security Assistance \nForce in Afghanistan, working well with our forces under Central \nCommand.\n  The North Atlantic Alliance has before it a summit meeting in Prague \nthis November, at which all the crucial issues--adapting methods of \noperation, refining NATO's mission, committing to achieve the necessary \ncapabilities, and enlargement--require our engagement. I trust that the \nadministration is working with allies to achieve a consensus on \nenlargement before the Prague Summit. And I take the administration at \nits word that it will consult the Congress and especially the Senate \nregularly about summit issues, as it has done in the February 28 \nhearing of the Armed Services Committee and at staff level in the \nmonths before. In due course, the Senate will deliberate over the \nindividual accession agreements that the alliance may negotiate with \naspirant states. Our scrutiny of those candidates and their commitments \nwill provide them with added impetus to raise democratic and military \nstandards and be the best allies they can be.\n  The Freedom Consolidation Act of 2001, which I cosponsored here in \nthe Senate, is our political signal that the Senate welcomes \nconsideration of new members and holds fast to the vision of a Europe \nwhole, free, and at peace, a vision which Presidents Bill Clinton and \nGeorge W. Bush have articulated. It also authorizes part of the \ninvestment our Nation is making in states that share our vision. The \nbill will do the following: reaffirm Congressional support for \ncontinued NATO enlargement; designate Slovakia as eligible to\n\n[[Page S4485]]\n\nreceive U.S. assistance under the NATO Participation Act of 1994; and, \nendorse the Foreign Military Financing (FMF) levels for the Baltic \nstates, Slovenia, Romania, and Bulgaria that the administration sought \nfor the current fiscal year.\n  In the Armed Services Committee on February 28 we had a thorough \nairing of questions about the aspirant states. NATO Supreme Commander \nGeneral Ralston's testimony in particular illustrated that there is \npractical work going on with all of them and that they expect further \nscrutiny of their preparedness. The aspirants know they each have a \ncase to make. They are busy in the Congress and expert community \nexplaining their progress and asking what they need to do more or \nbetter. In terms of money and military-to-military cooperation, we are \nalready doing what this bill conveys, both bilaterally and in NATO.\n  And so I urge my colleagues to join Senator Helms, the other \ncosponsors and myself in sending this signal that America values the \nNATO alliance, that we value the security arrangements and political \nprinciples NATO so crucially advances, and that we value friendly \nstates that share our values and vision.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3167, the \nFreedom Consolidation Act of 2002.\n  The title of this bill says it all, our goal here today, and our goal \nwhen we enlarge NATO this November, is to consolidate the gains that \nfreedom has made in Europe since 1989.\n  Thirteen years ago, in a series of wonderful evolutions and \nrevolutions, the people of eastern Europe threw off the shackles of \ncommunism and sent the Warsaw Pact to the dustbin of history.\n  Since then, the many nations of eastern and central Europe, some of \nthem brand new, have striven mightily to establish democratic \ninstitutions and develop market-based economies. This is nothing short \nof a Herculean task, given the magnitude of the problems that beset \ncommunist systems as they were in their terminal phase.\n  The people carrying out this difficult and historic transformation \nneed and deserve all the support we can give them. One of the ways we \ncan provide that support is to encourage the further enlargement of \nNATO. Membership in NATO will ease the strain on these newly free \ncountries and assist in their transformation to market democracies.\n  This is true for several reasons. First, membership in NATO, with its \nbedrock security commitment contained in Article V, will promote a \nstable environment in which these countries can pursue reforms. Second, \nmembership in NATO will foster an ever greater flow of information and \nideas between the U.S., western Europe and these new democracies. \nThird, membership in NATO will require these nations to maintain \ndemocratic systems and uphold the rule of law, thus giving them the \nincentive to continually deepen their reform process.\n  These benefits of NATO enlargement, the consolidation of freedom, the \nencouragement of the reform process in former communist countries, and \nthe expansion of the zone of stability and peace in Europe, are all \nvery much in the U.S. interest.\n  I think that recognition of these benefits is why there has been such \nstrong congressional support for NATO enlargement dating back to at \nleast 1994. By reaffirming past statements of support for enlargement \nby Congress, by Presidents Bush and Clinton and by NATO itself, and by \nauthorizing assistance to seven aspirant countries, this bill continues \nthat tradition.\n  At Munich and Yalta, it was decided that, as Neville Chamberlain \ntermed them, ``small, far-away'' countries could be sacrificed. The \nghosts of those two tragic episodes have haunted Europe for over 60 \nyears. A further round of NATO enlargement will help exorcize those \nghosts. Therefore, as NATO prepares for its Prague Summit in November, \nI hope it will heed the words of President Bush, who stated last year \nthat ``as we plan to enlarge NATO, . . . we should not calculate how \nlittle we can get away with, but how much we can do to advance the \ncause of freedom.''\n  In other words, we should seek to offer NATO membership to as many \nnew members as possible. That being said, NATO must of course be \njudicious in the selection process. NATO is not a club, it's an \nalliance. And enlargement is not a free pass to security for new \nmembers. NATO membership demands commitment from and places obligations \nupon those new members.\n  One of those obligations is the maintenance of adequate defense \nbudgets. New members must be able to offer equipment, forces and \ncapabilities that actually make a net contribution to NATO. As has been \nmuch discussed of late, NATO already suffers from the so-called \ncapabilities gap. That is, as we have learned from the campaigns in the \nBalkans and Afghanistan, there is a large and growing gap between the \nmilitary capabilities of the United States and most of its NATO allies.\n  Although the United States has reduced defense spending over the past \ndecade or so, the cuts in Europe have been even more severe. This is \nreflected in the fact that while we devote over 3 percent of our GDP to \ndefense, the European average is now below 2 percent. This simple fact \ngoes a long way toward explaining why NATO, despite its very helpful \nand much appreciated invocation of Article V after September 11, has \nnot participated in the campaign in Afghanistan. NATO should not \nexacerbate the capabilities gap by offering membership to countries \nthat are not serious about actually contributing to a military \nalliance.\n  Still, NATO must seize this moment. This is a historic opportunity to \nmake Europe whole again after decades of war, division, and tyranny. \nThat is why I support this bill and hope it will pass overwhelmingly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I will close this debate, unless others \nseek recognition, by reiterating my concern is for the American service \nperson--soldier, sailor, airman, and marine--who at some point in time, \nbecause of the articles of this treaty, ``an attack on one is an attack \non all'', our service persons could be in the foxhole fighting, \nrepelling that attack with someone who is not trained, not equipped, \ncannot communicate and all the other problems we have had in seeking a \nuniformity of standards and military capabilities among the NATO \nforces.\n  We are putting our people at risk. We are asking our taxpayers, \nagain, to spend enormous sums of money as we did in the Balkan \noperations. I supported the Balkan operations. We did the right thing: \n70 percent of the combat missions, 50 percent of the airlift.\n  This is not the lone dissenter, I suppose, in the Senate speaking. \nThis is the Secretary General of NATO, Lord Robertson, whom my \ncolleague from Indiana and I have met through many years, former \nMinister of Defense from Great Britain, now Secretary General of NATO, \nwho said the following. And I will quote from Secretary General \nRobertson's speech on NATO's future at the February 2000 Wehrkunde \nConference in Munich:\n\n       The United States must have partners who can contribute \n     their fair share to operations which benefit the entire Euro-\n     Atlantic community. . . . But the reality is . . . hardly any \n     European country can deploy usable and effective forces in \n     significant numbers outside their borders, and sustain them \n     for months or even years as we all need to do today. For all \n     Europe's rhetoric, an annual investment of over $140 billion \n     by NATO's European members--\n\n  That is the current 18, our Nation being the 19th. And I remind my \ncolleagues, our military budget is $379 billion, which I am privileged \nto join with Chairman Levin to bring to the floor shortly. The total of \nall other 18 is $140 billion.\n\n       For all Europe's rhetoric, an annual investment of over \n     $140 billion by NATO's European members, we still need U.S. \n     help to move, command, and provision a major operation. \n     American critics of Europe's military incapability are right. \n     So, if we are to ensure that the United States moves neither \n     towards unilateralism nor isolationism, all European \n     countries must show a new willingness to develop effective \n     crisis management capabilities.\n\n  I am delighted we have had this debate tonight. I thank colleagues \nfor coming over at this very late hour and participating. It has given \nme the opportunity to make my points, to elicit very important \ncommitments from colleagues in position of authority. I am not \ndiscussing withdrawal from NATO, as may have been inferred by some. I \nhave not reached any conclusion about any one or several countries at \nthis\n\n[[Page S4486]]\n\npoint in time as to whether they should or should not be admitted into \nNATO. I do not believe this is an open-door policy.\n  I read article 10. It is quite specific in the treaty. It says again, \nyou must have the capability to contribute and bear your burden for the \nsecurity of the entire NATO.\n  I support efforts by our President with regard to Russia. Again, I \nthink we have covered that. To the extent that the additional nations \nin NATO can help in this war on terrorism, you will have my support. We \nhave had a good debate. I will do everything I can, and now tonight I \nam assured by others, to see this is done before the final document is \nvoted upon by the Senate.\n  I would like to add one thing to this debate. Our good colleague from \nDelaware, the chairman, said he thought perhaps tonight the only people \nfollowing this debate would be the ambassadors of the aspirant \ncountries and perhaps ambassadors from other countries, but I have \nfound there is a remarkable infrastructure in the Nation's Capital, and \nperhaps elsewhere. Many of them are volunteers, such as Mrs. Julie \nFinley, who is a lifetime friend of mine and who has done a lot of hard \nwork and constructive effort on her own initiative to invite members of \nthe aspirant nations, be they the prime ministers or the defense \nministers or the foreign ministers, to events so that colleagues can \nshare and have the opportunity to meet them. So I think there is a \ntremendous infrastructure. They may not be watching this debate \ntonight, but I think they will make reference to the record that we \nhave put together.\n  So I thank my good friend from Indiana because I believe what we have \ncontributed tonight is a very important step towards strengthening \nNATO.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I agree with the distinguished Senator from Virginia. I \nwould join him in paying tribute to Julie Finley, whose hospitality I \nhave enjoyed. It has been an opportunity, as the Senator has suggested, \nfor an educational experience about NATO members and aspirants to NATO.\n\n  I join the Senator also in his comments about Lord Robertson, who \nvisited this country recently. He spoke to the Council on Foreign \nRelations and was very candid, as the Senator from Virginia has pointed \nout, about the obligations of European countries, the lack of lift \ncapacity, the lack of sophisticated communication gear, the lack of the \nability to bring in aircraft for specific strikes, the ordnance for \nthis equipment. These are recognized problems.\n  This debate, and other ways we can focus on NATO, are very important \nin sharpening our own view of the alliance and of the possibilities of \nthis alliance in our mutual fight against terrorism. I thank the Chair. \nI thank my distinguished colleague. On our side of the argument, I \nyield back the time allotted to Senator Biden and to myself.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, yesterday I was honored to attend the 21st \nAnnual National Peace Officers Memorial Day Services at the Capitol.\n  Sadly, last year was the deadliest year in law enforcement history \nsince 1974. In 2001, 230 law enforcement officers were killed in the \nline of duty including 72 fallen heroes who were killed on September \n11.\n  These brave public servants risked and sacrificed their own lives so \nthat others might live. Each one of us owes these courageous men and \nwomen, and their families, a debt of gratitude that we can never fully \nrepay.\n  During Police Memorial Week, I hope that Congress will act on two \npieces of legislation to appropriately honor the families of brave \npublic safety officers who sacrificed their own lives for their fellow \nAmericans.\n  First, I urge the House of Representatives to take up the Mychal \nJudge Police and Fire Chaplains Public Safety Officers' Benefit Act of \n2002, S. 2431.\n  The Senate passed this bipartisan legislation more than a week ago. \nIt is needed to amend the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program to \npermit the families of 10 public safety officers killed on September 11 \nto retroactively receive $250,000 each in Federal death benefits.\n  Senator Campbell and I introduced this bipartisan measure, \ncosponsored by Senators Schumer, Clinton, Biden and Feingold, to \nretroactively restructure the Public Safety Officers' Benefit Program \nto provide benefits to fallen officers who died without a surviving \nspouse, child, or parent.\n  I commend Representatives Manzullo and Nadler for their bipartisan \nleadership on the House version of this bill, H.R. 3297.\n  Named for Chaplain Mychal Judge, who was killed while responding with \nthe New York City Fire Department to the September 11 terrorist attacks \non the World Trade Center, our bipartisan legislation recognizes the \ninvaluable service of police and fire chaplains in crisis situations by \nallowing for their eligibility in the Public Safety Officers' Benefit \nProgram.\n  Father Judge, while deemed eligible for public safety officer \nbenefits, was survived by his two sisters who, under current law, are \nineligible to receive death benefits. This is simply wrong and must be \nremedied.\n  Indeed, Father Judge is among 10 public safety officers killed on \nSeptember 11 whose survivors are ineligible for Federal death benefits \nbecause they are not surviving spouses, children, or parents of the \nofficers. This bill would retroactively correct this injustice by \nexpanding the list of those who may receive public safety officer \nbenefits to the beneficiaries named on the most recently executed life \ninsurance policy of the deceased officer. This change would go into \neffect on September 11 of last year to make sure the families of Father \nJudge and the nine other fallen heros receive their public safety \nofficer benefits.\n  By taking up the Senate-passed Mychal Judge Police and Fire Chaplains \nPublic Safety Officers' Benefit Act during Police Memorial Week, the \nHouse of Representatives can provide much-needed relief for 10 families \nof public safety officers who sacrificed their lives on September 11.\n  Second, I hope that later today the Senate will consider the Law \nEnforcement Tribute Act, S. 2179, introduced by Senator Carnahan.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved this legislation \nto create a $3 million Department of Justice grant program to help \nStates, local governments and Indian tribes establish permanent \ntributes to fallen public safety officers. I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of Senator Carnahan's bill to honor officers killed in the \nline of duty.\n  During Police Memorial Week, the Senate should pass Senator \nCarnahan's legislation to provide Federal resources to our States and \nlocal communities to pay proper tribute to the brave public safety \nofficers.\n  I hope Congress will act expeditiously on these two important pieces \nof legislation to salute public safety officers across the country and \nhonor the brave men and women who gave the ultimate sacrifice to serve \nand protect us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/16/senate-section/article/S4486-4", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4486-S4487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

GRAHAM. Mr. President, I was unable to deliver this statement \nduring the debate on this amendment Tuesday. However, I want to covey \nmy strong support for the amendment that was offered by my colleagues \nfrom Massachusetts and California recognizing the November 2001 Doha \nDeclaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health. I am pleased that \nthis amendment was adopted and included in this trade package.\n  I supported this amendment because I believe that the Declaration and \nthe amendment, properly reaffirm the commitment of the United States \nand of all WTO members to the need to maintain strong global standards \nfor intellectual property protection while underscoring that measure \nnecessary to meet genuine public health emergencies in poor countries \ncan and must be pursued within the TRIPS framework. Solving the problem \nof access to HIV/AIDS medicines lies in overcoming economic and social \nbarriers to distribution and effective treatment. Undermining \nintellectual property protection is not part of the solution and will, \nindeed, only aggravate an already progress towards better treatment \nand, ultimately, a cure. Indeed as was documented in the October 17, \n2001 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, in the \nsub-Saharan countries ravaged by AIDS there are very few if any patents \non the books for HIV/AIDS medicines. The authors of this exhaustive \nstudy concluded that ``[T]he data suggest that patents in Africa have \ngenerally not been a factor in either pharmaceutical economics or \nantiretroviral drug treatment access.''\n  If I thought that this amendment's intenent was to contribute to the \ncampaign to distort the meaning of the Doha Declaration and erode \nessential TRIPS protections, I would have opposed it. However, I have \nbeen assured that this was not the sponsors' intent, nor the effect of \nits terms, and I therefore support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/16/senate-section/article/S4487-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred September 5, \n1994 in Seattle, WA. A gay couple was physically assaulted by a group \nof people shouting anti-gay slurs. Two of the attackers, Candice \nUnderwood and Steven Lee, were charged with malicious harassment in \nconnection with the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/16/senate-section/article/S4487-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              HONORING LIEUTENANT COMMANDER WILLIAM MUSCHA\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, almost 20 years ago I had the good \nfortune of selecting Bill Muscha, a boy from Fargo, ND, as my nominee \nfor the Naval Academy. He had been a member of his high school ROTC, a \nnewspaper carrier, a Merit Scholar, an altar boy, a violinist, an Eagle \nScout, a Sunday schoolteacher, a good kid. He was bright, well \nmannered, disciplined, dedicated to his career choice. I was pleased at \nthe caliber of this youth and proud to be able to send him to \nAnnapolis.\n  Now, many years later, I have the painful duty of announcing to my \ncolleagues here in the U.S. Senate, that Lieutenant Commander William \nMuscha has been killed in the line of duty. He was aboard a Navy \nSaberliner jet, out of the Pensacola Naval Air Station, which went down \nin the Gulf of Mexico on May 10.\n  As my colleagues understand so well, one of the great joys of serving \nin the Congress is being able to appoint young men and women to the \nNation's military academies. Inevitably, these are the best and \nbrightest, star scholars, skilled athletes, shining patriots, engaging \nyoungsters who are unusually mature, who already know what they want to \ndo with their lives. When they are selected, their families are \nexuberant, their schools celebrate, and their hometowns swell with \npride, and the students thank us warmly for the great favor we have \nbestowed on them.\n  But the truth is that these youngsters are the ones that the Members \nof Congress should be thanking. Senators don't need any plaudits for \ndoing their job. The tributes always ought go instead to these \nwonderful teenagers who volunteer to serve their Nation in positions \nthat are difficult, challenging, and dangerous. America is \nextraordinarily fortunate to have these kids step forward every year \nand pledge to defend their homeland.\n  Commander Muscha is a proud symbol of this Nation's tradition of \ncitizen soldiers, the youngsters who come out of our high schools and \nneighborhoods, and pledge their lives to defend us. His sudden death is \na sobering reminder of the hazards of military life. The perils of that \ncareer, dangers which led to the unhappy loss of Commander Muscha, are \none reason why the men and women of the Armed Services are so respected \nby the American people. As their representative, I am both humbled and \nhonored to stand here today, and salute this North Dakota patriot, and \nto send the Nation's sympathies to his grieving family.\n  He leaves his wife, Tamara, and their six children, Kara, Riley, \nAndrew, Molly, Zachary, and Emily: his parents, Robert and Carol \nMuscha; a sister, Major Diane Jones, and her husband, Scott; and the \nAmerican Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/16/senate-section/article/S4487-4", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4487]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HONORING BRIGID DEVRIES\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and \nhonor Brigid DeVries of Lexington, Kentucky, for being named the sixth \ncommissioner of the Kentucky High School Athletic Association. Brigid \nDeVries, an assistant commissioner with the KHSAA for the past 23 \nyears, is the first female head of the KHSAA and one of only four women \nacross the entire United States to serve as commissioner or executive \ndirector of a state athletics association.\n  Ms. DeVries, a Lexington native, attended the University of Kentucky \nand graduated with a bachelor's degree in Health, Physical Education \nand Recreation in 1971. After graduating from UK, Ms. DeVries became a \nphysical education teacher at Nicholas County Elementary School. Her \nnext position took her out of Kentucky to the state of Ohio, where she \nserved as the women's swimming and diving and track and field coach at \nOhio University. After three years at Ohio University, Ms. DeVries \nreturned to her alma mater, where she took over as men's and women's \ndiving coach from 1980-1990. In 1979, she was hired as assistant \ncommissioner of the KHSAA, and in 1994 was named executive assistant \ncommissioner. Among other duties, she has directed the organization's \ngender-equity program, conducted eligibility investigations and \nassisted in management of the state football and basketball \nchampionships.\n  Ms. DeVries has the experience, education and intensity to fill this \nposition without fear, hesitation, or reluctance. She has been a \nteacher, coach and administrator for many years now and certainly is \nqualified to lead the KHSAA for many years to come. I wish her the best \nof luck throughout her tenure as commissioner and look forward to \ncharting her success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/16/senate-section/article/S4487-5", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4487-S4488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL NANCY R.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a great \nAmerican and a true heroine in the Department of Defense who has \nhonorably served\n\n[[Page S4488]]\n\nour country for over 34 years: Major General Nancy R. Adams, United \nStates Army Nurse Corps. Major General Adams has had a brilliant career \nin the military. She quickly rose through the Army ranks as a medical-\nsurgical nurse totally dedicated to caring for people. Her leadership \nabilities and talents were quickly recognized, and her performance in a \nvariety of roles was exemplary. Her exceptional career includes many \nprestigious assignments, such as: Chief of the Army Nurse Corps, \nCommanding General of the Center of the U.S. Army Center for Health \nPromotion and Preventive Medicine, Commanding General of William \nBeaumont Army Medical Center and the Southwest Regional Medical \nCommand, and culminated with her assignment as Commanding General of \nTripler Army Medical Center and the Pacific Regional Medical Command.\n  Major General Adams initiated numerous changes that have improved the \ndelivery of health care to our men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies, and she has led the fight to improve business practices in \nthe Department of Defense. She has played a key role in the delivery of \ncare to our deserving veterans, always emphasizing the need for an \nintegrated system that puts patients' needs first. Such perseverance \nand commitment to the health of this Nation has garnered her numerous \naccolades not only from military and civilian health care organizations \nbut from academic institutions as well. She has been a champion for \nwomen's rights in the military and holds the distinction of being the \nsenior ranking women on active duty at this time in the United States \nArmy. Major General Adams has fostered the proud and cherished \ntraditions of the military with her unselfish service. Her performance \nreflects greatly on herself, the United States Army Medical Command, \nthe United States Army, the Department of Defense, and the United \nStates of America. I extend my deepest appreciation on behalf of a \ngrateful Nation for her dedicated service. Congratulations, Major \nGeneral Nancy Adams. I wish you Godspeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/16/senate-section/article/S4488-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       IN MEMORY OF BERNICE BROWN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues today to \nreflect on the rich life and legacy of Bernice Layne Brown. Mrs. Brown \nwas the matriarch of a remarkable California family, one that has had a \nprofound and positive effect on my State for the past 60 years.\n  Bernice Brown was the wife of the late Governor of California Pat \nBrown, and mother of another former Governor, Oakland Mayor Jerry \nBrown; as well as mother to former California State Treasurer Kathleen \nBrown; Cynthia Brown Kelly and Barbara Casey Siggins.\n  A true treasure to the Brown family and to all Californians, Bernice \nBrown, at the age of 93, died of natural causes on May 8, 2002 at her \nhome in Beverly Hills. Mrs. Brown was the daughter of San Francisco \nPolice Captain Arthur Layne. In her high school years, she met Pat \nBrown, and eloped with him in 1930 after making her living as a \nteacher. They were married for an impressive 65 years.\n  During the beginning of her husband's political career, she focused \nher time on raising their children. Although liking to avoid the \nspotlight, she was a wonderful asset to her family's campaigns and \npolitical careers and represented her family with dignity, respect and \ngrace. While famous for her elegance and decorum, she was also an \nexperienced campaigner who never shied away from giving frank advice to \nthe various members of her political brood.\n  Bernice Brown will be missed not only by her loving family, but by \nthe people of California, who grew to respect her quiet ways in the \nfray of politics. California has lost a remarkable matriarch, and we \nwill never forget the legacy she has left us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/16/senate-section/article/S4488-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4488]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATIONS TO GERALD K. OLSON\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Gerald \nK. Olson on becoming the new Chairman of the American Association of \nAirport Executives.\n  One of the most rewarding aspects of being a United States Senator is \nthat I frequently have the opportunity to meet wonderful people who \nwere born and raised in North Dakota and are making a difference in \npeople's lives through their chosen profession. Although he may no \nlonger reside in our great State, Jerry Olson is one of those \nindividuals that North Dakotans are proud to call one of their own.\n  Jerry grew up on a farm eight miles southwest of Minot where his \nparents still live and he graduated from the University of North Dakota \nin 1982. Although the aviation department started out with just two \nsmall aircraft and two faculty members, what is now known as the John \nD. Odegard School of Aerospace Sciences has evolved into one of the \ngreat aerospace programs in the country.\n  It should not surprise anyone that Jerry Olson had a hand in shaping \nthat successful program when he was a student in Grand Forks and when \nhe later managed airports in Williston, ND and Cheyenne, WY. During his \nentire professional career, Jerry has been a strong advocate for \ncontinuing education and has spent a great deal of his time helping and \nnurturing students studying airport administration at the University of \nNorth Dakota.\n  For approximately twenty years, Jerry has also worked hard to improve \nair service for those who live in small communities in North Dakota, \nWyoming and around the country. People in rural areas who are fighting \nfor better access to the commercial aviation system have no better \nadvocate than Jerry Olson. And despite all the contributions he has \nmade to aviation over the years, I suspect Jerry's most proud of the \nfact that he is a dedicated husband and father.\n  I know I speak on behalf of all North Dakotans when I thank Gerald K. \nOlson for his service and congratulate him on becoming the new chairman \nof the American Association of Airport Executives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/16/senate-section/article/S4488-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4488-S4489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DR. FAYE GLENN ABDELLAH\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Dr. Faye \nGlenn Abdellah, who is about to retire after 49 years of service to the \nFederal Government and the Nation. Dr. Abdellah is currently serving as \nthe Founding Dean of the Graduate School of Nursing, GSN, Uniformed \nServices University of the Health Sciences, USUHS. It does not seem so \nlong ago that the United States Senate recognized Dr. Abdellah's \ninduction into the National Women's Hall of Fame in October of 2000 for \na lifetime spent establishing and leading essential health care \nprograms for our country.\n  I have had the privilege of knowing Dr. Abdellah for many years, and \nI would be remiss if I were to focus only on the last nine years of Dr. \nAbdellah's service as Dean of the GSN. Dr. Abdellah is a nurse, and \neducator, a researcher, and an internationally recognized leader in \nnursing. As the first nurse to hold the rank of Rear Admiral, Upper \nHalf, and the title of Deputy Surgeon General of the United States, her \nincredible leadership abilities have resulted in many truly remarkable \naccomplishments. Her numerous achievements include: the development of \nthe first tested coronary care unit, which saved thousands of lives, \nthe authorship or co-authorship, of more than 152 publications, some of \nwhich have been translated into six languages and which have altered \nnursing theory and practice, and the receipt of almost 90 professional \nand academic honors and eleven honorary degrees, all recognizing her \ninnovative work in nursing research and health care. She has the unique \nhonor of being elected as a Charter Fellow of the American Academy of \nNursing where she later served as the Academy's Vice President and \nPresident.\n  Dr. Abdellah was also the recipient of the prestigious Allied Signal \nAward in 1989 and the Institute of Medicine's Gustav O. Lienhard Award \nin 1992. In 1994, the American Academy of Nursing presented her with \n``The Living Legend'' Award; in 1999, she was elected to the Hall of \nFame for Distinguished Graduates and Scholars at Columbia University. \nOn April 30, 2001, she received the ``Breaking Ground in Women's Health \nAward'' in Chicago, IL. Her military awards include: the Surgeon \nGeneral's Medallion and Medal, two United States Public Health Service\n\n[[Page S4489]]\n\nDistinguished Service Medals; the USUHS Distinguished Service and \nMeritorious Service Medals, the Secretary of the Department of Health \nEducation and Welfare Distinguished Service Award, and two Founders \nMedals from the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States. \nDr. Abdellah is renowned as an expert in health policies related to \nlong-term care, mental retardation, the developmentally disabled, \naging, hospice, and AIDS; her pioneering contributions have \nsubstantially and lastingly improved our Nation's health.\n  In 1993, the Congress directed the initiation of a demonstration \nprogram for the preparation of family nurse practitioners to meet the \nneeds of the uniformed services. Of course, the individual who stepped \nforward to assist the USUHS President, James A. Zimble, M.D., Vice \nAdmiral, Retired, was Dr. Abdellah. In the short time since its \nestablishment, the USUHS Graduate School of Nursing has: recruited and \nretained a qualified faculty, successfully established curricula for \ntwo programs, identified accredited clinical practice sites and \ncompleted memoranda of understanding with 19 military treatment \nfacilities, submitted self-studies and received full accreditation for \nthe two GSN programs from three professional accrediting entities, \nreceived formal approval and permanent status on February 26, 1996, \nfrom Health Affairs, Office of the Secretary of Defense, initiated, \nimplemented, and continuously reviewed the outcomes evaluation process \nfor both academic programs, and has awarded 157 Masters of Science in \nNursing Degrees to advanced practice nurse graduates through the Nurse \nPractitioner and Certified Registered Nurse Anesthesia Programs. All \nGSN graduates have passed their certification examinations, and 97 \npercent, of 152, of the GSN graduates remain on active duty.\n\n  One of the most successful and innovative programs between the \nDepartments of Defense and Veterans Affairs is the Distance Learning \nProgram established at the USUHS GSN. In 1999, the collaborative \nefforts of Dr. Abdellah with the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, in \nthe area of distance learning successfully demonstrated a cost-\neffective form of advanced education where nursing students can receive \nadvanced training in critically-required specialty areas while \nmaintaining their current positions at the VA medical centers. Twenty-\nsix students, through a ``virtual commencement exercise,'' graduated \nfrom the VA/DoD Distance Learning Program on May 18, 1999. The virtual \ngraduation was broadcast from USUHS and linked with eight VA Medical \nCenters located across the United States, and all graduates were \neligible to sit for the American Nurses Association Credentialing \nExamination for Adult Nurse Practitioners. This graduation marked the \nfirst virtual advanced-level graduation for either the VA or DoD. A \nsecond class, with students located in ten VA Medical Centers, \ngraduated in May of 2001, for a total of 60 distance learning \ngraduates. A third class is on-going. The exerpience gained by both the \nGSN and the VA will allow future projects in distance learning to \nbenefit from the lessons learned and the technologies tested during the \ntwenty-month program.\n  I believe that the recent grant of full accreditation by the National \nLeague for Nursing Accrediting Commission, NLNAC, sums up Dr. \nAbdellah's successful leadership at the USUHS GSN. The accrediting \ncommission pointed out in its summary findings to the University that \nthe mission and philosophy of the USUHS GSN is grounded in the \nUniversity's mission and in the mission of the Uniformed Services. The \nGSN curriculum is designed to be specific to the unique mission of \nmilitary service nurses: to serve in times of war and peace. The GSN \nstudents expressed a clear understanding that the program keeps them \nconnected to their mission and prepares them to function immediately \nafter completing the program.

A engrossed resolution adopted by the Assembly of \n     the State of Wisconsin relative to the authorization of \n     funding for modernization of lock and dam infrastructure on \n     the Upper Mississippi and Illinois Rivers' Inland Waterways \n     Transportation System; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                      2001 Assembly Resolution 56\n\n       Whereas, the state of Wisconsin borders or contains over \n     360 miles of the upper Mississippi River and 11 navigation \n     locks and dams along those borders; and\n       Whereas, many of Wisconsin's locks and dams are more than \n     60 years old and only 600 feet long, making them unable to \n     accommodate modern barge tows of 1,200 feet long, nearly \n     tripling locking times and causing lengthy delays and \n     ultimately increasing shipping costs; and\n       Whereas, the use of 1,200-foot locks has been proven \n     nationwide as the best method of improving efficiency, \n     reducing congestion, and modernizing the inland waterways; \n     and\n       Whereas, the construction of the lock and dam system has \n     spurred economic growth and a higher standard of living in \n     the Mississippi and Illinois river basin, and today supplies \n     more than 300,000,000 tons of the nation's cargo, supporting \n     more than 400,000 jobs, including 90,000 in manufacturing; \n     and\n       Whereas, more than 60% of American agricultural exports, \n     including corn, wheat, and soybeans, are shipped down the \n     Mississippi and Illinois rivers on the way to foreign \n     markets; and\n       Whereas, Wisconsin farmers, producers, and consumers rely \n     on efficient transportation to remain competitive in a global \n     economy, and efficiencies in river transport offset higher \n     production costs compared to those incurred by foreign \n     competitors; and\n       Whereas, the upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers lock and \n     dam system saves our nation more than $1.5 billion in higher \n     transportation costs each year, and failing to construct \n     1,200-foot locks will cause farmers to use more expensive \n     alternative modes of transportation, including trucks and \n     trains; and\n       Whereaas, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, \n     congestion along the upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers is \n     costing Wisconsin and other producers and consumers in the \n     basin $98,000,000 per year in higher transportation costs; \n     and\n       Whereas, river transportation is the most environmentally \n     friendly form of transporting goods and commodities, creating \n     almost no noise pollution and emitting 35% to 60% fewer \n     pollutants than either trucks or trains, according to the \n     U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; and\n       Whereas, moving away from river transport would add \n     millions of trucks and railcars to our nation's \n     infrastructure, adding air pollution, traffic congestion, and \n     greater wear and tear on highways; and\n       Whereas, backwater lakes created by the lock and dam system \n     provide breeding grounds for migratory waterfowl and fish; \n     and\n       Whereas, the lakes and 500 miles of wildlife refuge also \n     support a one-billion-dollar per year recreational industry, \n     including hunting, fishing, and tourism jobs; and\n       Whereas, upgrading the system of locks and dams on the \n     upper Mississippi and Illinois rivers will provide 3,000 \n     construction and related jobs over a 15-year to 20-year \n     period; and\n       Whereas, in 1999 the state of Wisconsin shipped 1,100,000 \n     tons of commodities, including grain, coal, chemicals, \n     aggregates, and other products; and\n       Whereas, 3,900,000 tons of commodities, including grain, \n     coal, chemicals, aggregates, and other products, were shipped \n     to, from, and within Wisconsin by barge, representing \n     $313,000,000 in value; and\n       Whereas, shippers moving by barge in Wisconsin realized a \n     savings of approximately $40,000,000 compared to other \n     transportation modes; and\n       Whereas, Wisconsin docks shipped products by barge to 6 \n     states and received products from 11 states; and\n       Whereas, there are approximately 20 manufacturing \n     facilities, terminals, and docks on the waterways of \n     Wisconsin, representing thousand of jobs in the state; and\n       Whereas, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is conducting a \n     collaborative navigation study of the economic and \n     environmental factors to be considered when examining capital \n     improvements to the upper Mississippi River system; and\n       Whereas, the navigation study will release initial results \n     in a summer 2002 report; now, therefore,\n       Resolved by the assembly, That the Wisconsin assembly \n     formally recognizes the upper Mississippi River as a river of \n     statewide significance for natural, navigational, and \n     recreational benefits; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the Wisconsin assembly recognizes the \n     importance of timely modernization of the inland waterway \n     transportation infrastructure to Wisconsin agriculture and \n     industry in this state, the region, and the nation and, \n     pending results of the navigation study, urges Congress to \n     authorize funding to construct 1,200-foot locks on the upper \n     Mississippi and Illinois river system; and, be it further\n       Resolved, That the assembly chief clerk shall transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the president and secretary of \n     the U.S. senate, the speaker and clerk of the U.S. house of \n     representatives, the chair of the senate committee on \n     commerce, science, and transportation, the chair of the house \n     committee on transportation and infrastructure, and the \n     members of the congressional delegation from this state.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-244. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to the Death \n     Tax; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 195\n\n       Whereas, Under tax relief legislation passed in 2001, the \n     federal death tax was temporarily--not permanently--\n     eliminated; and\n       Whereas, Women and minorities are very often owners of \n     small and medium sized businesses, and the death tax prevents \n     their children from reaping the rewards of a lifetime trying \n     to make a better life; and\n       Whereas, Farmers will face losing their farms if the \n     federal government resumes the heavy taxation of the estates \n     of people who invested most of their earnings back into their \n     farms; and\n       Whereas, Employees suffer when they lose their jobs because \n     many small and medium sized businesses are liquidated to pay \n     death taxes and because high capital costs depress the number \n     of new businesses that could offer them a job; and\n       Whereas, If the federal estate tax had been repealed in \n     1996, over the next nine years the United States economy \n     would have averaged as much as $11 billion per year in extra \n     output, and an average of 145,000 new jobs would have been \n     created; and\n       Whereas, the persistent uncertainty created by the sunset \n     provision prevents families and small businesses from taking \n     full advantage of the repeal; and\n       Whereas, Having passed both houses of the Congress of the \n     United States, elimination of the death tax has proven to \n     hold widespread bipartisan support; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, That we memorialize the Congress of \n     the United States to repeal permanently the federal death \n     tax; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-245.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to modify \nprovisions governing certain programs administered by the Department of \nVeterans Affairs and for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation \nrequested by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, as a courtesy to the \nSecretary and the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA. Except in unusual \ncircumstances, it is my practice to introduce legislation requested by \nthe administration so that such measures will be available for review \nand consideration.\n  This ``by-request'' bill contains four sections, which amend existing \nsections or provisions of title 38. The first section would expand the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs' authority to pay plot and interment \nallowances to State veterans cemeteries for all eligible peacetime \nveterans. Currently, the Secretary can only provide a plot allowance if \nthe veteran served during wartime, was discharged for a service-\nconnected disability, was receiving VA disability compensation or \npension, or died in a VA facility. This amendment would facilitate \nStates' participation in VA's State Cemeteries Grant Program, SCGP. \nUnder the SCGP, VA pays for the construction of the cemetery, but the \nStates bear the future maintenance costs. This provision would allow \nStates to receive allowances for approximately 1,200 additional \ninterments annually.\n  The second section of this bill would authorize the Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs to lease the undeveloped land and unused or underused \nbuildings of the National Cemetery System and retain the proceeds from \nthese leases, as well as agricultural licenses. The National Cemetery \nAdministration, NCA, is endowed with thousands of acres of land, some \nof which is unused because it is not suitable for NCA development or \nhas not yet been developed for NCA use. Currently, the NCA is \nauthorized to issue limited-term agricultural licenses for these lands, \nand all profits must be deposited with the U.S. Treasury. However, some \nNCA land would be suitable for other purposes. This provision is meant \nto provide the Secretary with greater flexibility in using NCA lands to \ngenerate revenues, while allowing the NCA to become more self-\nsufficient by keeping profits within the administration.\n  The third section of this bill would modify amendments made by the \nVeterans' Claims Assistance Act of 2000, VCAA, which imposed a 1-year \ntime limit for veterans to submit evidence--such as medical records--\nnecessary to substantiate their claims for benefits. Prior to the \nenactment of the VCAA, a 1-year time limitation was imposed on \ninformation--such as complete contact information--necessary to \ncomplete a veteran's application for benefits. This provision was not \nincluded in the VCAA. The Secretary asserts that this requires VA to \nkeep claims open indefinitely if they lack information for the \napplication, while not allowing VA to make a payment on a claim that \nrequired the veteran to submit evidence to substantiate it, even if the \nclaim could be granted on other grounds. This provision would reinstate \nthe original time limitation on information for applications and \nrescind the current limitation on evidence to substantiate.\n  Section four of this bill would eliminate the reporting requirement \non certain advance planning projects. Currently, VA cannot obligate \nmore than $500,000 from its advance planning fund without submitting a \nreport on the proposed obligation to both committees of Congress. \nHowever, VA argues that such reports are redundant for projects that \nhave already been authorized by Congress, creating unnecessary and \nuntimely delays. Accordingly, VA proposes that Congress eliminate this \nreporting requirement for already authorized projects.\n  Again, Mr. President, I submit this for the review and consideration \nof my colleagues at the request of the administration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and Secretary \nPrincipi's transmittal letter that accompanied the draft legislation be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2526\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; REFERENCES TO TITLE 38, UNITED STATES \n                   CODE.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' \n     Programs Amendments Act of 2002''.\n       (b) References.--Except as otherwise expressly provided, \n     whenever in this Act an amendment is expressed in terms of an \n     amendment to a section or other provision, the reference \n     shall be considered to be made to a section or other \n     provision of title 38, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 2. BURIAL PLOT ALLOWANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 2303(b) is amended--\n       (1) in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by striking ``a \n     burial allowance under such section 2302, or under such \n     subsection, who was discharged from the active military, \n     naval, or air service for a disability incurred or aggravated \n     in line of duty, or who is a veteran of any war'' and \n     inserting ``burial in a national cemetery under section 2402 \n     of this title''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (2) by striking ``(other than a veteran \n     whose eligibility for benefits under this subsection is based \n     on being a veteran of any war)'' and inserting ``is eligible \n     for a burial allowance under section 2302 of this title or \n     under subsection (a) of this section, or was discharged from \n     the active military, naval, or air service for a disability \n     incurred or aggravated in line of duty, and such veteran''.\n       (b) Applicability.--The amendments made by section 2(a) \n     shall apply with respect to the burial of persons dying on or \n     after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 3. LEASE OF LAND AND BUILDINGS; RETENTION OF PROCEEDS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 24 is amended by adding at the end \n     thereof the following new section:\n\n     Sec. 2412. Lease of land and buildings; retention of \n       proceeds.\n\n       ``(a) The Secretary may lease for a term not exceeding 3 \n     years undeveloped land and unused or underutilized buildings, \n     or parts or parcels thereof, belonging to the United States \n     and part of the National Cemetery System established by \n     section 2400 of this title. Any lease made to any public or \n     nonprofit organization may be made without regard to the \n     provisions of section 3709 of the Revised Statutes (41 U.S.C. \n     5). Notwithstanding section 321 of the Act of June 30, 1932 \n     (40 U.S.C. 303b), or any other provision of law, a lease made \n     pursuant to this subsection to any public or nonprofit \n     organization may provide for the maintenance, protection or \n     restoration by the lessee as a part or all of the \n     consideration for the lease. Prior to execution of any such \n     lease, the Secretary shall give appropriate public notice of \n     the Secretary's intention to do so in the newspaper of the \n     community in which the lands or buildings are located.\n       ``(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, proceeds \n     from the lease of National Cemetery land or buildings and \n     from agricultural licenses shall be deposited to the National \n     Cemetery Administration account to assist cemetery operations \n     and maintenance of cemetery property.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendments.--The table of sections at the \n     beginning of chapter 24 is amended by adding at the end \n     thereof the following new item:\n\n``2412. Lease of land and buildings; retention of proceeds.''.\n\n     SEC. 4. TIME LIMITATION ON RECEIPT OF CLAIM INFORMATION \n                   PURSUANT TO REQUEST BY DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS \n                   AFFAIRS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 5102 is amended by adding at the \n     end thereof the following new subsection:\n       ``(c) Time Limitation.--(1) If information that claimant \n     and the claimant's representative, if any, are notified under \n     subsection (b) is necessary to complete an application is not \n     received by the Secretary within one year from the date of \n     such notification, no benefit may be paid or furnished by \n     reason of the claimant's application.\n       ``(2) This subsection shall not apply to any application or \n     claim for Government life insurance benefits.''.\n\n[[Page S4495]]\n\n       (b) Repeal of Superseded Provisions.--Section 5103 is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``(a) Required Information and Evidence.--\n     '' ; and\n       (2) by striking subsection (b).\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall take effect as if enacted on November 9, 2000, \n     immediately after the enactment of the Veterans Claims \n     Assistance Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-475; 114 Stat. 2096).\n\n     SEC. 5. MODIFICATION OF LIMITATION ON OBLIGATIONS FOR ADVANCE \n                   PLANNING.\n\n       Section 8104 is amended by adding at the end thereof the \n     following new subsection:\n       ``(g) Subsection (f) shall not apply with respect to the \n     obligation of funds for a project if the project is \n     specifically authorized by law prior to the obligation of \n     funds.''.\n     Hon. Richard B. Cheney,\n     President of the Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: I am transmitting a draft bill, the \n     ``Veterans' Programs Amendments Act of 2002''. I request that \n     this draft bill be referred to the appropriate committee for \n     prompt consideration and enactment.\n\n\n                         BURIAL PLOT ALLOWANCE\n\n       Section 2(a) of the draft bill would amend 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2303(b) to authorize payment of the burial plot \n     allowance to states for each veteran interred in a state \n     veterans' cemetery at no cost to the veteran's estate or \n     survivors.\n       Under current section 2303(b)(1), the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs is authorized to pay to a state a $300 plot or \n     interment allowance for each eligible veteran buried in a \n     qualifying state veterans' cemetery. Such allowance is \n     authorized only if the veteran: (1) was a veteran of any war; \n     (2) was discharged from active service for a service-\n     connected disability; (3) was receiving Department of \n     Veterans Affairs (VA) compensation or pension at the time of \n     death; or (4) died in a VA facility. The proposed amendment \n     would expand this authority to permit payment of the plot \n     allowance to states for burial in state veterans' cemeteries \n     of all eligible peacetime veterans.\n       This amendment would encourage state participation in the \n     State Cemetery Grants Program (SCGP). In 1978, Congress \n     established the SCGP to complement VA's national cemetery \n     system by assisting states in providing burial plots for \n     veterans in areas where existing national cemeteries cannot \n     satisfy veterans' burial needs. State officials have \n     indicated to VA that they consider future maintenance costs \n     when deciding whether to pursue a state cemetery grant. To \n     the extent that the amendment would help defray those \n     maintenance costs and encourage states to establish veterans' \n     cemeteries, it would make the benefit of burial in such a \n     cemetery an accessible option for more veterans.\n       This amendment would allow states to receive plot allowance \n     payments for approximately 1,200 additional interments \n     annually. The costs associated with the enactment of this \n     provision would be $360,000 for fiscal year (FY) 2003 and \n     $3.6 million for the ten-year period from FY 2003 through FY \n     2012.\n\n\n           LEASE OF LAND AND BUILDINGS; RETENTION OF PROCEEDS\n\n       Section 3(a) of the bill would authorize the Secretary of \n     Veterans Affairs to lease undeveloped acreage and unused and \n     underutilized buildings of the National Cemetery System and \n     to retain the proceeds from leases or agricultural licenses.\n       Land is the primary asset entrusted to the National \n     Cemetery Administration (NCA), which currently maintains \n     approximately 14,650 acres. Land dedicated for burial \n     purposes is developed in ten-year increments using a ``just-\n     in-time'' approach that carefully monitors depletion of \n     gravesites, projected burial requirements and estimated \n     timing for new construction activities. Additionally, certain \n     sections of many national cemeteries are unsuitable for \n     development into burial sections due to the presence of \n     wetlands, rock outcroppings or sloped terrain. Acreage that \n     is unsuitable for burial purposes and land not yet needed for \n     development represents a significant underutilized asset.\n       Amending existing law to authorize NCA to enter into lease \n     agreements would provide NCA with more flexibility in finding \n     current uses for land that otherwise would remain idle until \n     it was needed for development. It also would permit buildings \n     that are currently not in use to be leased and by so doing, \n     to be maintained by the lessee. This authority is similar to \n     the lease authority given to the Veterans Health \n     Administration (VHA).\n       NCA already has authority to execute limited-term \n     agricultural licenses and has done so at certain national \n     cemeteries. The license permits grazing, sod farming or \n     planting rotational crops on unused acreage. These activities \n     directly benefit the cemetery by keeping the land cleared, \n     attractive and well maintained. However, receipts for the use \n     of this land must be deposited with the U.S. Treasury. \n     Additionally, NCA has historic lodges and other buildings \n     that could generate revenue for the cemetery if NCA were able \n     to retain the proceeds from leases.\n       The receipts retained by NCA would assist in maintaining \n     national cemeteries. The money would be deposited in the \n     National Cemetery Administration account to be used for \n     grounds maintenance, e.g., mowing, trimming, and fertilizing, \n     as well as building maintenance. The additional funds will \n     help to maintain national cemeteries as shrines dedicated to \n     our Nation's history, nurturing patriotism and honoring the \n     service and sacrifice veterans have made on behalf of the \n     United States.\n       We estimate that section 3 of the bill would generate \n     annual proceeds of approximately $100,000.\n\n\n            TIME LIMITATION ON RECEIPT OF CLAIM INFORMATION\n\n       Section 4(a) and (b) of the draft bill would make a \n     technical correction to the statutory provisions created by \n     the Veterans Claims Assistance Act of 2000 (VCAA), Pub. L. \n     No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096. Section 4(c) would make that \n     correction effective as if enacted immediately after the \n     VCAA.\n\n                               Prior Law\n\n       Before the enactment of the VCAA, 38 U.S.C. Sec. 5103(a) \n     required VA, if a claimant's application for benefits was \n     incomplete, to notify the claimant of the evidence necessary \n     to complete the application. Section 5103(a) further \n     provided: ``If such evidence is not received within one year \n     from the date of such notification, no benefits may be paid \n     or furnished by reason of such application.''\n       In accordance with former section 5103(a), VA regulations \n     provide that, if evidence requested in connection with a \n     claim is not furnished within one year after the date of \n     request, the claim will be considered abandoned. After the \n     expiration of one year, VA will take no further action unless \n     it receives a new claim. Furthermore, should the right to \n     benefits be finally established, benefits based on such \n     evidence would commence no earlier than the date the new \n     claim was filed. 38 C.F.R. Sec. 3.158(a).\n       Before the enactment of the VCAA, title 38, United States \n     Code, contained no provision requiring VA to notify a \n     claimant of the evidence necessary to substantiate a claim.\n\n                              Current Law\n\n       Section 3(a) of the VCAA struck former 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. Sec. 5102 and 5103 and added new sections 5102 and 5103. \n     114 Stat. at 2096-97. Now section 5102(b) requires VA, if a \n     claimant's application for a benefit is incomplete, to notify \n     the claimant (and his or her representative, if any) of the \n     information necessary to complete the application. Section \n     5102 contains no provision concerning a time limitation for \n     the submission of information necessary to complete an \n     application.\n       Now section 5103(a) requires VA, upon receipt of a complete \n     or substantially complete application for benefits, to notify \n     the claimant (and his or her representative, if any) of any \n     information and evidence not previously provided to VA that \n     is necessary to substantiate the claim. Furthermore, that \n     notice must indicate which portion of that information and \n     evidence, if any, is to be provided by the claimant and which \n     portion, if any, VA will attempt to obtain on the claimant's \n     behalf. Section 5103(b)(1) provides, in the case of \n     information or evidence that the claimant is notified is to \n     be provided by him or her, if VA does not receive such \n     information or evidence within one year from the date of such \n     notification, no benefit may be paid or furnished by reason \n     of the claimant's application.\n\n                              Implications\n\n       As a result of the amendments made by the VCAA, the \n     statutory provision imposing a one-year limitation now \n     relates to the substantiation of claims rather than to the \n     completion of applications. We do not believe Congress \n     intended this change from prior law. This change raises \n     several potential problems.\n       Without a statutory limitation of one year to complete an \n     application, VA no longer has a statutory basis for closing \n     an application as abandoned. Thus, if a claimant were to \n     submit an incomplete application for benefits, but not \n     respond to VA's notice of the information necessary to \n     complete it until many years later, the award of any benefit \n     granted on the basis of that application would have to be \n     effective from the date of the application, even though the \n     claimant took no action to complete it for many years. \n     Further, it appears that VA would be unauthorized to close or \n     deny the claim based on the claimant's failure to respond. We \n     do not believe Congress intended this result. Rather, we \n     believe that the former one-year statutory limitation on the \n     time available to complete an application should be restored.\n       The statutory limitation of one year to substantiate a \n     claim also raises potential problems. One such problem is the \n     possibility that courts will interpret the provision to \n     preclude VA from deciding a claim until one year has expired \n     from the date VA gives notice of the information and evidence \n     necessary to substantiate the claim. Exactly that \n     interpretation has been offered by several veterans' service \n     organizations challenging VA's regulations implementing the \n     VCAA. Under those regulations, as part of VA's notice under \n     section 5103(a), VA will request the claimant to provide any \n     evidence in the claimant's possession that pertains to the \n     claim. We ask for the evidence within 30 days, but tell the \n     claimant that one year is available to respond. If the \n     claimant has not responded to the request within 30 days, VA \n     may decide the claim before expiration of the one year, based \n     on all the information and evidence contained in the file, \n     including information and evidence it has obtained on the \n     claimant's behalf. However, VA will have to readjudicate the \n     claim if the claimant subsequently provides the information \n     and evidence within one year of the date of the request. 38 \n     C.F.R. Sec. 3.159(b)(1).\n\n[[Page S4496]]\n\n       VA issued those rules ``to allow for the timely processing \n     of claims.'' 66 Fed. Reg. 17,834, 17,835 (2001). Once an \n     application had been substantially completed, VA does not \n     want to have to wait one year to decide the claim, given the \n     large backlog of claims awaiting adjudication by VA and the \n     Secretary's commitment to reducing the backlog and shortening \n     the time VA takes to adjudicate claims. What VA considers to \n     be Congress' inadvertent moving of the one-year limitation \n     from the provision relating to completion of applications \n     to the provision relating to the substantiation of claims \n     could impede VA's efforts to improve service to veterans. \n     VA doubts that Congress intended to require VA, after \n     requesting evidence from a claimant, to keep the claim \n     open and pending for a full year if the claimant has not \n     yet responded.\n       Furthermore, section 5103(b)(1)'s clear and unambiguous \n     language appears to prohibit the payment of benefits even \n     though VA could allow a claim. For example, VA might be able \n     to allow a claim on the basis of evidence VA obtained on the \n     claimant's behalf, even though the claimant has not provided \n     the evidence requested of him or her. Or VA might find clear \n     and unmistakable error in a prior denial and need to grant \n     benefits on the claim that was erroneously denied. Yet \n     section 5103(b)(1) prohibits the payment or furnishing of any \n     benefit if VA does not receive within one year the \n     information or evidence the claimant is to provide according \n     to VA's notice. Surely, Congress did not intend such a \n     result.\n       Finally, some of VA's pro-veteran regulations will have to \n     be changed unless the one-year time limitation is removed \n     from section 5103. For example, 38 C.F.R. Sec. 20.1304(a) \n     permits an appellant to submit additional evidence during the \n     90 days following notice that an appeal has been certified to \n     the Board of Veterans' Appeals and the appellate record has \n     been transferred to the Board. That 90-day period may extend \n     beyond the one-year period following notice of the \n     information and evidence necessary to substantiate the claim \n     given under section 5103(a), in which case it would conflict \n     with the statutory mandate that ``no benefit may be paid or \n     furnished by reason of the claimant's application'' if VA \n     does not receive the evidence within one year from the date \n     of the section 5103(a) notice. Another potentially \n     conflicting regulation is 38 C.F.R. Sec. 3.156(b), which \n     deems new and material evidence received before expiration of \n     the one-year appeal period (beginning when notice of the \n     decision on a claim is sent) or before an appellate decision \n     is made if a timely appeal is filed to have been filed in \n     connection with the claim pending at the beginning of the \n     appeal period. Because the one-year appeal period necessarily \n     extends beyond the one-year substantiation period, the \n     regulation authorizes the grant of benefits based on evidence \n     not timely received under section 5103(b), contrary to the \n     statutory mandate.\n       Accordingly, we propose a technical amendment to sections \n     5102 and 5103 that would prevent these problems. Our draft \n     bill would restore the one-year limitation to section 5102 \n     and remove it from section 5103. It would make these \n     technical amendments effective as if enacted immediately \n     after the VCAA.\n\n\n             LIMITATION ON OBLIGATIONS FOR ADVANCE PLANNING\n\n       Section 5 of the bill would eliminate the limitation on \n     certain obligations for advance planning.\n       Section 8104(f) of title 38, United States Code, currently \n     provides that the Secretary may not obligate funds on an \n     amount in excess of $500,000 from the Advance Planning Fund \n     of the Department until the Secretary submits to the \n     committees of Congress a report on the proposed obligation, \n     and a period of 30 days has passed after the date the \n     committees have received the report.\n       The reporting requirement was established to ensure that \n     the VA committees were knowledgeable of VA project \n     development activities. At present, these committees \n     participate in the authorization process and, as a result, \n     are knowledgeable of the projects that have already been \n     authorized by Congress. However, because the reporting \n     requirement still applies to projects that have already been \n     authorized by Congress, the Secretary is precluded from \n     funding these projects until after a report is submitted to \n     the committees and the 30-day period has passed. The current \n     limitation places a two to three month delay on those \n     projects that have already been authorized by Congress.\n       The proposed legislation would eliminate the limitation \n     only for those projects that have already been authorized by \n     Congress in accordance with 38 U.S.C. Sec. 8104(2). \n     Consequently, the elimination of this limitation would remove \n     the duplication of effort on the part of VA and Congress.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there \n     is no objection to the submission of this legislative \n     proposal to the Congress.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                              Anthony J. Principi.\n       Enclosure.\n\n                      Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n       DRAFT BILL: ``VETERANS' PROGRAMS AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2002''\n\n   Section 1. Short Title; References to Title 38, United States Code\n\n       Section 1(a) would state the short title to the Act: the \n     Veterans' Programs Amendments Act of 2002. Section 1(b) would \n     provide that all amendments made by the Act, unless otherwise \n     specified, are to a section or other provision of title 38, \n     United States Code.\n\n                    Section 2. Burial Plot Allowance\n\n       Section 2(a) would amend 38 U.S.C. 2303(b) to authorize \n     payment of the burial plot allowance to states for each \n     veteran interred in a state veterans' cemetery at no cost to \n     the veteran's estate or survivors. Currently, section \n     2303(b)(1) authorizes VA to pay a state a $300 plot or \n     interment allowance for each eligible veteran buried in a \n     qualifying state veterans' cemetery. Such allowance is \n     authorized only if the veteran: (1) was a veteran of any war; \n     (2) was discharged from active service for a service-\n     connected disability; (3) was receiving VA compensation or \n     pension at the time of death; or (4) died in a VA facility. \n     The proposed amendment would expand this authority to permit \n     payment of the plot allowance to states for burial in state \n     veterans' cemeteries of all eligible peacetime veterans.\n       Section 2(b) would make the amendments made by subsection \n     (a) applicable to burial of persons dying on or after the \n     date of the Act's enactment.\n\n     Section 3. Lease of Land and Buildings; Retention of Proceeds\n\n       Section 3(a) would add to Chapter 24 of title 38, United \n     States Code, new section 2412. Section 2412(a) would \n     authorize the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to lease, for a \n     term not to exceed 3 years, undeveloped land and unused or \n     underutilized buildings, or parts or parcels thereof, of the \n     National Cemetery System. This authority would mirror the \n     Secretary's authority in section 8122 of title 38, to lease \n     land or buildings at a VA medical facility. A lease made to a \n     public or nonprofit organization can be made without regard \n     to the advertising requirements of section 5 of title 41, \n     United States Code, and it can provide for the public or \n     nonprofit to maintain, protect or restore the property in \n     lieu of monetary consideration. Section 2421(b) would \n     authorize the proceeds generated by the lease or the proceeds \n     received from an agricultural license to be deposited to the \n     National Cemetery Administration account to assist \n     cemetery operations and maintenance of cemetery property.\n       Section 3(b) would add to the table of contents at the \n     beginning of chapter 24 a new item to reflect the addition of \n     section 2412.\n\nSection 4. Time Limitation on Receipt of Claim Information Pursuant to \n               Request by Department of Veterans Affairs\n\n       Section 4(a) and (b) would remove a time limitation from 38 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 5103 and restore it to 38 U.S.C. Sec. 5102. The \n     provision, currently in section 5103(b), prohibits VA from \n     paying or furnishing any benefit by reason of an application \n     if VA has not received certain information and evidence \n     within one year of notifying the claimant that the \n     information and evidence is necessary to substantiate the \n     claim and that the claimant is to provide them. If moved to \n     section 5102, the provision would prohibit VA from paying or \n     furnishing any benefit by reason of an application if VA has \n     not received certain information within one year of notifying \n     the claimant that the information is necessary to complete \n     the application.\n       Section 4(c) would make the amendments made by subsections \n     (a) and (b) effective as if enacted on November 9, 2000, \n     immediately after the enactment of the Veterans Claims \n     Assistance Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-475, 114 Stat. 2096.\n\n   Section 5. Modification of Limitation on Obligations for Advanced \n                                Planning\n\n       Section 5 would add to the end of section 8104 of title 38, \n     United States Code, a new subsection (g) eliminating a \n     limitation on the obligation of funds from the Advance \n     Planning Fund for certain projects. At present, 38 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 8104(f) provides that the Secretary may not obligate \n     funds on an amount in excess of $500,000 from the Advanced \n     Planning Fund of the Department until the Secretary submits \n     to the committees of Congress a report on the proposed \n     obligation and a period of 30 days has passed after the date \n     the committees have received the report. The reporting \n     requirement applies to projects that have already been \n     authorized by Congress, and the Secretary is therefore \n     precluded from funding these projects until after a report is \n     submitted to the Committees and the 30-day period has passed. \n     The current limitation places a two to three month delay on \n     those projects that have already been authorized by Congress. \n     Elimination of this limitation, as contemplated by section 5, \n     would remove duplication of effort on the part of VA and \n     Congress for those projects that have been authorized in \n     accordance with title 38 U.S.C. Sec. 8104.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Cochran):\n  S. 2527. A bill to provide for health benefits coverage under chapter \n89 of title 5, United States Code, for individuals enrolled in a plan \nadministered by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprovide health care coverage under the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits\n\n[[Page S4497]]\n\nProgram, FEHBP, to individuals enrolled in a health care plan \nadministered by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, OPIC. I am \npleased to be joined by my good friend Senator Cochran in this \nendeavor.\n  In the 1980s, a number of Federal banking-related agencies--including \nOPIC, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift \nSupervision, and the Farm Credit Administration--established separate \nhealth insurance plans outside the FEHBP. The agencies were able to \noffer enhanced benefits at significantly lower costs because of the \ndemographics of their workforce. However, increasing health care costs, \nan aging workforce, and an overall reduction in the Federal workforce \nhas made it economically impractical for these agencies to maintain \ntheir separate programs. As a result, all of these agencies, except \nOPIC, discontinued their separate programs through legislation and \ntransferred their employees to the FEHBP. Legislative action is needed \nbecause current law requires that Federal employees participate in a \nFEHBP plan for the 5 years prior to retirement in order to retain \ncoverage after retirement.\n  OPIC established its separate program in 1982 and discontinued \noffering the plan to new employees on January 1, 1995. There are 21 \nretirees and 18 near-retirees who would be affected by the change. Due \nto the large costs involved in covering retirees in the FEHBP, OPIC \nwould be required to pay the employees health benefits fund for the \nbenefits provided by this legislation. OPIC has agreed to pay this \namount from its existing appropriated resources. It is estimated that \nOPIC will save approximately $300,000 per year in premiums when the \ntransfer occurs.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this legislation and for unanimous \nconsent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2527\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CONTINUATION OF HEALTH BENEFITS COVERAGE FOR \n                   INDIVIDUALS ENROLLED IN A PLAN ADMINISTERED BY \n                   THE OVERSEAS PRIVATE INVESTMENT CORPORATION.\n\n       (a) Enrollment in Chapter 89 Plan.--For purposes of the \n     administration of chapter 89 of title 5, United States Code, \n     any period of enrollment under a health benefits plan \n     administered by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation \n     before the effective date of this Act shall be deemed to be a \n     period of enrollment in a health benefits plan under chapter \n     89 of such title.\n       (b) Continued Coverage.--\n       (1) In general.--Any individual who, on June 30, 2002, is \n     covered by a health benefits plan administered by the \n     Overseas Private Investment Corporation may enroll in an \n     approved health benefits plan described under section 8903 or \n     8903a of title 5, United States Code--\n       (A) either as an individual or for self and family, if such \n     individual is an employee, annuitant, or former spouse as \n     defined under section 8901 of such title; and\n       (B) for coverage effective on and after June 30, 2002.\n       (2) Individuals currently under continued coverage.--An \n     individual who, on June 30, 2002, is entitled to continued \n     coverage under a health benefits plan administered by the \n     Overseas Private Investment Corporation--\n       (A) shall be deemed to be entitled to continued coverage \n     under section 8905a of title 5, United States Code, for the \n     same period that would have been permitted under the plan \n     administered by the Overseas Private Investment Corporation; \n     and\n       (B) may enroll in an approved health benefits plan \n     described under section 8903 or 8903a of such title in \n     accordance with section 8905a of such title for coverage \n     effective on and after June 30, 2002.\n       (3) Unmarried dependent children.--An individual who, on \n     June 30, 2002, is covered as an unmarried dependent child \n     under a health benefits plan administered by the Overseas \n     Private Investment Corporation and who is not a member of \n     family as defined under section 8901(5) of title 5, United \n     States Code--\n       (A) shall be deemed to be entitled to continued coverage \n     under section 8905a of such title as though the individual \n     had, on June 30, 2002, ceased to meet the requirements for \n     being considered an unmarried dependent child under chapter \n     89 of such title; and\n       (B) may enroll in an approved health benefits plan \n     described under section 8903 or 8903a of such title in \n     accordance with section 8905a for continued coverage \n     effective on and after June 30, 2002.\n       (c) Transfers to the Employees Health Benefits Fund.--\n       (1) In general.--The Overseas Private Investment \n     Corporation shall transfer to the Employees Health Benefits \n     Fund established under section 8909 of title 5, United States \n     Code, amounts determined by the Director of the Office of \n     Personnel Management, after consultation with the Overseas \n     Private Investment Corporation, to be necessary to reimburse \n     the Fund for the cost of providing benefits under this \n     section not otherwise paid for by the individuals covered by \n     this section.\n       (2) Availability of funds.--The amounts transferred under \n     paragraph (1) shall be held in the Fund and used by the \n     Office in addition to amounts available under section \n     8906(g)(1) of title 5, United States Code.\n       (d) Administration and Regulations.--The Office of \n     Personnel Management--\n       (1) shall administer this section to provide for--\n       (A) a period of notice and open enrollment for individuals \n     affected by this section; and\n       (B) no lapse of health coverage for individuals who enroll \n     in a health benefits plan under chapter 89 of title 5, United \n     States Code, in accordance with this section; and\n       (2) may prescribe regulations to implement this section.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Hagel, Ms. Snowe, \n        Mr. Kyl, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. \n        Graham, Mr. Burns, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Wyden, and \n        Mr. Allard):\n  S. 2528. A bill to establish a National Drought Council within the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, to improve national drought \npreparedness, mitigation, and response efforts, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nDrought Preparedness Act of 2002. Severe droughts are not solely the \ncurse of the Southwest. Lately, it has been apparent that every region \nin the United States can be hit by drought. We have certainly \nexperienced our share of drought in the Southwest, but we have also \nseen the phenomenon occur in the Pacific Northwest, California, the \nGreat Basin States, and this year in Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, \nand Delaware. According to the recent Drought Monitor, a joint \nproduction of the National Drought Mitigation Center, USDA, NOAA, and \nthe Climate Prediction Center, nearly a third of the United States is \ncurrently in a moderate to extreme drought.\n  Currently, the State of New Mexico and much of the Rocky Mountain \nStates are near or below 50 percent of normal based on low snow pack. \nAlong the east coast, precipitation in many places is 8-20 inches below \nnormal over the last year.\n  Drought is a unique emergency situation; it creeps in unlike other \nabrupt weather disasters. Without a national drought policy we \nconstantly live not knowing what the next year will bring. If we find \nourselves facing a drought, towns could be scrambling to drill new \nwater wells, fire could sweep across bone dry forests and farmers, and \nranchers could be forced to watch their way of life blow away with the \ndust. We must be vigilant and prepare ourselves for quick action when \nthe next drought cycle begins. Better planning on our part could limit \nsome of the damage felt by drought. I propose that this bill is the \nexact tool needed for facilitating better planning.\n  The impacts of drought are also very costly. According to NOAA, there \nhave been 12 different drought events since 1980 that resulted in \ndamages and costs exceeding $1 billion each. In 2000, severe drought in \nthe South-Central and Southeastern States caused losses to agriculture \nand related industries of over $4 billion. Western wildfires that year \ntotaled over $2 billion in damages. The Eastern drought in 1999 led to \n$1 billion in losses. These are just a few of the statistics.\n  While drought affects the economic and environmental well-being of \nthe entire Nation, the United States has lacked a cohesive strategy for \ndealing with serious drought emergencies. As many of you know, the \nimpact of drought emerges gradually rather than suddenly as is the case \nwith other natural disasters.\n  In 1996, every part of New Mexico suffered from severe drought. As a \nresult, I convened a special Multi-State Drought Task Force of Federal, \nState, local, and tribal emergency management agencies to coordinate \nefforts to respond to drought. The task force was headed up by the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, and included\n\n[[Page S4498]]\n\nevery Federal agency that has programs designed to deal with drought. \nThe task force found that although the Federal Government has many \ndrought-related programs on the books, the real problem is that there \nis no integrated, coordinated system of implementing those programs.\n  With the recommendations from the Western Governors' Association, the \nNational Governors' Association, and the Multi-State Drought Task \nForce, I introduced the National Drought Policy Act of 1997. This piece \nof legislation, which was signed into law, was the first step toward \nestablishing a coherent, effective national drought policy. The \nlegislation created a commission comprised of representatives of those \nFederal, State, local, and tribal agencies and organizations most \ninvolved in drought issues. The bill further charged the commission \nwith providing recommendations on a permanent and systematic federal \nprocess to address this particular type of devastating natural \ndisaster.\n  The commission included representatives from USDA, Interior, the \nArmy, FEMA, SBA and Commerce--all agencies with current drought-related \nprograms. The commission also included non-Federal members such as \nrepresentatives from the National Governors' Association, the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, and four persons representing those groups that \nare always hardest hit by drought emergencies.\n  The commission was charged with determining what needs existed on the \nFederal, State, local, and tribal levels with regard to drought; \nreviewing existing drought programs; and determining what gaps exist \nbetween the needs of drought victims and those programs currently \ndesigned to deal with drought. Finally, the commission was charged with \nmaking recommendations on how Federal drought laws and programs could \nbe better integrated into a comprehensive national drought policy.\n  Ultimately, the commission concluded that ``we must adopt a forward-\nlooking stance to reduce this nation's vulnerability to the impacts of \ndrought. Preparedness--including drought planning, plan implementation, \nproactive mitigation, risk management, resource stewardship, \nconsideration of environmental concerns, and public education--must \nbecome the cornerstone of national drought policy.'' The guiding \nprinciples of drought policy should be one, favoring preparedness over \ninsurance, insurance over relief, and incentives over regulation; two, \nsetting research priorities based on the potential of the research \nresults to reduce drought impacts; and three, coordinating the delivery \nof Federal services through cooperation and collaboration with non-\nFederal entities.\n  I am pleased to be following through on what I started in 1997. The \nbill that I am introducing today is the next step in implementing a \nnational, cohesive drought policy. The bill recognizes that drought is \na recurring phenomenon that causes serious economic and environmental \nloss and that a national drought policy is needed to ensure an \nintegrated, coordinated strategy.\n  The National Drought Preparedness Act of 2002 does the following: It \ncreates national policy for drought. This will hopefully move the \ncountry away from the costly, ad-hoc, response-oriented approach to \ndrought, and move us toward a pro-active, preparedness approach. The \nnew national policy would provide the tools and focus, similar to the \nStafford Act, for Federal, State, tribal and local governments to \naddress the diverse impacts and costs caused by drought.\n  The bill would improve delivery of Federal drought programs. This \nwould ensure improved program delivery, integration, and leadership. To \nachieve this intended purpose, the bill establishes the National \nDrought Council, designating USDA as the lead Federal agency. The \ncouncil and USDA would provide the coordinating and integrating \nfunction for Federal drought programs, much like FEMA provides that \nfunction for other natural disasters under the Stafford Act.\n  The act will provide new tools for drought preparedness planning. \nBuilding on existing policy and planning processes, the bill would \nassist States, local governments, tribes, and other entities in the \ndevelopment and implementation of drought preparedness plans. The bill \ndoes not mandate State and local planning, but is intended to \nfacilitate plan development and implementation through establishment of \nthe drought assistance fund.\n  The bill would improve forecasting and monitoring by facilitating the \ndevelopment of the National Drought Monitoring Network in order to \nimprove the characterization of current drought conditions and the \nforecasting of future droughts. Ultimately, this would provide a better \nbasis to trigger Federal drought assistance.\n  Finally, the bill would authorize FEMA to provide reimbursement to \nStates for reasonable staging and pre-positioning costs when there is a \nthreat of a wildfire.\n  Mr. President I ask unanimous consent that text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2528\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) regional drought disasters in the United States cause \n     serious economic and environmental losses, yet there is no \n     national policy to ensure an integrated and coordinated \n     Federal strategy to prepare for, mitigate, or respond to such \n     losses;\n       (2) State, tribal, and local governments have to coordinate \n     efforts with each Federal agency involved in drought \n     monitoring, planning, mitigation, and response;\n       (3) effective drought monitoring--\n       (A) is a critical component of drought preparedness and \n     mitigation; and\n       (B) requires a comprehensive, integrated national program \n     that is capable of providing reliable, accessible, and timely \n     information to persons involved in drought planning, \n     mitigation, and response activities;\n       (4) the National Drought Policy Commission was established \n     in 1998 to provide advice and recommendations on the creation \n     of an integrated, coordinated Federal policy designed to \n     prepare for and respond to serious drought emergencies;\n       (5) according to the report issued by the National Drought \n     Policy Commission in May 2000, the guiding principles of \n     national drought policy should be--\n       (A) to favor preparedness over insurance, insurance over \n     relief, and incentives over regulation;\n       (B) to establish research priorities based on the potential \n     of the research to reduce drought impacts;\n       (C) to coordinate the delivery of Federal services through \n     collaboration with State and local governments and other non-\n     Federal entities; and\n       (D) to improve collaboration among scientists and managers; \n     and\n       (6) the National Drought Council, in coordination with \n     Federal agencies and State, tribal, and local governments, \n     should provide the necessary direction, coordination, \n     guidance, and assistance in developing a comprehensive \n     drought preparedness system.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the medicare incentive payment program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today \nwith Senators Thomas, Murkowski, Torricelli, Harkin, Clinton, and \nJohnson entitled ``The Medicare Incentive Payment Program Improvement \nAct of 2002'' is designed to improve the flow of needed bonus payments \nto physicians serving Medicare patients in health professions shortage \nareas, HPSA.\n  In my own State the flight of physicians from underserved areas has \naffected both primary care and specialty services alike. In many areas \nthe shortages of specialists exceeds that of primary care physicians. \nThe New Mexico Health Policy Commission reported in its year 2000 \nreport that 22 percent of residents in Los Alamos and Santa Fe were \nunable to receive needed specialist care.\n  With only 170 physicians per 100,000 people, New Mexico ranks well \nbehind the national average with regard to primary care and specialist \nphysicians. The physician shortage problem is further compounded by the \ndisproportionate decline in physicians from rural and underserved \nareas.\n  New Mexico, like many States, has a growing proportion of its rural \npopulation becoming older and sicker. According to the latest census, \nover 20 million of our citizens live in physician shortage areas.\n  Lack of adequate reimbursement, in the face of increasing costs, is a \ncritical factor leading to the shortage of physician services in HPSAs. \nPhysicians flee rural and shortage areas for many reasons including \ninadequate reimbursement, family hardships and quality-of-life issues. \nAlthough it is beyond our scope to address all these issues, we can fix \nthe reimbursement component.\n  The Medicare Incentive Payment Program, MIPP, created by the Omnibus \nBudget Reconciliation Act of 1987, was meant to assist physicians in \ndefraying the higher costs and burdens of serving Medicare patients in \nshortage areas. These 10 percent ``bonuses'' are an essential component \nin our ongoing effort to ensure Medicare beneficiaries access to \nmedical services.\n  Unfortunately the Medicare Incentive Payment Program has fared \npoorly, with few providers choosing to receive the payments. In fact, \nthe total annual physician payments have never exceeded $100 million \nbecause of a series of disincentives in the legislation.\n  The program requires a provider to do a number of things to obtain \nthe bonus payments. First, providers must be aware that NIPP payments \nare available to them. Many providers are unaware of the program's \nexistence. Next, physicians must find out if the patient's medical care \noccurred in a shortage area. Following this a unique code must be \nattached to the Medicare claim, which is then forwarded to the carrier. \nFinally, after all these steps, providers are subjected to automatic \nMedicare audits, just for accepting these payments.\n  Providers committed to serving Medicare patients in underserved areas \ndeserve the support assured by the original legislation's intent.\n  The Medicare Incentive Payment Improvement Act of 2002 addresses and \nimproves shortcomings in the original legislation by: placing the \nburden for determining the bonus eligibility on the Medicare carrier; \neliminating automatic provider audits; directing the Center for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services to establish a Medicare incentive \npayment program educational program for providers; establishing an \nongoing analysis of the programs' ability to improve Medicare \nbeneficiaries access to physician services; continue to provide the \noriginal 10 percent add-on bonus for Part B physician payments in \nhealth provider shortage areas.\n  Medicare carriers are the logical arbiters to determine whether \nphysician services occurred in a shortage area. Physicians, already \noverworked, lack sufficient time, resources, and training to research \nand determine whether a service was provided in a HPSA. By placing the \nresponsibility on carriers, with their sophisticated information \nsystems, the physician's administrative burdens will be reduced.\n  The automatic audits triggered by this program, costly, time \nintensive, and unwarranted, will be lifted under our legislation. By \nplacing the responsibility on carriers to determine payment eligibility \nthe need for provider audits is eliminated.\n  While the MIPP program is intended to improve beneficiaries' access \nto physician services, there is no measure of the program's effect on \nphysician availability. The legislation offered today directs CMS, to \nperform, as ongoing analysis, whether these payments actually do \nimprove beneficiaries access to physician services.\n  I believe these improvements, in addition to others listed above, \nwill greatly improve patient's access to care.\n  The following organizations have expressed their support for this \nlegislation: American College of Physicians/American Society of \nInternal Medicine, the American Academy of Family Physicians and the \nAmerican Geriatrics Society.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a fact sheet, letters of \nsupport, and the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S4502]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2529\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) will \n     improve the flow of needed bonus payments to physicians \n     serving Medicare beneficiaries in Health Professions Shortage \n     Areas (HPSA's). These providers care for patients under \n     difficult circumstances without the financial or \n     infrastructure resources of their colleagues practicing in \n     non-shortage areas.\n       The Act streamlines the flow of a 10% bonus payment for all \n     part-B physicians services provided in geographic HPSA's. In \n     addition, the legislation further improves the existing \n     Medicare Incentive Payment Program by reducing the \n     administrative burden to providers and providing an \n     educational program.\n       The Medicare Incentive Payment Program was initially \n     created and later modified under the Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Acts of 1987 and 1989. The program has fared \n     poorly with little uptake by providers. Total payments fell \n     following the 1997 Balanced Budget Amendment with total \n     payments of $100 million in 1996 and $90 million in 1997.\n       The present program requires a provider to have knowledge \n     of and perform a number of items in order to obtain the \n     payment.\n       Have knowledge the program exists. Many providers are \n     unaware of the bonuses.\n       Determine if the patient encounter took place in a \n     geographic HPSA.\n       Attach the proper modifier to the claim.\n       Undergo a stringent audit process by the intermediary. This \n     risk alone deters many providers from participation.\n       The MIP program although sound in concept has proven \n     difficult to execute. In order for the programs initial goals \n     to be fully realized it must be utilized, i.e., payment to \n     providers serving Medicare beneficiary's in geographic HPSA's\n       The Medicare Incentive Program Improvment Act of 2002 will:\n       Continue to provide the 10% add on bonus to all Part-B \n     payments in Geographic HPSA's.\n       Place the responsibility for determining bonus eligibility \n     on the Medicare carrier.\n       Eliminate the audit burden.\n       Call for the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services to \n     establish a MIP Educational Program for providers.\n       Establish an ongoing analysis of the programs ability to \n     improve Medicare's patient's access to physician services.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                     ACP-ASIM,\n\n                                                   April 17, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: On behalf of the American College of \n     Physicians-American Society of Internal Medicine (ACP-ASIM), \n     we wish to extend our support for your draft Medicare \n     Incentive Payment (MIP) Program legislation. ACP-ASIM--\n     represents 115,000 physicians and medical students--is the \n     largest medical specialty society and second largest \n     physician organization in the United States. Internists \n     provide care to more Medicare patients than any other \n     physician specialty.\n       The MIP Program provides a 10 percent bonus payment to \n     physicians serving Medicare patients in geographic Health \n     Professions Shortage Areas (HPSA). We support provisions in \n     your proposal that seeks to improve the existing MIP Program \n     by placing the burden for determining the bonus eligibility \n     on the Medicare carrier, and not the individual physician. In \n     addition, we support provisions in the proposal that require \n     the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to \n     establish a MIP educational program for providers, and also \n     establish initiatives that provide an analysis of the \n     programs ability to improve Medicare beneficiary's access to \n     physician services. We hope these initiatives will provide \n     needed incentives to recruit and retain physicians into \n     shortage areas.\n       While we support the draft MIP legislation, we are \n     concerned that unless Congress fixes the overall physician \n     payment update formula within the Medicare program, a 10 \n     percent bonus of a declining payment will not solve the \n     problem of physicians providing services to patients in HPSA. \n     Therefore, we hope you will continue to be supportive of a \n     legislative solution to replace the seriously flawed formula \n     in current law for updating the Medicare physician fee \n     schedule, and base annual updates on changes in physicians' \n     input prices as has been recommended by the Medicare Payment \n     Advisory Commission in its March 1 Report to Congress. If \n     left in place, the current update methodology, tied to the \n     performance of the overall economy, will lower Medicare \n     payments for physician services by 28.1 percent in real terms \n     by 2005.\n       Thank you again, Senator Bingaman for your continued \n     leadership to the present and future viability of the \n     Medicare program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Sara E. Walker,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              The American Geriatrics Society,\n\n                                                     May 16, 2002.\n     The Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     United States Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: The American Geriatrics Society \n     (AGS), an organization of over 6,000 geriatricians and other \n     health care professionals who are specially trained in the \n     management of care for frail, chronically ill older patients, \n     extends our support for your draft Medicare Incentive Payment \n     (MIP) Program legislation.\n       The MIP Program provides a 10 percent bonus payment to \n     physicians serving Medicare patients in Geographic Health \n     Professions Shortage Areas (HPSA). We support provisions in \n     your proposal that seek to improve the existing MIP by \n     placing the burden for determining the bonus eligibility on \n     the Medicare carrier, and not the individual physician. \n     Finally, we support provision that would improve our ability \n     to provide Medicare beneficiary access to physician services \n     under the MIP Program.\n       We look forward to working with you on this and other \n     important Medicare initiatives during this Congress. If you \n     should have comments or questions on this letter, please \n     contact Susan Emmer in our Washington office at 301-320-3873.\n           Sincerely,\n                                        Kenneth Brummel-Smith, MD,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               American Academy of\n\n\n                                            Family Physicians,\n\n                                                     May 16, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: The American Academy of Family \n     Physicians and its 93,500 members nationwide commend you for \n     introducing the ``Medicare Incentive Payment Program \n     Improvement Act of 2002.'' This bill would make any physician \n     practicing in a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) \n     eligible for a ten-percent bonus. The bill would also charge \n     the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct an \n     ongoing program to provide education to physicians on the \n     Medicare Incentive Payment (MIP) program. The Secretary would \n     also be directed to conduct an ongoing study of the MIP \n     program, which shall focus on whether such a program \n     increases the access to physicians' services for those \n     Medicare beneficiaries who reside in a HPSA.\n       Created in 1989, the MIP program provides bonus payments to \n     physicians who practice in HPSAs in an effort to entice more \n     physicians to those areas. According to a Medicare Payment \n     Advisory Commission (MedPAC) report dated June 2001, a recent \n     decline in the bonus payments to physicians has caused \n     concern that several aspects of the program design are \n     compromising its effectivess.\n       For example, currently the MIP ten-percent bonus is paid to \n     physicians practicing in HPSAs only upon submission of the \n     claim form with a special coding modifier attached to each \n     service identified. Since the bonus payment is predicated \n     upon the use of this special coding modifier, and since, due \n     to the inherent instability of the HPSA designation, \n     physicians cannot always be certain if they are practicing in \n     a shortage area, the use of the MIP has been less than \n     expected.\n\n[[Page S4503]]\n\n       In 1996, 75 percent of participating rural physicians, or \n     about 18,700 doctors, received less than $1,520 each in bonus \n     payments for the year. In addition to the complexities \n     described above, the low level of payments may be \n     attributable to carriers being required to review claims of \n     physicians who receive the largest bonus payments. A 1999 \n     study by the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) \n     suggested this policy may discourage physicians from applying \n     for the MIP program. More importantly, a 1999 General \n     Accounting Office (GAO) report suggested the ten-percent \n     bonus payments may be insufficient to have a significant \n     influence on recruitment or retention of primary care \n     physicians.\n       The American Academy of Family Physicians urges Congress to \n     pass the ``Medicare Incentive Payment Program Improvement Act \n     of 2002,'' which would make any physician practicing in a \n     HPSA automatically eligible for the ten-percent bonus without \n     having to engage in any special billing or coding processes \n     or submitting to a higher level of claims review. Such action \n     will ensure that rural Medicare patients can continue to \n     receive the care they depend on and deserve. Please let us \n     know how we can assist in the effort to gain support for this \n     important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Richard G. Roberts,\n                                                      Board Chair.\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce \nthe Medicare Incentive Payment Program Improvement Act of 2002 with my \ndistinguished colleague Senator Bingaman. This legislation makes \nimportant improvements to the current Medicare Incentive Payment, MIP \nProgram. These refinements will go a long way in ensuring eligible \nrural physicians receive the Medicare bonus payment to which they are \nentitled.\n  The Medicare Incentive Payment Program was created in 1987 under the \nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act to serve as an incentive tool to \nrecruit physicians to practice in Health Professional Shortage Areas, \nHPSAs, by providing a 10-percent Medicare bonus payment. There are \napproximately 2,800 federally designated HPSAs--75 percent of which are \nlocated in rural areas. In my State of Wyoming, over half of the \ncounties are designated as a health professional shortage area and have \na difficult time recruiting physicians.\n  Unfortunately, this well-intended program has not worked well due to \nthe burden it places on providers. Under the current MIP programmatic \nstructure, physicians are required to determine if the patient \nencounter occurred in a designated underserved areas, they must attach \na code modifier to the billing claim and must undergo a stringent \naudit. Additionally, there is evidence that many physicians who would \nbe eligible are not even aware of the program.\n  Therefore, the legislation we are introducing today alleviates the \nadministrative burden on rural physicians by requiring Medicare \ncarriers to determine eligibility. The Medicare Incentive Payment \nProgram Improvement Act of 2002 also requires the Centers for Medicare \nand Medicaid Services to establish a MIP education program for \nproviders and establishes ongoing analysis of the MIP Program's ability \nto improve access to physician services for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  All physicians are currently struggling with the recent Medicare \npayment reduction of 5.4 percent in addition to the ever-increasing \nregulatory burden of participating in the Medicare Program. As rural \nproviders tend to be disproportionately impacted by Medicare payment \ncuts, it has never been more important to ensure that the few rural \nphysician incentive programs that exist have a positive effect on the \nstability of our rural health care delivery system. I strongly urge all \nmy Senate colleagues interested in rural health to cosponsor the \nMedicare Incentive Payment Program Improvement Act of 2002.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/16/senate-section/article/S4503-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 271--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n   EFFECTIVENESS OF THE AMBER PLAN IN RESPONDING TO CHILD ABDUCTIONS\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 271\n\n       Whereas communities should implement an emergency alert \n     plan such as the AMBER (America's Missing: Broadcast \n     Emergency Response) Plan to expedite the recovery of abducted \n     children;\n       Whereas the AMBER Plan, a partnership between law \n     enforcement agencies and media officials, assists law \n     enforcement, parents, and local communities to respond \n     immediately to the most serious child abduction cases;\n       Whereas just as in a storm emergency, when warnings are \n     broadcast locally, under AMBER, radio and television \n     stations, as a public service, interrupt programming with a \n     critical message from law enforcement regarding the \n     description of a missing child;\n       Whereas the AMBER Plan was created in 1996 in memory of 9-\n     year-old Amber Hagerman who was kidnapped and murdered in \n     Arlington, Texas;\n       Whereas in response to community concern, the Association \n     of Radio Managers with the assistance of area law enforcement \n     in Arlington, Texas, created the AMBER Plan;\n       Whereas statistics from the Department of Justice show that \n     74 percent of kidnapped children who are later found murdered \n     are killed within the first 3 hours of their abduction;\n       Whereas since the first few hours during which a child is \n     missing are critical, the AMBER plan helps the community \n     respond quickly;\n       Whereas since the first AMBER alert in 1997, AMBER plans \n     have helped to recover 16 children throughout the country;\n       Whereas the National Center for Missing and Exploited \n     Children endorses the AMBER Plan and is promoting the use of \n     such emergency alert plans nationwide;\n       Whereas the AMBER Plan is responsible for reuniting \n     children with their searching parents: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the AMBER Plan is a powerful tool in fighting child \n     abductions; and\n       (2) the AMBER Plan should be used in communities across the \n     United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/16/senate-section/article/S4503-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3428.

I ask unanimous consent that S. 848, the Social Security \nNumber Misuse Prevention Act of 2002, reported today by the Judiciary \nCommittee, be referred to the Committee on Finance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the social security number was originally \ndevised to administer the Social Security program. Despite the limited \npurpose for which it was intended, the social security number is now \nwidely used by Federal, State and local governments, businesses, health \ncare providers, educational institutions, and others for identification \nand recordkeeping.\n  The unintended consequence of this widespread use is that social \nsecurity numbers have been used to facilitate a growing range of \nillegal activities, including fraud, identity theft, and, in some \ncases, stalking and other violent crimes.\n  Because the Federal Government requires virtually every individual in \nthe United States to have a social security number to seek employment, \nto pay taxes, to qualify for social security benefits, it is necessary \nand appropriate for the Federal Government to take steps to prevent the \nabuse of social security numbers.\n  Last year, Senator Feinstein and Senator Gregg introduced a bill, S. \n848, designed to protect social security numbers. Based on the fact \nthat one section of the bill amends Title 18, the so called ``criminal \ncode,'' and another section of the bill gives the Attorney General \ncertain rulemaking authority, the bill was referred to the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  However, the purpose of this bill is to protect social security \nnumbers, which as a matter of law falls within the scope of Social \nSecurity Act, which as a matter of jurisdiction falls within the \npurview of the Financial Committee.\n  The Social Security Act, which led to the creation of the social \nsecurity number, has been amended numerous times to protect Social \nSecurity numbers and the Social Security Office of Inspector General \nhas been given authority to enforce these protections. A careful review \nof S. 848 clearly shows that the preponderance of its provisions fall \nwithin the scope of the Finance Committee's jurisdiction.\n  Therefore, it is my view that this bill, S. 848, should have been \nreferred to the Finance Committee.\n  Unfortunately, there is no provision in Senate rules to correct this \nmistake and refer S. 848 to the Finance Committee once it has already \nbeen referred to the Judiciary Committee.\n  When the Judiciary Committee scheduled a markup of this bill on May \n2, Senator Grassley and I sent a letter to the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee urging them to postpone markup until \nthese questions of jurisdiction could be resolved. Following our \ndiscussions with Senator Feinstein, Senator Grassley and I have agreed \nto withdraw our objections to the Judiciary Committee proceeding to \nmarkup S. 848, based on the following three conditions:\n  First, in the event that S. 848 is reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee, it will be referred to the Finance Committee.\n  Second, it should be understood that this agreement to a sequential \nreferral does not cede our claim of jurisdiction to this legislation \nand should not prejudice the referral of future legislation on this \nmatter.\n  Third, it is my intention to have the Finance Committee consider S. \n848 as soon as the committee schedule permits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/16/senate-section/article/S4509-5", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR FRIDAY, MAY 17, 2002\n\n  Mr. REID.
