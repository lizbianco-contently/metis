Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to \nfollow Senator Burns.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S8394]]\n\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank my friend from Minnesota. Senator Byrd will be a \nlittle bit late this morning. If the Senator would like to give his \nstatement now, that is perfectly OK with me. I think there will be more \nspeakers on our side. I am supporting the amendment. We will make those \npoints at a later time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank my colleague and I thank the Senator from \nMontana for all of his support, all of his leadership on this amendment \nthat deals with disaster assistance for rural America.\n  Colleagues, the Presiding Officer comes from a State where \nagriculture is not the No. 1 industry. Thomas ``Tip'' O'Neill said all \npolitics is local. I add, all politics is personal. For me, this is \nprobably the biggest priority I have right now, to get help to people.\n  This amendment, which started with Senator Byrd providing assistance \nfor firefighters working on fires in our country, and some Members \nsaid, let's do this all together.\n  I come from a State where we have had massive devastation, massive \nlosses from flooding. Others come from States where there is drought. \nOthers come from States where there are fires. And, of course, since I \nhave been in the Senate it has been hurricanes, tornados, you name it. \nThis provides much needed assistance to farmers, whether they be \nwheatgrowers, soybeans, or livestock producers.\n  In our State, the estimates of the amount of loss of dollars is $300 \nmillion plus. The people with the best of crop insurance have lost 30 \npercent that they do not have covered. The independent producers cannot \nmake it.\n  This is what we have, a situation that is a perfect example of there \nbut the grace of God go I, or we are our brother's keeper or sister's \nkeeper. How true.\n  I have never, since I have been a Senator, voted against disaster \nassistance for any part of the country. I know that when people are hit \nby floods or drought or tornadoes or hurricanes or fire, it does not \nhave a thing to do with whether they work hard or do not work hard, are \ngood managers or not good managers. No one asks for this.\n  In the original farm bill, I think we had over $2 billion for \ndisaster assistance for 2001. It was taken out in conference. It was \nopposed, I guess, by the administration and some of the leadership in \nthe House. We tried to bring this disaster relief bill up, we tried to \nput it on the supplemental appropriations bill, without much luck.\n  I think the support has built for this legislation. We are going to \nhave a really strong vote, and, frankly, I am not really interested in \ndrawing the line, as in Democrats versus Republicans. I do not think \nthis has much to do with that. I wish the administration would be more \nsupportive, but I think the President will sign this bill. I know he \nwill. I think if we get a strong vote on the Senate side, the House \nwill support it. It is just impossible for any Senator or \nRepresentative--it doesn't really matter about party--you just cannot \nturn your back on people.\n  All these statistics, to me, translate in personal terms. The trips I \nhave taken to northwestern Minnesota have been among the most emotional \nexperiences I have had as a Senator. You can see the damage the floods \nhave caused.\n  FEMA can help with temporary housing, and FEMA can help if there is \ndamage of public infrastructure. FEMA helped us build a new school in \nAda, MN. That was so important. But when it comes to farm country, \nreally, if we do not provide the help, it is just not going to be \nthere. FEMA cannot deal with these kinds of crop losses.\n  It is just the absolute sense of discouragement, of just being \ncompletely beaten down, of seeing your whole life's work disappear, of \njust believing there is no future. Then there has been the delay, and \nthe delay, and I think a lot of farmers--and not just farmers, people \nin northwest Minnesota--have just lost all hope.\n  I make this appeal to all my colleagues to please support this \nlegislation. The truth of the matter is, never in the 12 years I have \nbeen here have we hesitated to provide disaster assistance moneys to \npeople. We never have hesitated--never--to take it out of general \nrevenue. We know we are going to have to do it. As I say, if it is the \nfarmers in northwest Minnesota now, it could be people on the coast in \nFlorida who need help tomorrow. God knows, people in Colorado need it. \nCertainly in Colorado we have drought; South Dakota, North Dakota; \nKansas is faced with these struggles--it is all over the country. And \nthen it could be something else next year and the next year. We are \ntalking about natural disasters. This is long overdue.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, I view this as the most important vote \nwe could have. I appeal to all my colleagues, regardless of the region \nof the country you are from, regardless of whether you are faced with \nany of these catastrophes. I again pledge, one more time--I see two \nmore colleagues here in the Chamber, so I am not going to take more \nthan another minute or two. Here is what I say to you, and it is an \nabsolute promise I will keep. If you, as a Senator from New Jersey, or \nthe Senator in the chair, any Senator ever comes to the floor and says, \nmy God, this is what has happened, there is this devastation, there is \nno way people can build their economic lives without this disaster \nrelief--I know it is not in the State of Minnesota--will you, as a \nSenator from Minnesota, support this? I will say yes, because we are a \nnational community and we help people. That is what it is about: We \nhelp people. This is critically important.\n  I hope we will get a huge vote for this amendment. I make the plea to \nall my colleagues, regardless of the State they are from, to please \nsupport this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from \nKansas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank my distinguished colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. President, before you saddle up to ride on a new trail, it is a \ngood thing to take a look at where you have been. You can avoid a lot \nof trouble--a lot of ditches, a lot of box canyons--that way. The \nproblem is that in terms of yet another expensive disaster bill for \nfarmers and ranchers--sorely needed--we are indeed in a box canyon. It \nappears we are going to have to pay quite a price to backtrack, to get \nto a responsible and reasonable farm program policy to be of assistance \nto our farmers.\n  We didn't have to go down this trail. I would like to read a quote by \nthe distinguished Senate majority leader. He is doing the best he can, \nas he sees it, with the disaster bill. But the majority leader said in \nregard to the new farm bill when it was passed in May, according to CQ \nMonitor News:\n\n       What we are doing is putting certainty back in the bill. \n     And I would argue, we're going to be doing it at less cost to \n     the Federal Government during the course and life of this \n     bill than we did under Freedom to Farm because you are not \n     going to see these disastrous supplemental requests in the \n     future. We'd still like to get one for 2001, but in the \n     future you are not going to see them. It won't be necessary.\n\n  At the same time, we also had many say that the new farm bill was the \ngreatest farm bill ever passed.\n  Here we are, only 4 months out from the passage of the farm bill, and \nfarmers are lined up outside the Farm Service Agency offices in great \nnumbers, with all of the complexities of the bill, and already these \nfolks and a majority of the farm and commodity organizations are also \nlined up, pushing for a disaster assistance package, a bill the \nCongressional Budget Office now says will come close to $6 billion. It \nis a bill that faces an uphill, if not impossible, battle in the House \nand a possible Presidential veto.\n\n  How on Earth did we get here after passing the so-called greatest \nfarm bill ever? Because in my view the new farm bill is flawed. Simply \nput, it provides no assistance to farmers when they need it the most. \nThat so-called and much talked about countercyclical safety net we \nheard so much about--well, it was not a safety net. It is a hammock. It \nhas holes, and it is lying on parched acres suffering from drought.\n  We are in, as has been said and has also been covered in the press, \none of the worst droughts we have ever seen in many parts of the \nPlains. Pastures are gone. Cattle herds have been liquidated. Combines \nnever left the shed\n\n[[Page S8395]]\n\nin parts of Kansas. Parts of our great State look like the desert areas \nof the southwestern United States. I have bankers telling me they \ncannot cash flow a single producer who does business at their bank.\n  In large part, these cash flow problems are the result of a farm bill \nthat provides no assistance to producers this crop-year when they do \nnot have a crop. When the farm bill was debated months ago, I said I \nwould vote against the bill because it would not have provided the so-\ncalled countercyclical assistance to wheat producers in 9 of the last \n20 years. Why would you support a farm bill that did not really provide \nany assistance in about half of the time in the past 20 years, with \nmost of those years being in poor production years caused by droughts, \nflooding, freeze, insects--the years when we need the assistance the \nmost, 9 out of 20? I did not think that was a very good deal.\n  For that I received some criticism on this floor. I was told it was \nOK that the bill would not have paid out in 9 of those 20 years because \nthat meant that prices were high and producers would not need the \nassistance.\n  Let the record show that yesterday in Dodge City, KS, the closing \nprice was $4.67 a bushel on wheat. That is a tremendous price as \ncompared to where it has been, so prices have come up. It is about \n$2.91 a bushel for corn, $4.28 a bushel on sorghum, $5.61 a bushel on \nsoybeans--great prices. But, with these prices, my producers are barely \nhanging on. Why? They have no crops to sell. Consequently, the few who \ndid sold early to meet these emergency obligations.\n  This August, I just finished a 105-county listening tour. I wish \nthose ``greatest farm bill ever'' proponents would have been there. My \nfarm meeting in Stockton, KS, America, started out with a farmer \ntelling me:\n\n       Pat, thanks for voting against that farm bill. I don't \n     think most of us can survive this first year under it. We \n     were counting, under the old bill, on a supplemental payment \n     called the AMTA payment, or at best the equivalent of that \n     payment.\n\n  It was a common statement all throughout Kansas.\n  The difference is that under that payment, the checks would have been \nthere now and it would have been 60 cents for wheat as opposed to a \nvery small direct payment of 6 cents a bushel for wheat. And the other \nthree components of the countercyclical payment don't work in times \nsuch as this.\n  It is true that prices are high. But it is because drought has \nreduced the supplies. In many instances, my producers had no crop to \nharvest. And that is true in Montana, it is true in Wyoming, it is true \nin Colorado, it is true in South Dakota, it is true in Nebraska, and it \nis true in Oklahoma. But due to these high prices, they are not going \nto receive any countercyclical payments. There is no loan deficiency \npayment, and they have no crop to put under loan.\n  One of the criticisms of the farm bill was that it was too complex. \nFarmers would get payments in maybe one in four mailboxes. If you \nlooked in one mailbox, no payment. If you looked in a second mailbox, \nno payment. If you looked in a third mailbox, no payment. If you looked \nin a fourth mailbox, maybe 6 cents a bushel.\n  That is one of the major flaws of this farm bill. It is why I pushed \nan alternative farm bill approach. It is also why I proposed \nimplementing this bill or any new bill in 2003--the next cropyear to \ngive us enough time to work on it--and doing a budgeted $5.5 billion \nsupplemental AMTA payment plus livestock feed assistance for this \nyear--cash payments, income protection, not a countercyclical payment \nless than what we are going to spend in regard to this disaster bill.\n  Instead, here we are doing a disaster bill again. Every even numbered \nyear there is disaster assistance proposed and disaster assistance to \nimplement. As long as this farm bill is our current policy, we are \nprobably going to be back here doing one each and every year.\n  This ride into a farm bill box canyon is expensive. It is full of \nregulatory potholes, all sorts of snakes that come back and bite the \nproducer and truly counterproductive--not countercyclical. Two years \nago, we made significant reforms to the Crop Insurance Program. That \nwas the tool under the Kerrey-Roberts bill, or the Roberts-Kerrey bill \ndepending on which one you want to give the credit. If you like it, it \nis the Roberts-Kerrey bill. If you do not like it, it is the Kerrey-\nRoberts bill.\n  There are significant reforms. Coverage levels are up. Insured acres \nare up. Indemnities paid to producers are substantial. We spent $1 \nbillion to address the problems caused by multiple years of losses. \nMany producers are telling me they are just beginning to realize the \nbenefits of this change.\n  You can insure up to the 85 percent coverage level. However, because \nof the farm bill that was passed earlier this year, which took money \nout of crop insurance, we are now doing a disaster assistance bill that \nworks to undermine the very reforms we passed in the year 2000. Again, \nit didn't have to happen this way.\n  We proposed a farm bill that would have provided assistance in years \nof both low prices and crop losses. The other side said: No thank you.\n  We proposed a supplemental AMTA package and livestock assistance that \nwould have been paid for in the budget. The checks would be out this \nmonth. The other said: No thank you.\n  It took USDA 8 months to provide disaster payments several years ago. \nThey are hard hit today trying to work through all of the paperwork on \nthe new farm bill. I am not sure that will happen in regard to \nimmediate assistance. Here we are again, just like the farm bill. My \nminority party was shut out of any committee consideration of that \nbill. And due to the parliamentary situation in which this second-\ndegree amendment was submitted, we have no opportunity to offer \namendments to this package.\n\n  I had a proposal to allow producers to choose between 2001 and 2002 \nassistance. The other side didn't like that, though it was a better \ndeal for taxpayers. It brought the price down. And, after all, farmers \ndid receive the extra AMTA payment in 2001.\n  Was it perfect? No. But it was a halfway point between those wanting \nassistance and some in this body who want nothing at all. It worked to \nprotect the Crop Insurance Program by requiring the purchase of crop \ninsurance in order to receive disaster assistance.\n  Why buy crop insurance if you are going to get disaster assistance \nevery year?\n  It tried to make proper use of taxpayer dollars by keeping this \nspending in check. And it was popular with my Kansas producers on my \nrecent tour in the 105 counties of the great State of Kansas.\n  We will not have a chance to debate any alternative proposals today. \nThis package will probably pass. I am going to reluctantly--heels \ndragging--support it. I have to support it. The situation is grim--\nabsolutely grim. It has been hotter out in Kansas. It has been drier \nout in Kansas. But it has never been as hot and as dry at the same \ntime--even back in dirty thirties--as is the case as of today.\n  But let's be honest with ourselves and the American public. These \nfunds are coming straight from Social Security. It is the other side \nthat has increased the bidding war right at the start of this \nappropriations process, and we are doing this plain and simple because \nwe have a new farm bill that is flawed and that has created a cash flow \nvacuum in rural America.\n  There is no question that we need--that our farmers need--this \ndisaster assistance. The situation in farm country hit by drought--the \ndrought that caused increased market prices in other commodity regions, \nnot the farm bill--is recordbreaking. It is severe. By passing--\n``force-feeding'' is the better term--this expensive emergency disaster \npackage, without any chance for amendment, what do we achieve? I will \ntell you what we achieve. We achieve an issue. I hope the end result is \nthat we achieve a bill. Right now we have an issue. This bill will not \npass the House. It will not be signed by the President. It is going to \nbe a little tough for the farmer, it seems to me, to cashflow with \npolitics and an issue at the bank.\n  I hope when we pass this bill--this very expensive bill that is \nheaded for an uphill battle in the House and with the administration--\nthat we can reach some accommodation in conference.\n  Reluctantly, I will vote for the bill. I don't like the way it has \nbeen brought up. I have gone over all of the reasons\n\n[[Page S8396]]\n\nwhy I think we should have done it another way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to make another note about \nthis process being hijacked for the last year and a half. When we \nstarted talking about drought and disaster relief and agriculture, the \nnumber was much smaller. In the meantime, we did pass a farm bill that \nI reluctantly supported. Of course, I was a party, with the Senator \nfrom Kansas, in offering a substitute amendment that I think would have \nbeen better for agriculture.\n  We have a circumstance at this time in this particular case where the \nmoney was taken out of agriculture and a drought where you have no crop \nfor sale. We have a cashflow problem. In other words, we would like to \nsee our agricultural producers go to the insurance program--we think it \nis much better than it was, say, 2 years ago--and to assume some \nresponsibility in risk management. That is not the case now because of \nthe drying up of funds over the last year and a half. The circumstances \nhave changed. Thus, we have the amendment on the floor that is before \nus today.\n  I appreciate the work the Senator from Kansas has done in providing \nreal help instead of getting into a position where we fall to the whims \nof politics. There are circumstances that arise that make this issue a \nvery contentious issue. I thank him for his work.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Nebraska.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank my friend and \ncolleague from Montana, Senator Burns, for granting me some time this \nmorning to speak regarding this very important legislation to assist \nour farmers and ranchers across our country with the disaster which \nthey have been experiencing--not only this year but in many cases for 2 \nor as many as 5 years.\n  I thank Senators Baucus and Burns for their tireless work to get \ndrought relief to the floor. I thank Senator Daschle for moving so \nquickly to get this amendment to a vote.\n  I think going home over the August recess certainly gave many \nSenators--and all of us from the States that have been hit by drought \neven more reason to move on this bill. I am glad we are having this \nvote today.\n  This drought is a disaster. It has been a disaster for agriculture \nand a disaster for rural communities which depend so much on \nagriculture. If this had been a hurricane or an earthquake, we would \nhave already responded. If we had found a way to call a drought by \nname, such as ``Drought Andrew,'' or drought this or drought that, we \nprobably would have been able to have it crystallized so people could \nsee that it is the same kind of experience as you have with any other \nnatural disaster. It just takes a longer time in building. It doesn't \nhave necessarily a beginning point or an ending point, but it expands \nover a broad period of time. We would have had an aid package within a \nfew weeks, and assistance would already be on the way, and the \ncommunities that have felt the hurt and the pain would already be \nfeeling the positive effects from this kind of support. Here we are \nresponding to natural disasters, and I think it is important we do \nthat. We can remedy that by passing this amendment today, not waiting \nany longer.\n\n  I also believe that my colleagues who are not from drought-stricken \nStates may not have the entire picture about how bad this has been. I \nknow I have been kept up to date on the devastation caused by the \ndrought--getting reports, getting information, seeing pictures--but \nvisiting the drought areas during the recess firsthand was certainly an \neye-opening experience.\n  Going to farms that have had crops--some good, some bad--every year \nfor 70 years and today, this year, to see there is no crop, for the \nfirst time ever, is an eye-opening experience. To walk across a \ncornfield and find only shriveled cobs that can barely be shucked and \nhaving no kernels is an eye-opening experience.\n  This is not the result of poor planning or some unfortunate weather; \nthis is the result of a natural disaster that has crept upon the land, \nhad no mercy; and it has turned upside down the hopes and the work that \nwent into planting this spring.\n  Again, for much of my State, this is a no-yield year. I would like to \ngive some specific examples that I heard back home. A family farmer \nnear McCook, NE--my hometown--Dale Dueland, whom I have known from the \ndays that he crawled across his family's floor, said he would have a \nzero yield on his 900 acres of dryland corn. That crop is a loss this \nyear, despite preparation that assumes little moisture--as he always \nassumes little moisture--and despite crop insurance.\n  Al Davis from Hyannis told me: ``Each day places another nail in the \ncoffin of many individual ranchers in Nebraska and on the Great Plains. \nMany ranchers have already thrown in the towel and are liquidating \nportions of their herds,'' which will have an impact not only today and \ntomorrow but for the next several years until those herds are rebuilt, \nif they are rebuilt.\n  Annette Dubas, who owns a ranch and farm in western Nance County, NE, \ntold me after the third year in a row of drought conditions, some \nfarmers in her area had already been forced out, while others work two \njobs just to be able to keep their farms going. These are not big-time \ncorporate farms; these are family farmers who are being driven out of \nbusinesses that, in some cases, have been in their families for \ngenerations--in many cases 100 or more years.\n  The relief package before us today is of the utmost importance to \nfarmers and ranchers across Nebraska and all rural America. It will \nmake the difference between keeping their farms or being forced out of \nagriculture--to the very great detriment of all of us who depend on the \n``breadbasket of the world.''\n  We must pass this legislation and ensure that our rural communities \nare not allowed to wither under the worst conditions in over half a \ncentury.\n  This is not the result of a bad crop-year or bad market price; it is \nabout a no-crop year. It is about a no-pasture year, a no-grassland \nyear on top of 2 or more for 5 years. It has been where we have been \nexperiencing no crops, no pasture, and no future--unless we are able to \nstep forward today and adopt this legislation.\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to close my statement this morning by \nquoting from what Dale Dueland said at the Senate Agriculture Committee \nhearing in Grand Island, NE, last month. And I quote him:\n\n       This drought is a disaster. It is as severe and as much a \n     disaster as any flood, tornado, hurricane, or earthquake that \n     you could imagine. It has been sneaky and sinister. It has \n     tempted and teased us for two years with moderate dry spells, \n     and this year just unleashed an unbelievable 90 days of \n     extreme heat and dry to scorch the earth. This disaster \n     deserves extreme measures to deal with the problems.\n\n  Mr. President, I could not have said it better than my friend Dale \nDueland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n6 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Burns, for \nyielding time for me to come and speak on behalf of this amendment.\n  This is an amendment to provide emergency drought relief for ranchers \nand farmers. The amendment is based on Senator Baucus' bipartisan bill, \nS. 2800, of which I am very pleased to be a cosponsor, along with 16 \nother Senators.\n  The ranching tradition in our State--in New Mexico--goes back 400 \nyears to the time that the Spanish settled the State. The cattle and \ncalf industry in our State is the single most important agricultural \nproduct that we have, which represents close to $1 billion a year in \ndirect cash receipts to people in our State.\n  Most of the cattle industry is concentrated in rural areas of the \nState, such as Union County, Chaves County, and Curry County. These are \nfamily-owned businesses. The families in New Mexico who own these \nbusinesses, in many cases, have ranched this same land for many \ngenerations.\n  New Mexico, like much of the rest of the West, is now in the throes \nof the worst drought in at least 50 years. In some parts of the State, \nthe drought has persisted for the last 3 years.\n\n[[Page S8397]]\n\n  According to the Natural Resources Conservation Service, this has \nbeen one of New Mexico's driest years in recent history. The lack of \nnormal snow and rainfall has left ranchers in our State with little \npasture for grazing livestock.\n\n  The Governor of New Mexico has declared a statewide drought \nemergency. He declared that in April. The Secretary of Agriculture has \nnow declared every agricultural county in our State a disaster area.\n  Since March of this year, the USDA has rated range and pasture \nconditions in New Mexico at an average of 81 percent poor or very poor. \nThese conditions have made it impossible for ranchers to maintain their \nherds. As a result of the continuing drought, water tanks and stock \nponds in New Mexico's rangeland have dried up. Ranchers in my State are \nhauling water and are supplementing feed for their herds. As grazing \nconditions have continued to worsen, many ranchers have culled their \nherds because of the cost of water and feed being more than they could \nbear at this stage.\n  The drought will continue to impact producers in our State for years \nto come. Without emergency support such as contained in this amendment, \nthe ongoing drought could very well put many of our ranching families \nout of business for good.\n  I would like to take this opportunity to thank the staff of the \nUSDA's Farm Service Agency in New Mexico for their fine work so far \nthis year in helping New Mexico farmers and ranchers deal with the \ndrought. They have used the limited tools available to them. Paul \nGutierrez, Scotty Abbott, and Rosalie Ramirez have worked effectively \nto provide some limited economic help to producers throughout New \nMexico. As a result, many producers in our State have been able to take \nadvantage of low-cost loans, emergency haying and grazing on CRP land, \nor assistance through the USDA's Emergency Conservation Program.\n  However, even with this limited help from USDA, the farmers and \nranchers of New Mexico are continuing to suffer the economic effects of \nthe drought. In previous years, Congress has provided emergency support \nthrough the Crop Disaster Program, the Livestock Assistance Program, \nand the American Indian Livestock Feed Program. I believe the drought \ndisaster in New Mexico is so severe that assistance again this year is \njustified.\n  I first voted to support drought relief in February during \nconsideration of the farm bill. That amendment, which Senator Baucus \noffered, was adopted by a large vote of 69 to 30. Unfortunately, the \nHouse refused to include the emergency funding in the farm bill, and it \nwas dropped in conference.\n  Since the Senate voted in February, the conditions in my State have \ncontinued to deteriorate because of the lack of moisture.\n  The emergency funding provided in this amendment will provide \npayments to ranchers for the losses they have suffered from the \ndrought. The disaster funding is desperately needed. I hope all \nSenators will support the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Frank A. \nDuBois, who is the New Mexico Secretary of Agriculture, in support of \nemergency drought funding as provided for in this amendment, be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                        Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                          State of New Mexico,\n\n                                     Las Cruces, NM, June 6, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senator, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: As you know, our ranchers are facing \n     a financial hardship due to the drought. I ask your support \n     for funding the Livestock Assistance Program authorized in \n     the recent farm bill.\n       Pasture conditions have declined severely over the past \n     months. Currently, pasture and feed conditions are reported \n     in very poor to poor condition. As a result, ranchers are \n     providing supplemental feed and hauling water to their \n     livestock. Ranchers in the state are also culling herds to \n     reduce their feed costs.\n       Cattle and calves are New Mexico's largest agricultural \n     industry. The overall economic impact from the ranching \n     industry to the state is over $1 billion.\n       Please call me at (505) 646-5063 if you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Frank A. DuBois.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Three minutes, 15 seconds remain.\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield 3 minutes to my friend from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, Wyoming is experiencing a level of drought \nthat has been devastating to the ranching industry of my State. In an \neffort to address a need that grows more and more desperate every day, \nI am cosponsoring the emergency agricultural disaster assistance \namendment. This amendment funds the Livestock Assistance Program for \nboth 2001 and 2002 and responds to a call for help that echoes through \nthe ranching communities of Wyoming and throughout the west.\n  The need for drought assistance is great, but the need for \nresponsible legislating is just as great. As a cosponsor, I am fully \nsupportive of the amendment before us; however, I must serve the needs \nof my State without breaking the budget. For this reason, I plan to \nintroduce an amendment, with the support of Senator Grassley, to offset \nthe emergency funding for the Livestock Assistance Program by \nreinstating payment limitations in the farm bill. I plan to pay my own \nway for the assistance I have advocated for over a year.\n  My proposed amendment does its best to work within the strictures of \na poor economy. I am not unmindful of the fact that the United States \nwill have a deficit this year after 4 years of surplus. Alan Greenspan \nsaid to me a few weeks ago that one of the things this country needs \nthe most now is fiscal responsibility. As a fiscal conservative myself, \nI plan to use an offset for desperately needed livestock assistance \nfunding.\n  Time has changed things since we voted for disaster assistance in the \nfarm bill. The national economic picture isn't so rosy with the thunder \nclouds of the forecasted deficit on the horizon. In fact, the economic \nforecast is as stark as the weather forecast ranchers are reading in my \nState. This is a time for choices. The agricultural community can't \nhave it all, but we can do our best to act responsibly and serve their \nneeds. That is what my amendment would do. And it doesn't just serve \nthe ranching community\n  My proposed amendment is not an attempt to decrease the assistance \ngoing to our agricultural communities or to thwart the emergency \nagricultural amendment before us now. I have spent the last month in \nWyoming and the devastation there is imprinted in my brain. This is the \nthird year Wyoming and the west have been battling the effects of the \nweather and suffering through a drought that has had a severe impact on \nfamilies and communities throughout the west. As an example, when I was \nhome in Gillette I noted that we had received just over half of our \nnormal level of precipitation since January. Water is so precious right \nnow Wyomingites treasure every drop that falls from the sky as a gift \nfrom the heavens. Unfortunately, those gifts have been few and far \nbetween and, at the printing of the last crop report, 80 percent of \nWyoming's range and pasture feed was rated in poor or very poor \ncondition. That 80 percent represents a huge increase over our 5-year \naverage, which was 32 percent.\n  At the present time, only 13 percent of Wyoming has adequate topsoil \nmoisture. That lack of soil moisture not only makes it impossible to \ngrow crops, but it also has effects that ripple throughout our entire \nState.\n  In our Popo Agie Conservation district a fracture opened up this \nsummer in the ground. Soil scientists called in to determine the cause \nof the fracture said that the 5-foot deep crack had opened up because \nthere is not enough moisture in the soil for the land to maintain its \ncurrent status and structure.\n  There is a good reason for that. The U.S. Drought Monitor indicates \nthat significant parts of the west, including Wyoming, are experiencing \nan exceptional level of drought--level D4. That's the highest rating \ngiven for the status of a drought.\n  As I noted, the effects of drought at a D4 level ripple throughout \nour communities. For instance, the drought\n\n[[Page S8398]]\n\nhas forced Wyoming's Governor Geringer to ban the use of fireworks or \ncampfires on State lands. Many of Wyoming's towns and counties have \nfollowed the Governor's lead and banned similar activities on their \ntown and county lands. These stipulations have ruined some businesses \nand forced others that rely on summer sales to go without their one \nchance to make a profit this year. It's a sacrifice, but everyone \nunderstands the reason for the ban. After all, in a region that has \nbeen plagued with fires, a single spark in an area surrounded by dry \nwood is a formula for disaster. Although everyone understands the need \nto take drastic steps to address the drought, everyone is also \nsuffering from the devastating impact of a lack of water.\n  It may be difficult for some of us to comprehend the lack of water \nout west because for so many of the fortunate citizens of the United \nStates a sufficient supply of water is no further away than the nearest \ntap or faucet. There are even States suffering from the effects of \nfloods. Wyoming, however, as is much of the west, is in desperate need \nof every drop of water we can find.\n  The best example of what the drought has meant to our tourism and \nrecreational industry is the Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area, \nwhich stretches 60 miles from the beginning of Bighorn Lake to \nYellowtail Dam in Montana.\n  Usually boaters have a choice of three ramps to use to launch their \nboats onto the lake. The lake has been dropping an average of 2 to 5 \ninches a day, so all the ramps have been closed. Since the drought \nbegan the water level has dropped at least 45 feet.\n  The reservoirs in the rest of Wyoming are in even worse condition. If \nthe drought continues, the dam at Boysen reservoir will no longer be \nable to produce electricity because the dangerously low volume of water \nmeans that there will be insufficient water pressure to spin the \nturbines and produce the electricity that the towns and people of \nWyoming depend on for the necessities of life.\n  As you can see, the drought has had an impact on just about every \naspect of life in the west especially those activities and resources we \nhave always taken for granted. With the drought, there will be no \ncampfires, no fireworks, no boating, in short, the recreational \nactivities of the spring, summer and fall are no longer permitted--or \npossible.\n  True, this is a terrible problem, but for those who have to forego a \nyear of these activities, it has been an inconvenience. For the \nagricultural community, however, the drought threatens their way of \nlife and their ability to provide for their families. For the ranchers \nand farmers, the drought threatens to destroy the land and turn once \nvaluable topsoil into dry dust that will blow away and never be \nrestored to use again. For them, and so many others, the drought has \nbeen nothing short of a disaster.\n  It's easy for me to tell you how my constituents are suffering \nbecause of the drought which has destroyed so much of the resources \nupon which they depend, but unless you hear with your own ears how bad \nthings have become, you still might not believe it.\n  Let me tell you a story about what your life would be like if you \nwere part of a typical family in Wyoming that is barely holding on from \nthe effects of 3 years of drought.\n  It's July on the ranch and you have 1,000 cow/calf pairs. Normally, \non a day like today, you would have paper and pencil in hand to \ncalculate how much you expect to make in the fall when you sell your \ncalves. Unfortunately, this is not a normal day or a typical year. For \non this day you are using your pencil and paper to calculate just how \nbad the news will be in the coming months. Your bottom line this year \nwill not reflect your margin of profit, but your margin for survival.\n  Last year you sold 1,000 calves at an average of 600 pounds for $1.07 \na pound. Your total income from your hard work came to almost $640,000. \nThat is before any expenses.\n  This year, the conditions brought about by the current drought have \nforced you to sell your calves earlier and at a lighter weight.\n  That's the bad news.\n  The worse news is that you have watched the bottom fall out of the \ncattle market this year. That means you'll be selling your cattle at a \nlower weight and at a lower price. It's a double whammy that is sure to \ndestroy you this year and leave you muttering the old baseball adage to \nyourself, Wait till next year.\n  So, you continue your calculations and note that you'll probably be \nselling 1,000 calves this year at an average of 500 pounds for only 80 \ncents a pound. That will bring you about $400,000--before you pay your \nexpenses. Thanks to the drought, your total income has already dropped \nfrom $640,000 to $400,000. Unfortunately, your expenses and your bills \nhave not taken a similar drop. In fact, they have increased--which you \ndiscover when you start working on next year's budget.\n  After a terrible sale, you realize you have to start feeding your \ncows soon. Cows come from cows--so you have to keep some. Normally, \nthis doesn't pose a problem because a rancher usually puts hay up all \nsummer to start feeding the cattle in January.\n  The drought ended that. You see, the drought stole the irrigation \nwater you would normally use to grow your crops of hay and corn on the \n1,000 acres of farmland.\n  Adding up what that will cost you comes out like this--the cost of \nbuying hay, the loss of corn production, the cost of feeding your \ncattle for four additional months, the cost of leasing additional \ngrazing land and paying full price for irrigation water even though you \nonly are getting \\1/5\\ of the water you pay for that adds up to about \n$355,000, again added expenses due to the drought.\n  Remember, our total income came to $400,000. That means, after those \nexpenses, you're left with about $45,000 to pay the normal operating \nexpenses of the ranch, pay your mortgage, pay whatever help you have \nhired, make repairs on your ranch and the equipment you need--and, oh \nyes, feed and clothe your family.\n  Ranchers have added up those numbers in just about every way you can \nimagine and come up with the same answer--they can't afford to keep \ntheir cattle. That's why the sale rings in Wyoming are full and \noverflowing--which only serves to continue to drive prices downward.\n  As you can see, the double pressures of drought and the current \ndepressed market have hit the ranchers in the West particularly hard.\n  Ranchers are usually an optimistic bunch, but this time nature offers \nthem no reprieve and little reason to hope.\n  Farmers are having the same problem, but they have something our \nranchers do not have--crop insurance.\n  Here on the Senate floor we crafted a farm bill that ensured there \nwould be help for our Nation's farmers. We fully funded the programs \nfarmers rely on and made sure they'd have a source of support when the \nmarket turned sour. Unfortunately, we didn't do the same for ranchers. \nThe rancher doesn't have a safety net to keep him propped up nor does \nhis crop, the cattle he raises, have a price safety net. This is an \ninequity that must be addressed.\n  As I listened to the heartfelt deliberations of the Senate on the \nfarm bill, I heard a plea for the provision of $360,000 a year, which \nis the current payment limitation, in assistance to farmers. As the \ndebate progressed I couldn't help but think of the ranchers who are \nstruggling to make ends meet in Wyoming and throughout the west who are \nset to receive next to nothing to help them.\n\n  It seems clear to them, and to me, and to anyone who reviews our farm \npolicy that farm bill payments were not intended to subsidize every \nacre of every farm--nor every bushel produced. They were meant to help \nthose in need and to keep family farms in business. Shouldn't that same \nlogic apply to family ranchers and ranches?\n  The American taxpayer should not be asked to keep large corporations \nor weekend hobby farmers in silk overalls and gold-plated pitchforks. \nFarm assistance was intended for and must continue to be directed at \nsmall and medium producers--family farmers who truly need help. Our \nrural communities depend on farms and the farms, in turn, depend on \ntheir communities.\n  Too many small farms are not receiving the assistance that is needed \nwhile large multi-million dollar corporations continue to receive \nFederal funds for\n\n[[Page S8399]]\n\nevery acre they take over. Payments to large corporations have nothing \nto do with good farm policy but good farm policy has everything to do \nwith family farms.\n  Even farmers have recognized the desperate circumstances that face \nour ranchers and the inequity of their situations. Recently, we heard \nfrom an Illinois farmer who had a ``heart for Wyoming.'' He wanted to \ndonate hay to help Wyoming ranchers struggling to find feed for their \nherds. Don't get me wrong, we'll be glad to get it, but it will be a \ndrop in a bucket compared to what we need--though it will be a much \nappreciated drop!\n  Just like the rancher with his pencil figuring out his budget, when \nyou add it all up, there can be only one responsible conclusion and I \nhave tried to present it in an amendment I plan on introducing later \ntoday.\n  Only by reinstating tougher payment limitations on farm bill payments \nand using the savings to offset emergency feed assistance to livestock \nproducers for drought disaster can we hope to save them, while also \nmaking a stab at fiscal responsibility.\n  Current law has set payment limitations at $360,000, but that fails \nto count the gains farmers receive when they forfeit their crop to the \nCCC and keep the loan or when they use commodity certificates. These \ngains are not considered against the $360,000 payment limitation. \nBasically, payments are still unlimited.\n  If we have learned one thing this year, it should be to avoid tricky \naccounting. My amendment would put in place real payment limits by \ncounting all gain. My amendment establishes that limit at $280,000 per \nyear. This should be an easy choice as the Senate has already voted its \nsupport of farm bill payment limitations by 61-33 on February 7 of this \nyear.\n  The reinstatement of payment limitations is directly in line with the \nproposal the administration made to the World Trade Organization to \nglobally lower trade distorting subsidies. The proposal would limit \ntrade distorting subsidies to five percent of agricultural production. \nStricter payment limitations now would decrease the impact that this \nproposal would have on our farm bill programs. As world leaders we \nshould set an example in word and deed for the rest of the world. We \nhave spoken the word with the proposal. But as we all know, actions \nspeak louder than words, so let us put our words into action today.\n  Under the terms of my legislation, a savings of at least $500 million \nfrom the strengthened payment limitations would be applied to the \nLivestock Assistance Program. The Livestock Assistance Program is \navailable to livestock producers in counties that have been declared \ndisaster areas by the President or the Secretary of Agriculture. It \nprovides minimal financial relief to livestock producers that are \nexperiencing livestock production loss due to drought and other \ndisasters--but only if there is money in the fund. The emergency \nagricultural disaster assistance amendment before us now puts money in \nthe fund and my proposed amendment would prevent that money from being \nanother addition to our national debt.\n  Once the LAP is funded, producers apply for relief and a formula \nsplits the available monies according to their needs. It assists all \nproducers who qualify, but the extent of the assistance that is \navailable is limited by the program funding and the number of \napplicants. The more applicants there are across the country, the \nsmaller the individual payment.\n  Without the assistance and provisions in my proposed amendment, \nCongress is clearly picking the winners and losers of the current \nclimate and economic conditions facing the West. This is not only \nunfair, it is unwise, too. We are continuing to slip outrageous \nbenefits to corporate farms that don't need assistance while the West \nblows away in the wind. I'm only asking for what is fair and for what \nwe should have done long ago.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the emergency agricultural disaster \nassistance amendment. If we pass this emergency amendment, the ranchers \nwho are suffering will know that they have been heard. I also urge my \ncolleagues to support my proposed amendment after this vote. If we go \non to pass my amendment, we will have made the choice to act \nresponsibly while providing desperately needed assistance. It will give \nranchers and our economy a fighting chance to survive. We owe our \nranchers and ourselves no less.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, as I said, I am one of the cosponsors \non this drought amendment. It is of critical importance to our State. \nWe are in the third year of a critical drought. Each year has gotten \nworse. There has been less rain each year. Our ranchers are suffering \nterribly. I have tried on three different occasions to get some \nlivestock assistance payments included in different bills. They have \nnot made it through conference committee. At the same time we have \ntaken care of farmers, we have provided them with payments of up to \n$360,000 each.\n  It is my intention, once this amendment is disposed of, to submit an \namendment for the body to vote on that would provide for a slight \nreduction in those assistance payments where we are subsidizing every \nacre and every bushel produced on every farm so that something, \nanything can go to ranchers. We are talking about $360,000 to farmers, \nzero to ranchers. If my amendment for livestock assistance payments \npasses, they would get approximately $8,000. Does anybody see the \ndisparity here? Ranchers need help, too. They are having to sell off \ntheir herds. When they sell off their herds, it drives the prices down. \nThey were getting $1.07 a pound. How much are you paying for beef in \nthe grocery store? It went down 80 cents a pound. It has been down to \n60 cents a pound. Your prices went up. There is a monopoly in the beef, \nbut that is another issue. We will cover that at another time.\n  We need to do something for the producers so we can keep putting food \non the table. It is a huge part of the economy. It cascades into the \nrest of the economy. When farmers and ranchers can't buy things, then \nthe merchants from whom they buy can't buy things. The economy implodes \non itself.\n  Transportation is important in this country, but food production is \nmore important. If we can't eat, we can't travel. We need to do \nsomething for the ranchers. There is a way we can do it. We absolutely \nneed to do something on drought assistance. I hope my amendment will be \naccepted to offset some of the livestock assistance payments with the \nother payments so that we are not busting the budget. The best way for \nus to improve the economy is to watch the spending. That would be a \ncross-payment.\n  I ask for Members to watch for the amendment and to support the \ndrought amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds remains to the Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask the Chair if the time of those who support the \namendment has been used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-three minutes remain on the other side.\n  Mr. BURNS. We used 23 of it?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-three minutes remain on the other side. \nNine seconds remain on the side of the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I yield to my friend from Colorado. I want \nto protect the opposition's time, understanding that we are starting to \nrun out of time totally before the vote comes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. Twenty-two \nminutes, 45 seconds remain to Senator Wellstone. The time is in the \ncontrol of Senator Wellstone.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased to give 5 minutes out of our time \nto the opponents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Can I yield 2 minutes to my friend from Colorado and allow \nhim to outline his statement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota for \nbeing willing to yield some time to my side.\n  I want to follow up on some of the comments made by my colleagues \nfrom the intermountain area, particularly the Rocky Mountain region. \nColorado is right in the center of this drought. With all the stories \nyou have heard about the States around Colorado, we are much more \naffected than anybody else.\n  This is a very unique drought. It is a more severe drought than any \nof the\n\n[[Page S8400]]\n\npeople in Colorado can ever remember. In fact, if you look at the tree \nrings up in some of the foothill areas, a study has been done which \nsuggests that maybe this drought has been the most severe drought we \nhave had since the 1700s. So we have a lot of individuals in rural \ncommunities, farmers and ranchers, suffering as a result of this \ndrought.\n  I have been working closely with the Secretary of Agriculture, Ann \nVeneman, to try to provide as much relief as we can with the program \nmoneys available. I thank the administration for being responsive, but \nwe have to do more than that. That is why I am a cosponsor on this \nparticular legislation. That is why I am pushing hard for its passage.\n  I grew up on a ranch in Walden, CO, spending my summers baling hay, \nand tending to cattle. But this year, hay is scarce and maintaining a \ncattle herd is a task of monumental proportions. I have seen the \ndevastation caused by the drought as I have traveled across the state, \nand I have come to the very serious conclusion that farmers and \nranchers, and the rural communities that depend on them, must receive \nemergency disaster assistance--before it is too late.\n  Those involved in agriculture have a strong tradition of lending \ntheir neighbor a hand when they are in need, and helping those who have \nsuffered through a major loss. When a rancher's barn burns to the \nground, you can count on farmers and ranchers throughout the county \nshowing up to help rebuild. When a death or illness prevents the \nharvest of a crop, you can bet that a dozen combines will show up to \nbring the crop in, to salvage the season in the face of loss, and to \nlend a helping hand to those in need.\n  Yet this type of kindness is not isolated to the farm or ranch--we in \nthe United States have always responded to natural disasters by \nproviding the needed emergency assistance. And providing the needed \nassistance to those who produce our food, and sustain our democracy is \nno different. Following in the great fellowship that calls Americans \ntogether during the most challenging times, I urge my colleagues to \nimmediately pass the emergency disaster amendment that is now before \nus.\n  The drought, which in some parts of my state has entered its fourth \nyear, has transformed large expanses of prairie landscapes, and scarred \nmountain slopes and valleys to the point that all four corners of the \nstate are parched beyond memory. In fact, the United States Department \nof Agriculture estimates that 93 percent of Colorado pasture is rated \nas either poor or very poor, and subsoil moisture supplies continue to \nbe rated at extremely low at 86 percent very short.\n  Responding to the drought by developing new feed programs, working \nwith Natural Resources Conservation Service field offices, funding the \nEmergency Conservation Program, and by responding quickly to the needs \nof farmers and ranchers of my state, Secretary of Agriculture Ann \nVeneman and President Bush, have provided farmers and ranchers with the \ntools to survive, and for that, I thank them both.\n  When I first urged the Secretary to release CRP ground for emergency \ngrazing and haying in May, she responded by acting much more quickly \nthan past practice dictated. In August, when I personally called the \nSecretary to urge the extension of the deadline, she responded the next \nday by extending the emergency haying and grazing deadline through \nNovember 30. Thank you, Madam Secretary, for your leadership in this \ndifficult time.\n  While the administration has provided the tools to survive up to this \npoint, the drought has now reached the point at which Congress must act \nswiftly to ensure survival beyond today.\n  I recognize that the arid climate of the west means dry weather, but \nI think that everyone would agree that this drought is anything but \nnormal. In fact, I have been told dozens of times by farmers and \nranchers--producers who have 70 plus years of experience--that this is \nthe most severe drought they have ever witnessed. I recently had the \nopportunity to discuss the drought with scientists studying tree rings \nalong Boulder Creek. They told me that only by tracing the rings back \nto the 1700's, could one find a period of comparable drought.\n  I have taken an active role in providing Coloradan's with access to \nprograms that provide the necessary emergency resources. Over the past \nmonth, I have traveled across Colorado, meeting with 600 farmers and \nranchers in Yuma, CO, coordinating meetings with dozens of producers in \nLas Animas, Alamosa, and Delta, and meeting with well over one hundred \nproducers in Pueblo, to discuss the drought and drought relief. At the \ndisaster forums, I brought together federal agencies that provide \ndrought relief with the people who need their help the most. I listened \nas farmers and ranchers--some of whom had driven nearly 300 miles to \nattend--told of their need for assistance.\n  I listened as the Colorado Commissioner of Agriculture warned that \nstate could lose as many as 50 percent of its farms because of the \ndrought, and ranchers expressed their anguish at the fact that more \nthan 1 million head of cattle--half the state's total--have already \nbeen liquidated. I listened as Larry Fillmore, a rancher north of \nBoone, CO, stood in a barren pasture that normally supports tall grass \nand cattle, and emotionally describe that the last moisture the pasture \nreceived was last October--in the form of a hail storm. Even the sage \nbrush, with roots ten feet deep, had turned brown. I listened as \nranchers told the story of mass cattle selloffs. In the proud community \nof La Junta, they are experiencing drought induced traffic jams, as a \nstreaming line of trucks hauls cattle to the sale barn. Sale volume \nrecords are falling, and one sale--just one sale--can last nearly 24 \nhours straight, running from 9 am to 6:30 am the next morning.\n  According to an article in the Denver Post, over 700,000 acres of \ndryland winter wheat, worth an estimated $120 million, has been lost \ndue to drought. Production was 38 million bushels this year, compared \nwith a 10-year annual average of 83.4 million bushels. Sunflower \nproduction, worth almost $20 million last year, was down 71 percent \nthis year, and 250,000 acres of dryland corn has completely withered \naway.\n  Perhaps the most telling story of all is that of Ed Hiza. Standing in \nthe middle of his pasture, he said that 80 percent of the cattle in a \n20 mile radius were gone, and that most of the remaining 20 percent \nwould be shipped out within a month. Mr. Hiza made it clear about what \nthe drought means for him, and many of his neighbors, ``We've endured a \nlot of hardship in this county, and this drought is just the nail in \nour coffin.'' This story is recounted in the Pueblo Chieftan.\n  For those who do not believe that the drought is indeed that severe, \nI hope that they will pay attention to the following statistics, and \nkeep in mind that Colorado is the source of water for many downstream \nStates. According to the Colorado Department of Natural Resources, the \nSouth Platte River flows now hover at 13% of average, and Arkansas \nRiver streamflows are at record lows. In the San Luis Valley, many \ndomestic wells have stopped flowing. Citizens are seeking assistance \nfrom Federal and State agencies for redrilling wells. The San Luis \nValley aquifer has been drawn down to the lowest level ever recorded. \nOn the Rio Grande, the flow is 6% of normal. Without using the flows \nthat are normally dedicated to a wildlife refuge, the Rio Grande would \nprobably be dry at the stateline. Many streams are dry and many more \nmay go dry. On the Gunnison River, streamflows are near record lows. \nCalls on the river are occurring that have not been placed since the \nconstruction of one million acre feet of storage--the Aspinall Unit \nreservoirs--upstream. In the Colorado River Basin, reservoir supplies \nare bleak. Active storage in Grandby Reservoir is less than 1/5 of \ncapacity. Dillon will have 75,000 acre feet out of 252,000 acre feet. \nWilliams Fork will be at its dead pool. Wolford Mountain Reservoir will \nhave 19,000 acre feet and Reudi Reservoir will have 35,000 acre feet of \nits 120,000 acre feet capacity.\n  In the Yampa, White and North Platte basins, many reservoirs are \nempty save for their dead pool storage. Streamflows are well below \nnormal. In the San Juan and Dolores Basins, all irrigation reservoirs \nare expected to be emptied. The San Juan is flowing at 3% of normal, \nand the Animas River is flowing at 14% of normal.\n  In short, the need for relief is real. Although there is no \nlegislative cure\n\n[[Page S8401]]\n\nfor a lack of moisture, we can help ease the economic hemorrhaging \ncaused by the drought. As we search for new alternatives that will \nprovide drought relief to communities and businesses, I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of this amendment, and support those who \nhave suffered from natural disaster.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the following information in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Denver Post, Sept. 7, 2002]\n\n                       Senate Should OK Farm Bill\n\n       A prediction that Colorado will lose 20 to 50 percent of \n     its farms and ranches over the next year underscores the \n     importance of a bill in the U.S. Senate that will give cash \n     and low-interest loans to help keep farms from shutting down \n     their operations.\n       The bill, a $5 billion drought emergency package, is co-\n     sponsored by Sen. Wayne Allard, a Loveland Republican. It is \n     expected to pass the Senate on Monday. We urge swift passage \n     of this measure that provides money for farms in dire need.\n       Not only would the emergency package provide low-interest \n     loans for Colorado farmers and ranchers severely affected by \n     drought conditions, it also provides cash grants for those \n     who are too deep in debt to qualify for other government-\n     subsidized loans.\n       Colorado's agricultural income stands to drop by one-half \n     due to the drought. Production is already so far down this \n     year that large dairy farms are losing thousands of dollars a \n     month, hundreds of thousands of acres of produce have died \n     and the prices paid to farmers for their products are \n     decreasing.\n       Because the state has received federal drought designation, \n     farmers also may qualify for federal loans. But many Colorado \n     farms and ranches can't qualify for federal funding. \n     Therefore, state loans and grants are of paramount importance \n     during this extremely dry year.\n       What is frightening is that if the state's snowfall doesn't \n     increase significantly this winter, the situation is going to \n     be even worse next year.\n       The whole disturbing situation also makes a strong case for \n     enhanced water storage systems during wet years.\n       While the government passes a measure to pump more cash \n     into agriculture, we also must look at being more aggressive \n     in planning for the state's future water needs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Denver Post, Sept. 6, 2002]\n\n             Senate Bill Seeks Cash for Farmers in Drought\n\n\n        Officials fear state will lose 20%-50% of farms in year\n\n                           (By Kit Miniclier)\n\n       Cash and loans would be available to farmers in Colorado \n     and the rest of the country hit hard by drought under a $5 \n     billion drought emergency package co-sponsored by U.S. Sen. \n     Wayne Allard, R-Colo.\n       Low-interest loans aren't enough help for farmers whose \n     worth shrank during the drought, agriculture officials say.\n       They predict Colorado will lose from 20 to 50 percent of \n     its farms and ranches over the next year.\n       The measure, which Allard predicted would win Senate \n     approval Monday, provides loans. It also offers cash grants \n     for those who can't qualify for low-interest federal loans, \n     he said.\n       ``This is the worst drought in Colorado history,'' probably \n     going back to the 1700s, said Allard, the only veterinarian \n     in the Senate.\n       Agriculture, which consumes about 85 percent of Colorado's \n     water, earns about $5 billion as the produce leaves the farm \n     or ranch, ``and you can add another $12 billion at retail,'' \n     said Don Ament, a veteran farmer, state lawmaker and \n     Colorado's commissioner of agriculture.\n       Dead and dying crops are expected to cut Colorado farm \n     income by at least half this year, Ament warned Gov. Bill \n     Owens this week.\n       Although a statewide federal drought designation earlier \n     this year cleared the way for low-interest federal loans, \n     many farmers and ranchers aren't eligible because they are \n     already deeply in debt.\n       ``A catastrophic impact on agriculture and rural businesses \n     can be expected'' this fall because of this loss of crops and \n     income, according to a report compiled for Owens.\n       If Colorado doesn't get a substantial snowpack this winter, \n     ``the situation will be tenfold worse by this time next \n     year,'' Ament added.\n       That's because there was water in the reservoirs this year, \n     but many are dry now.\n       The state could increase its water storage by 150,000 acre-\n     feet by simply repairing existing dams, according to Greg \n     Walcher, executive director of the Colorado Department of \n     Natural Resources.\n       There is a consensus--for this first time in two \n     generations--to store water for bad years, Walcher added.\n       Colorado's drought-related losses reportedly include:\n       More than 1 million cattle--half the state's total, \n     including breeder stock for hundreds of farms--sold \n     prematurely.\n       Big dairy farms losing $15,000 to $20,000 a month because \n     of low milk prices and rising feed prices.\n       700,000 acres of dryland winter wheat worth an estimated \n     $120 million died. Production was 38 million bushels, \n     compared with a 10-year annual average of 83.4 million \n     bushels.\n       Sunflower production worth almost $20 million last year, \n     was down 71 percent this year.\n       This year's 250,000 acres of dryland corn dried up before \n     it could be harvested. Last year's crop was worth $34 \n     million.\n       Sorghum for grain, which grossed about $17 million last \n     year, is down by at least 25 percent this year.\n       ``You know you've got real trouble when you drive by a \n     reservoir and dirt storms are blowing out of the lake \n     bottom,'' said Ament, who had recently driven past Barr Lake \n     State Park northeast of Denver.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Pueblo Chieftain, Aug. 24, 2002]\n\n                  Rancher's Lament: ``Feed and Worry''\n\n                            (By Margie Wood)\n\n       With decent rain, the sandy soil on Larry Fillmore's ranch \n     north of Boone would support waist-high grass and a cattle \n     herd--and a way of life that has kept his family on the land \n     for four generations.\n       This year, a portion that's in the Conservation Reserve \n     Program is covered by a gray tangle of grass that saw its \n     last moisture in the form of hail last October. And that was \n     better than a 40-acre plot across the road, where two horses \n     and a congregation of prairie dogs have eaten pretty much \n     everything in sight.\n       ``I'm ashamed of this part,'' Fillmore told visitors on a \n     drought tour sponsored by the Colorado Association of \n     Conservation Districts on Friday. ``I thought it would rain \n     someday.''\n       But it didn't rain until a little bit of moisture fell \n     Thursday night. By that time, Fillmore had sent most of his \n     cattle to Oklahoma. He still has some stock in mountain \n     meadows and is worrying about what to do with them in October \n     when they have to be moved.\n       ``I was still feeding (rather than having grass for the \n     cattle to graze on) the 15th of July,'' he said. ``We did two \n     things all spring and summer: feed and worry. And that took \n     up all day and all night.''\n       His neighbor, J.D. Wright, has a stocker cattle operation \n     nearby, meaning he buys calves in the fall, feeds them in \n     through the winter and grazes them in the summer before \n     taking them to sell. This year, there was so little grass he \n     sold them early and figures he lost about $10 a head.\n       Now, after witnessing 11 lightning fires that burned \n     thousands of acres in the area, Wright looks at a CRP field \n     and sees a lot of fuel.\n       He agreed with Randy Loutzenhiser of Flagler, President of \n     the state association of conservation districts, that the CRP \n     land should be used periodically, maybe every third or fourth \n     year, to keep it healthy and reduce the fuel load.\n       The CRP program is run by the Natural Resources \n     Conservation Services, and this year the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture did make some allowances for grazing and haying \n     on CRP land because of the drought. But there was a penalty \n     involved, and Fillmore opted not to pay the price to move \n     cattle onto his CRP land.\n       As the tour moved farther north in the Olney-Boone \n     Conservation District, district conservationist Dave Miller \n     of the NRCS pointed out a green field that had 4 to 4\\1/2\\ \n     inches of rain this year, with grass about 8 inches tall.\n       Another field had a fire followed by rain in the same \n     lightning storm, so the grass recovered somewhat. Yet another \n     had a lightning fire with no rain, and the soil already is \n     beginning to blow, Miller noted. ``We're hoping somehow it \n     will get some grass on it. The only other thing to keep it \n     from blowing would be deep chiseling--and I mean 30 inches \n     deep.''\n       In some areas, even sagebrush looked brown and dead. \n     ``Those plants may have roots 10 feet deep,'' Miller said. \n     ``Still, there's no water for them.''\n       But the worst sight on the tour was a field that has been \n     farmed in a beans-milo rotation. The ground was tilled in the \n     spring, exposing the roots.\n       ``He planted a crop but there was no rain, no crop,'' \n     Miller said--and all the silt with its nutrients has blown \n     away, leaving a stretch of pale sand unbroken by one green \n     shoot.\n       A few miles away, rancher Ed Hiza said 80 percent of the \n     cattle in a 20-mile radius are gone. He expects to ship the \n     rest of his cattle out within a month, saying ``I can't feed \n     them for nine more months, and that's the earliest I can see \n     growing anything to feed them.\n       ``We've endured a lot of hardship in this county, and this \n     drought is just the nail in our coffin,'' he said. \n     ``Economically we find a lot of excuses about world markets \n     and that, but the situation is that I could be forced off \n     this ranch in the next few years.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Pueblo Chieftain, Aug. 24, 2002]\n\n           Allard: Drought More Serious in Southern Colorado\n\n                            (By Margie Wood)\n\n       U.S. Sen.

I hate to be so negative, \n     but we're here to help you survive.''\n       Their audience ranged from John Stencel of the Rocky \n     Mountain Farmers Union to a sheep rancher from Montrose to \n     several Las Animas County ranchers.\n       ``We're about four years into this drought in Las Animas \n     County,'' said Gary Hill. ``It is kinda funny that it didn't \n     really get to be a drought until our city cousins couldn't \n     water their lawns.''\n       Stencel also spoke of the ``quiet tragedy'' of drought, and \n     said it will take the state agricultural producers years to \n     dig out.\n       Allard's staff conducted a similar meeting in Alamosa on \n     Thursday.\n       Farmer Ray Wright, who heads the Rio Grande Water \n     Conservation District and is a member of the Colorado Water \n     Conservation Board, said the area is in a water deficit and \n     an overdraft on the water supply will continue.\n       Alamosa businessman Leroy Martinez said part of the problem \n     is that the traditional farming area has been expanded to the \n     point where it can't be supplied with water.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, will the Senator from Minnesota yield to \nthe senior Senator from Wyoming for his statement?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am pleased to yield.\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield 2 minutes to the senior Senator from Wyoming, Mr. \nThomas.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I spoke some about this yesterday on the \nfloor in terms of it being part of the Interior bill. Certainly I \nsupport this amendment. This is the only way we have to relieve the \nkinds of economic disasters that have occurred in the West and over the \ncountry, as a matter of fact.\n  One of the issues is going to be how this is administered and how it \nis divided. Certainly, often you read about so much an acre for the \ncrops and so on. I want to make the point again, this is also for \nlivestock. This is for cattle, sheep, for the people who have not had \ngrazing either on their own lands or on the lands that are leased. As \nwe look at this, agriculture includes livestock. We need to make sure \nthat is the case and that the distribution be made fairly throughout.\n  I appreciate very much the opportunity for us to actually do \nsomething. Hopefully, the expenditures, even though not a formal \noffset, will be offset actually by the reduction in costs in the farm \nbill, and this makes it a little more practical in terms of the \nfinances.\n  I am supportive of the bill and hope we can move forward with the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will just take 1 minute for an \nobservation, if I may.\n  I say to the Senator from Wyoming, this does include livestock \nproducers, and it is extremely important. In our State, we are talking \nabout livestock producers, but we are also talking about wheatgrowers, \nsoybeans, all of the damage to the crops.\n  I thank colleagues on both sides of the aisle for coming out here, \nRepublicans and Democrats, West and Midwest, and also Senators from the \neast coast who have not sustained this kind of damage but are willing \nto lend their support, knowing full well that if they need help they \nwill get help from the rest of us.\n\n  This is sort of a definition of community and helping people, and I \nam so pleased to see the strong bipartisan support. I really believe if \nwe get a huge vote, we have an excellent chance of getting help to \npeople.\n  As a Senator from Minnesota, I am so pleased with the way this \ndiscussion is going and I thank my colleagues from both sides of the \naisle for their support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Missouri.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized for 3 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I strongly support this relief package \nfor family farmers needing immediate disaster relief in order to stay \non their land.\n  Let me cite a few numbers to underscore the extent of the problem in \nMissouri. Just yesterday, the USDA rated 58 percent of Missouri's \npastureland in poor or very poor condition; 53 percent of Missouri's \ncorn is in poor or very poor condition; 49 percent of Missouri's \nsoybeans are in poor or very poor condition. Though any additional \nrainfall would be welcomed, it will only be of limited assistance.\n  Much of the damage I cited is on land that was hit last year by an \narmy worm infestation of record proportion. Many farmers are facing 2 \nyears of devastation because of these unprecedented natural disasters. \nThis legislation would provide real relief for crop and livestock \nlosses over the past 2 years. Much of the damage to the crops and \npastureland is irreversible. Just as we help the victims of floods, \nwildfires, and other natural disasters, so we must come to the aid of \nfarmers victimized by Mother Nature.\n  Several weeks ago, I expressed my disappointment to the \nadministration for declaring that drought relief must be offset by cuts \nto programs funded in the new farm bill. Such cuts would undermine the \nfarm bill's safety net that we put into place only a few months ago. \nThis safety net is key to farmers, bankers, and others who must make \nlong-term planning decisions.\n  Tampering with the safety net would send a message to our farmers \nthat the farm bill is not something on which they can rely. In essence, \nthe administration is proposing to rob Peter to pay Paul. This stance \nis particularly troubling when recent USDA reports show farm income \ndecreasing by 23 percent this year. That is a $10.5 billion decrease in \nnet farm income. It is the wrong position. It is wrong for our farmers, \nand it is wrong for our communities that rely on an agricultural \neconomy.\n  Missouri ranks second nationally for the number of farms within a \nState. Agriculture is a large part of Missouri's economic lifeline. \nHistorically, what is good for our farmers is good for America, and I \nurge my colleagues to support our farmers by providing disaster relief \nthat keeps the safety net intact.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask my colleague if I may have 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 13\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BURNS. That would be fine.\n\n[[Page S8403]]\n\n  I say to my friend from Montana, I am trying to protect those who \noppose, but I have no problem with yielding 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nMontana, Senator Burns, for cosponsoring this amendment with me. I \ndeeply appreciate his work.\n  I point out this is truly a bipartisan effort to get agricultural and \ndisaster assistance payments to farmers and ranchers across our \ncountry. This is not a partisan matter. This is a nonpartisan matter. \nDrought does not know whether a farmer is a Republican, a Democrat, an \nIndependent, or whatever political affiliation he or she may have. \nDrought hits everybody relentlessly. It is clear that these last \nseveral years it has hurt a lot of farmers.\n  This amendment we are attempting to pass will help farmers across our \ncountry.\n  I also thank the numerous agricultural organizations that have \ndemonstrated their support for the amendment by making an endless \nnumber of phone calls, writing letters, and tirelessly raising the need \nfor agricultural assistance in the Halls of the Congress.\n  Drought brings the producers to their knees, not only poor producers \nbut the best producers. The crisis in our agricultural community has \nabsolutely nothing to do with poor planning. I want to make that very \nclear. In fact, the farm bill has nothing to do with agricultural \ndisaster assistance. The farm bill we passed has to do with farmers \ngenerally. If and when disaster hits, and if it is persistent over \nseveral years, then there is no choice but to fold up one's tent, \nleave, or cut back dramatically in a way that hurts not only the farmer \nbut the rest of the community.\n  According to the New York Times on May 3, 2002--not too many months \nago--let me quote an article in that newspaper:\n\n       In eastern Montana, more than a thousand wheat farmers have \n     called it quits rather than try to coax another crop out of \n     the ground that has received less rain over the last 12 \n     months than many deserts get in a year.\n\n  We today have the opportunity to help mitigate these drought \nconditions and keep our producers on the land. After consecutive years, \ndrought harms not only producers but entire communities. I would like \nto share the words of Montana farmer Dan Debuff to illustrate the \nimpacts of drought on his community of Shawmut:\n\n       Our local John Deere dealer had sold seven combines last \n     year at this time. This year he hasn't sold one. School \n     enrollments are down 30 percent from 5 years ago and are \n     still declining.\n\n  Remember, this drought has been going on for 4 or 5 years.\n\n       Gross revenues for the local grain elevator and fertilizer \n     plant have declined 33 percent from 2 years ago and they have \n     eliminated two full-time jobs. The large elevator and \n     fertilizer plant have cut 9 full-time jobs out of a total of \n     25.\n\n  The letter goes on to describe the adverse effects the drought has \nnot only on farmers individually but also on communities.\n  I have a chart which shows the effect of the drought now in America. \nIt covers almost the entire West. If one draws a line a little bit west \nof the 100th meridian, almost all of America west of that line is in \ndrought. The chart shows by color the worst conditions. The red and \norange are the worst, and that is almost all of the western United \nStates. In fact, it is almost half of the geographic United States of \nAmerica.\n  Without our help, without passing natural disaster assistance today, \nwe will change the future of rural America forever. A large percentage \nof our hard-working producers will lose their land, lose their homes, \ntheir jobs, and their way of life. They will not be purchasing clothes, \nseed, fertilizer, or equipment in their local stores. They are going to \nhave to move, take their kids out of school, go some place else, and \ntry to make a go of it.\n  We now have the opportunity to do something about that. A vote for \nthis amendment is a vote for America's family farmers and ranchers to \nprovide us with a safe domestic food supply. A vote for this amendment \nis a vote for the future of rural America. A vote for this amendment is \na vote for fulfilling our responsibility as a country to protect our \ncitizens from natural disaster.\n  Rural America is resilient. Like them, I am not going to give up. We \nare going to keep trying until we get the disaster assistance we need. \nWe give disaster assistance to people in the country for earthquakes, \nfor floods, and for hurricanes. It only makes sense that we should give \ndisaster assistance for our farmers.\n  I voted for disaster assistance for Americans for flood insurance, \nfor hurricanes, and for earthquake disasters. I voted for those because \nit was the right thing to do, the American thing to do. It is also the \nAmerican thing to do to help our farmers and ranchers.\n  I also ask the President to reconsider. I support the President many \ntimes and do not support him other times. This is one time I am asking \nthe President to reconsider his opposition because our American farmers \nneed all of America to help give them the assistance they need.\n  I very much thank the Chair and thank my colleague from Montana and \nthank the Parliamentarian. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to express my support for an \namendment that is being offered by the distinguished majority leader. I \nam a cosponsor of this amendment, originally proposed as a bill by \nSenator Baucus which I also cosponsored. It now provides much needed \nassistance to our Nation's farmers.\n  While farmers across the country have faced tremendous losses during \nthe past 2 years, those in my home State of Michigan have been among \nthose who have suffered the most. Dramatic shifts in weather conditions \nthroughout the growing season have devastated crops across the State. \nSome farmers faced early warm temperatures followed by freezing \nconditions while others saw torrential rains early in the growing \nseason followed by long droughts; still others have faced drought \nconditions at the beginning of the crop year and heavy rains at harvest \ntime.\n  These conditions have devastated many of Michigan's prime crops. This \nyear, cherry farmers in Michigan lost upwards of 90 percent of their \ncrops, a level that threatens to devastate Michigan and the Nation's \ncherry industry give that Michigan produces over 70 percent of the tart \ncherries in the Nation. Additionally, 80 percent of Michigan's apple \nfarmers have lost upwards of 40 percent of their crop.\n  Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to visit with cherry growers \nin Michigan and listen to them as they told me how this year's crop \nlosses were the worst on record. In addition, approximately 25 percent \nof apple growers in Michigan and across the Nation are in danger of \ngoing out of business in the next 2 years, and in Michigan that means \nthat our cherry, peach, and asparagus crops, which are often grown on \nthe same orchards, will be greatly decreased.\n  This year, USDA Secretary Ann Veneman recognized the atypical weather \nconditions that affected Michigan by designating 50 of the State's \ncounties as disaster areas. Making matters worse, all of these counties \nwere similarly designated last year, when Secretary Veneman designated \n82 of Michigan's 83 counties as official disaster areas. While \nMichigan's farmers are some of the most innovative in the Nation, 2 \nyears of statewide crop failure have threatened the continued viability \nof agriculture in Michigan.\n  No one, least of all America's farmers, likes the fact that emergency \nagricultural supplementals have seemingly become routine. However, we \nmust provide this assistance for without it many of our Nation's \nfarmers will cease to be able to continue farming. I thank the Senator \nfrom South Dakota and the Senator from Montana for their efforts in \ndrafting, supporting, and helping to pass this amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment to \nprovide disaster assistance for our Nation's farmers and ranchers. Over \nthe last several years, Congress has acted responsibly to provide help \nto those producers whose operations have been adversely affected by bad \nweather. I see no reason why this year should be different. This \nsituation truly exemplifies an emergency in every sense of the word, \nand should not force us to deplete the long-term resources provided\n\n[[Page S8404]]\n\nby this year's farm bill in order to meet these short-term needs.\n  Already, this has been a devastating crop year for producers across \nthe country. In the most recent assessment issued by the National \nWeather Service, nearly every State west of the Missouri River faces \nsignificant crop losses as a result of severe to exceptional drought \nconditions. A second region of the Eastern United States which includes \nmost States in a block from Georgia northward to Maine and westward to \nOhio is facing a similar situation. For many States, particularly in \nthe West, this is only the latest in a series of droughts.\n  We have only begun to assess the magnitude of this year's disaster \nfor agricultural producers. From late July, press reports cite losses \nin the Plains States of $822 million in South Dakota, $687 million in \nNebraska, and $267 million in Minnesota from both drought and flooding. \nWith little appreciable rain during August in most drought-stricken \nregions, it is likely that losses have increased since those estimates \nwere made. We have serious drought in southwest Iowa, and also \nexperienced uncompensated 2001 losses in Iowa, mostly from prevented \nplantings.\n  Other regions have also been hit. In Michigan, harsh spring weather \ncaused USDA to declare 50 counties agricultural disaster areas, \nparticularly affecting the cherry and grape crops. Hordes of \ngrasshoppers are eating their way through pastures and fields in the \nRocky Mountain West, including Colorado and Idaho. Rampant disease \nthreatens Georgia and North Carolina crops. In mid-August, Maryland's \nGovernor sought a disaster designation for all but two counties in his \nState.\n  As a result of field surveys in late July, USDA is now predicting the \nsmallest U.S. corn crop since 1995, at less than 9 billion bushels, and \nthe smallest wheat crop since 1972, driven both by poor yields and \nreduced acreage. Although some farmers will benefit from the increased \nprices, those farmers with little or no crop to harvest will not. \nWestern cattle producers, who have seen their pastures burn up in the \nunrelenting heat, face a choice of either buying hay on the market or \nselling their animals into a depressed market. There are currently no \nprograms to assist these producers.\n  It is true that many row crop farmers have crop insurance policies, \nwhich will offer them some relief, but the gravity of this situation \ndemands further Federal action. These producers are facing the loss of \ntheir crops in the wake of several years of low commodity prices, thus \npushing them deeper into a financial hole.\n  With higher crop prices now projected by USDA for the 2002 crop year, \nit is clear that farm program spending will be lower than was \noriginally predicted by the Congressional Budget Office. It was \nestimated recently by CBO that the difference could amount to $5.6 \nbillion in LDP's and countercylical payments that will not now be made \ncompared to the August baseline. That difference would exceed $6 \nbillion when compared to earlier estimates of the farm bill's cost.\n  Floods and drought have been particularly hard this year not only on \nproducers' bottom lines, but also on our soil, water, and wildlife \nresources. Unfortunately, the money needed to take care of our \nresources under the Emergency Watershed Protection Program wasn't \nincluded in this package. I intend to pursue adding the money needed \nfor drought and flood relief through this program in conference, and \nhope that we will be able to address these needs in the final \nconference report.\n  I fear that unwillingness to act on this amendment could push many \nfarmers to the brink of failure, and hasten the erosion of rural \ncommunities and small towns. If we truly want to assure economic \nsecurity to our nation, then we must start with its backbone, our farm \nfamilies and the rural economy they support.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the text of the letter \nsent to the Senate leadership yesterday by Agriculture Secretary \nVeneman, reiterating the President's opposition to disaster relief \nlegislation for which the cost is not offset by cuts in the 2002 farm \nbill. I am disappointed that the letter was sent. I hope that we will \nbe able to bring the White House and the House of Representatives \naround to the realization that assistance is critically needed and that \nit cannot be funded by taking assistance out of the farm bill and away \nfrom other producers.\n\n\n                                 The Secretary of Agriculture,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 2002.\n     Hon. Thomas Daschle,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Trent Lott,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Daschle and Lott: We appreciate your efforts \n     to help farmers and ranchers who are suffering as a result of \n     the 2002 drought. As you know, the Administration continues \n     to take all action allowable under current law to assist \n     struggling farmers and ranchers. This includes expediting \n     emergency declarations and making emergency loans available \n     to producers, the recent release of CCC-owned milk powder in \n     order to provide a low cost feed supplement for cow and calf \n     operations, and the opening of all CRP lands nationwide for \n     haying and grazing. The President has consistently stated his \n     support for additional drought relief provided it does not \n     increase the deficit.\n       The Congress has already provided the tools for drought \n     relief for crop farmers through the heavily subsidized \n     Federal Crop Insurance Program. The crop insurance subsidy \n     was increased dramatically in 2000 to avoid the need for \n     disaster payments. The vast majority of the crop acreage in \n     the drought regions is covered by crop insurance. Over \n     seventy percent of the acreage in the U.S. is covered and \n     over eighty percent in South Dakota. Our goal should be to \n     maximize participation in this program. Additionally, we \n     recognize that ranchers and livestock producers who have been \n     severely impacted by this drought do not benefit from the \n     same risk management tools available to other farmers.\n       The recently enacted Farm Bill provides $180 billion, an \n     increase of $82 billion above the baseline. This $180 billion \n     can accommodate funding for emergencies, economic assistance, \n     rural development, and other purposes. One of the greatest \n     benefits of the Farm Bill is that it ensures farmers have the \n     resources they need. On May 24, Senator Daschle defended the \n     farm bill spending levels, stating ``we're getting rid of \n     those ad hoc disaster payment approaches''. The farm bill \n     should break the bad fiscal habit of needing to pass \n     emergency agriculture spending bills including drought, \n     flood, or other supplemental payments that make it difficult \n     for Congress to live within its budget.\n       We support providing immediate assistance to those who \n     don't have access to risk management tools, encouraging \n     greater participation in the crop insurance program and \n     providing relief within the resources of the current farm \n     bill. If legislation consistent with this approach were to be \n     presented to the President, we would advise his support.\n       In the Senate, an amendment has been offered to the \n     Interior Appropriations bill that would reestablish emergency \n     payment programs for farmers and ranchers similar to those \n     used for the 2000 crop year. We understand the cost of this \n     amendment is likely to approach $6 billion.\n       The Administration strongly opposes this amendment and any \n     agriculture spending in excess of the $180 billion in \n     spending provided earlier this year. This proposal would add \n     $6 billion on top of the already generous Farm Bill only a \n     few months after the bill was enacted. This is unacceptable. \n     The needs for the current drought must be met within the \n     additional resources provided for in the Farm Bill.\n       We hope this information gives you the guidance you need in \n     order to consider a prudent and fiscally responsible drought \n     assistance package. I look forward to working closely with \n     you through this process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Ann M. Veneman.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to state my \nreasons for voting for the amendment offered to provide $5.9 billion in \nemergency relief to farmers due to flooding, drought and other natural \ndisasters because I am concerned that numerous farmers across the \nUnited States and Pennsylvania may lose their livelihoods.\n  The Pennsylvania agricultural community has been particularly hard \nhit by natural disasters in recent years. On September 3, 2002, \nPennsylvania Governor Mark Schweiker requested a Natural Disaster \nDetermination from the United States Department of Agriculture on \nbehalf of 54 of Pennsylvania's 67 counties that are suffering due to \nthis drought. These counties have been and continue to be under a \ndrought warning or drought emergency. Due to these adverse weather \nconditions, Pennsylvania farmers have and will experience significant \ncrop damage resulting in reduced harvests. The losses to these counties \nare projected at over $321 million in Pennsylvania. I am informed that \nsituations similar to this are occurring across the United States. The \nfunding in this amendment will provide $5.9 billion in relief for \nfarmers for the 2001 and 2002 crop years.\n  During consideration of the 2002 farm bill, I opposed the \noverwhelming costs\n\n[[Page S8405]]\n\nthat came as a result of the House and Senate Conference, an increase \nof $10 billion over the levels passed by the Senate and the House. \nHowever, funds are now warranted to combat continued natural disasters \nthat have become an acute problem for farmers in Pennsylvania and \nacross the Nation.\n  The loss of crops that have come with these natural disasters have \nleft grain farmers with a low yield. This low yield not only effects \nfarmers producing grain but those who must use grain and account for \nthe increased cost of production. The rising costs of grain to dairy \nfarmers has created an intolerable situation where the costs of \nproducing are increasing without the already low price of milk rising \nat a corresponding level. The addition of these increased costs to \nproduction is too much to be shouldered by the hardworking farmers of \nPennsylvania and America.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about the \nproposed drought relief package that I have cosponsored and to urge my \ncolleagues to throw their full support behind this very important \nmeasure. Utah is in its fourth consecutive year of drought, and our \nfarmers and ranchers have been hit particularly hard this season. If \nthis body does not act now to alleviate some of the damage wreaked by \nthis latest year of drought, many more farmers and ranchers will be \nforced to sell off their assets completely, as some have already done.\n  At this time, adequate feed and forage is simply not available for \nlivestock producers in Utah. About 70 percent of Utah agriculture is in \nthe livestock industry, and ranchers rely heavily on public grazing. \nHowever, in drought years many ranchers are kicked off public lands by \nthe BLM and Forest Service in an effort to preserve the existing \nforage. Let me provide an example of how our ranchers have been \naffected by the drought and resulting expulsion from public grazing. \nAlarik Myrin is a rancher who I know from Duchesne County, Utah. Alarik \nhas 600 head of cattle and each year relies on public lands to provide \n500 of them with forage. Like many others in my state, he was forced \noff public lands and was not able to graze those 500 head even one day \nthis year. This was a devastating blow in a drought year, because the \nmeager harvest in the West has created a dramatic shortage of feed. \nWhile Alarik did receive a small alfalfa harvest on his private land, \nhe was still forced to sell off 300 of his breeding cows along with \ntheir calves just to cut his losses. It is important to understand \nthat, like most ranchers, Alarik Myrin makes his living from selling \ncalves. Being forced to liquidate his producing cows without a profit \nwas, in Mr. Myrin's words, like ``selling the factory,'' and he is now \nleft without the resources to purchase a new herd for the next season.\n  In a normal rainfall year, adequate runoff from Utah's snowpack would \nhelp to offset drought conditions. However, this year, the lack of \nsnowpack has combined with almost no precipitation and Utah's largest \ncricket infestation ever documented to make for an extremely difficult \nyear for agriculture.\n  Utah has some of the toughest ranchers I know but some have literally \nbeen brought to tears by the hardships they are facing this year. Some \nof these families have been farming and ranching since before Utah was \na state, and they know how to succeed in difficult conditions. But a \nfourth year of drought of this severity is too much to overcome.\n  One more example of the extreme nature of this year's drought is \nbrought to light at the Salina Cattle Auction in Utah. Normally, this \nauction sees 500 head sold in the entire month of July. This year, \nhowever, the auction saw an average of 2,700 head sold per week in \nJuly. Ranchers are liquidating their cows often at less than half the \naverage price. For too many, the result is complete bankruptcy.\n  I have gone into some detail regarding the difficulties of Utah \nlivestock producers, but crop losses for our farmers have been just as \nsevere. For instance, much of Utah fruit crop this year has been \ncompletely ruined. The lack of precipitation and ground water has \nresulted in unseasonable frosts that have wiped out many of our \norchards. Across the board, we are losing key elements of our \nagriculture sector in the West. Mr. President, if we want to be a \nnation that feeds itself, we must take action to allow our producers to \nsurvive this long drought and live to produce next season.\n  I urge my colleagues to recognize the importance of this drought \nrelief package. I believe it will help to rebuild an agriculture \nindustry that is in dire need of assistance. It will take several years \nto recover for many of our producers, but this package will help \nrebuild herds and allow many farmers and ranchers to continue to \nprovide our nation with the invaluable resources we rely on. Again, I \nurge my colleagues to support farmers and ranchers across the country \nby voting in favor of this measure.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                          Crop Disaster Relief\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I would like to recognize Mr. Daschle \nfor his efforts and concern for the farmers, growers, and ranchers of \nthis nation. His leadership on providing financial assistance to these \nfarmers who have been stricken by the wrath of Mother Nature is to be \ncommended.\n  Mr. President, my colleague from New York, Senator Schumer, and I \nwould like to engage Senator Daschle in a colloquy.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank my colleague for her kind remarks, and would be \nhappy to engage in a colloquy with the Senators from New York State.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, spring freezes, frosts, and excessive \nrains have caused severe and permanent damage to specialty crops, such \nas apples, peaches, pears, grapes (including labrusca grapes), \nstrawberries, stone fruits, onions and cherries in New York State. This \ndamage will not only cause a major financial hardship for the farms, \nbut as my friend from South Dakota has already mentioned, the impact \nwill spread throughout the economy of rural communities that depend so \nheavily on the prosperity of their farms.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, these weather conditions have wreaked \nhavoc on an industry vital to New York State. As their trees now stand, \ngreen leaves and no fruit, it is feared that a large percentage of \nthese fruit farmers will be forced out of business. It is crucial that \nthese farmers receive assistance along with the farmers and ranchers of \nthe rest of the country who have suffered the devastating effects of \ndrought.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this season's farm losses only continue a \nstring of bad luck during the past few years. Last year, New York grape \nfarmers suffered losses of approximately $7 million due to poor fruit \nset. This year, the losses are expected to be even greater--over $10 \nmillion lost because of adverse weather conditions.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, this year has been the worst year in \nmemory for many specialty crop farmers. In New York's Hudson Valley \nregion, losses on specialty fruit crops total $65 million for 2002 \nalone. For the communities and the fruit growers in the region, crop \ndisaster relief is much needed to sustain our farms through this \ndifficult time.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I appreciate the remarks of the Senators of New York, \nand assure them that we intend for specialty crop producers, including \nproducers of the crops mentioned by my colleague from New York, to \nreceive disaster assistance under this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the time has actually expired, has it not?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Just under 6 minutes remain for the opponents.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S8406]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask the leader of the Senate if I may \nspeak for 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am happy to yield time from the \nleader's allocation, if we are out of time.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will maybe not even take that long.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the effects of a \nnatural disaster that lingers across most of the West--drought. There \nis not a segment of the New Mexico population that will not be touched \nin some way, some form, or fashion by drought this year.\n  People in other parts of the country have turned on their television \nsets over the past few weeks and have seen the blazes of catastrophic \nwildfires that are again devastating the western United states. This \nmay be the only effect of the drought that many are aware of. Let me \ntell you, the devastation is even more profound.\n  Ranchers, including ranchers on the Navajo Nation, are being forced \nto sell off livestock because they can't find enough water for them and \ncan't afford the significant feed costs.\n  Other agricultural businesses are being forced to shut their doors \nbecause the agriculture sector as a whole is hurting. But this is not \njust a problem for the agricultural community.\n  Most of the national forests in New Mexico were closed to the public. \nThis resulted in a decrease in tourism.\n  Let me mention a couple of specific examples. First of all, there is \na small railroad, the historic Cumbres and Toltec Railroad, that takes \npeople through a very beautiful part of the State. The railroad \ncontributes to the tourism and economic stability of a very poor part \nof the State. That railroad was forced to close because it was so close \nto the national forest system lands that the fear that the railroad \nmight spark and start a wildfire is a threat too imminent to risk.\n  A second example is the river rafting operations that have been \nforced to cease operations because of the drought conditions and lack \nof river flows.\n  Municipal and private wells are running dry. In the City of Santa Fe, \nemergency wells for municipal water use are needed because Santa Fe's \nwater storage is at 18 percent capacity, the spring runoff is only at 2 \npercent, and current wells are pumping 24 hours a day.\n  The City of Santa Fe is at a Stage 3 water shortage emergency, which \nallows outdoor watering once a week, but the City Council is \nconsidering going to Stage 4, which would eliminate all outdoor \nwatering. To put this in perspective, the last substantial rain for the \narea was in late January.\n  Santa Fe is only one of the numerous municipalities that have imposed \nrestrictions on water use. These restrictions are enforced by ``water \npolice'' and that violators face steep fines ranging from $20 for a \nfirst offense to $200 for a fourth offense and stay at $200 for each \nrepeat violation.\n  While most livestock sales generally take place on the reservation \nduring September and October, this year emergency sales were being held \nalmost every weekend during July and August. Hundreds of cattle, horses \nand sheep have already died as a result of the severe drought \nconditions.\n  The article goes on to describe the severity of the conditions. \n``Stock ponds have gone dry, fish have died in evaporating lakes, and \ngrass has disappeared. Sand blows across reservation roads, and the \nstiff bodies of dead cattle litter the land.''\n  The seriousness of the water situation in New Mexico becomes more \nacute every single day. I reiterate that every single New Mexican will \nfeel the impact of this drought in one way or another. whether they are \nselling off the essence of their livelihood--livestock, or losing daily \nrevenues in other small businesses, or whether they are actually having \nto refrain from watering their own lawns and washing their cars, the \ndrought and its devastation is very real.\n  There is a need out west and I stand ready to do what I can. It will \nbe a monumental and expensive challenge, but one we cannot avoid.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I know we are about to vote. I will take \nwhatever time I require from my leader time to make a couple of closing \nremarks with regard to this amendment.\n  I appreciate very much the great work done by so many of our \ncolleagues over the course of the last several months on this issue. \nThe Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, and the other Senator from \nMontana, Mr. Burns, and my colleague from South Dakota, Mr. Johnson, \nand so many of our colleagues who have worked diligently to make the \ncase to report to this body the gravity of the situation we now face, \nall deserve commendation.\n  As I traveled through South Dakota in August during my unscheduled \ndriving, the comment I got most from people in every situation--people \non Main Street, people in government, people on farms and ranches--was \nsimply this: Help us with the drought. If you want to deal with the \neconomy, help us solve this problem now.\n  The situation could not be any more grave than it is in the western \npart of my State. Statistically, this situation is the worst it has \nbeen in some counties since 1936. So, there is no other option than for \nus to answer the call made to us all as we traveled our States last \nmonth: Help us with the drought. Provide the assistance. Do what is \nright. Recognize that as we have dealt with crises and natural \ndisasters in the past, we must now do the same. That is what this \namendment does.\n  We would respond with generosity and we would respond with commitment \nif there was a hurricane. We would respond with generosity if there was \na flood. We would respond with generosity it there was an earthquake. \nLet us respond with the same commitment and resolve in this drought as \nwe would with any other natural disaster. That is what this amendment \ndoes.\n  We have actually saved a great deal of money because prices are \nhigher than projected when the farm bill passed. We don't need an \noffset. We simply know these resources can be re-dedicated to rural \nAmerica without the commitment of an offset per se.\n  This is an emergency. We must send a clear message that, without this \nhelp, we will lose many of those leaders in the agricultural community \nthroughout our country that we rely on every day.\n  So I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and recognize the \nurgency of the need for this emergency disaster assistance, to support \nit on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis this morning and send a clear \nmessage that help is on the way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I understand there are only 58 seconds \nremaining on the side of the opposition. I still want to protect their \nright to speak for some time before the vote, and we are now passed the \ntime limit now. If the Senators who want to speak can be allowed at \nleast 5 minutes, then we will go immediately to the vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object to an extension. We have \nCondoleezza Rice and George Tenet waiting for a classified briefing. \nOur time is up. People have had all morning to speak.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, there are two Senators who have sought \nrecognition prior to the time we vote. I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Gramm of Texas and Senator Conrad of North Dakota both be given \n2 minutes prior to the vote and that the vote occur immediately \nthereafter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, those who are in opposition to providing \ndisaster assistance to our Nation's farmers and ranchers who have been \nhit by disaster have said it will cost money. Of course, that is true. \nIt will cost\n\n[[Page S8407]]\n\nmoney, over $5 billion, to provide disaster assistance. It is something \nwe have always done. It is something we should do now.\n  More than that, the Congressional Budget Office informed me yesterday \nthat there will be savings from the farm bill of $5.6 billion. Let me \nrepeat that: The CBO informed me in a letter yesterday there will be \n$5.6 billion of savings from the farm bill. That is not a direct offset \nfor this disaster assistance. I urge my colleagues to keep in mind when \nwe are looking at overall spending that it will be about a wash.\n  There are savings from the farm bill because production is down. That \nmeans prices are higher than anticipated, meaning costs under the farm \nbill will be less by $5.6 billion. That approximately pays for the \ndisaster package.\n  If anyone wonders whether it is really needed, I urge them to visit \nsouthwestern North Dakota, which has become like a moonscape. In \nrunning a food bank in northern South Dakota, a Presbyterian minister \nreported that the wives of ranchers are coming in asking for food and \nthey are very concerned that their husbands not find out because they \nare proud. They do not want public assistance, but they desperately \nneed it.\n  Now is the time. Please help. We always have in the past.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Could I ask the Senator a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I listened carefully to the remarks, but the Senator \ndid not say the Congressional Budget Office told you that a waiver is \nnot necessary for this bill in that it will require a budget waiver or \nit will fall. Is that not correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is absolutely correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, we have listened as over and over again our \nBudget Committee chairman, the majority leader, and others have talked \nabout deficits and the alarm we have for rising deficits. Yet today we \nare in the process of adding $6 billion to those deficits. We have \nalready passed a farm bill that cost a record amount--over $80 billion \nover 10 years--but that is not enough. We are now being asked to add \nroughly another $6 billion to that deficit.\n  We have to come to a recognition that deficits do not come from \nheaven. Deficits do not occur because God makes some decision. Deficits \noccur because we make decisions.\n  We have a budget process. The chairman of the Budget Committee is not \nwilling to defend it, but we have it. We have a budget point of order \nthat requires 60 votes for the Congress to go on record as saying we \nare willing to throw fiscal restraint out the door, that we are willing \nto add $6 billion to a deficit which is swelling daily.\n  I hope, first, that we sustain the budget point of order I will \nraise. But I hope those who are going to vote to waive this budget \npoint of order and who will give us long lectures on many subjects will \nnot include growing deficits among those subjects.\n  I think ultimately we have to start making decisions. We have to make \na choice: Do we want these deficits to go ever higher or are we willing \nto make a stand now? I am not saying there are not people who need \nhelp. I think we can focus a narrower bill which is paid for. I think a \nsource of paying for it can be some of the over $80 billion in the farm \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I raise a point of order under section 306 of the \nCongressional Budget Act against the pending amendment, No. 4481, \nbecause it contains matter which is within the jurisdiction of the \nSenate Budget Committee. That matter is, basically, setting aside the \nbudget process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I move to waive the relevant portion of the Budget Act, \nand I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n\n       There is a sufficient second.\n\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Hawaii (Mr. Akaka) and the \nSenator from New Jersey (Mr. Torricelli) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. \nGregg), the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. Helms), and the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire (Mr. Bob Smith) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). Are there any other Senators \nin the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 79, nays 16, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 212 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--79\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Campbell\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Enzi\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hagel\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--16\n\n     Chafee\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Hutchison\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     Nickles\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Thompson\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Akaka\n     Gregg\n     Helms\n     Smith (NH)\n     Torricelli\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 79, the nays are \n16. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to and the point of order falls.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote and move to lay that motion \non the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Enzi \nbe recognized to offer a second-degree amendment to the Byrd amendment, \nthat he have up to 3 minutes to discuss his amendment, and that \nfollowing the use or yielding back of his time, the amendment be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I would further notify Senators that \nfollowing Senator Enzi, Senator Craig is expected to offer an \namendment, which would be a second-degree amendment--I have spoken to \nthe managers of the bill; I have spoken to Senators Dodd and Craig--and \nthat following the offering of the amendment by the Senator from Idaho, \nhe would speak for a period of time but not until 12:30, and that there \nwould be sufficient time for that amendment to be set aside temporarily \nand Senator Dodd be recognized to offer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Daschle amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4481), as modified, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Madam President, reserving the right to object--and I will \nnot object--I need a clarification, though, how that could be disposed \nof. Then would the Senator from Connecticut lay his amendment aside \nafter it being offered to the main bill or to the underlying bill?\n  Mr. REID. The purpose of this is to have the Craig amendment laid \ndown. As most know, we are trying to work out an agreement on this very \ncontentious issue dealing with fire suppression. And staff is trying to \nwork out a unanimous consent request that we could agree to later \ntoday. But until\n\n[[Page S8408]]\n\nthat happens, Senator Craig's amendment would be the matter next before \nthe Senate. But he has agreed to temporarily lay that aside to allow \nthe Senator from Connecticut to offer an amendment. And that is not in \nthe form of a unanimous consent request; it is just for the information \nof Senators.\n  Mr. BURNS. I withdraw my reservation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4517 To Amendment No. 4480\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 4517.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi], for himself, Mr. \n     Grassley, and Mr. Hagel, proposes an amendment numbered 4517 \n     to amendment No. 4480.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       (Purpose: To provide offsets through payment limitations)\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3__. PAYMENT LIMITATIONS.\n\n       Section 1001 of the Food Security of 1985 (7 U.S.C. 1308) \n     is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (b), by striking ``$40,000'' each place \n     it appears and inserting ``$17,500'';\n       (2) in subsection (c), by striking ``$65,000'' each place \n     it appears and inserting ``$32,500''; and\n       (3) by striking subsection (d) and inserting the following:\n       ``(d) Limitations on Marketing Loan Gains, Loan Deficiency \n     Payments, and Commodity Certificate Transactions.--\n       ``(1) Loan commodities.--The total amount of the following \n     gains and payments that a person may receive during any crop \n     year may not exceed $90,000:\n       ``(A)(i) Any gain realized by a producer from repaying a \n     marketing assistance loan for 1 or more loan commodities \n     under subtitle B of title I of the Farm Security and Rural \n     Investment Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 7931 et seq.) at a lower \n     level than the original loan rate established for the loan \n     commodity under that subtitle.\n       ``(ii) In the case of settlement of a marketing assistance \n     loan for 1 or more loan commodities under that subtitle by \n     forfeiture, the amount by which the loan amount exceeds the \n     repayment amount for the loan if the loan had been settled by \n     repayment instead of forfeiture.\n       ``(B) Any loan deficiency payments received for 1 or more \n     loan commodities under that subtitle.\n       ``(C) Any gain realized from the use of a commodity \n     certificate issued by the Commodity Credit Corporation for 1 \n     or more loan commodities, as determined by the Secretary, \n     including the use of a certificate for the settlement of a \n     marketing assistance loan made under that subtitle.\n       ``(2) Other commodities.--The total amount of the following \n     gains and payments that a person may receive during any crop \n     year may not exceed $90,000:\n       ``(A)(i) Any gain realized by a producer from repaying a \n     marketing assistance loan for peanuts, wool, mohair, or honey \n     under subtitle B or C of title I of the Farm Security and \n     Rural Investment Act of 2002 (7 U.S.C. 7931 et seq.) at a \n     lower level than the original loan rate established for the \n     commodity under those subtitles.\n       ``(ii) In the case of settlement of a marketing assistance \n     loan for peanuts, wool, mohair, or honey under those \n     subtitles by forfeiture, the amount by which the loan amount \n     exceeds the repayment amount for the loan if the loan had \n     been settled by repayment instead of forfeiture.\n       ``(B) Any loan deficiency payments received for peanuts, \n     wool, mohair, and honey under those subtitles.\n       ``(C) Any gain realized from the use of a commodity \n     certificate issued by the Commodity Credit Corporation for \n     peanuts, wool, mohair, and honey, as determined by the \n     Secretary, including the use of a certificate for the \n     settlement of a marketing assistance loan made under those \n     subtitles.\n       ``(f) Single Farming Operation.--Notwithstanding \n     subsections (b) through (e), if an individual participates \n     only in a single farming operation and receives, directly or \n     indirectly, any payment or gain covered by this section \n     through the operation, the total amount of payments or gains \n     (as applicable) covered by this section that the individual \n     may receive during any crop year may not exceed twice the \n     dollar amount prescribed in this section.''.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 4517, Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, this is a sorely needed offset for sorely \nneeded assistance. I wholeheartedly agree with the need for the \nemergency agricultural assistance we just passed. It is an emergency in \nWyoming and most of the United States. Another pending emergency is the \nincrease in our national deficit. We have a readily available and \nappropriate offset for at least part of the expenditure. I am \nsuggesting we use it.\n  By needing emergency agricultural assistance today--we have tacitly \nadmitted that by passing Senator Daschle's amendment--we showed that we \nneeded to add to the farm bill. So it has already been opened.\n  This is an emergency, which is why I cosponsored the emergency \namendment. However, this body already wanted payment limitations. We \nvoted on February 7 of this year, by 61 to 33, to include payment \nlimitations in the farm bill. This isn't an issue of chopping programs \nto provide agricultural emergency money when we don't do that for any \nother emergency. This is an issue of providing agriculture with \nemergency money and helping pay for it with something on which this \nbody has already voted.\n  There has been some discussion this morning to the effect that the \nlack of crops will lead to additional money anyway. The President has \nsaid he supports drought relief that doesn't increase the national \ndeficit. We voted for agricultural assistance today. We should make \nevery effort to keep it alive, and keep it in the bill until it is sent \nto the President, by showing our good will and intention to do what we \ncan today to keep this desperately needed assistance from increasing \nthe deficit.\n  It is ridiculous to consider that this body will reject an amendment \nthat provides an offset for an appropriations bill while entertaining a \nhost of amendments that increase spending. The arcane rule seems almost \nslanted to increased spending.\n  However, I recognize the importance of rule XVI. I really think this \nneed for drought assistance, for an offset so that we aren't increasing \nthe national spending, is entirely critical. But I will withdraw my \namendment based on the Parliamentarian's ruling that rule XVI prohibits \noffering amendments containing general legislation on appropriations \nbills. I remain committed to funding a bill in which we offer my \namendment that will offset the drought spending.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4518 To Amendment No. 4480\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Craig], for himself and Mr. \n     Domenici, proposes an amendment numbered 4518:\n\n (Purpose: To reduce hazardous fuels on our national forests, and for \n                            other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the amendment, add the \n     following--\n\n     SEC.   . EMERGENCY HAZARDOUS FUELS REDUCTION PLAN.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subject to subsection (c) and \n     notwithstanding the National Environmental Policy Act of \n     1969, the Secretaries of Agriculture and the Interior shall \n     conduct immediately and to completion, projects consistent \n     with the Implementation Plan for the 10-year Comprehensive \n     Strategy for a Collaborative Approach for Reducing Wildland \n     Fire Risks to Communities and the Environment, May 2002 \n     developed pursuant to the Conference Report to the Department \n     of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001 \n     (House Report 106-646) to reduce hazardous fuels within any \n     areas of federal land under the jurisdiction of the Secretary \n     of Agriculture or the Secretary of the Interior that are \n     outside of Congressionally designated Wilderness Areas and \n     that the appropriate Secretary determines qualifies as a fire \n     risk condition class three area.

QUINCY LIBRARY INITIATIVE.\n\n       (a) Congress reaffirms its original intent that the Herger-\n     Feinstein Quincy Library Group Forest Recovery Act of 1998 be \n     implemented. Congress finds that delays and obstacles to \n     implementation of the Act have occurred as a result of the \n     Sierra Nevada Forest Plan Amendment decision January 2001.\n       (b) Congress hereby extends the expiration of the Act by \n     five years.\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, I have just sent to the desk a second-\ndegree amendment in my name and that of the Senator from New Mexico, \nMr. Domenici, and a good number of other Western Senators who have \ngrown extremely concerned about the fire situation in the Western \nStates primarily, and especially the Great Basin States, where we have \nseen now wildfires raging since mid-June--some 66.5 million acres, \n2,300 homes up in smoke, 28 lives lost, phenomenal wildlife habitat and \nwatershed destroyed. Clearly, it is a time when we need positive action \nto resolve this issue.\n  Others have spoken to it. Our President, about 3 weeks ago, while in \nOregon, spoke very clearly to the need for flexibility within forest \npolicy in this country to deal with the fuel-loaded forests of our \nNation, to thin them and to clean them, to restore their health, and to \ndo so in an environmentally sound way.\n  The amendment we offer today--while we still work with my colleagues \nfrom Oregon and California and other States that have the same problem, \nbut we are working with a variety of interest groups at this moment to \nsee if we can resolve this in permanent policy--is an expedited process \nthat does not lock the courthouse door, that recognizes the validity of \nexpression and public participation to deal with this issue.\n  We have reached out to incorporate what the Western Governors \nproposed, along with the Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of \nAgriculture, some months ago, to be a collaborative process that brings \nall of the parties together on a State-by-State basis to recognize \nthese lands and to designate them for the purpose of cleaning up.\n  We have limited this approach to no more than 10 million acres. There \nare over 33 million acres in the class 3 status, which means they are \nseverely bug-ridden, dead, dying, fuel-loaded forests. Even with that \nnumber, we have chosen to be limited, to target the most severe, and to \ndeal with it directly.\n  We also are dealing with the wildland-urban interface, where these \nhomes now in the Western States are, of which we have lost over 2,300 \nas of today. We are also dealing with urban watersheds. Many of the \nwatersheds that yield the valuable water to the growing urban \npopulations of the West have been devastated by fire this year or are \nin conditions where they are extremely fire prone. We have also set up \na variety of other prescriptions as to how these lands would be dealt \nwith.\n  I will talk no more in detail about it. My colleague from New Mexico \nis here to speak about it. We are still working with our other \ncolleagues in the West and around the country to see if we can build a \nbipartisan approach toward resolving this issue.\n  The President, the Deputy Secretary of Agriculture, and the Chief are \ndirectly involved with us at this moment to see if we can bind together \nat least a policy that begins to step us forward into resolving what, \nin my opinion, is now a critical, if not a crisis, status in our U.S. \nforested lands.\n  We have now lost an unprecedented number of acres. We are still \nburning in the States of California and in other States. That could \nwell go on for another month before the wet season hits. We could lose \nover 7.5 million acres this year, comparable to what we lost last year.\n  That is the intent of this amendment--to bring parties of interest \ntogether to resolve this, to bring Western States together to see if we \ncan find a course of action and the shaping of a public policy that \nbegins to return our great forests to a state of environmental health, \nwatershed quality, and wildlife habitat of the kind we would expect.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I thank Senator Craig. It is a \nprivilege to work with him on this entire matter. He is the chief \nsponsor, and I am here to help him. I started working on it very late \ncompared to Senator Craig. When I say ``it,'' I mean this issue, the \nterrible status of the American forests.\n  Everyone in this Chamber, be they staffer or Senator, Democrat or \nRepublican, has, over the last 3\\1/2\\ months, looked at their \ntelevision in absolute awe, for they have seen hundreds of thousands of \nwhat seemed from a distance to be beautiful American forests that ought \nto be enjoyed by millions of people, owned by all Americans, burning \nup. Sometimes they move a little bit out of the forest and catch a \nhouse on fire. If they are burning in California, they burn a house, \nalmost every time. We have fires in my State of New Mexico where they \nburn and no houses are affected, but the beautiful forest is burning to \nthe ground.\n  You heard the numbers. It is absolutely incredible. What we are told \nis that there are, within this great forest, 33 million acres that, if \nyou went and looked at it, they are not so beautiful, they are not so \ngreat.\n  If you drive through them for a few miles, you will probably ask the \nperson you are riding with: Why are those trees still there? They may \nbe stark, burned trees just standing straight up, black or dark brown \nfrom having been burned, but still standing up. If there is a big tree \nin the same forest--you may see a huge amount of acreage that has blown \nover. Nature knocked them over so they are not the beautiful forest \nthat you think it is from a distance.\n  Or if you go to two or three forests, you will also find that there \nare infected forests with various kinds of bugs, to use a common word--\ninsects that have eaten a forest away and what happens? It just stands. \nThese dry, wooden trees just stand. Underneath all of this, or \nalongside of it all, are small trees that have fallen down, leaves that \nhave piled up. In a nutshell, the forest is unattended and left, \nobviously, for years, with nobody doing what we all did many years ago. \nNobody is cleaning it up; nobody is thinning it.\n  So we have acreage in America where there are so many trees growing \nside by side that we were shown yesterday\n\n[[Page S8410]]\n\nby one of our colleagues, who is helping with this bill, two pieces--a \ncut across a tree about this thick, about 14, 15 inches in diameter, \nand another one was this big, about 4\\1/2\\, 5 inches in diameter. But \nguess what. They can tell how old each one is. The little one is twice \nas old as the bigger one because of poor growing conditions, because \nthey were all squashed up together, like you see American forests \ntoday. Instead of being separated, where the Sun can go down through \nand the forest can be happy--as we called a bill to clean up the \nforests last year, we named it the Happy Forest Act, hoping that we \nwould start to clean up the forests.\n  But we have not. The American people have now heard on the local news \nmedia and the national news media that, for some reason, the process of \ntrying to clean up some of these trees--I am speaking now of those \ncategories to which my friend Senator Larry Craig alluded--that almost \nanybody would say let's get those out of the forests.\n  The process of cleaning it up has been held up by a procedure that \ngets almost every desired cleanup into a court of law, into a NEPA \nstatement, regardless of how little or ineffective it is against the \nforest. In fact, the process got so bad that, while most of us were \ntotally unable to get a change so we could do fix it, the distinguished \nmajority leader saw it coming. Senator Daschle saw it coming in his \nState. He must have gone there and saw what we see. He saw it in his \nforest in the Black Hills. In other words, he saw some acreage where \nhis constituents must have been showing him and saying: Senator, why do \nwe have to leave that here? It is just a target that will burn our \nwhole forest down. Why are you not able? Because environmental groups, \nwhich are particularly concerned--rightfully so--with the forests of \nAmerica, won't let you take it up?\n  So everyone should know that Senator Craig, Senator Domenici, and \nmany other Western and Rocky Mountain Senators--hopefully, before we \nare finished we will be joined by many others--looked at the urgent \nsupplemental that passed not long ago, and we noticed that the \ndistinguished majority leader had put in language exempting fuels \nreduction projects on the Black Hills National Forest from NEPA appeals \nand litigation.\n  So from a distance, we said, thank you, Mr. Majority leader, you \nreally did for us what ought to be done--except that you only did it \nfor your State. No criticism. That is fine. We say if it is good enough \nfor the majority leader in his State, then it ought to be good enough \nfor us. We have many, many times more acreage of this kind in our \nrespective States--Idaho, Arizona, New Mexico, Nevada, and I can go on. \nWe have much, much more of that broken down, knocked over timber, \nburned but still standing, wind blown, bug-infested. We would like to \nhave the same thing, or as close as we can, that Senator Daschle, quite \ncorrectly, gave to the citizens of his State. He did that a month and a \nhalf ago, or less, when we put amendments on an appropriations bill.\n\n  Again, I have no objection to his having done that. I praised him \nbecause the time had come when NEPA had to be changed. We were all \noperating under a blanket that said you can't do that, no matter what. \nWhen we read this, we said, if you cannot do it, it has just been done \nbecause the distinguished majority leader did it for the Black Hills in \nhis State. And now I walked, during the last 25 days in my State, into \nabout six or eight meetings with cowboys and people who used to work in \nlumber mills, with people who have farms up alongside the forests; they \nare at meetings and all they want to know, why can't we clean forests \nso they won't burn down. Anybody coming to see Senator Domenici puts up \nhis hand and he wants to know why can't New Mexico do what South Dakota \ncan do. All we can do is say Senator Daschle is a fair man. He did this \nfor his constituents. We believe when he sees what should be done for \nours, he will be helpful.\n  We do hope the amendment that we put down--the Craig-Domenici, et \nal--that many Senators will be on it. I have talked to Senators on the \nother side whose names have not yet been mentioned--even by Senator \nLarry Craig, the prime sponsor. I am talking to all of them now, \nDemocrats and Republicans. We can put a bill together that will work in \nCalifornia, where there are many houses and they are very valuable and, \ntherefore, you need to clean up around each of them--all the way over \nto New Mexico where you have very open spaces and some houses. But you \nhave to make sure the cleanup is not going to just be around buildings \nand houses. Some of it will have to be in other open spaces where the \nforest itself will be the victim, not necessarily a house in the fire's \nway.\n  So I urge that--as is the usual manner when we have a situation such \nas this--we not end up with one group calling the other group names--\nthat one is pro-environment, or that one is pro-forest. I submit that \nwe have a big problem. Senator Daschle tried to solve it for his \nconstituents. We have observed that carefully. We would like to solve \nit for our constituents. We do not believe the distinguished majority \nleader is going to say: I got it but you cannot have it. It is fair and \nit must be done. Our forests will burn down before we ever get to clean \nthem up.\n  Having said that, we worked very hard--not just Republicans, but a \nnumber of Democrats, and not just Republican staff, but a number of \nDemocrat staff who know what they are talking about. We crafted this \nbill. We think from the standpoint of doing away with some of the \nlitigation that environmentalists like to be in place so they think \ntheir interests are protected, we have left more court proceedings in \nour measure than the majority leader left in his. We have streamlined \nthe process, no question about it. We have taken less of a proportion \nof the class III gambling acreage and put it in our bill.\n  Senator Craig said, out of 33 million acres that are so polluted as \nwe described, they are going to burn down and carry all kinds of other \ntrees with them. Ten out of 33 is what we provide for in our bill. We \nare willing to say, if they cannot do 10, because they don't have the \nequipment or the time, it can be altered. We are also in favor of \nadding the new money that the President pledged, and that can go to \nthis. If there needs to be more, we can talk about it on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  I rose today not to speak of technicalities. We will do that. Our \namendment is there and there are plenty of copies for the technicians \nto look at. In a nutshell, we have seen the forests of America and they \nare burning.\n  We think over time we must have a new forest plan. I have heard my \ngood friend, Senator Craig, speak of a new forest plan, a new horizon \nfor maintenance and upkeep that will keep these forests beautiful. We \nalso speak of preserving these forests where they are subject to being \nburned down because of our failure to maintain them. We want to go in, \nwithin the next 18 months, and do as much maintenance as we can. In the \nprocess, we are not interested in lumber.\n  As soon as we decided we were going this way, 10 or 15 Senators got \non television and we heard opposition: We do not want to do that, \nbecause they are all for big lumber.\n  What we are for is saving our forests. We do not have any new lumber \ncontract language, that I am aware of, in this bill. I am not an \nexpert, but I see the experts saying that is true. We have provisions \nthat will permit the managers within the Forest Service and the BLM to \nproceed to maximum cleanup, and to do it now.\n  We do not have any new roadways, as I understand it. We do not have \nnew roadways where there are none, because we are not interested in \nthat; that is not our goal.\n  So once again, I say to our friends, Democrats and Republicans, these \nare days when we seem to try to come together as Senators. We are not \ngetting a lot done because 9/11 is hovering over us. But I do think it \nwould permit us, also under that attitude we have generated of being \nmore friendly and more congenial, to consider what those who oppose it \nsay; we will consider it to be a legitimate objection, if the other \nside will consider what we propose to do as legitimate and let us \nexplain it carefully.\n  Let's see if we can get a bill so we can go home this year, whether \nwe are running or whether we are just going home because it is our time \nto go home, and we can go to those meetings I described and say, \nDemocrat and Republican, joined by our President, we\n\n[[Page S8411]]\n\nput more money into cleaning up the forests that you live by, live in, \nwork with, and recreate in; we put money to do some real fixing up; and \nwe also have agreed we do not have to take so long to go from weighing \nthat forest and saying it is one of those that ought to be cleaned up \nto getting it cleaned up.\n  Should it take 5 years? Of course not. Should it take so long that \neverybody gives up? Of course not. We have provisions as to how fast it \nmust go in terms of the events that occur in the courtrooms and other \nplaces.\n  This is one chance to make some real changes. They will be temporary, \nbut we will be able to look at them and say we can now continue to do \nthem; the forests may come out clean in 10 or 15 years, not next week, \nnot next month.\n  I am hopeful our amendment, which obviously can be changed, will be \nlooked at from the standpoint that we are not here to blame; we are not \nhere to criticize; we are here to commend the distinguished majority \nleader for seeing that NEPA, the approach of the National Environmental \nProtection Act to cleaning up the forests, has to be modified in terms \nof its imposition of delay.\n  We ought to be able to do that in writing, where it is easy for \neverybody to understand and will not destroy, will not cause our \nforests to be logged in some way that is not good for America. We hope \nthe public can look openly at our work in the next 3 or 4 days. And we \nwant it to be open. We have nothing to hide. We want to be able to say \nwithin the next 6 weeks, across the United States on the nightly news \nand the newscasts of the day, the bipartisan Senate has decided to fix \nup the forests before they burn down, clean them up before they are no \nmore. That is essentially what our bill is all about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I am going to be very brief because I am \nimposing on the time of Senator Dodd. As chairman of the Senate's \nSubcommittee on Forests and Public Lands, I regret to say this morning \nI have to oppose the amendment that has been laid down by my \ncolleagues.\n  I have enormous respect for both Senator Domenici and Senator Craig. \nI want to take a couple of minutes to talk about my concerns. I want to \nbe clear, having lived this issue constantly with my constituents \nthrough the summer months, I am totally committed to the concept of \nexpedited treatment when we are dealing with areas that are fire prone, \nwhen we are dealing with areas that are at risk for fire, as so much of \nthe West is. I am committed to expedited treatment.\n  I will say, and I regret to have to do so this morning, I believe \nthis amendment is an overreach. The history in the West, because things \nare so polarized, is that the surest way to taint an effort to try to \nbring the parties together is to overreach. Particularly, this analogy \nto South Dakota, I would say to my good friends, simply does not wash. \nThe South Dakota example involved 800 acres. We are talking about \nmillions and millions of acres in this debate. If there is one thing \nthat we westerners have learned, it is that one size does not fit all.\n  I hope we can continue to talk about ways to really ecologically \nimprove the health of fire-prone forests, work together to tailor our \napproach to deal with areas that are at risk for fire. I have made it \nclear I support expedited treatment there.\n  Let us not lock the doors to the courthouse. I believe people have a \nconstitutional right to access the courts, but they do not have a \nconstitutional right to a 5-year delay. Let us make sure all the \nstakeholders have a place at the negotiating table.\n  Senator Craig and I have an experience that has worked with the \ncounty payments bill, a bill that the Forest Service called the most \nimportant bill in 30 years.\n  Finally, it seems to me we ought to be sensitive to the ecological \nimportance of the big old-growth trees.\n  So I am saddened that I have to oppose this amendment. I plan to \ncontinue to keep talking to my colleagues.\n  I thank Senator Dodd again for his graciousness in giving me this \ntime, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will only take a minute.\n  I say to my good friend from Oregon, I thank him for his remarks. I \nam very hopeful that whenever we vote on this bill, the Senator will \nvote aye, because whatever it is the Senator thinks does not fit the \nbill in this amendment can be rectified.\n  I also say that my mentioning of the distinguished majority leader \nwas with praise, with congratulations, and stating that he showed us \nhow. I did not say we have to do it the same way, but he did change the \neffect of NEPA for his State once and for all on these forests. I am \nvery proud he did. I want to do something close to that when we do it. \nI do not want to close the gates of the courthouse. In fact, we did \nless of that in this than with other bills. I think the Senator knows \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my friend, Senator Craig, who is in the Chamber, \nin conversations with the distinguished majority whip a moment ago the \nsuggestion was that we might temporarily lay aside the Craig amendment \nso I could offer an amendment. I am not going to take a lot of time on \nthis, I would say to the ranking member on this bill. I will lay down \nthis amendment and explain briefly what I would like to do.\n  Since this involves the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Senator Inouye, the \nchairman of the committee, is looking at the amendment, but I want to \nat least discuss this by taking a few minutes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the amendment offered by the \ndistinguished Senator from Idaho be temporarily laid aside for the \npurposes of offering an amendment I would propose, with the full \nunderstanding that, obviously, the amendment by Senator Craig would \npreempt any consideration of my amendment, at least under the present \ncircumstances.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4522 to amendment No. 4472\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n     The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4522 to amendment No. 4472.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To prohibit the expenditure of funds to recognize Indian \n tribes and tribal nations until the date of implementation of certain \n                       administrative procedures)\n\n       On page 64, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1__. FEDERAL RECOGNITION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this Act, and subject to the availability of funds and \n     subsections (b) and (c), the Bureau of Indian Affairs may not \n     use more than $1,900,000 of the funds made available by this \n     Act to carry out functions and activities associated with the \n     Branch of Acknowledgment and Research.\n       (b) Limitations.--None of the funds made available under \n     this Act shall be used to approve or deny a petition from any \n     person or entity for recognition as a federally-recognized \n     Indian tribe or tribal nation (referred to in this section as \n     a ``petition'') until such date as the Secretary of the \n     Interior (referred to in this section as the ``Secretary'') \n     certifies to Congress that the administrative procedures \n     described in subsection (c) have been implemented with \n     respect to consideration of any petition submitted to the \n     Secretary.\n       (c) Procedures.--The administrative procedures described in \n     subsection (b) are that--\n       (1) in addition to notices provided under any other \n     provision of law, not later than 30 days after the date of \n     receipt of a petition, the Secretary shall provide written \n     notification of the petition to--\n       (A) the Governor and attorney general of--\n       (i) the State in which the petitioner is located as of that \n     date; or\n       (i) each State in which the petitioner has been located \n     historically, if that State is different from the State in \n     which the petitioner is located as of that date;\n       (B) the chief executive officers of each county and \n     municipality located in the geographic area historically \n     occupied by the petitioner; and\n       (C) any Indian tribe and any other petitioner that, as \n     determined by the Secretary--\n       (i) has a relationship with the petitioner (including a \n     historical relationship); or\n\n[[Page S8412]]\n\n       (ii) may otherwise be considered to have a potential \n     interest in the acknowledgement determination;\n       (2) the Secretary--\n       (A) shall consider all relevant evidence submitted by a \n     petitioner or any other interested party, including \n     neighboring municipalities that possess information bearing \n     on the merits of a petition;\n       (B) on request by an interested party, may conduct a formal \n     hearing at which all interested parties may present evidence, \n     call witnesses, cross-examine witnesses, or rebut evidence \n     presented by other parties during the hearing; and\n       (C) shall include a transcript of a hearing described in \n     subparagraph (B) in the administrative record of the hearing \n     on which the Secretary may rely in considering a petition;\n       (3) the Secretary shall--\n       (A) ensure that the evidence presented in consideration of \n     a petition is sufficient to demonstrate that the petitioner \n     meets each of the 7 mandatory criteria for recognition \n     contained in section 83.7 of title 25, Code of Federal \n     Regulations (as in effect on the date of enactment of this \n     Act); and\n       (B) consider a criterion to be met if the Secretary \n     determines that it is more likely than not that evidence \n     presented demonstrates the satisfaction of the criterion; and\n       (4) the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register, \n     and provide to each person to which notice is provided under \n     paragraph (1), a complete and detailed explanation of the \n     final decision of the Secretary regarding a documented \n     petition under this Act that includes express findings of \n     fact and law with respect to each of the criteria described \n     in paragraph (3).\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, let me emphasize, I am offering this \namendment now with the full understanding that my dear friend and \ncolleague from Hawaii, the chairman of the committee, is reviewing this \namendment to see whether it might be accepted. If it is, obviously we \nwill deal with it in a different manner.\n  Since we have some time and we are about to leave the Interior bill \nto go back to homeland security, it may be another day or two before we \nget back to the Interior appropriations bill. So I thought I would take \nadvantage of this pause in the consideration of the Craig amendment to \nlay out what this amendment is, why I am offering it, and why it is so \nterribly important that we adopt it, or something like it, if we can.\n  It is with some reluctance that I offer this amendment to address the \nprocess for recognizing Indian tribes in this country. I would have \npreferred to have the matter addressed at a different time and under \ndifferent circumstance, but I raise it now because the matter has \nconsiderable urgency and importance in my State and other States.\n  Currently, there are 200 petitions pending at the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs by groups throughout our country seeking Federal recognition as \nIndian tribes. Nine of the petitions are in my State of Connecticut, a \nState 110 miles by 630 miles square. There are in addition to the two \ntribes that have been recognized in our State, with which I have a very \nclose and warm relationship, the Pequot Tribe and the Mohegan Tribe, \nboth of which have played a significant role in our State and with our \ncitizens and have contributed to the well-being of our State. The two \ntribes have generated thousands of jobs in Connecticut and have \nprovided much revenue for the State.\n  I offer this amendment which in no way deals at all with tribes that \nhave been recognized. I strongly support them and have been deeply \ninvolved in both the Mohegan and Pequot issues, sometimes going back to \nmy days when I served in the other body, when the Tribes were first \nconsidered for recognition. We went through an extensive process.\n  My concern has to do with the fact that the recognition process, by \nthe admission of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, has broken down \nentirely. I will quote the former head of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, \nKevin Gover, the Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs:\n\n       I am troubled by the money backing certain petitions and I \n     do think it is time that Congress should consider an \n     alternative to the [existing] process. [Otherwise,] we're \n     more likely to recognize someone that might not deserve it.\n\n  That was the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs.\n  We are reviewing petitions that are almost hard to imagine. We just \nhad a situation in our State where two tribes opposing each other \nsought recognition by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Bureau of \nIndian Affairs did not approve either application but rather came up \nwith a third choice--no one asked for it--and recognized the third \nchoice.\n  If that is not a system that is broken down, I don't know what is. \nAll we are asking in this amendment is that communities, leaders, \nGovernors, and the various States where the petitions are pending be \nnotified of the petitions; that other tribes be notified as well as the \npetitions; that there be improved notice of petition to key persons who \nmay have an interest in the petition, including the Governor and the \nattorney general of the State where a tribe seeks recognition; \nconsideration of all relevant evidence submitted by a petitioner and \nother interested parties, including municipalities; require that a \npetitioner meet each and every one of the seven criteria for Federal \nrecognition spelled out by the current Code of Federal Regulations; and \nrequire that a decision on a petition be published in the Federal \nregistry that includes express written findings of fact and of law with \nrespect to each of the seven mandatory criteria.\n\n  We had a case not long ago where the criteria of showing a continuity \nof relationship had been broken by more than 70 years. The Assistant \nSecretary, despite the findings of the technical staff that said this \ngap would be enough to deny recognition, overruled the technical staff \nand approved it anyway. So what we are doing is not writing new \ncriteria. These criteria are part of the Federal Registry. We want to \ncodify them to say if these criteria are important, they ought to be \nadhered to. If you go through the recognition process, you must meet \nthe criteria, as well as inform affected communities.\n  Many States in the country have petitions pending. There are 200 \npending. My State has nine. That is why there is a sense of urgency. \nOther States have petitions pending, as well. This is not about denying \npetitions. I happen to believe if criteria are met, these tribes ought \nto be recognized. In fact, I suggest the present process, as flawed and \nas broken as it is, devalues federal recognition so those that have \nbeen recognized, under stiff criteria, those who have gone through the \nprocess that took years in some cases, will see their recognition \nundermined in some sense if the future recognitions are granted where \nthe criteria have not been met. That is what we are trying to avoid.\n  This amendment imposes a moratorium on any new recognitions until the \nBureau of Indian Affairs applies these criteria. They can do it quickly \nand move forward, or they can delay it. And in that case, we hold up \nhere.\n  We have also in this amendment provided some $1.9 million if funds \nare made available to the Bureau of Indian Affairs. There are some \nwonderful people working in this agency. But they do not have the \nresources needed when you have 200 applications pending, a relatively \nsmall staff, and if you are trying to do the historical research, the \nchecking, all of the investigation that needs to be done, considering \nall the information that comes to you, you have to have the people who \ncan help you do that.\n  I don't require this spending because that might subject the \namendment to a point of order, but I merely point out that these funds, \nif available, should be made available to the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nto allow them to do the job they would like to do.\n  Again, I don't write anything new in terms of new criteria, new law, \nnew hurdles. We take the existing criteria, we do say you must notify \npeople and affected communities where this is going on so they can be \nheard and people have an opportunity to discuss what will happen if \nrecognition is approved and we end up with a sense of community. I wish \nevery single community could go through what we went through with the \nMohegan Tribe in Connecticut when that Tribe was seeking recognition. \nThe relationship with the surrounding communities that developed was \nnot done under law. It was done because the leadership of the tribe and \nthe leadership of the communities worked so closely together. As a \nresult of that, today we have a wonderful relationship between a Native \nAmerican tribe and the communities in which they reside.\n  Recently, I participated in the opening of a new hotel at the Mohegan \nfacility, and had dinner with the tribal council. The tribal council \ninvited\n\n[[Page S8413]]\n\nleaders throughout the State. Everyone was there to celebrate the \nremarkable event, this wonderful relationships that have emerged, and \nthe contribution this tribe has made. With the Pequot Tribe, we have \nhad a more difficult relationship with some of the communities, but \nthey are working at it. There are still issues to be resolved and they \nare struggling to sort them out.\n  We need to bring some sanity and some sensibility to a recognition \nprocess that is just not working. I wish there was some other way to \ndeal with this. I don't ever want to support legislation to undo \nrecognition where recognition has been granted. We are not talking \nabout anything that would undermine the recognition of existing tribes \nin the country. It merely says for those petitions that are pending, \nthe criteria should be met; that notice should be given; that \nopportunity to be heard should be made. We do not think that is a \ntremendous amount to be asking. We are looking at, in some cases, \ntremendous additional burdens on surrounding communities, on \ntransportation, housing, and the like. We need to take that into \nconsideration with Federal recognition as part of the process.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senator Dodd's \nproposed amendment, of which I am a cosponsor, to reform and strengthen \nthe Federal tribal recognition process for American Indian tribes and \ntheir governments.\n  I am pleased to join with my respected colleague on this amendment, \nand concur with his sentiment that this amendment will further \nconstructive dialogue on establishing a more fair and open Federal \ntribal recognition process. In 2001, I joined him in introducing S. \n1392 and S. 1393, which were similarly designed to reform and improve \nthe process by which the Federal Government recognizes the sovereign \nstatus of American Indian tribes and their tribal governments.\n  The Federal tribal recognition process has greatly affected the State \nof Connecticut and its local municipalities from a financial and \nphysical infrastructure standpoint. Connecticut is one of our nation's \ngeographically smallest states. However, Connecticut already has three \nfederally recognized tribes, one of which is being appealed, and nine \nmore recognition petitions are in the Bureau of Indian Affairs \npipeline. That is why Connecticut has been so keenly impacted by the \nfederal recognition process.\n  This Federal recognition process has been fraught with controversy. \nWe shouldn't recognize additional tribes until the process is fixed and \ncredibility in the BIA recognition process is reestablished. It is \nwidely recognized that the process is both extremely lengthy and that \ntowns and other interested parties feel that their views have been \nignored.\n  I want to stress that this amendment does nothing to affect already \nrecognized Federal tribes or hinder their economic development plans. \nNor does it change existing Federal tribal recognition laws. What this \namendment does, consistent with those laws, is ensure that recognition \ncriteria are satisfied and all affected parties, including affected \ntowns, have a chance to fairly participate in the decision process. It \nassures a system of notice to affected parties; that relevant evidence \nfrom petitioners and interested parties, including neighboring towns, \nis properly considered; that a formal hearing may be requested, with an \nopportunity for witnesses to be called and with other due process \nprocedures in place; that a transcript of the hearing is kept; that the \nevidence is sufficient to show that the petitioner meets the seven \nmandatory criteria in Federal regulations; and that a complete and \ndetailed explanation of the final decision and findings of fact are \npublished in the Federal Register. Under the amendment, funding \navailable under the Interior Appropriations bill to the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs for the recognition process becomes available when these \nfundamental due process procedures are implemented by the Secretary of \nInterior. The amendment dictates no outcomes, it simply tries to assure \na fair process, accessible and more transparent to affected parties.\n  Mr. DODD. I see my wonderful friend, Ben Nighthorse Campbell. He and \nI have talked about this on numerous occasions, and he is aware of what \nI am doing with this amendment I drafted many months ago.\n  I have gone through it and have had numerous conversations with \nNative American tribes about this amendment, as to what I wanted to do \nand why I thought it was important. I am very grateful for the \nresponses I have had, the understanding here that this in no way \nderecognizes--in fact I would vehemently oppose any effort to \nderecognize any tribe in this country that has received Federal \nrecognition.\n  The point I am trying to make here is that the Bureau of Indian \nAffairs needs resources and it needs to follow a process so there is \nclarity; so everybody understands what happens and how it happens; so \nthere is the information the people need; so there is an opportunity to \nrespond; so the criteria will be met.\n  You have great technical staff, great professional staff at the BIA. \nIt is disheartening for them to go through a process and make \nrecommendations and have an Assistant Secretary veto their hard work, \nand that has happened in too many instances.\n  We have 200 applications pending--in my State nine of them--and a \nnumber of them are going to be decided in the next 7 or 8 months. If I \ncould wait for the next Congress, wait for an authorization bill to \ncome up, I would rather go that way. But next year the amendment I am \noffering would do little or nothing if recognition is granted in places \nit is not deserved.\n  What heightens this more than anything else are some of the most \nrecent applications. I know my friend from Colorado is aware of this, \nbut we actually had two tribes seeking recognition. They opposed each \nother's recognition. The Bureau of Indian Affairs essentially rejected \nboth applications and approved a third application that was never \nfiled. You can understand the utter amazement of my constituents under \nthose circumstances. That is like two people applying for a Federal \ngrant, both being rejected, and a grant being awarded to an agency that \nnever sought it. My colleagues who think the system is not broken: Look \nat that example.\n  While your State may not be affected today, it could be, so we need \nto bring some order to this, provide the resources, make sure the \ncriteria are met, and then we ought to accept and endorse and applaud \nwhen recognition occurs and not to undermine the recognition process \nwhen problems such as this arise.\n  Again, I will take some additional time if necessary. I am hopeful my \ncolleagues can just accept this amendment. I am not interested in going \nthrough a unnecessary process here, a lengthy process of debate on \nthis. I would like to see if we could agree. I am not adding anything \nnew. I am just taking the criteria and codifying them, and setting a \nmoratorium. The moratorium could last a month or less if the criteria \nwould be applied, so it need not delay things inordinately.\n  I have tried every which way; I know of no other way we can get BIA's \nattention. We cannot get a bill up. We can't get things done, and the \nprocess goes on, and if a recognition comes through--I don't want to \nundo a recognition when it occurs. That would be outrageous. That would \nput in jeopardy every single recognized tribe, which would have to fear \nan act of Congress might somehow derecognize them. That is not the way \nto go. But if we don't bring in some sanity and we end up with \ncircumstances such as those that happened in my State, I can see \nsomebody passing legislation that might just do that, and it would not \nbe because they are evil or bad but it would be because they see a \nsystem that is flawed and is providing recognition where it is not \ndeserved, or worse, denying recognition where it was deserved because \nother financial interests objected to them reaching that status.\n  So both the petitioner that deserves recognition and the neighbors of \npetitioners that do not are in jeopardy as a result of the present \nprocess. It's unfair and wrong.\n\n  I am hopeful we can, as I say, adopt this and then convince the \nadministration, convince the BIA to improve the process and go this \nroute and straighten this out before we end up with a firestorm across \nthe country that I\n\n[[Page S8414]]\n\nthink could do great damage to our Nation and to those that deserve \nrecognition that might otherwise be adversely affected by it.\n  I have not gone into the whole casino deal because I don't think that \nis the issue. If a tribe in my State deserves recognition and they go \nthrough the process, my State allows for Native American tribes to \noperate casinos. If a tribe deserves recognition and they open up a \ncasino, if they deserve the recognition, then they deserve to go ahead \nwith that. I may not be enthusiastic about it, but I don't believe we \nought to be opposing recognition because Native American tribes all of \na sudden have discovered a way to accrue some wealth. So my objection \nto this process is not grounded in the casino debate. I understand it. \nI am sympathetic in some ways.\n  Mine is a small State, smaller than Yellowstone National Park. It is \nsmaller than some counties in California or Montana, geographically. \nWhen you end up with two of the largest casinos in the world and the \npossibility of nine more in a little State, you can understand some \nfrustration being felt. But my argument is not grounded on that point. \nIf recognition is deserved, it ought to be granted. My concern is that \nthe recognition process is so broken and so flawed that even the \nAssistant Secretary has described it as such. It is incumbent upon us, \nit seems to me, to try to do what we can to straighten this out.\n  So this amendment is designed to impose a moratorium, take existing \nlaw, existing regulations, codify them so there is clarity in the \nprocess, there is a clear roadmap, so those petitioners seeking \nrecognition and those opposing it for whatever reason can have a higher \ndegree of expectation of what is expected of them and what the hurdles \nare that have to be met before recognition is granted or denied.\n  With that, I have taken more time than I said I probably would. I am \ngrateful to Senator Craig and Senator Domenici for laying aside their \namendment so I could lay this down for the purpose of letting my \ncolleagues know my interests. Hopefully we can find some common ground.\n  My colleague from Colorado has an alternative idea. My concern is, if \nwe don't get that done in the meantime, the recognition goes forward \nand obviously he is not going to offer a bill that is going to undo \nanything that has occurred already.\n  For those of us who sense urgency on this issue, I am looking for \nsome temporary filler here until we get to a more elaborate, more \nestablished process. My concern is by the time we get that done, the \nhorses may be out of my barn, in a sense, and there will be nothing \nmore than a historical tragedy in a way where I have nothing more to \nsay to my colleagues except we missed an opportunity.\n  It seems to me, if I do not try to do something here, then we are \nsubject to the criticism that we knew a system was broken and we didn't \nmake an effort to try to do something about it.\n  With that, let me sit down, yield the floor, and listen to the good \nwords of my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I ask a couple of minutes of time from Senator Burns, \nif I can get some.\n  Let me tell my friend, Senator Dodd, I think he has brought something \nforward that we have long neglected. We have dealt with it in the \nIndian Affairs Committee several times and have not been able to find a \nsolution.\n  I know, as you said, the casino issue may not be the central focus \npoint, but clearly it has driven the debate over the last few years. \nThere are probably 60 or 70 or more on the drawing boards right now \nthroughout America. In fact, there is a good number in California.\n  We have seen the advent of huge amounts of money. Actually it ended \nup dividing families, about who was going to control the tribe. We are \ndealing with that now in California, where part of the family has \nliterally disenfranchised some other parts through some local decisions \nmade by the agencies in California rather than even going as far as the \nSecretary's office or the Under Secretary's office. So we know there \nare some real problems with it.\n  I wanted to mention that I may very well join you. But right now I \nunderstand this is going to be laid aside for a while anyway. I tried \nto call Senator Inouye, the chairman. I am the ranking member, as the \nSenator from Connecticut knows. He is not in yet, but we are going to \nsit down and talk about this.\n  I might say, in the past, my own feeling about codifying anything--in \nother words, taking regulations and turning them into law--without \npeople whose lives are going to be affected, I have always been very \ncareful about that, particularly in the Indian community. We hear very \noften in committee when Indians come in to testify, tribes come to \ntestify, people say: We didn't even know you were going to do this. We \nhad no opportunity to study it, to deal with it. I know, at least in my \nview, I do not think any of the national groups, for instance, the \nNational Congress of American Indians, any professional group or any \nparticular tribes, have had a chance to review this and try to be in on \nthe discussion about how we fix something that is rapidly causing a lot \nof problems.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield, I have, going back a number of \nmonths now, specifically transmitted this language, or language like it \nanyway, to one of the national tribal councils to get their input. I \ndon't want to bring anything to the floor that in any way they would \nfeel hostile about or toward.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. I tell my friend, their national convention is going to \nbe in San Diego after we get out, in November, with only 17 or 18 days \nof actual working time here. It might well be too late to do anything \nthis year. But if we don't, and even if it does have the support of \nIndian tribes, it is certainly something we ought to review next year. \nI tell my friend I will be looking forward to trying to find a solution \nto this very difficult problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, will the majority whip yield for a second?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield to my friend for a question.\n  Mr. BURNS. Will he allow me to ask unanimous consent that the Dodd \namendment be laid aside so the pending business would be the Craig \namendment?\n  Mr. REID. Absolutely.\n  Mr. BURNS. I ask unanimous consent that the Dodd amendment be laid \naside and that we return to the Craig amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4518\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to take just a few minutes to talk \nabout the statements given by my friend--I say my dear friend from New \nMexico, the former chairman of the Budget Committee, and someone I have \nworked with for many years on the Appropriations Committee and the \nEnergy and Water Subcommittee--regarding the South Dakota forest \nsettlement that was initiated and accomplished just a few months ago.\n  The amendment that was offered by my friend from Idaho simply doesn't \nmeet the Black Hills test. There are others who can probably explain \nthat better than I. But I think I have a pretty good knowledge of what \nhappened in South Dakota.\n  First of all, the amendment offered by the minority doesn't offer any \nnew wilderness in exchange for protecting the timber from appeals. In \naddition to the 10 million acres of trees that my friend from New \nMexico wants to have the Forest Service and BLM cutting down and doing \nthings of that nature, if my friend wants to include a wilderness part \nof that, that would be something maybe a lot of us could take a look \nat. As we know, wilderness comes in this body by inches. It is very \ndifficult to accomplish.\n  Anytime we talk about what is happening in South Dakota, understand \nthat a component of that was creating wilderness--in fact, about 4,000 \nacres of wilderness. I think that is something we have to understand.\n  We have to also understand that the amendment offered by my friend \nfrom the minority is sweeping in its scope, covering, as I understand \nit, about 10 million acres. The South Dakota proposal dealt with 8,000 \nacres.\n  The terms and conditions of the individual projects under this \nproposal that we have from our friend from\n\n[[Page S8415]]\n\nIdaho will not be subject to negotiations by environmental groups, \nStates, and the industry. It also does not protect wilderness areas \nfrom new road construction. It will not retain large, green trees and \nsnags--something that was in the South Dakota proposal.\n  I know it is an interesting ploy to say we want to do just exactly \nwhat South Dakota did. No one really means that. It is a totally \ndifferent situation involving not 10 million acres but 8,000 acres.\n  There have been longstanding negotiations in South Dakota. It has \nbeen involved in the court system for a considerable period of time.\n  I think we have to get off that, and get off the fact that we only \nwant to do what the majority leader wants. We want is to make sure that \nplaces such as beautiful Lake Tahoe, which is a lake surrounded by the \nStates of Nevada and California are protected--a lot of people are \nliving there. We are really afraid of a fire taking place there because \nlots of people now live in that basin.\n  During one of the trips that I remember taking with the supervisor of \nthe forests in that area, he said: Senator, the thing we are worried \nabout is fire, because of the downdrafts and updrafts that occur every \nday. If a fire starts in here, we will not be able to control it. We \ncame very close this summer to having a fire burn into that basin. We \nwere very fortunate. Nature was kind to us. It burned the other side \ntoward Carson City. That was extremely important.\n  But what we want and what we hope to be able to have at a subsequent \ntime is the Craig amendment and the amendment we will offer here. We \nwill debate those two amendments and, of course, recognize that because \nwe have the 60-vote threshold here in the Senate, we have been jumping \nthrough all of the hoops dealing with cloture. We would simply have the \n60-vote threshold on both. We are in the process of seeing if we can \nwork something out in that regard. That proposal was given to me by the \nSenator from Idaho earlier today. The staff is working to see if they \ncan come up with the unanimous consent agreement.\n  What we want--and I will just lay out the broad outlines of that--is \nto protect Lake Tahoe.\n  What does that mean? We think 70 percent of the money should be spent \nprotecting urban areas--not 70 percent creating new places to cut down \ntrees where there are no people. Lake Tahoe is a perfect example of \nthat. If we could have the trees thinned and, in effect, urban areas \nprotected there for a quarter to a half mile, then it wouldn't matter \nwhat happened; we would be able to protect those properties and those \npeople in that basin. The same applies around the rest of the country. \nWe have to protect these urban areas.\n  We are not asking that 100 percent of the money be spent on these \nurban areas, but 70 percent. Now it is turned around. Now only about 30 \npercent is spent in urban areas and 70 percent spent outside these \nurban areas.\n  As I indicated, the Black Hills settlement agreement creates \nthousands of acres of new wilderness in the Black Elk Wilderness Area. \nThe Black Hills settlement is an environmentally responsible thinning \nin two areas in the Black Hills National Forest. The Black Hills \nsettlement has conditions of sales negotiated among various parties, \nincluding environmental groups. The Black Hills settlement agreement \nallows negotiated sales to go forward without further appeal or \nlawsuits. The Black Hills settlement agreement contains large green \ntrees and snags, and it protects endangered species and habitat.\n  We can get into more debate in that regard with this amendment \noffered by Senator Craig and the one we will offer at a subsequent \ntime. But I just wanted to outline the two basic proposals and how we \ncan't keep harping on the fact that we want to do what was done in \nSouth Dakota. Nobody really means that. It is just an effort to try to \ncreate an atmosphere where the rules we play by and have been directed \nby for so many years dealing with forests be done away with. It wasn't \ndone in the settlement in South Dakota. We don't expect it to be done \nhere.\n\n  It is my understanding we have a number of amendments that have been \ncleared and that have been approved by both Senator Byrd and Senator \nConrad. I suggest the absence of a quorum so we can make sure that is \nthe case.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I apologize to my friend from New Jersey. I \nsat right by him for 6 years, and it was always hard for people to see \nme. I apologize. I thought Senator Burns was the only Senator on the \nfloor.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I appreciate that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE.

Mr. President, I appreciate the distinguished Senator \nfrom Nevada giving me the opportunity to speak on an issue that I am \nreally quite sad about, in all honesty. This is a human issue that I \nbring to the floor today that I think is an oversight on the part of \nthe Senate and actually all of us in public life.\n  I want to speak about families of lawful noncitizens whose loved ones \nperished in the World Trade Center. They are about to be put into a \nposition where, on a legal basis, they are deportable as of September \n11, 2002, and this at the same time as they are taking on that \nincredibly difficult task of dismantling their lives here in the United \nStates and returning to their country of birth.\n  This legislation would extend by 1 year the relief we provided in the \nPatriot Act to allow noncitizens whose parent or spouse was murdered in \nthe terrorist attacks of September 11.\n  Today is September 10, just 1 day shy of the 1-year anniversary of \nthe most significant terrorist attack on the United States in history.\n  The United States lost some 2,800 lives, as you know, but in the past \nyear we have forgotten, in my view, to take into consideration the 504 \nnationals from 86 foreign countries who were a part of that. Many of \nthese victims were in the United States as guest workers, contributing \ntheir technical expertise in helping the U.S. economy be the strongest \nin the world, be the engine of the world's economy. When they died, \ntheir hopes to provide a better life for themselves and their children \nin the United States died with them.\n  Tomorrow is September 11, and deportation proceedings could very well \nbegin, if the INS were to proceed this way, for the grieving families \nof those temporary workers. While those families watch the media \ncoverage of the anniversary--coverage that will no doubt extol the \nbravery and the sacrifice of so many of their family members--their \npresence in the United States will be in jeopardy.\n  These families were admitted to the United States 100 percent \nlawfully. They had all of their papers. They were admitted because we \ninvited them here to help drive our economy. They did not sneak across \nany border or overstay their visas. They are lawfully present in the \nUnited States because work visas were provided to their loved ones. \nThey paid taxes and submitted all appropriate paperwork. They were \nactive in our communities in New York and New Jersey and very \nproductive members of our society. Yet on the 1-year anniversary of the \ndeath of their loved ones, the INS could begin making arrangements for \ntheir removal from this country. Fortunately, the INS said they are \ngoing to turn a blind eye. But folks have to live with the risk that \nthis is a possibility.\n  The challenges faced by these brave families were anticipated by \nthose of us in Congress. In fact, the Patriot Act appropriately allowed \nthem an additional year to remain in the United States. But it is \nbecoming quite clear an additional year for families who have had to \nsuffer so much is not adequate. This legislation is a response to the \nvery real challenges of these families.\n  For example, many of these families are participating in September 11 \nsupport groups, groups that simply would\n\n[[Page S8416]]\n\nnot exist in the countries to which they may be returning. Many of them \nare eligible for awards from the Victims Compensation Fund, but, as you \nknow, many of the awards have not been processed, or even begun to be \nprocessed in many instances. Much work remains to be done.\n  Although they have been in mourning for nearly a year, many widows \nand children are waiting patiently for DNA analysis of the remains of \ntheir loved ones. Without closure, the grieving process has been \nprolonged considerably. Because of this delay, many necessary and \nunfamiliar financial matters have not been adequately addressed. There \nare homes that need to be sold and other business affairs to be settled \nbefore these folks should be returning home.\n  Also, there are children to consider, many of them in American \nschools, who have begun their lives. Many of them are American \ncitizens, the children themselves. In fact, I think some of these \nchildren could potentially be separated from their parents as we go \nforward with this whole process. So it is a real issue at a human level \non the ground, where people are trying to work their way through this \ntragic series of events.\n  While it is difficult to define the precise number of survivors who \nwould be eligible for relief under my legislation, it is safe to say it \nis under 200. I think it also reflects some problems in the INS. The \nbooks and records are not exactly clear on how many folks there are \ninvolved. We have identified, in my office, about 80 of these people \nwith whom we are working to try to provide special attention to them. \nThe thought is, it would be close to 200.\n\n  Yet despite the fact that this legislation is sculpted very narrowly \nto address only the most immediate humanitarian considerations for this \npopulation, and despite the fact that the number of people included is \na narrow 200 or fewer, each time I have attempted to get this \nlegislation cleared, an objection has been raised. Generally, it has \nbeen one individual who has used their ability to quietly veto this \nlegislation.\n  So at this time, with September 11 just 1 day away, Mr. President, I \nthink it is time to pass this legislation. I think it is important. I \nthink it speaks to the nature and the quality of who we are as a \nnation.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate take up and pass \nS. 2845, legislation to extend for 1 year procedural relief provided \nunder the USA Patriot Act for individuals who were or are victims or \nsurvivors of victims of a terrorist attack on the United States on \nSeptember 11, 2001.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BURNS. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I appreciate the responsibility of the Senator from \nWyoming to carry out the objection.\n  I continue to have serious concerns that if the facts of this issue \nwere known broadly, they would not be resisted. I personally sought out \nthe assistance of a number of folks who have typically objected to \nlegislation dealing with immigration: Senator Byrd, Senator Nickles, \nand particularly Senator Hatch, and they have been very helpful on \nthis--and the Senator from Montana; excuse me. The distinguished \nSenator from Montana. I apologize. I am tied up in this sense of--\n  Mr. BURNS. I say to the Senator from New Jersey, I have lived on both \nsides of the line.\n  Mr. CORZINE. It is all a beautiful part of the country.\n  But I must say, of all of the issues that get at human interests, I \nconsider it extraordinarily unusual that we have chosen to put a group \nof people--a limited group of people--at such risk.\n  I think this idea of having people be able to secretly hold \nlegislation is a troubling one. I hope we can move on with it. I think \nthis is an important piece of legislation.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana for his graciousness, and also the \nSenator from Nevada. I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this \nimportant issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/10/senate-section/article/S8416-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8416-S8420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                            2003--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OFFSHORE OIL LEASES.\n\n       (a) Congress finds that--\n       (1) There are 36 undeveloped oil leases on the land in the \n     Southern California planning area of the Outer Continental \n     Shelf that have been under review for an exceptionally long \n     period of time, some going back over thirty years, and have \n     yet to be approved for development pursuant to the Outer \n     Continental Shelf Lands Act:\n       (2) The oil companies that hold these 36 leases have \n     expressed an interest in retiring these leases in exchange \n     for equitable compensation and are engaged in settlement \n     negotiations with the Department of the Interior regarding \n     the retirement of these leases; and\n       (3) It would be a waste of taxpayer dollars to continue the \n     process for approval or permitting of these 36 leases when \n     both the lessees and the Department of the Interior have said \n     they expect there will be an agreement to retire these \n     leases.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that no funds should be \n     spent to approve any exploration, development, or production \n     plan for, or application for a permit to drill on the 36 \n     undeveloped leases while the lessees are discussing a \n     potential retirement of these leases with the Department of \n     the Interior.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the pending amendment, which I have offered \nat the request of Senator Boxer, is a sense-of-the-Senate amendment \nregarding southern California offshore oil leases. The amendment notes \nthat several leases have not been developed and that the leaseholders \nare negotiating with the Government to retire those leases. During \nthese negotiations, the amendment urges that no funds be spent on \ndevelopment of the leases.\n  The amendment has been agreed to by Senator Burns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would normally object to any amendment \nthat would withdraw any lands from energy development or consideration. \nHowever, this one is just a little bit different. This is already tied \nup in litigation. I think anytime we shield land from energy \nexploration, we do not do this country a great favor, nor do we help \nour situation in the Middle East.\n  So I think should it be in any other form--there are litigation \ndiscussions now ongoing that could possibly expose this Government to a \nmassive takings litigation. However, the way it is worded, it is only a \nsense of the Senate, and I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4523) was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BURNS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the amendment reallocates funding provided \nin the bill for Forest Legacy projects in the State of Utah. The \namendment is fully offset, and both sides have agreed to it. I urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4524) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate concerning adequate \n                 funding for the National Park Service)\n\n       On page 64, between lines 15 and 16, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1__. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR \n                   THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the National Park Service is responsible for the \n     preservation and management of the natural and cultural \n     resources of the National Park System for the enjoyment, \n     education, and inspiration of the present and future \n     generations;\n       (2) the National Park Service is the caretaker of some of \n     the most valued natural, cultural, and historical resources \n     of the United States;\n       (3) the National Park System provides countless \n     opportunities for the citizens of the United States to enjoy \n     the benefits of the heritage of the United States;\n       (4) the National Park Service is struggling to accommodate \n     an increasing number of visitors while maintaining the \n     National Park System; and\n       (5) in an effort to support the purposes of the National \n     Park System, in recent years Congress has, with respect to \n     units of the National Park System, substantially increased \n     the amount of funding available for operations, maintenance, \n     and capital projects.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should--\n       (1) to the maximum extent practicable, continue efforts to \n     increase operational funding for the National Park System; \n     and\n       (2) seek to eliminate the deferred maintenance backlog by \n     fiscal year 2007.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator Byrd and \nSenator Burns, along with their staffs, for the hard work they have put \ninto the Fiscal Year 2003 Interior Appropriations bill. I know that, \nwith the current budgetary constraints, it was not easy task to craft a \nbill which would fund all of the agencies and programs which fall under \nthis legislation. The FY 2003 Interior Appropriations bill includes \nclose to $.6 billion for the National Park Service. This is an increase \nof nearly $100 million above the FY 2002 funding level and I know it \nwill go a long way in helping the National Park Service meet their \nresponsibilities to maintain our National Park system. However, the \nNational Park Service currently has an estimated $600 million annual \nshortfall in operations funding which has significantly contributed to \na backlog of unmet needs, threatening the natural, historic, and \ncultural treasures that the National Park Service was established to \nprotect.\n  The National Park Service is charged with managing 83 million acres \nof land, 385 sites, habitat for 168 threatened or endangered species, \nmore than 80 million museum objects, 1.5 million archeological sites, \nan 26,000 historic structures. Park Service employees do a remarkable \njob of preserving our heritage and welcoming park visitors, nearly 300 \nmillion each year, however, it has become clear that if the Park \nService is to continue the good work they do, the Congress must provide \nsubstantial increase in funding so as to alleviate the maintenance \nbacklog which is contributing to the physical deterioration of our \nparks and cut-backs in services provided.\n  The Chichamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park, located in \nGeorgia and Tennessee, has more than 1,400 monuments and plaques, most \nerected during the 1890's and early 1900's to honor those who lost \ntheir lives during the Civil War. Many of these historic monuments have \nbeen vandalized or otherwise damaged over the years and have not been \nrepaired due to a lack of funding. Another National Park Service site \nin Georgia, the Ocmulgee National Monument, was established to preserve \nthe cultural remnants of 12,000 years of human habitation in the \nSoutheastern United States. While Ocmulgee boasts the second-largest \nmuseum collection in the park system, there is no museum curator on \nsite to monitor the artifacts. Funding limitations have also impaired \nthe Park Service's efforts to teach visitors about the park's cultural \nresources. Most recently, a week-long program introducing local youth \nto the park was discontinued, and instead of receiving a guided tour of \nthe park as in the past, visitors are fortunate if there is a ranger \navailable to hand them a brochure upon entering the park.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Thompson and I were joined by 26 of our \ncolleagues in requesting that the Senate Interior Appropriations bill \ninclude increased funding for the National Park Service. While the \nCommittee did not increase funding as much as we had hoped for, we are \nmost appreciative for the increase of nearly $100 million. Today, \nSenator Thompson and I have again worked together to introduce an \namendment expressing the Sense of the Senate that the National Park \nService is of tremendous importance and value to the American people \nand that the Congress should significantly increase operational funding \nand eliminate the deferred maintenance backlog by 2007. I thank Senator \nAkaka and Senator Graham for their leadership on this issue and \nappreciate their co-sponsorship of this amendment.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, as we debate the Interior Appropriations \nbill, I would like to take this opportunity to focus attention on \nunderinvestment in our national parks, an issue of particular \nimportance to me and the millions of Americans who visit our national \nparks each year. Earlier this year I joined 27 of my colleagues in \nwriting to Chairman Byrd and Senator Burns to request a $280 million \nincrease above the fiscal year 2002 level for the National Park \nService's operating budget. While the bill before us does not reach \nthat goal, it is a step in the right direction and provides almost $98 \nmillion more than last year's funding level. I thank Chairman Byrd and \nSenator Burns for their leadership, and especially for their commitment \nto continue working to increase operational funding for the National \nPark Service and to eliminate the deferred maintenance backlog by 2007.\n  Our national parks are a precious resource that we have a \nresponsibility to protect. I have seen first hand the important role \nthat our national parks play in conserving our natural resources and \nshaping our national heritage, and I have also witnessed the problems \nassociated with a lack of resources for our parks. The Great Smoky \nMountains National Park, located in my home State of Tennessee, is the \nNation's most visited national park, welcoming more visitors each year \nthan the Grand Canyon and Yosemite combined. Unfortunately, the Great \nSmoky Mountains National Park, like so many other parks across the \ncountry, is struggling to cope with an increasing number of visitors, a \ndeteriorating infrastructure, and a general lack of resources. While \nCongress has regularly increased funding to operate and maintain the \nNational Park\n\n[[Page S8418]]\n\nSystem, we need to do more. The Federal Government has a fundamental \nresponsibility to ensure that the Nation's 385 national parks are \npreserved for the enjoyment of current and future generations.\n  Since 1980, park visitation has grown by more than 40 percent and \nCongress has added more than 60 new park units. More visitors means \nmore stress on roads, campgrounds, and trails, and requires higher \nstaffing levels to ensure that visitors are kept safe and resources are \nprotected. One might say our parks are being loved to death, and \nCongress must make it a priority to provide the funding necessary to \nkeep pace with increasing needs. The threats facing the parks can no \nlonger be ignored, and each year of delay only compounds the problem.\n  The amendment I am offering with Senator Cleland makes clear the \nSenate's commitment to meeting our responsibility to our national \nparks. The amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that Congress \nshould, to the maximum extent practicable, continue efforts to increase \noperational funding for the National Park System and to eliminate the \ndeferred maintenance backlog by 2007. The President has promised to \naddress the maintenance backlog, and I commend his efforts. The \ndeterioration of our national parks did not happen overnight, and a \nsolution is going to require a long-term commitment from both the \nadministration and Congress.\n  The national parks exist for the use and enjoyment of all Americans \nand teach us important lessons about ourselves and the natural world in \nwhich we live. At a crucial time in our Nation's history, Americans \nshould able to visit our national parks and experience them as they \nwere meant to be enjoyed. A neglected and underfunded National Park \nSystem is not the legacy that I want to leave to our children and \ngrandchildren. I am pleased that the Senate has recognized the \nimportance of adequately funding our national parks, and it is my hope \nthat Congress will continue to provide increased funding in the years \nto come.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, Senator Cleland and \nSenator Thompson, in offering an amendment to the Interior \nAppropriations bill that shows the Senate's support for funding our \nnational parks.\n  I am cosponsoring this amendment after hearing comments from park \nemployees, park supporters, and park visitors about the importance of \nproviding adequate funds to maintain our nation's natural treasures \nduring my Third Annual National Parks Issues Forum, held at Zion \nNational Park in Utah.\n  Tomorrow marks one year since the horrific terrorist attacks on our \nNation. Events such as these remind us of the importance of having \nplaces of refuge were we can go to refresh and renew our spirits. John \nMuir wrote in his book Our National Parks, ``Thousands of tired, nerve-\nshaken, overcivilized people are beginning to find out that going to \nthe mountains is going home; that wildness is a necessity; and that \nmountain parks and reservations are useful not only as fountains of \ntimber and irrigating rivers but as fountains of life.''\n  John Muir's thoughts still ring true. Our national parks, be they \nmountains, deserts, or rivers of grass, are critically important places \nfor Americans to go and escape the trials of civilized life.\n  Our Nation's cultural and natural heritage are preserved in our \nparks. We have demonstrated our initial commitment to preserving this \nheritage by setting aside these special places as national parks. We \nmust now continue to demonstrate our commitment to these special places \nby providing a level of funding adequate to operate and maintain them.\n  Throughout the park system there are historic structures and \nbuildings that require rehabilitation; there are utility systems that \nrequire repair or replacement; there are roads that require paving. In \naddition there are units that are woefully understaffed. Given our \ncurrent fiscal constraints, we must be sure to invest each of our \ndollars in those places that will do the most good and make the biggest \nimpact in our parks.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge Senator Akaka's \nleadership on this and other issues of critical importance to the \nnational parks. Senator Akaka is the Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nNational Parks and I have long enjoyed our work together to improve our \nparks.\n  Like Senator Akaka, I believe that our national parks are worthy of \nour investment--worthy of our commitment. I urge my colleagues to help \nprovide our parks with an adequate level of funding.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, God blessed this Nation with an abundance \nof natural resources and places of unmatched natural beauty. I am so \nglad that as a Nation we have set aside portions of our land for the \nenjoyment of the American people and have preserved our heritage by the \nrestoration and maintenance of dozens of historic sites around America.\n  However over the course of my nearly thirty years in the Senate, I \nhave seen the Federal Government fumble year after year its stewardship \nover the lands it holds as a fiduciary for the American People.\n  The Federal Government has continued to add acre after acre year \nafter year, when it has been demonstrated that it cannot maintain what \nit already has. This has placed an enormous burden on the National Park \nService and other Federal agencies who manage and hold in trust land \nfor the American people.\n  The Park Service is charged with managing 385 sites which comprise 83 \nmillion acres of land drawing 300 million visitors per year. The \nService is also responsible for, among other things, the care of more \nthan 80 million museum artifacts that trace American history.\n  According to a report from the Congressional Research Service, the \nNational Park Service estimated that its national maintenance backlog \nwas $4.9 billion when it submitted its fiscal year 2002 budget request \nto the Congress. Let me say this again, $4.9 Billion.\n  The Appropriations Committee has recognized this and recommended an \nincrease of $97,990,000 above the fiscal year 2002 enacted level, and \n$500,000 above the budget request, and I'm glad the Committee included \nan additional $20,000,000 in to meet these needs. Included in that is a \n2.9 percent increase for base operations of National Parks in North \nCarolina. That is encouraging but the Federal Government needs to catch \nup.\n  According to the figures supplied to me by the National Park Service \nthe total amount for ``deferred repair/rehabilitation construction for \nthe National Park Units in North Carolina is $65,231,974.\n  My friend from Georgia, Mr. Cleland, and my friend from Tennessee, \nMr. Thompson, have offered a ``sense of the Senate'' resolution that \ncalls upon the Federal Government to catch up on the hundreds of \nmaintenance and repair projects in our national parks which I support.\n  Clearly, the Federal Government is behind the eight ball on its \nfiduciary duty to maintain and operate the National Park System.\n  In my State of North Carolina there are 9 sites within the State and \nthree other parks service units that we share with other States, \nincluding the Great Smoky Mountains National Park we share with \nTennessee, the Blue Ridge Parkway that we share with Virginia and the \nAppalachian National Scenic Trail that we share with the states of \nMaine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, \nNew Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia , Virginia, Tennessee \nand Georgia. There are a total of 416,620.1 acres of land that the \nNational Park Service manages for the federal government in North \nCarolina.\n  The Federal Government needs the resources for proper management and \ncatching up on the backlog of maintenance and construction projects on \nthe Blue Ridge Parkway, Appalachian Trail, Cape Hatteras National \nSeashore, Carl Sandburg Home and National Historic Site, Fort Raleigh \nNational Historic Site, Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Guilford \nCourthouse National Military Park, Moores Creek National Battlefield, \nand the Wright Brothers National Memorial.\n  These parks and historic sites are among the most visited in the \nnation and these units in North Carolina are among the most beautiful, \nspectacular and historically significant in the Nation. The first \npowered flight occurred\n\n[[Page S8419]]\n\nat the site of the Wright Brothers Memorial on December 17, 1903. Next \nyear America will gather at the Wright Brothers National Memorial to \ncelebrate the Centennial Anniversary of flight and I am grateful to the \nAppropriations Committee for providing needed funding for this event.\n  The Revolutionary War battle at the site of the Guilford Courthouse \nNational Military Park that was fought on March 15, 1781 is where \nGeneral Nathanael Greene and his army of 4,400 patriots severely \ncrippled Lord Cornwallis's professional troops of 1,900 men. Lord \nCornwallis lost a quarter of his army and almost a third of his \nofficers.\n  This was the largest and most hotly contested battle in the \nRevolutionary War's Southern Campaign and led to the American victory \nand British surrender at Yorktown seven months later.\n  The beauty of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, Cape Hatteras \nNational Seashore, Appalachian Trail and Blue Ridge Parkway are \nunmatched.\n  Our National Parks are like the front porch of America, they need to \nbe swept and keep clean and well maintained at all times because it is \na reflection of the America people. I do hope the Senate will pass this \nresolution and that the Federal Government will do a better job in the \nmonths and years ahead managing and maintaining land in the National \nPark Service system for our children and grandchildren.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this amendment, proposed by Senators Cleland \nand Thompson, is a sense of the Senate amendment pertaining to funding \nfor the National Park Service. While noting that Congress has \nsubstantially increased funding for the Park Service over the past few \nyears, the amendment urges Congress to continue that effort and to try \nto eliminate the maintenance backlog by fiscal year 2007. The amendment \nhas been cleared by both sides. It is my understanding Senator Burns \nhas agreed to the amendment.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, there is no objection on this side.

Mr. President, in Nevada, which is growing so rapidly, 87 \npercent of the land is owned by the Federal Government. There are a \nnumber of land applications dealing with all kinds of activities in \npublic lands, and the BLM has not had money to process those \napplications. What they have done, in an effort to try to speed things \nup, is they have had people who are actually moving the land \napplications come and help them in the offices. It just does not work \ngood, even though it may be right. Even though I hate to do this, we \nhave clarified the expenditure of funds so they will have more money to \nhire BLM people to do this rather than look to the outside sector, \nwhich is an obvious, apparent conflict of interest.

I support this amendment and \nunderstand it has been cleared on both sides.\n  Basically what this amendment does, it gives a little extra money to \nlook into the books and the financial situation at the park. We have \nheard some disparaging stories. The way we take care of those, as the \nsaying goes, is to look into it. It is going to take a little money to \ndo that.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, recently ABC ran a series of stories about \nthe National Park Service and discussed the $4.9 billion backlog of \ndeferred maintenance nationwide in our National Park System. One \nsegment mentioned that some operations and park programs may need to be \ncurtailed or discontinued as a result of budget shortfalls at \nYellowstone National Park.\n  To be absolutely fair, over the past few years both Senator Byrd and \nSenator Burns have been very generous to the National Park Service and \nto Yellowstone in particular.\n  Yellowstone is the world's first national park, created in 1872, and \none of the biggest. It stretches across volcanic plateaus in northwest \nWyoming and into southern Montana and Idaho, and contains more than 2 \nmillion acres of geysers, lakes, waterfalls, forests, bison, bears, and \ntourists. But more than that, Yellowstone is very rich in cultural, \nhistorical and natural resources, and in fact, represents--in one \npart--the multiple facets of park operations and programs found in the \nindividual 285 units of the System.\n  My amendment would use Yellowstone as a demonstration project for \nbusiness transformation. The National Park Service depends upon several \nsources of revenue to sustain operations and modernize facilities, \nincluding but not limited to, appropriations, fee income and revenue \nfrom concessioners, lease holders and permittees. These funding sources \nneed to be managed in the most cost-effective and efficient manner \npossible to ensure improvement of services to the park visitor and for \nthe protection of natural and cultural resources. Toward this end, I \nbelieve that improved state-of-the-art business practices need to be \nestablished in the National Park Service.\n  This amendment would require the Secretary of the Interior to \ncontract for an independent and comprehensive management, operational, \nperformance, and financial review of Yellowstone National Park. As I \nhave already stated Yellowstone National Park has a wide range of a \nnatural and cultural resources, programs and visitor services and \nprovides an optimal environment in which to identify and make \nrecommendations for improved management and operational practices that \ncan be proliferated throughout the National Park Service and transform \nmanagement to provide cost-effective, efficient and responsive \nprograms. I know, the lessons that we will learn from Yellowstone will \nhave application to the rest of the units within the System. I would \nsuggest that the eventual cost savings, redirection of expenditures, \nand cost efficiencies will more than pay for the cost of this study.\n  We all are aware that there is a backlog of maintenance, and Congress \nhas attempted to address the situation. But, I have to say that \nthrowing money at the problem does not guarantee that there will not be \na deferred maintenance backlog ten years from now. Unfortunately, we \nhave never systematically evaluated the management programs that \ncontributed to the backlog in the first place.\n  I believe this is a compelling need to establish new and better \nmodern business practices within the National Park Service. With the \npassage of this amendment we can take advantage of the expertise that \nthe private business sector has to offer so that we can redirect funds \nto address the backlog where we can, and more importantly, ensure that \nmeasures are taken to prevent a re-occurrence of programs and policies \nwhich led to the backlog we face today. I believe we can achieve these \ngoals while maintaining important park program and operations.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 4529) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have nothing further to bring before the \nSenate at this time.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I see no one else seeking recognition. I \nwould suggest we recess the Senate for the party caucuses.\n  Mr. REID. There is already an order in effect.\n  Mr. BURNS. I move we recess under the previous order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/10/senate-section/article/S8420-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8420]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I commend the chairman of the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, Senator Lieberman, for recognizing \nearly on that a major government reorganization should be considered in \nlight of the tragic events of September 11th and for his leadership in \nputting together a basic structure for a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity. I also praise President Bush for supporting the existing \ncongressional effort to elevate the authority and the status of the \nOffice of Homeland Security to a Cabinet level position that will be \nresponsive to the needs of the American people.\n  As we approach the anniversary of September 11th, Congress has been \ndiligently working to insure that America has a Department of Homeland \nSecurity that can be responsive to the challenges of the post September \n11th world. The Senate has spent the past few months exploring the \nbureaucratic obstacles that limited our capacity to identify and \nprevent the terrorist attacks of September 11th. We have considered in \nhearings whether the steps that have been taken to advance our \ncountry's safety and security since September 11 have been effective, \nand whether they adequately protect our most fundamental civil \nliberties.\n  The Congress has always responded to the challenge to protect this \nnation against any and all threats, including terrorism. I am committed \nto ensuring that as we build this new agency, we do so in manner that \nguarantees that basic fundamental rights are not lost or forgotten in a \nrush to be seen as doing something.\n  As the Senate moves forward in considering this new government \nstructure, I have been guided by two simple questions: Will this \nreorganization make all of us safer? And will it preserve our liberties \nas Americans? That inquiry should continue to guide our consideration \nfor a Department of Homeland Security.\n\n[[Page S8421]]\n\n  So as we move forward toward establishing a Department of Homeland \nSecurity, it is important for all of us to examine and discuss both the \nstrengths and weaknesses of the pending proposal.\n  All of us know that local law enforcement stands at the front line \nfor security in our neighborhoods and communities. The new Department \nshould be organized in a manner that helps and doesn't hinder local law \nenforcement. The Department of Homeland Security needs to insure that \nfederal, state and local law enforcement work together with the \nnecessary information, tools and resources that are required to adapt \nand respond to the evolving challenges our first responders are facing.\n  I am pleased that my bill, the First Responder Support Act, is part \nof the present proposal we are now discussing. I certainly want to \nthank my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, for her work in making \nour responsibility to first responders a priority in this bill.\n  The First Responder Support Act will help first responders get the \ninformation and training they need from the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. I am also introducing the First Responder Communication \nSupport Act to help communities who need communication systems to \nenable police, fire, EMS, and relief agencies to speak to one another \nin a time of crisis without overwhelming existing communication lines. \nWhether people face an act of terrorism or a tornado, in a time of \nemergency our first responders need to be able to communicate with one \nanother.\n  I am also concerned about our efforts to protect the public from the \nuse of weapons of mass destruction. The emerging chemical and \nbiological weapons of the 21st century present new challenges to our \nmilitary and to local first responders. The Weapons of Mass Destruction \nCivil Support Teams play a vital role in assisting local first \nresponders in investigating and combating these new threats. The \nSeptember 11 terrorist attacks emphasize the need to have full-time \nteams in each State.\n  I have filed an amendment that would require the Secretary of Defense \nto establish at least one Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support \nTeam in each State by September 30, 2003. The cost of establishing, \ntraining, equipping, and operating these new teams would be paid for \nfrom existing fiscal year 2003 Department of Defense resources, thus \nrequiring no additional spending while providing a critical level of \nprotection. As we rethink the security needs of our country, we should \nsupport the creation of an additional 23 full-time Weapons of Mass \nDestruction Civil Support Teams. Establishing these additional full-\ntime teams will improve the overall capacity and capability to prepare \nfor and respond to potential threats in the future. I look forward to \nworking with Chairman Levin and Chairman Lieberman on this effort.\n  We must remember that not every law enforcement purpose makes sense. \nThe administration's proposal to create the TIPS program appears to be \na way to begin domestic Government surveillance in our communities with \na motto not of ``love thy neighbor'' but ``spy on thy neighbor.'' I am \nconcerned that if some trained police officers have a difficulty \ndistinguishing between the proper and improper use of race in law \nenforcement activities, we are asking for real trouble if we ask \nuntrained and fearful ``citizen'' volunteers to report on their \nneighbors.\n  Workers in the Department of Homeland Security who will have the \nawesome responsibility of protecting us should have the basic job \nprotection their fellow Federal workers are granted. No one, including \nthe President, has shown how simple and basic job security will \njeopardize our national security. I believe we can protect our country \nat the same time that we protect our workers. In fact, we can better \nprotect our country if our workers' rights are well-protected, too.\n  I am concerned that the administration appears ready to use the \ncreation of a new Department of Homeland Security as an opportunity to \neliminate or weaken the civil service protections currently in place \nfor the Federal employees who would be transferred to the new \nDepartment. The civil service system was put into place in order to end \nthe corrupt patronage system that had permeated Government hiring. The \ncreation of a new Department should not be used as an excuse to roll \nback these protections.\n  In addition, I support the right of Federal workers to join a union \nand am troubled that the administration wants to strip existing union \nrepresentation and collective bargaining rights from many of these \nworkers. I also am troubled by the implication that union membership is \nsomehow a threat to our national security.\n  In light of September 11, there has been a tremendous amount of \ndiscussion about the FBI's ability to effectively gather intelligence \ninformation. It has become clear that federal intelligence gathering \nagencies, such as the FBI, need to do better in collecting, organizing \nand presenting basic information about domestic terrorism. I believe \nthat important first steps have been taken. In our desire to move \nagencies under one roof, however, we should not be afraid to ask if the \nmove will actually improve intelligence gathering or simply confuse us.\n  I also want to take a moment to lend my support to the immigration \nprovisions in the Lieberman substitute. There has been considerable \ndebate in recent years, and especially since September 11, on how best \nto re-organize the Immigration and Naturalization Service, so that we \ncan protect our Nation from those who would seek to enter the U.S. to \ndo harm, while we effectively and efficiently address the needs of \nbusinesses, families, students, and visitors who seek to enter our \nNation for lawful purposes.\n  The Lieberman substitute would wisely keep the service and \nenforcement functions of INS together in one Department; elevate the \nINS to a separate division within the new Department; keep visa \napproval authority within the Department of State; maintain the \nadjudication authority for immigration matters within the Department of \nJustice; and include a civil rights monitoring and oversight provision \nfor the important purpose of holding INS enforcement functions \naccountable.\n  I commend Senator Lieberman for including the ideas of Senators \nKennedy and Brownback, the distinguished chairman and ranking member, \nrespectively, of the Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Immigration. \nThese Senators came together to create a bipartisan INS reorganization \nplan. Immigrant advocates have long believed that in order to be \neffective and efficient, INS requires a strong leader with authority to \ncoordinate and balance the complementary functions of services and \nenforcement. The Lieberman substitute does just that. While we seek to \nsecure our Nation, we cannot ignore the importance of the flow of \nimmigrants and visitors to our Nation. They provide the nutrients of \nnew ideas, labor, and money that grows our economy and our Nation. I \nurge my colleagues to support the carefully crafted immigration \nprovisions contained in the Lieberman substitute.\n\n  I am especially pleased that the Lieberman substitute contains an \nimportant provision to ensure that the new Department complies with the \nNation's civil rights and privacy laws. As I have said, I believe that \nour consideration of this legislation should be guided by two \nprinciples: will this proposed re-organization make our country safer, \nand can we do so while respecting fundamental constitutional rights and \nprotections? Many Federal agencies have designated offices and \npersonnel to monitor agency policies and practices to ensure that they \ncomply with the Nation's civil rights laws. This new Department of \nHomeland Security, with its unprecedented array of law enforcement \npowers, should be no different.\n  It is absolutely critical that the new Department include civil \nrights and privacy monitoring and oversight functions. I support the \nLieberman substitute's requirement of a civil rights officer and \nprivacy officer. The civil rights officer would be Senate-confirmed and \nwould have responsibility to oversee and review Department policies to \nensure that they do not violate the Nation's civil rights laws. The \ncivil rights officer would refer matters that warrant further \ninvestigation to the new Department's inspector general. The Lieberman \nsubstitute would require the inspector general to designate an official \nto receive and review complaints alleging civil rights abuses\n\n[[Page S8422]]\n\nand submit reports on a semi-annual basis to Congress that detail any \ncivil rights abuses by employees and officials of the Department. Like \nthe civil rights officer, the privacy officer would have responsibility \nto oversee and review Department policies to ensure that they do not \nviolate the Nation's privacy laws.\n  I was pleased to join Senator Kennedy in urging that these civil \nrights and privacy oversight provisions be included in the bill. I \nthank Senator Kennedy for his leadership on this issue. I also want to \nthank Senator Lieberman for his recognition of the importance of these \naccountability provisions and his willingness to work with us. These \nprovisions are an important step toward ensuring that the policies and \npractices of the new Department will be consistent with the rights and \nprotections guaranteed by our Constitution. I look forward to \ncontinuing to work with Senator Lieberman to ensure that the new \nDepartment includes appropriate and effective civil rights and privacy \noversight provisions.\n  Finally, notwithstanding our desire to move rapidly to address the \nNation's safety, I believe we still have to ask ourselves if the cost \nof the Department is reasonable. I do have budget concerns with regard \nto the creation of this new Department. Safety for all Americans isn't \ninexpensive, but I don't want this new Department to unnecessarily \naggravate our budget problems.\n  When the President first announced his proposal for the creation of a \nDepartment of Homeland Security, he indicated that the reorganization \nof the existing agencies would not increase costs and in fact should \nactually realize savings.\n  That promise of net savings stands in contrast to the analysis of the \nproposal by the Congressional Budget Office, which estimates that the \nnew Department as proposed by this bill will add about $11 billion in \nnew costs over the next 5 years on top of the projected net spending \nfor the ongoing activities of the transferred agencies. And that $11 \nbillion in new costs does not include the cost of developing the \nintegrated information and communications systems authorized by the \nbill--systems with a price tag CBO states could exceed $1 billion.\n  I am told that when the Education Department and the Energy \nDepartment were created, they both exceeded their initial budgets by at \nleast 10 percent, and I don't want that to be the case with this new \nDepartment of Homeland Security.\n  We need an effective, responsive and efficient Department of Homeland \nSecurity. I believe we can do this in a manner that protects the \ncitizens who will depend on the Department and is fair to the employees \nwho will be in the agency. In the coming weeks, I look forward to the \ndebate on the shape and size of the Department with the belief that at \nthe end of our discussion a better and stronger plan for a Department \nof Homeland Security will emerge.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, the disturbing thing to this particular \nSenator--incidently, Senators are always disturbed--but in all candor, \nthe best way to recognize 9/11 of last year is to make certain that a \n9/11 does not occur again and that we correct the intelligence failure \nthat brought about 9/11.\n  With respect to actually assuring us that a 9/11 would never occur \nagain, we had that debate last Thursday relative to securing the \ncockpit of airplanes. We are depending on the White House to weigh in \nnow with their particular view. In my view, once that cockpit door is \nsecured, never to be opened in flight, a 9/11 could never happen again.\n  I speak advisedly. In the month of September of last year, I had the \nprivilege of meeting with the chief pilot of El Al, the Israeli \nairline. That is the one airline in the world--particularly, of course, \nin the Mideast, where you have suicidal terrorists--that would be \nsubject to a hijacking and people taking over the plane and running it \ninto a building.\n  They determined years ago the only way to prevent a hijacking was to \nnot give responsibility to the pilots for law and order on the flight \nitself--namely, a pistol and so forth to overpower any kind of \nattempted hijacking. Instead, they wanted the pilots to assume the \nresponsibility that the plane would never go into a building or never \nbe hijacked or taken to another country.\n  Over the last 30 years they have shown this is the right rule: Once \nthe door has been secured, it has never opened in flight.\n  I can hear the chief pilot of El Al. He said: Senator, I can tell you \nhere and now, if they are assaulting my wife in the cabin, I do not \nopen that door. I go straight to the ground, and law enforcement meets \nme. And whoever is causing the trouble is off to jail.\n  As a result, they have not had a hijacking in 30 years. Yes, they \nhave attacked the ticket counter of El Al in Los Angeles. But \nterrorists don't even hardly make an attempt to hijack an El Al plane \nbecause they know that, yes, they could cause trouble with the \npassengers but not with the crew, not with the plane itself. There is \nno way to take it over.\n  Let me embellish on that thought because we had a debate with respect \nto arming pilots with pistols. Many pilots wanted Congress to allow \npistols in the cockpit. The House has passed that, and the Senate on \nlast Thursday voted for that overwhelmingly.\n  What should be understood is, you have to remove the responsibility \nfrom that pilot. In other words, let's assume you have that pistol on \nthe pilots as they walk to and fro; that is another danger. And as they \nget in transatlantic flights, that is another forbidden practice--those \nkinds of things need to be considered. But more particularly, if a \nflight attendant is crying out: They are choking me, they are killing \nme, open the door. In my opinion, once that door is cracked open, the \npilot with the pistol might get off a shot or two. But as we saw on 9/\n11, there are now teams of suicide terrorists, five-member teams \nwilling to sacrifice one, two, or three people. The pilot might be able \nto kill three of them, but the other highjackers would still be coming \ninto that cockpit. They would take over that plane once that door is \ncracked, with pistols, machine guns, whatever else they have up there.\n  So it has to be categorical and clearly understood. People have \ncriticized me for saying this, but as I come into Reagan National \nAirport and see the sign, ``Welcome to Reagan National, Washington, \nDC,'' I would rather have a reflective sign saying, in Arabic: ``Try to \nhijack, go to jail.''\n  People will say: Why are you saying that in Arabic? I use Arabic \nnumerals regularly. I invaded Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. \nIncidentally, I have the highest esteem for the country of Tunisia \nbecause I traveled there not too long ago, and they have some 65 \npercent literacy and 80 percent home ownership. And the Foreign \nMinister told me, when I asked: How in the world did you ever do this? \nHe said: The secret is to let the women vote.\n  He said: As soon as we allowed women to vote in Tunisia, they wanted \nbetter schools for the children. They wanted nice homes for their \nfamilies.\n\n  In World War II, I was one of the first in the African campaign with \nColonel Anderson and the 178th Field Artillery. I wasn't in the \nfrontline unit. I am not trying to fudge on his bravery. But we went \ninto Tunisia. Now you can go into the city of Tunis itself and what was \nthe Dust Bowl during the war, looks like a golf course. They have \nturned the country around.\n  But the fact is, it was Muslim extremists who overtook the barracks \nin Lebanon, and who blew up barracks in Saudi Arabia. They blew up our \nEmbassy in Dar es Salaam in Tanzania. They blew up our Embassy in \nNairobi, Kenya. They blew up the USS Cole. Almost nine years ago they \ntried to blow up the World Trade Centers. All of those were Islamic \nteams that came and caused the blowing up.\n  So I am justified in saying this. I want those who are blowing us up \nto understand: try to hijack and go to jail.\n  As I relate all these particular incidents, I come right to the point \nof my amendment in the second degree to Senator Thompson. I was \nworking, and my staff was working with Senator Thompson's staff, to see \nif it was acceptable to him. He is not with us this afternoon, but we \nwill be glad to talk to him tomorrow and on Thursday because he and I \nhave the same intent. I think we have to fix the responsibility.\n  There is none better in the history of the United States of America \nthan old Harry Truman. He said: The buck stops here. He put that little \nsign on his desk.\n\n[[Page S8423]]\n\n  That has been the trouble. I don't fault President Bush. He didn't \nknow anything before 9/11. He was not properly informed. And having not \nbeen properly informed, he could do nothing to have prevented it. So it \nis not my role this afternoon, on the floor of the Senate, to find \nfault with the President himself.\n  But I think we have to fix that responsibility for national security \nwith him. In 1947, and later, as a Presidential directive, and then \nlater in statutory language, the National Security Council was \ninstituted. It says: ``the function of the Council shall be to advise \nthe President with respect to the integration of domestic, foreign, and \nmilitary policies relating to the national security so as to enable the \nmilitary services and the other departments and agencies of the \nGovernment to cooperate more effectively in matters involving the \nnational security.''\n  The problem is the make-up of the National Security Council. On it \nare the Vice President, Secretary of State, and the Secretary of \nDefense. It has been in bed some with the Secretary of Treasury. But \nthere are some others, like the Attorney General who should be \nincluded. The Attorney General has oversight of the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration, and we know that terrorism is financed by drugs. He has \nthe Border Patrol and the Immigration Service under him. He has all of \nthese entities. He would be the chief Cabinet officer as of this minute \nfor security, unless you get that Secretary of Homeland Security. But \nit still is going to be his professional teams that ensure security and \nprovide the domestic intelligence that the Council needs.\n  So that homeland security intelligence, wherever you have it--if you \nhave it at a Bureau or an office of homeland security in the White \nHouse, or a Department of Homeland Security with a particular \nassimilating and analytical role of intelligence, or as a department in \nCongress itself--wherever you have it, you still are going to have to \ntake whatever analysis, whatever finding, and fuse it at the National \nSecurity Council level.\n  If you were President of the United States, or I were President of \nthe United States, I would only have one particular briefing, one \nreport on my desk. Every hour the President gets them now with respect \nto political intelligence. He knows what the polls show in Nebraska and \nwhat the trends are in South Carolina. He has political polls on \nNovember given to him every hour just about. So they are constantly \ntaking that.\n  I want intelligence polls taken and reported to the President of the \nUnited States and fused at the National Security Council. The National \nSecurity Council has that responsibility. The particular Department of \nHomeland Security does not amend that particular statute. In fact, we \ncould pass a Department of Homeland Security in the next 10 minutes and \nyou could have a 9/11, because the very things that went wrong on 9/11 \nwould go wrong again. The very Departments that failed, starting with \nthe CIA is not included in the new Department. The Central Intelligence \nAgency knew about all of these things I have related. An article in \nthis week's Newsweek says that they knew they had persons who roomed \nwith the suicidal terrorists of 9/11 who commandeered the planes \nthemselves. We know of attempts made to run a plane into the Eiffel \nTower.\n  We know from the Philippines incident that the CIA knew they had \nplanned to run a plane into the CIA building. You can go down the \nlitany--all of this was known before 9/11. The CIA didn't even \ncorrelate it, didn't pay attention to it, and certainly didn't pass it \non and give it in the briefings to the National Security Council. I can \nhear Condoleezza Rice, the Director of the National Security Council, \nsaying, ``We never got anything specific.''\n  I want to be sure they get something specific. The Department of \nHomeland Security bill, now being debated on the floor of the Senate, \ncould pass and you would not have any of the Departments included that \nfailed on last September 11.\n  The CIA failed. The FBI had reports from the field that something is \nwrong. The field teams said people were coming in and getting flight \ntraining, and we ought to be looking into it. It didn't get past the \nsecond level. You have Coleen Rowley, from Minneapolis, saying in her \nmemo that they could be flying a plane into the World Trade Towers. We \nknew the World Trade Towers were vulnerable. They had already attacked \nthem in 1993. Here was a memo again that they didn't pay any attention \nto. She came all the way to Washington and talked to the folks in the \nFBI. Nothing was done. We know, of course, the National Security Agency \nhad something that said ``Tomorrow is zero hour.'' That was in Arabic.\n\n  People tell me that I will hurt somebody's feelings if I put up a \nsign in Arabic that reads: try to hijack and go to jail. They say that \nis typecasting, profiling. Well, I mean to profile. I want it \nunderstood. That is exactly what occurred--in Arabic, ``Tomorrow is \nzero hour.'' They got that on September 10 of last year, but they \ndidn't translate it at the National Security Agency until September \n12--after the tragedy.\n  Here we have everyone running up and down saying we are going to make \nsure 9/11 never happens again. Not with this bill. You might tinker \naround with what we already have on course.\n  Incidentally, of the 170,000 proposed staff for this Department, we \nalready have 110,000 of them together in one Department--the \nTransportation Department. We had a hearing this morning with Admiral \nLoy of the Transportation Security Administration. It is a blessing we \nhave him, because he knows what he is doing. He is moving and working. \nHe has the airports, the authority, Republicans and Democrats--\neverybody pulling together. He solved the biggest problem we have had \nwith respect to airline security. But he has the seaport security, the \nrail security, and Amtrak--the rail stations, the tunnels, and \neverything else of that kind; they are all in one Department. We \nhaven't been waiting.\n  If you had just the homeland security bill and it had an up-or-down \nvote this minute, without any amendments, I would have to vote against \nit. I don't want to mislead my constituents and say that I have voted \nfor homeland security, because I know with that bill I have not voted \nfor homeland security; I haven't done anything about the intelligence \nfailures of 9/11 of last year.\n  So, Mr. President, that is the attempt of my particular amendment--to \nget the National Security Council beefed up. By beefing up, I mean the \nPresident did put out an order in February after he took office last \nyear. You ought to see that particular order. It has included in \nvarious forms of the Council, the Overseas Private Investment \nCorporation, the Peace Corps, and everybody else. It was so inclusive \nas to really confuse rather than fix a responsibility, that the buck \nstops here.\n  I want to make it absolutely certain that this particular National \nSecurity Council needs to be beefed up, irrespective of whether we pass \na Department of Homeland Security, irrespective of whether they put an \nOffice of Homeland Security in the White House, as is presently \nconstituted with Governor Ridge, or whether they call it a bureau--and \nI certainly would go along with Senator Thompson with respect to the \nmatter of confirmation. I know if I were President, I would not want my \nstaff subject to the confirmation and to have to respond to the \nCongress. You elected me the President, you have given me the \nresponsibility, and the buck stops here. My Chief of Staff, head of my \nSecurity Council, and everything else like that, are my choice, and I \nhave my team, and I don't have to worry about the politics over in the \nlegislative branch as to confirmation and being responsible to \nsubpoenas coming over. We cannot subpoena the Director of the National \nSecurity Council. We should not be able to just subpoena willy-nilly. \nThey can say we just have to plead executive privilege.\n  Be that as it may, I think the distinguished Senator from Tennessee \nis off on the right track. He wants to make sure we don't have all this \nbureaucracy; in other words, if you are going to have a Department \ncollecting intelligence, you have the CIA collecting intelligence, you \nhave the National Security Council collecting intelligence, and you \nhave got domestic intelligence collected by the FBI.\n  You have the office in the White House trying to correlate and work \nwith it, but even that correlation has to be fused with international \nthreats,\n\n[[Page S8424]]\n\nwith foreign policy. There is only one place, and that is the National \nSecurity Council, as the Congress has already determined and as \ndetermined by none other than President Truman himself back in 1947, \n``The buck stops here.'' I do not want to have another buck stop in an \noffice here and a department here and another agency there and a CIA \nagent and a defense intelligence agent over here. We have intelligence \ncoming out of our ears. The reason this is not understood is we do not \nhave an independent Presidential commission investigating 9/11.\n  I was moved the other evening when we heard former Vice President \nMondale emphasize the need for that particular initiative. I joined in \nthat some months back, and I did so advisedly. The reason I do it is \nwhen you have the House and the Senate investigate intelligence, you \nhave a political split. It is 50 Republican and 50 Democratic. Having \nserved for 8 years on the Intelligence Committee I can tell you that we \nhad categorical sworn testimony to a certain effect, that was known by \nthe White House, and we had it on two occasions to verify it, but we \nnever could make that public because of 50 percent being Republican. \nThey just did not want it to surface because it was critical.\n  Incidentally, that same Intelligence Committee staff is not subject \nto a polygraph. I want to emphasize that for the simple reason that one \ncannot get a job with the Secret Service unless they are polygraphed. \nThey cannot get a job with the Central Intelligence Agency unless they \nare polygraphed. They cannot get a job with the FBI unless they are \npolygraphed. More particularly, they cannot get a job out there as a \nCapitol policeman unless they take a lie detector test.\n  I was told that certain information was not revealed to me by the \nCIA, as a member of the committee, because my staff--not my personal \nstaff but the staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee--had not had \nthe proper clearance.\n  I will never forget I had a constituent who was arrested in another \ncountry, and I was trying to get him out of that arrest. I had to \nstruggle to do it. The country involved said he was an agent of the CIA \nor had gotten briefings from the CIA. They categorically denied it. It \nwas a year and a half to 2 years later, I went into one country and \ntalked with the station agent. He said: Oh, Senator, you are from South \nCarolina.\n  I said: I certainly am. How is that?\n  He said: Well, I debriefed so and so. He was one of the best we ever \nhad.\n  That is how I found out about the lie saying that they never knew \nanything about him.\n  I served on the Hoover Commission in 1954 under GEN Mark Clark and \nPresident Herbert Hoover investigating the intelligence activities of \nthe United States of America. It was the Joe McCarthy days. We went \ninto the CIA, the CID, the Army, Navy, air intelligence, Secret \nService, Q clearance, and the Atomic Energy Commission, and all the \nrest of the intelligence divisions.\n  I have a slight background in intelligence. There is a lack of \ncoordination. In addition to having the buck stop here, you have to \nhave that coordination, and only the President of the United States can \nget that coordination. He has to get those involved on the Council. I \nhave talked to Director Mueller of the FBI because I oversee his \nappropriation. He says he has gotten CIA fellows over there. But then I \nhear reports that they are not always exchanging the information.\n\n  That information exchange and getting it all to the one Commander in \nChief to make a decision as to whether or not we have intelligence, for \nexample, with respect to a need to invade Iraq, that has to be \ncentralized, not at the Department of Homeland Security, not at an \nOffice of Homeland Security, but fused at the level of the National \nSecurity Council, reporting directly to the President of the United \nStates.\n  I have included in this amendment, in an advisory capacity to the \nCouncil, the Director of the FBI--as is the Director of the Central \nIntelligence Agency. He is also in an advisory capacity. But that one \nsummary intelligence report that is put on the President's desk early \nevery morning has to have the fused intelligence of domestic as well as \nforeign intelligence.\n  There is this idea now that we can beef up and fix that \nresponsibility. I am very much concerned, as I have tried to point out \nwith respect to this particular amendment--I am in step with the \ndistinguished Senator from Tennessee. He is trying to avoid further \nbureaucracy and further politics with respect to confirmation. You \nnever have the Director of the National Security Council confirmed or \nthe chief of staff. The Presiding Officer of the Senate or this \nparticular Senator would never have our chief of staff or \nadministrative AA assistant confirmed by the Senate. That is just more \nbureaucracy. I agree with Senator Thompson on that. But it still does \nnot fix that responsibility of the buck stopping there and that has to \nbe at the National Security Council level with the President of the \nUnited States, and nowhere else. There has to be one place in case we \never have anything that is even like 9/11, instead of people running \naround finger pointing, saying: This Department said, no, but the CIA \ndid not do it, but the FBI, well, the National Security Agency guy, no, \nwe did not find out from defense intelligence.\n  They knew. They should have told. We have intelligence, tens of \nbillions of dollars according to what I read in the newspapers. We have \nall kinds of entities running around with intelligence. Here we are \ngoing around and saying we are going to avoid a 9/11 by the institution \nof a Department of Homeland Security.\n  So this particular Senator has been working in that field. Namely, we \npassed 100 to 0, all Republicans and all Democrats, airport security. \nWe got together and we reported out of the Commerce Committee, and it \npassed the Senate 100 to 0, all Republicans and all Democrats, seaport \nsecurity. It is hung up over in the House with respect to the \nconference. I have at the desk rail security in an Amtrak bill by a \nvote of, I think it was, 20 to 3 out of the committee. So I have been \nworking in this field. I sat down last fall with the new Director of \nthe FBI, Bob Mueller. We gave him $750 million. We said: Straighten out \nyour computers, get those all working, reorganize your department, \ninstitute domestic intelligence.\n  We never wanted to do that. We shied away from domestic intelligence. \nWith the McCarthy days and the witch hunts, the un-American activities \nand all, we do not want to go down that road. But the terrorism war \nrequires an intelligence effort at the domestic level. Fine, you can \nhave a Department--we have it going right now, to tell the truth, and \nwe are trying to reorganize it under a new Secretary.\n  According to GAO, it is going to take 5 to 6 years to get it \norganized right, so we are going to have to depend on what we have.\n  I have been working in that particular field and just got through \nwith a hearing this morning with the new Administrator of the \nTransportation Security Administration in the Department of \nTransportation, and I think we are on course. But we are behind the \ncurve with respect to seaport security. We are behind the curve with \nrespect to rail security, with respect to actual intelligence security \nand correlating it. This bill absolutely leaves out all of the failures \nof last year, 9/11, and includes therein all of the good operative \nentities; namely, that there was nothing wrong with the Coast Guard \nthat would be included in the new Department, there was nothing wrong \nwith FEMA or the agriculture office that would be included in the new \nDepartment.\n\n  As they said in the Navy during World War II: When in danger, when in \ndoubt, run in circles, scream and shout.\n  We are running around here. We have a Department going, and it is \nsupposed to govern. I voted for homeland security. You did not. This \nbill could pass in the next 10 minutes and it would not correct the \nfailings of September 11. My amendment to the Thompson amendment would \nfix that responsibility at the National Security Council, so the buck \nwould stop there. The President of the United States would have to know \nwhat is going on. If he could not find out, this President would get \nrid of him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I listened very carefully to the comments of \nmy\n\n[[Page S8425]]\n\nfriend and colleague from South Carolina.

I \nhave not had a chance to speak on the bill as of yet, but I don't want \nto miss the opportunity of congratulating him and thanking him, and all \nof our colleagues, for the work he has done and to thank Senator \nHollings for his tireless efforts on related matters.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Washington Post on September 9 had \nan editorial titled ``Equity for Mental Illness.'' I ask unanimous \nconsent this editorial be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Washington Post, September 9, 2002]\n\n                       Equity for Mental Illness\n\n       Last spring President Bush announced a new commitment to \n     improving mental health care for Americans. He cited unfair \n     limits on treatment as one major obstacle to effective care \n     and pledged to seek legislation by year's end to require that \n     insurance plans treat mental illnesses in the same way they \n     treat other medical ailments. Now time is getting short and \n     the calendar is crowded, but Congress still should approve a \n     parity bill, and Mr. Bush, recalling his pledge, should help \n     make it happen.\n       This isn't the position we took when we last examined the \n     subject, last year, and many of the issues that troubled us \n     then haven't disappeared. Parity legislation is not a \n     panacea. It won't help the uninsured. There's a risk that, by \n     raising costs, it could cause some employers to weaken or \n     abandon existing coverage or charge employees more for \n     benefits. Congress tends to be much more interested in \n     providing benefits than in dealing with their costs: That's \n     especially true for a mandate like this, in which the costs \n     would be borne almost entirely by the private sector. \n     Businesses wrestling with double-digit increases in health \n     care costs are fighting any move that would add even \n     marginally to the problem.\n       But two factors now seem to us to outweigh those concerns. \n     The first is practical: Experience in both the federal \n     employees' insurance system and in states that have enacted \n     their own parity laws argues that, by managing care, insurers \n     can move toward equal treatment without crippling cost \n     increases. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that \n     enacting the parity bill now pending in Congress would add \n     just less than one percent to the overall national cost of \n     insurance premiums, though specific costs will vary from \n     business to business depending on what benefits are offered. \n     Insurers, CBO noted this spring, still will be able to \n     exercise the management tools that have been used in the past \n     to decide what treatments are appropriate and warranted, and \n     to hold down expenses. The right response to the gathering \n     health care crisis is to fix the system, not make the \n     mentally ill bear a disproportionate burden.\n       The second factor is one of fundamental fairness, and of \n     removing the stigma that for too long has shrouded mental \n     illness. Many mental disorders can be clearly diagnosed and \n     effectively treated; some can't. The same can be said of \n     cancers. The pending legislation would require large \n     employers who offer coverage for mental and other illness to \n     handle all disorders in essentially the same way: You can't \n     put treatment limits or financial requirements on mental \n     health benefits that are not imposed on physical ailments. \n     Insurers would not have to pay for what is not medically \n     effective. It's not a huge step, but it would help some \n     people get the treatment they need. It's right to level the \n     field.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I will read the opening paragraph:\n\n       Last spring President Bush announced the new commitment to \n     improving mental health care for Americans. He cited unfair \n     treatment as one major obstacle to effective care and pledged \n     to seek legislation to require the insurance plans to treat \n     mental illness in the same way they treat other medical \n     ailments. Now time is getting short and the calendar is \n     crowded, but Congress still should approve a parity bill, and \n     Mr. Bush, recalling his pledge, should help make it happen.\n       This isn't the position we took when we last examined the \n     subject.\n\n  As a coauthor of this legislation with Senator Domenici, I am \ngratified and moved that the Washington Post has come out with a very \nstrong editorial in favor of parity in mental health coverage. This \nlegislation is called the Mental Health Equity Treatment Act, with, by \nthe way, 67 Senators, two-thirds of the Senate, and 243 \nRepresentatives, including authors Marge Roukema and Patrick Kennedy, \nbipartisan in both the Senate and the House, in support of it.\n  The Washington Post says it is not a be-all or end-all. The \nWashington Post is absolutely right. But it at least is a huge step \ntoward ending the discrimination. And more or less, I argue, once we \nhave the coverage in the plans, the care will follow the money. And \nthere will be more of an infrastructure of care for people who do not \nget any help.\n  I don't know what has happened with the negotiations. There is no \nstronger advocate than my colleague, Senator Domenici. I was excited \nwhen the President announced his support. I thought the White House \nwould bring people together and we would have agreement in the House \nand the Senate and we would pass legislation. Frankly, I have not seen \na lot of negotiation take place. It has been a huge disappointment to \nme. I hope the White House will become fully engaged. It is not too \nlate.\n  The President went on record as saying: I want to see this \nlegislation passed; I want to see this discrimination ended. We need to \nsee those words backed by action.\n  What we call the Mental Health Equity Treatment Act has tremendous \nsupport. If the White House would become engaged in this, we can pass \nthis legislation. There are any number of different vehicles we still \nhave this month. I believe we can attach this legislation to one of \nthose vehicles and one of those appropriations bills or other pieces of \nlegislation. This legislation will pass. It will pass for a couple of \nreasons. It will pass because all of the families that have been \naffected by this illness--and there is not anybody in the Senate or the \nHouse who does not have a member of the family who has not been \naffected one way or the other--have stepped forward. They have become \ntheir own leaders. They have become their own citizen lobby. They \nbasically say it is time to end this discrimination. This is major \ncivil rights legislation.\n  It will pass. Last time, this became part of the Education, Labor, \nHealth and Human Services appropriations bill. Both Senator Harkin and \nSenator Specter were strong advocates of this matter when it went to \nconference committee. We had near unanimous support in the Senate. Then \nit was blocked last session by the House Republican leadership and the \nWhite House. But there were a number of Republicans who said: We are \nvery uncomfortable voting against this. Several of them, I believe, \nhave their own personal experiences in their own families or with \nfriends with mental illness. Several of them said: Look, if this comes \nback a year later and nothing has been done, we do not want to vote \nagainst this.\n\n  I come to the floor to include this very important editorial in the \nWashington Post in the Senate Record to bring this to my colleagues' \nattention. This is a change of position on the part of the Washington \nPost. The Washington Post points this out in their editorial.\n  Second, I remind the President that he has made a commitment to \nhelping pass this legislation this session, not to put it off year \nafter year after year. I hope he will back his words with the deed, the \ngood Hebrew word, ``mitzvah.''\n  Time is not neutral. We do not have a lot of time yet. There is a lot \nof good will in the Senate, both by Democrats and Republicans. \nCertainly, one of the key leaders is Senator Domenici. Nobody has done \nmore. I mention Marge Roukema and Patrick Kennedy on the House side. \nSenator Reid has done so much work. I could go on and on. The White \nHouse has been semi-missing in action. We need them to become engaged. \nI have no doubt we can pass this\n\n[[Page S8426]]\n\nin the Senate either on its own or as part of this appropriations bill \nor another bill. I worry there would be an effort to block it.\n  I think the President can do something wonderful. I think he can do \nsomething very positive. I think not only would he get a tremendous \namount of support in the Senate and the House, but he would get a lot \nof support from families and people all across the country.\n  For my own part, working with my colleague, Senator Domenici, I am \nready to put this amendment on to a bill. I am ready to do that. \nCertainly, we are going to do that in the Senate. We are going to get \nthis into a conference committee. If we get the support from the \nPresident, we will pass this legislation. It would be win-win-win.\n  The insurance industry will not love it. That is true. They will not \nbe in love with it. But it will be a win for the White House for doing \nsomething very good for people. It will be a win for both Democrats and \nRepublicans, Republicans and Democrats. Most important of all, it will \nmake a positive difference in the lives of many families and many \npeople across this country.\n  Let's get this done. Let's get the support from the White House. Mr. \nPresident, you said you were all for this. We need you. We need you to \nbe engaged. We need you to exert leadership. We need your support. If \nwe get your support, we will pass this legislation.\n  As we look toward September 11, and commemorate this tragic day in \nAmerica's history, we can be proud of the way in which the American \npeople rallied to support those who suffered such unspeakable losses in \ntheir lives. Many of us still feel the shock and the fear of that day, \nand while we can take great pride in the ways in which our country has \nrecovered, we know that for many, the grief and the trauma is still \nsharp and constant. We know more about how such events can leave scars \non the psyche of a country, as well as individuals. We know that many \nwho had suffered from mental illness prior to September 11 may find \nthey need treatment again. We know that many in New York and other \nparts of our country are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. \nWe show our strength as Americans when we respond not only with our \nstrength and outrage toward the perpetrators of this horror, but also \nwith compassion and support toward the victims.\n  I was pleased to sponsor support for programs that provided emergency \nmental health care for survivors and emergency workers and their \nfamilies in the Senate's bioterrorism bill and other legislation. But \nwe know that more is needed to improve the overall infrastructure of \nmental health care in our country's response to terrorism. People with \nmental illness are routinely denied decent mental health care. They are \nrequired to pay more for their care, and are given less access, simply \nbecause their illness is located in the brain, and not in another part \nof the body. While we can be proud as a country for our ongoing fight \nto reduce stigma against the mentally ill, we here in Congress should \nnot be so proud. Nor should the President. We have not yet done our job \nin truly helping those with mental illness by ensuring full mental \nhealth parity in insurance coverage.\n  The Mental Health Equitable Treatment Act, which I have sponsored \nwith Senator Pete Domenici, is poised to pass in this congress. This \nbill is more than ready to move forward and to be signed by the \nPresident. S. 543 enjoys the support of two-thirds of the Senate, 67 \nSenators, the majority of the House, 243 Representatives, and about 250 \norganizations representing health care, education, law enforcement, \ndisability, religious organizations, and many others. On June 6, more \nthan 2,000 people rallied at the Capitol in 100 degree heat to demand \nthat this legislation move forward. On April 29, President Bush \npublicly proclaimed his support for full mental health parity and vowed \nto work with Congress to make sure he signed a full mental health \nparity bill this year.\n  And today, the Washington Post, which has historically questioned the \nvalue of mental health parity, reversed its position in support of full \nmental health parity. The Post states on its editorial page, ``Now time \nis getting short and the calendar is crowded, but Congress still should \napprove a bill, and Mr. Bush, recalling his pledge, should help make it \nhappen.''\n  Throughout this Congress, I have continued to work with Senator \nDomenici, and with Senator Kennedy, who, as Chair of the HELP \ncommittee, has been so helpful in moving this bill forward. Senator \nDaschle has stated many times that this legislation is one of the \npriority issues for the Senate floor. I have worked with White House \nstaff to help clarify the intention of Congress in shaping this \nlegislation--that we expect it to be a comprehensive bill that does not \ndiscriminate against people by diagnosis. We have been open and \navailable to discussing issues of concern to other members and the \nWhite House. But we are still waiting? Why? Because the opponents of \nthis bill--the insurance industry--continue to try to influence their \nfriends at the White House and on Capitol Hill to either kill this \nbill, or weaken it so much that it would provide very little help to \nthose who are praying for its passage.\n  Every argument the opponents have tried to put forward--whether it is \ncost, or science, or treatment effectiveness--every one of these \narguments has been fought and won by the supporters of this bill. \nOpponents have challenged the CBO cost estimate of this bill not once, \nnot twice, but three times, to no avail. The cost of S. 543 is low: the \nestimated increase in premiums for full mental health parity, covering \nall diagnoses, is 0.9 percent.\n  The opposition also distorts the purpose and intention of the bill by \ntrying to limit it to only 5 percent of mental illness diagnoses. They \nknow there is no scientific or even economic basis for restricting \ncoverage in this way, but they continue these destructive methods as \none more way to try to kill the bill. They resort to ridicule by \ntrivializing the pain and reality of mental illness and the toll it \ntakes on the lives of those with this illness and their families. This \nis an outrage, and we cannot allow such tactics to destroy the \ndemocratic process.\n\n  We all are very aware of how much work is remaining on our Senate \ncalendar, much of which is so important to our country. But here, in \nthis piece of legislation, we can show true bipartisan support, along \nwith solidarity with the President, for those with mental illness. This \nbill will help those with chronic mental illnesses, those with acute \ndepression, anxiety, or PTSD resulting from the trauma of September 11, \nchildren with autism or eating disorders, and the millions of other \nAmericans with mental illness. Without treatment, mental illness can \nworsen, and can even lead to death. We cannot as a country allow people \nwith mental illness to be treated as second-class citizens any longer. \nAs the Post said today,``The right response to the gathering health \ncare crisis is to fix the system, not make the mentally ill bear a \ndisproportionate burden.''\n  When President Bush spoke in support of full mental health parity, we \nin the Senate had already done our job. We had invested many months in \nbipartisan meetings to shape a bill that respected the business \ncommunity, the insurance industry, and the needs of those with mental \nillness. This is why this bill has the support of the majority of \nCongress and about 250 organizations who represent millions of \nAmericans.\n  It is time for President Bush to speak again, to publicly support \nthis bipartisan, bicameral bill that clearly has the support of the \nAmerican people. The House has finally held hearings on this, and I \nwant to thank those committees for doing so. The hearings made it \npossible for witnesses to expose the arguments of the insurance \nindustry for what they are. The opposition is based on nothing more \nthan discrimination and protecting the corporate bottom line.\n  I want President Bush to be confident that he has my continued \nsupport to do everything possible to pass this legislation. But I ask \nhim now to follow through on the promise he made in New Mexico to \nsupport full mental health parity. This legislation is ready to move \nforward. The President asked to sign a full mental health parity bill. \nThere is nothing stopping this bill except the politics of the \ninsurance industry. I ask President Bush to put the needs of those \nsuffering from mental illness first, to help prevent further suffering \nand deaths, and to ease the\n\n[[Page S8427]]\n\npain of those scarred by September 11 by helping to make treatment \navailable to those who need it. I ask him to urge Republican \nCongressional leaders to support this legislation. I ask him to endorse \nS. 543/H.R. 4066.\n  Within the constraints of the Senate calendar, this bill may move \nforward independently, or we may again attach it to an appropriations \nbill, as we did last year. With the tremendous support for this bill on \nand off the Hill, we have these options. However, when the bill moved \nforward on LHHS appropriations in 2001, 10 House members voted to kill \nthis bill, and President Bush wrote a letter to Senator Domenici \npromising to help pass it this year. I ask the President to follow \nthrough on that promise. I ask him to prevent the insurance lobby from \nkilling this bill again. Our country needs this legislation, and the \nmajority of Americans have made it clear that they want it now.\n  I look forward to the day when people with mental illness receive \ndecent, humane, and timely mental health care. It will be a good day \nfor our country. I ask the President to make sure that this day comes \nsoon.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The Presiding Officer.

Mr. President, as we approach the anniversary of the \nSeptember 11 tragedy, our Nation is in the midst of a national debate \nabout war with Iraq.\n  I am sure the presiding Senator recalls, as I do, graphically, that \nday just a year ago, on September 11, when the Capitol Building was \nevacuated. During the course of that evacuation, it finally hit me, as \nI stood on the grass outside the Capitol and was looking at this \nbuilding, I was looking at the last building ever invaded by a foreign \narmy on the continental United States soil, when the British attacked \nthe Capitol during the War of 1812. That struck me as I stood there and \nreflected that once again an enemy had struck the United States home.\n  I never would have imagined, when I came to work that week, that by \nthe end of the week I would be voting unanimously with my colleagues in \nthe Senate, Democrats and Republicans, to give to the President of the \nUnited States the authority to go to war and the resources to go to \nwar. It happened so quickly, but it was the right thing to do. We \nunderstood that the United States was in peril, was in danger--and \nstill is--from the forces of terrorism around the world. We stood as \none, in a bipartisan way, to back the President, to fight this war on \nterrorism, to go after those who were responsible for the September 11 \ntragedy which struck the United States.\n  Now, here we are a year later. The war on terrorism continues. Few, \nif any, would say that it is resolved or that we have won it. And we \nare debating the possibility of another war against another enemy. \nOsama bin Laden has not been captured or accounted for. The major \nleaders in al-Qaida are still on the loose somewhere. We believe al-\nQaida still has a network of sleepers in 60 nations around the world. \nAfghanistan, the first battleground in the war against terrorism in the \n21st century, is still not a stable and safe country. Hamid Karzai, the \nPresident of Afghanistan, barely survived an assassination attempt last \nweek. We have thousands of American troops still on the ground there. I \nhad the honor to meet with some of them last January; our hearts and \nprayers are with them every single day. But that war on terrorism still \ncontinues.\n  Yet the administration comes forward and tells us we still have to \nthink about the possibility of another war, in this case a war against \nIraq. Indeed, it is possible that within a few days or maybe a few \nweeks the people of the United States of America, through their Members \nof Congress, will be asked to vote on whether to go to war against \nIraq. It is hard to believe the events are moving so quickly that we \nwould be declaring a second war within little more than a year of the \nSeptember 11 attack.\n  Last Sunday on ``Meet the Press,'' Vice President Cheney indicated \nthat the administration would like the Congress to vote on Iraq prior \nto adjourning this October. Do you realize that is a matter of weeks--\nweeks, before we would be called on to make this momentous decision? \nBecause this is not a matter of high-altitude bombing when it comes to \nIraq. We wouldn't have the luxury of that type of warfare. We are \ntalking about, in the President's words, ``regime change.'' We are \ntalking about removing Saddam Hussein from power, not peacefully but \nwith force. That would involve, I am afraid, land forces invading, the \ntype of war we have not seen in many decades in the United States.\n  We recall the Persian Gulf war. It was a much different situation, a \nlittle over 10 years ago, precipitated by Saddam Hussein's invasion and \noccupation of Kuwait: The formation of a coalition led by the United \nStates but also with the United Nations and allies around the world, \nincluding many Arab States who joined us.\n  We fought to remove Saddam Hussein from Kuwait. We were successful in \ndoing that. We had logistical support. We positioned our troops in \nSaudi Arabia and nearby. We had a broad coalition. We were forcing \nSaddam Hussein out of a territory he had occupied.\n  This is a far different challenge if we invade Iraq--different in \nthat the coalition today consists of England and the United States, and \nno others. Logistical support is hard to find because the countries \nsurrounding Iraq have basically told us they will not support us in \nthis effort. Frankly, we would be fighting Saddam Hussein on his own \nterritory, which gives him a home field advantage, which most military \nexperts concede. Would we be successful ultimately? Yes--at some cost \nand at some price over some period of time. I have no doubt the \nAmerican military--the very best in the world. Hussein would be gone. I \ncan't tell you what it would cost.\n  In the midst of the Kuwait situation, Saddam Hussein didn't use \nchemical and biological weapons, which we believe he has, but instead \nhe decided to fire Scud missiles on Israel--kind of a third party to \nthis conversation--hoping, I am sure, that he would destabilize the \nMiddle East and cause such an uproar and consternation that the United \nStates would withdraw. It didn't work. Sadly, Israelis died in the \nprocess.\n  This time, we are not talking about moving Iraqi troops out of Kuwait \nbut actually killing and capturing Saddam Hussein. To what lengths \nwould he go in response? What victims would he seek? He doesn't have \nmissiles to reach the United States, but he has the capacity to train \nwhat missiles he does have on nearby neighbors such as Israel.\n  Vice President Cheney said that before the October adjournment, \nCongress would be asked to ``take a position and support whatever the \nPresident needs to have done in order to deal with this very critical \nproblem.''\n  By most definitions, that is article I, section 8, clause 11, of the \nConstitution\n\n[[Page S8428]]\n\nwhich gives the Congress, and the Congress alone, the power to declare \nwar. The people who wrote that Constitution--the Founding Fathers--had \nseen a king in action, a king who had dragged his country into wars, \nand said that the United States would be different. We will never have \na President to take us into a war. The American people will make that \nchoice through Members of Congress--Members of the House elected every \n2 years, and the Senate every 6 years. They will make the call, and do \nit very explicitly.\n  Vice President Cheney is saying to Congress: It is your turn to make \nthis decision.\n  The decision to go to war is the most significant decision any \ngovernment can make, and Congress plays an essential role. We and the \nexecutive branch need to have all the relevant facts analyzed as \nthoroughly and objectively as possible before making the decision to \nput America's military men and women in harm's way.\n  Senior administration officials publicly identified Iraq's \ndevelopment of weapons of mass destruction and the potential of Iraq's \ntransfer of these weapons to terrorist groups as the primary threat to \nour Nation. Ultimately, our Government must rely on the intelligence \ncommunity to make the most thorough and unbiased analytic assessment of \nthe current and projected status of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction \ninfrastructure, regardless of whether the analytic judgments conform or \nconflict with stated U.S. policy. In other words, we are saying that \nthe intelligence community should give us the unvarnished truth, tell \nus what Iraq has and its likely capability.\n  It is interesting, if you look at the countries that the Bush \nadministration designated as part of the axis of evil--North Korea, \nIran, and Iraq--of the three, the military capabilities of North Korea \nand Iran far surpass the capability of Iraq. We know that in the case \nwith North Korea, and probably Iran as well, they have nuclear weapons \ntoday. We also know they are working on developing long-range missiles. \nWe believe North Korea is the closest to developing missiles which \ncould make it to the shores of the United States. But we think Iran is \ntrying to do the same thing.\n  All that I am telling you is a matter of public information. We know \nthis. We know what their capability is. When you look at the status of \nthe three countries which the President said are the axis of evil, Iraq \nclearly ranks third. If all three are threats and enemies to the United \nStates, why is it that the administration has focused in on Iraq, which \nto our knowledge does not have nuclear weapons today nor the ability to \ndeliver any type of long-range weaponry against the United States?\n  As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I am \ndeeply concerned that the intelligence community has not completed the \nmost basic document which is asked of them before the United States \nmakes such a critical life-or-death decision.\n  It is within the power of the Director of the CIA, George Tenet, to \norder a national intelligence estimate, known as an NIE. National \nintelligence estimates bring together all the agencies of the Federal \nGovernment involved in intelligence, sits them down, and collects and \ncoordinate all of their information to reach the best possible \nconclusion he can come up with.\n  I was stunned to learn last week that we have not produced a national \nintelligence estimate showing the current state of weapons of mass \ndestruction in Iraq. What is incredible, with all of the statements \nmade by members of this administration about those weapons, is the fact \nthat the intelligence community has not been brought together.\n  If we learned anything from September 11 of last year, we learned, \nwhen it came to the intelligence out there at the FBI and the CIA and \nother agencies, that no one ever brought it together. Had we been able \nto bring it together by September 10, could we have avoided September \n11? I am not sure. I wouldn't say that. But we certainly would have \nappreciated the threat a lot better, and perhaps we would have been \nprepared a lot better. Maybe--just maybe--we might have avoided some or \nall of the tragedy. But we didn't do it.\n  Time and again since then as we looked back on last year, we have \nsaid we have to be better prepared, with better communications and \nbetter coordination of information from outside the country and inside, \nand bring it all together so we can make the best decision.\n  When we are talking about a possible invasion of Iraq and a war \nagainst Iraq, why haven't we really created the most basic document \nthat we have the power to create in this Government--the national \nintelligence estimate--so we know exactly what we may be up against in \nIraq? It has not been done.\n  This morning, I handed a letter to the deputy to Director Tenet \nasking that he give it to the Director personally, asking that they \nmove as quickly as possible to establish and create this national \nintelligence estimate. Once it is established, I think we should meet \non Capitol Hill--the Senate and the House Intelligence Committees. We \nshould have classified hearing on things that can't be discussed \npublicly about this NIE, and then a public hearing as well to share \nwith the American people, without compromising in any way the safety \nand security of the United States, as much information as we possibly \ncan about the current state of affairs in Iraq.\n\n  National intelligence estimates are the Director of Central \nIntelligence's most authoritative written judgments concerning national \nsecurity issues. They contain the coordinated judgments of the entire \nintelligence community regarding the likely course of future events. \nThey provide not just a snapshot of a particular national security \nproblem today but a coordinated assessment of how that problem might \nevolve over the next several years. This is the vital policy planning \ntool for our Nation's policymakers.\n  Let me tell you the many components of the U.S. intelligence \ncommunity are worthy agencies. Each and every one of them does a good \njob of intelligence collection--the Central Intelligence Agency, the \nDefense Intelligence Agency, the Department of State Intelligence and \nResearch Bureau, and the Department of Energy's Intelligence Office \nwhich is critical to doing an assessment of nuclear capability, and the \nNational Security Agency, just to name a few. They provide analytic \nassessments on an hour-to-hour, day-to-day basis. They can tell us \nbetter than any other group the current situation in Iraq. We need to \nknow what their consensus opinion is before we decide in advance \nwhether or not this war should be undertaken. I firmly believe that \npolicymakers in both the executive branch and the Congress--the \nPresident, the White House, the Department of Defense, the Department \nof State, and the Congress--would benefit from the production of a \ncoordinated consensus document produced by all relevant components of \nthe intelligence community on the current and projected status of \nIraq's weapons of mass destruction.\n  The letter I sent to Director Tenet asked him to initiate this \nprocess as quickly as possible and to produce the NIE within several \nweeks. I requested that an unclassified summary of it be produced, as \nhas been done in the past, so the American public can better understand \nthis vitally important national security issue.\n  Let me tell you that during the time I served in the Congress--the \nHouse and the Senate--there is no moment I recall with more pain in my \nheart than the debate a little over 10 years ago about the Persian Gulf \nwar. After we persuaded President Bush's father to follow the \nConstitution, to come to Congress and to seek the authority of the \nAmerican people and the permission and approval of Congress before \ninitiating that war, we then engaged in a debate--a long debate. I \nthink virtually every Member of the House of Representatives took the \nfloor over a 2- or 3-day period of time. The House met continuously. In \nthat period of time, each of us stood in the well of the House of \nRepresentatives--as we did in the Senate Chamber here--and spoke our \nhearts about the challenge we faced and the vote we faced. We knew that \nif a vote were cast to go to war, innocent people would die and that \nAmerican soldiers and American sailors and marines and airmen would \nhave their lives on the line.\n\n  It meant a lot to me personally because of a friend of mine, who was \na Marine at the time--I knew his parents well. They were from \nSpringfield, IL. I\n\n[[Page S8429]]\n\nhad known his mother and father for many years. They came to me early \non when the debate got started and said: We are worried to death about \nour son. Really, our hope for the future of our family is in the \nMarines. He is there in the Persian Gulf, and we sure don't want to see \nanything happen to him.\n  I assured them that I would think about him constantly as I made my \ndecision on the Persian Gulf war. Of course, we all recall what \nhappened. Finally, after the approval was given, the war was initiated. \nThe land war did not take but 2 or 3 days and it was over. And I \nthought, at the time, what a great relief it was to be able to call his \nparents and tell them that it had ended so quickly and so well.\n  Little did I know that Christian Porter of the U.S. Marine Corps from \nSpringfield, IL, was one of the several hundred American casualties in \nthat war. This young man, whom we all worried about so much, was the \nvictim of friendly fire.\n  I went to his funeral service in Springfield and to the veterans \ncemetery afterwards. My heart was broken for that family. But it was a \ngood reminder for this Member of Congress--now a Member of the Senate--\nto remember what war is all about. It is about the potential loss of \nlife of many innocent people. It is about being in harm's way for many \nAmericans in uniform.\n  We have to take this responsibility very seriously. And if we are \ngoing to take it seriously, we must insist, in Congress, that the \nadministration produce the clear and convincing evidence that an \ninvasion of Iraq is the only option available to us to bring this \npotential threat under control.\n  If this administration cannot produce a National Intelligence \nEstimate which comes to that same conclusion, then, frankly, those of \nus who have listened to the heavy rhetoric over the last several weeks \nwill understand that, when it comes to the evidence, there is something \nlacking.\n  It is time for the administration to rise to the occasion, to produce \nthis evidence, as has been asked for and been produced so many times in \nthe past when America's national security was at risk. We cannot accept \nanything less than that before any Member of the House or the Senate is \nasked to vote on this critical question of going to war.\n  We have to say to the administration: Bring forward your best \nevidence and your best arguments so that, ultimately, when we make this \nmomentous and historic decision, we can go back to the States and \npeople who we represent and say that we have dispatched our \nresponsibility in a credible, good-faith manner, that we have done \neverything possible to understand the nature of the threat, and the \nbest response of the United States.\n  War is the last option. We have to know every element before we make \nthat decision. We have to exhaust every other opportunity before we \nreach it.\n  On Thursday, the President will be at the United Nations in New York. \nI am certain he is going to remind them that Saddam Hussein is a thug, \nthat he has been a threat to his own people, to the region, and to \npeople around the world with his weapons of mass destruction. He will, \nundoubtedly, remind them of his cruel invasion of Kuwait, which \nmobilized the United Nations to defeat him and to displace his troops \nfrom Kuwait. He will, undoubtedly, remind them of what has happened \nsince: when the United Nations resolution, which condemns and prohibits \nIraq from ever having weapons of mass destruction, has been ignored by \nSaddam Hussein; how the inspectors, some 4 years ago, were pushed out \nof his country; and how this man has literally, as a thug, ruled this \nnation in a manner and form that most civilized countries in the world \nfind reprehensible.\n  All of those things, I will concede, are true. But the next question \nfacing the United Nations and facing the United States and its people, \nthrough its elected representatives in Congress, is: Is it the right \nthing for us to do?\n  We cannot make the right decision without the best information. And \nthe production of the National Intelligence Estimate will give us that \ninformation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/10/senate-section/article/S8429-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8429-S8431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               STAYING IN TOUCH WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the President talks a lot about the coffee \nshop in Crawford, TX, which brings to mind Uncle Josh and Aunt Nancy's \nSmokehouse in West Virginia where I have been talking with people for a \nlong time. You ought to come down to that shop sometime--Uncle Josh and \nAunt Nancy's Smokehouse. I talk with those people quite often. We have \none of those in every State, I suppose. I suppose each of the Senators \nhere has a coffee shop such as the one in Crawford, TX, or like Uncle \nJosh and Aunt Nancy's Smokehouse in their State. So I have one of \nthose.\n  It is good to get back home and kind of get the feel of the people \nand ``press the flesh'' a little, as Lyndon Johnson used to say, and \nknow what they are saying back there in that coffee shop.\n  But, Madam President, despite all of his talk about staying in touch \nwith the people at the coffee shop in Crawford, TX, the President seems \nto have lost touch with the needs of the American people. I worry that \nthe extra caffeine must have affected the President's ability to take \nthe pulse of America. After looking at some of the administration's \nactions over the past few weeks, I am almost certain of it.\n  At almost every turn, the President seems to be a day late and a \ndollar short. Let me just give a few examples. On July 16, the House \nadded $700 million of supplemental funding to the Interior bill to \nfight fires that are raging across this Nation. The administration, \nthrough the Office of Management and Budget, wrote to the Congress and \nstrongly objected to that funding. Yet on August 28--just 6 weeks \nlater--the President requested $825 million for emergency firefighting \nfunding. It is a complete about-face.\n  In mid-July, the White House, through the Office of Management and \nBudget, again pressed Congress to reduce the size of the supplemental \nthat was then in conference. The OMB Director, Mitch Daniels, \nrecommended that conferees on the bill reduce funding for the \nTransportation Security Administration by $219 million. The conferees \nacceded to the administration's request. Yet on September 3--just 6 \nweeks later--the President requested that $219 million and an \nadditional $327 million for the Transportation Security Administration. \nThat is $546 million that, 6 weeks earlier, the administration did not \nthink was necessary.\n  In late July, Congress approved $200 million for economic assistance \nto Israel and $50 million of disaster assistance for Palestinians, \nwhich was not requested by the President. The President had until \nSeptember 1 to designate the funds as emergency and, thus, make the \nfunds available to spend. The President rejected the funding on \nSeptember 1. He could have had it then. All he needed to do was sign \nhis name. No, he rejected it on September 1. But 2 days later, on \nSeptember 3, the President requested--you guessed it--$250 million for \nthe very same purpose. Are we seeing a pattern here? It is as plain as \nthe noonday Sun on a cloudless sky. On September 4, the administration \nwrote Congress to stress its desire for Congress to restrain spending \nby keeping spending for the fiscal year that begins October 1 to a \nlevel of $759 billion, and yet on August 2 and September 3 the \nPresident requested $1.3 billion of additional funding and proposed no \noffsets for that spending.\n\n  The Congressional Budget Office now estimates that the President has \nrequested $760.5 billion for the fiscal year that begins October 1, and \nyet the President insists we spend only $759 billion--that far and no \nfarther, $759 billion. This President seems to rely on the same types \nof accounting techniques with regard to homeland security that are \ncausing such problems in corporate America.\n  The President and his administration love to tell Americans that we \nare constantly at risk of new terrorist attacks. The President's \nCabinet members have been out in great force time\n\n[[Page S8430]]\n\nand time again putting the country on alert for a possible terrorist \nattack. We have been told to watch the bridges, watch the fuel trucks, \nwatch the banks. Remember the little boy who cried wolf too often, too \nmany times?\n  So we are constantly at risk, the administration says. In fact, just \nthis afternoon the administration raised the Nation's level of alert \nfrom yellow to orange, believing there is a high risk for a terrorist \nattack.\n  I have been thinking that, too. I suppose most people in this country \nhave been concerned about that as well. Apparently, security concerns \nhave grown by such an extent in the last 24 hours that Americans at \nhome and around the world are being told to be extra vigilant and \nalert. Specifically, the Attorney General pointed to new threats aimed \nat embassies overseas, at our Nation's transportation network, and at \nthe symbols and monuments of our country. That is why Congress \noverwhelmingly included in the emergency supplemental package $10 \nmillion for embassy security. That is why Congress passed $17.7 million \nfor security at the Washington Monument and the Jefferson Memorial. \nThat is why Congress approved $150 million for airport security. That \nis why Congress approved another $42 million for security at air \ntraffic control towers.\n  Congress has not been asleep at the wheel. Congress has been acting \nlike Paul Revere in saying: Alert, rise, for the day is passing, and \nyou lie sleeping on. Others have girded their armor and forth to battle \nhave gone. So Congress has been sounding this alert. That is why \nCongress approved $150 million for airport security and another $42 \nmillion for security at air traffic control towers, but the \nadministration rejected those items and labeled them as wasteful \nspending.\n  Wasteful, my foot. There is nothing wasteful about investing in the \nsecurity of the American people. Hear me down there at the other end of \nthe avenue. Hear me, Mr. President. There is nothing wasteful about \ninvesting in the security of the American people who send us to \nWashington, whose taxes pay the bills, whose sons and daughters give \ntheir blood in wars--the American people.\n  The only thing wasted by the President's rejection of these funds is \ntime, time necessary to put these dollars to work and put them to work \nrightly, prudently, carefully, to put these dollars to work and to \nprotect American lives.\n  The administration is right to warn America when it learns of new, \ncredible terrorist threats, whether at home or abroad. However, \nAmericans must have the tools to secure our homeland. The homeland \ndefense problem cannot be solved simply by moving boxes around on an \norganizational flowchart or by ``now you see it, now you don't'' \nfunding shenanigans.\n\n  A few weeks ago, Congress approved $2.5 billion for homeland defense \nprograms, $2.5 billion that was put into legislation by this Senate \nthrough its Appropriations Committee, in a bipartisan display of \nsupport; $2.5 billion for homeland defense programs to secure our \nports, our river ports, our seaports, to secure our airports, to secure \nour nuclear facilities, to train and equip our Nation's police and \nfirefighters. Those are the people who ran up the steps, those are the \npeople who sought to protect the lives of others, and those are the \npeople who gave their own lives to save the lives of others. Those are \nthe people who have now left widows and orphans, happy dreams forever \ngone. That is what Congress was thinking of when we put that money in \nthe bill. This funding would have addressed the very security concerns \nthe administration outlined this very afternoon.\n  The first question that was ever asked in the history of the human \nrace was, ``Where art thou?'' When God came in the cool of the day, \nwalking in the Garden of Eden looking for Adam, Adam was in hiding. God \nsaid, ``Adam, where art thou?'' That was the first question that was \never asked in the history of the human race: ``Adam, where art thou?''\n  I say, where were you? The people will say to the administration, \nwhere were you? Where were you when the Congress passed that measure \nproviding $2.5 billion for the security, for the welfare, and for the \nprotection of the American people? Where were you, Mr. President? Where \nwere you? It was up to you. Just the signature of a name would have \ngiven the $2.5 billion to the firefighters, the policemen, the health \nemergency people, would have given you that money for the protection of \nour nuclear facilities, for the protection of our ports of entry, for \nbetter border security to the north, for better border security to the \nsouth, for more food inspectors. Why did you turn your back on that \nmoney for the security of the American people?\n\n  I say again, that funding would have addressed the very security \nconcerns the administration outlined this afternoon. Yet on September \n1, the President chose to cancel those funds, turn his back on those \nfunds, push them away. I wonder what goes into that coffee in Crawford?\n  Today, the Senate passed a drought relief amendment by a 79-to-16 \nmargin. This amendment would provide disaster assistance to our \nNation's farmers and ranchers in the face of unprecedented drought. \nThat ought to be pretty easy to understand. I have lived in northern \nVirginia now for 50 years, the same number of years that I have served \nin Congress. In those 50 years, I don't recall ever such a drought as \nwe have experienced and such weather as we have experienced as this \nyear. I have been accustomed to pulling up my tomato plants, cutting up \nthe stems, and putting them in the trash bags to be hauled away by the \ngarbage truck. And I have been accustomed to doing that in mid-\nSeptember or late September. This year, forget it. I did it in mid-\nAugust. Those vines were dying. The blossoms that had come earlier had \nnever flowered into tomatoes. Don't think I am a great tomato producer. \nI only have three or four vines. I have planted as many as seven or \neight during the years I have been in McLean, but that is just from a \nwee tomato farmer.\n  This is a drought. I have lived now 85 years, lacking a very few \ndays--85 years. I have seen something happening out in the heavens as \nwe witnessed pestilences and droughts, floods and fires. Something has \nhappened. This was an unprecedented drought as far as I am concerned. I \nam probably not going to put out any tomato plants next year. The \ncountry will not miss my tomato plants, but the country misses the \nsignature on that $2.5 billion that would have been turned loose, that \nwould have been there for the country, for the protection of the \npeople, for all these items and more that I have mentioned.\n  Yet the President has told our farmers and ranchers that he opposes \nthis funding. How about that? He has told the farmers and ranchers he \nopposes this funding. But he did not oppose a $1.3 trillion tax cut \nthat goes for the most part to the wealthiest in this country. Those \npeople never lived on my side of the tracks, the people who are going \nto be the beneficiaries of most of that tax cut. They did not come from \nmy side of the tracks. No, the people on my side of the tracks have not \nreaped any benefit from that tax cut. My side of the tracks, yes, had a \ncoffee shop on that side, too, but not many people could afford 5 cents \nfor the cup of coffee.\n  So when the President tells our farmers and ranchers he opposes this \nfunding, without this help many farms and ranches will dry up and \ndisappear. Congress knows how to take the pulse of the Nation and to \nrespond to the needs of the people. There are people in this Congress \nwho may have lived on the other side of the tracks, mingled with people \nnot just in the Crawford coffee shop but in Uncle Josh's and Aunt \nNancy's Smokehouse from where the common people, the ordinary people \ncome.\n  If we wait for the President to change his mind, there may be no \npulse to take for our farmers and ranchers. Once again, the President \nseems to be a day late and a dollar short. It is time for the \nadministration to wake up and smell the coffee.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nproceedings under the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I understand that on my call for \nregular\n\n[[Page S8431]]\n\norder, we go back to the pending bill. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Then I do call for the regular order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/10/senate-section/article/S8431-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8431-S8433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HOMELAND SECURITY ACT OF 2002--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate resumes consideration of the \npending bill.\n  Mr. REID. Was there a unanimous consent request, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania asked for the \nregular order.\n  Mr. REID. What is the regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill, H.R. 5005.\n  Mr. REID. If my friend would allow me to speak, it is my \nunderstanding that we were in a period of morning business with \nSenators allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes each. Would it not take \nconsent to get out of that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning business occurs by consent. The \nregular order was the legislation.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I think I have the floor. If I might \njust comment, what I would like to do is speak on the bill.\n  Mr. REID. We would like to hear you speak. But I say to my friend, \nthere would be no amendments. We have the Thompson amendment pending, \nand we would have to have consent to set that aside, or I guess you \ncould offer a second-degree to Senator Thompson's amendment. But you \nare not planning to offer an amendment?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I don't plan to offer any amendments or \nanything unusual. I want to make some comments on the pending bill. I \ndon't plan to do anything that would require the presence of anybody \nhere to safeguard their interests. I don't wish to do anything that \nwould be construed as contrary to anybody's interest. I would like to \nhave people here who are on the bill.\n  Mr. REID. I only say I am sorry I have to leave the floor because I \nwould love to hear the statement of the Senator from Pennsylvania. I \nsay this as affirmatively and sincerely as possible. The Senator always \nmakes statements that are good and direct, and I am sorry to have \ninterrupted him, but I didn't know what was going on.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I am sorry the Senator from Nevada will not be here to \nhear my presentation, but there are 97 other Senators who could come. \nCounting the Presiding Officer and myself and the Senator from Nevada, \nthat leaves 97 others. That is probably more people than are watching \non C-SPAN 2, as a matter of fact, Madam President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4513\n\n  The pending amendment seeks to speak to the provisions of the bill \nrelating to a National Office for Combating Terrorism, and I believe \nthe thrust of the provisions for this national office are well founded \nas a coordinating mechanism. But after discussing the matter in some \ndetail with the author of the bill, the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Florida, and considering the views of the President, who does not \nwant to have a confirmed officer in the West Wing but is looking for an \nadviser, as former Governor Ridge who is now his adviser, as \nDr. Condoleezza Rice is the National Security Adviser--it seems to me \nthere are strong reasons for us to avoid this legislation to have a \nSecretary of Homeland Security who will be confirmed and then have a \nDirector for the National Office for Combating Terrorism, because all \nof these duties, in my opinion, can be handled by the Secretary of \nHomeland Security. So the objectives which the senior Senator from \nFlorida seeks to accomplish can be accomplished without adding this \nadditional office. I know the President does not want another officer \nconfirmed by the Senate. He didn't want one in the first place, and \ndidn't want a Department of Homeland Security, but now has acceded.\n\n  Senator Lieberman and I introduced the legislation for a Department \nof Homeland Security and a Secretary of Homeland Security last October, \nand eventually the President acceded to that necessity, and there is \nnow a bill on the floor.\n  But as I look over the responsibilities which the senior Senator from \nFlorida has assigned to the Director of the National Office for \nCombating Terrorism, it is my view that these duties can be handled by \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security. The responsibilities which are set \nout in section 201(c):\n\n       To develop national objectives and policies for combating \n     terrorism.\n\n  I think that is an appropriate function for the Secretary.\n\n       To direct . . . [the] assessment of terrorist threats and \n     vulnerabilities to those threats . . . .\n\n  Again, I think that is something that can be handled by the \nSecretary.\n\n       To coordinate . . . the implementation . . . of the \n     Strategy by agencies with responsibilities for combating \n     terrorism . . . .\n\n  Again, I think that is something the Secretary can do.\n\n       To work with agencies, including the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, to ensure that appropriate actions are \n     taken to address vulnerabilities identified by the \n     Directorate of Critical Infrastructure Protection within the \n     Department.\n\n  Again, that is something which the Secretary can handle.\n\n       To coordinate, with the advice of the Secretary, the \n     development of a comprehensive annual budget for the programs \n     and activities under the Strategy, including the budgets of \n     the military departments and agencies within the National \n     Foreign Intelligence Program relating to international \n     terrorism . . . .\n\n  That can be handled by the Secretary. In fact, this provision calls \nfor coordination with the Secretary.\n  The provision does exclude military programs, projects or activities \nrelating to force protection. This is a controversial item, as to \nwhether there ought to be somebody with budget authority. I think it is \na good idea. Right now there is diverse budget authority with a larger \nshare of it on the intelligence agencies coming out of the Department \nof Defense. I believe it would be very useful to have that centralized.\n  When I chaired the Intelligence Committee in the 104th Congress, I \nproposed legislation which would have brought all of the intelligence \nagencies under one umbrella, the Central Intelligence Agency. Now I \nthink there is an opportunity to do that with the new Department of \nHomeland Security since we are taking a fresh look at this area. I know \nthere are objections to giving budget authority to anyone on an overall \nbasis, but it would be my hope that this provision would stay--but it \nwould stay under the dominion of the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  The other responsibilities of the Director of the National Office for \nCombating Terrorism are:\n\n       To exercise funding authority for Federal terrorism \n     prevention and response agencies . . . .\n\n  Stated simply, all of the functions of the Director of the National \nOffice for Combating Terrorism, in my view, can be handled by the \nSecretary of Homeland Security. I think those objectives are sound.\n  It is my hope that we will legislate here to put under the umbrella \nof the Secretary of Homeland Security the necessary authority to \nprotect against terrorists. It is my judgment that had all of the dots \nbeen under one umbrella, there would have been a veritable blueprint \nfor what happened on September 11 and that September 11 might well have \nbeen prevented. This is the time, with the new Department of Homeland \nSecurity to be established, that we have a chance to implement what so \nmany people have proposed.\n  My idea to bring all of the intelligence agencies under one umbrella \nin the legislation, which I proposed in the 104th Congress when I \nchaired the Intelligence Committee, is an idea which has been proposed \nby many. At the moment, there is on the President's desk a \ncomprehensive proposal to accomplish just that. But the reality is that \nthe turf wars involving the various agencies are so fierce that this is \nnever accomplished. Now we have a chance to do it.\n  Had the one umbrella been present to identify the FBI Phoenix \nmemorandum--where there was a flight student with a big picture of \nOsama bin Laden and indicators of potential terrorist activity--had \nthat, combined with the two men identified, who were later hijackers on \nSeptember 11, in Kuala Lumpur where the CIA never told the FBI or the \nINS--had that been added to the records--the National Security Agency \ngot it on September 10; it wasn't translated as a threat that something \nwould happen the next day, perhaps later, until the 12th--especially \nwith the information which\n\n[[Page S8432]]\n\ncould have been obtained, had a warrant been issued for the computer of \nZacarias Moussaoui and for the search of his premises--there was a \nvirtual treasure trove of information linking Moussaoui to al-Qaida.\n  We have learned a very different lesson from 9/11. Now is the time \nfor the Congress to change it. We simply have to override the various \nFederal agencies that are fighting for their turf. The stakes now are \ntoo serious.\n  We have an enormous responsibility in the Congress to do everything \nwe can to see to it that there is no recurrence of 9/11. We have action \nto be taken if there is a biological attack. We have worked on various \nantidotes for various biological weapons--smallpox and anthrax. But if \nwe have to respond, it is a 99 percent loss. What we have to do is \nprevent it.\n  The intelligence agencies that want to maintain their own sovereignty \njust ought to change that attitude. The legislation which has been \nproposed would put all of these analysis sections under the Secretary \nof Homeland Security. That is what ought to be done. That can be done \nin this bill.\n  There was a meeting on July 31 with the President, Governor Ridge, \nand Members of Congress, where we talked about these ideas.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of this letter be printed \nin the Record at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, there is a critical line on the letter I \nhave written to Governor Ridge. I will read just a little bit of it.\n\n       Dear Tom:\n       I was very pleased to hear the President's affirmative \n     response yesterday to the proposal to have analysts from \n     every intelligence agency (CIA, FBI, DIA, etc) under the \n     umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security with the \n     Secretary having the authority to direct those intelligence \n     agencies to supply his Department with the requisite \n     intelligence data.\n       This doesn't mean that Homeland Security will have \n     authority over CIA agents. They will remain with the CIA. It \n     doesn't mean the Secretary of Homeland Security would have \n     the direction of the FBI agents or any other agents. They \n     will all remain in their Departments. But the analysts will \n     all come together under one roof. There will be nothing to \n     stop the CIA from having analysts under the CIA roof. But \n     they will have to be CIA agents under the roof of the \n     Director of Homeland Security so that all of the analysts are \n     there and can put the dots together in one place.\n\n  The critical paragraph in the letter set forth is:\n\n       Responsibilities.--The Directorate of Intelligence . . . . \n     On behalf of the Secretary, subject to disapproval by the \n     President, directing the agencies described under subsection \n     (a)(1)(B) to provide intelligence information, analyses of \n     intelligence information and such other intelligence-related \n     information as the Directorate of Intelligence deems \n     necessary.\n\n  That is the critical part of it.\n  The other way of articulating the idea would be to say that the \nPresident approves the Secretary having this authority. But it is \nunrealistic to expect the President to come in and make an analysis and \ntake affirmative action. But it is effective to get the same job done \nif the problem is sufficient to have the matter disapproved by the \nPresident.\n  I don't think you really have to have statutory language because the \nPresident directs anybody as he chooses. They are going to be bound to \ncarry out his orders. But this would give the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity umbrella authority, as I say, subject to disapproval of the \nPresident.\n  Although I do think the senior Senator from Florida had a good idea \nand purpose in the National Office for Combating Terrorism, the better \npolicy is to leave these responsibilities to the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, a separate Department. The President is then free to have an \nadviser on homeland security--as he currently does, a position filled \nin the West Wing by Governor Ridge.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n                                   Washington, DC, August 1, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Ridge,\n     Director of Homeland Security,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Tom: I was very pleased to hear the President's \n     affirmative response yesterday to the proposal to have \n     analysts from every intelligence agency (CIA, FBI, DIA, etc.) \n     under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland Security \n     with the Secretary having the authority to direct those \n     intelligence agencies to supply his Department with the \n     requisite intelligence data.\n       As I said in the meeting in the Cabinet Room yesterday, I \n     think that had all of the intelligence information known \n     prior to September 11th been under one umbrella, the \n     terrorist attacks of September 11th might have been \n     prevented.\n       Senator Thompson, as I understood him, did not disagree \n     with that ultimate approach except to express the view that \n     he thought that changes in the structure of the intelligence \n     community should await further studies. My own strongly held \n     view is that we have a unique opportunity to make the changes \n     in the intelligence community now because of the imminent \n     terrorist threats; and, if we don't act now, we will go back \n     to business as usual.\n       As you and I discussed in our meeting of July 29, 2002, \n     there have been many proposals to place the intelligence \n     agencies under one umbrella, including legislation which I \n     introduced in 1996 when I chaired the Intelligence Committee, \n     and the current proposals which have been made by General \n     Scowcroft.\n       I suggest that Section 132(b) of the bill reported by the \n     Governmental Affairs Committee be modified by adding at the \n     beginning a new paragraph (1) to read as follows:\n       (b) Responsibilities:--The Directorate of Intelligence \n     shall be responsible for the following:\n       (1) On behalf of the Secretary, subject to disapproval by \n     the President, directing the agencies described under \n     subsection (a)(1)(B) to provide intelligence information, \n     analyses of intelligence information and such other \n     intelligence-related information as the Directorate of \n     Intelligence deems necessary.\n       I am sending copies of this letter to Senator Lieberman and \n     Senator Thompson so that we may all discuss these issues \n     further.\n       My best.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, while our troops have had \nenormous success abroad, the war on terror, obviously, is not over. We \nare just beginning. We must do everything we can to prevent future \nattacks on the homeland.\n  Tomorrow is going to commemorate that awful experience. My attention \nover the weekend was riveted to an article in one of the country's \nmajor newspapers that reported on a debriefing of one of the al-Qaeda \ndetainees who had indicated that the fourth airplane, the one that \ncrashed in Pennsylvania, had as its target the U.S. Capitol.\n  How many of us on that day were working in the U.S. Capitol? I was in \na meeting on the west front of the Capitol, only 30 paces from where I \nam now standing in the Chamber of the Senate. It was a meeting attended \nby about 15, chaired by the majority leader. We had already seen the \ntelevision images of the World Trade Center, but we continued our \nmeeting.\n  Someone burst in the door and said: ``The Pentagon has been hit.'' We \nleapt to the windows overlooking the west front of the Capitol, \noverlooking the mall in the direction of the Pentagon, and saw the \nblack smoke rising on the other side of the Potomac.\n  Interestingly, my immediate reaction was to leap to a telephone to \ntry to get word to my wife, Grace. Only 5 days earlier, we had moved \ninto an apartment overlooking the southwest corner of the Pentagon. My \nmessage to her was--and we didn't even have a telephone in the \napartment, since we had just moved in--to get into the basement garage \nbecause, of course, I didn't know what was happening on that side of \nthe Potomac.\n  In the meantime, Grace Nelson is getting dressed in the apartment. \nShe hears the airplane. She said it sounded so loud, as if it was going \nto hit the apartment. And the line of flight was very close to the \napartment. She heard the impact. She ran to the window and saw the \nwhole thing.\n  When she saw the people streaming out of the Pentagon, her immediate \nresponse, which is the great patriotic instinct of my wife, was: What \ncan I do to go down and help those people?\n  That, of course, was a riveting experience, like any that you have \nhad in your adult life. I was in college at the time of the \nassassination of President Kennedy. I can tell you exactly where I was \nwhen we received the word. So, too, on any other tragic event, such as \nthe destruction of the space shuttle Challenger. And so, too, Americans \nwill remember exactly what they were doing and where they were at the \ntime of receiving the news that the Nation was under attack a year ago.\n\n[[Page S8433]]\n\n  This war is going to be a long one, and it is going to be very \ndifficult because it is a new kind of war. We don't have the luxury we \nhave had for two centuries of two big oceans protecting us from our \nenemies, for now the enemies have figured out a way to infiltrate \nwithin. Of course, all of the U.S. interests and assets around the \nworld, including our ambassadors, are targets we have to protect.\n  It is appropriate that this legislation is being considered at this \ntime. What do we have to do to help protect future attacks on U.S. \nsoil?\n  Clearly, there was a colossal intelligence failure on September 11. \nThat is primarily what we need to address. The inexcusable bureaucratic \ninefficiencies and inability of one hand of the bureaucracy to know \nwhat the other hand was doing, all of that has to be ironed out. In the \nbriefings that we have had, I have some degree of confidence that it is \nbeing ironed out. It better be. We have no choice. For the only way to \nthwart the terrorists is to find out what they are going to do before \nthey do it and stop them.\n  Combining this new threat also requires a more agile government. What \nwe are about to do is undertake the largest governmental reorganization \nin the last five decades. This new department will combine 22 agencies, \n170,000 people, with an annual budget of $38 billion. But considering \nthe seriousness of the threat and the scope of the restructuring, I \nmust say that I am surprised by the administration's demands that this \nnew Department of Homeland Security be run with minimal accountability \nto the American people, which includes accountability to this Congress.\n  There is something that we all swore to uphold when we took office: \nthe Constitution of the United States. The political geniuses who \ngathered over 225 years ago fashioned a document that had checks and \nbalances so that power could not be concentrated in any one branch of \nthe Government.\n  So as we start to create this new, vast reorganization of the \nexecutive branch, we have to make it accountable to the American people \nby having it accountable to the Congress, with our oversight functions, \nwith our appropriations functions, with our authorization functions, \nwith all that has served this Nation so well since the beginning of our \nconstitutional government in 1789.\n  I am concerned and a little bit surprised that the administration \ndemands that they have it their way without the accountability, which \nis the checks and balances of the Constitution, necessary to the \nfunctioning of our constitutional government.\n  Many of us on both sides of the aisle believe this is an issue of \ngreat importance, involving such a massive reorganization of the \nGovernment that we must ensure that there are checks and balances. The \nAmerican people deserve to know how this new department will be managed \nand how the resources allocated to the war on terror are going to be \nused.\n  Transparency is essential to ensure that this new department is \nworking. I am not sure that is the message that has come from the \nadministration. It is going to be up to us, particularly those of us \nwho feel so strongly about this.\n  We have heard a number of people talk about the great leadership of \nSenator Lieberman, the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, \nand, clearly, the man who not only believes daily and recites daily the \nU.S. Constitution but carries that Constitution with him wherever he \ngoes, a man who has been in Congress for over 50 years, Senator Byrd, \nwho has expressed his concerns. And there will be more, including mine \nthat I am registering today.\n  I am afraid that the administration's bill--which, in essence, is the \nHouse of Representatives-passed bill--fails to adequately protect the \nnonhomeland mission of the Coast Guard. Think of that. The Coast Guard \noverseas a number of important maritime missions, which save countless \nlives each year, including search-and-rescue operations, Marine safety, \nand recreational boating safety initiatives.\n  Am I sensitive to this? You bet. Look how much coastline Florida has. \nI have not actually measured it against the California coastline, but I \nsuspect ours is greater if not equal to the California coastline.\n  So is the search-and-rescue operation, Marine safety, recreational \nboating safety--a non-homeland-defense mission of the Coast Guard--\nimportant? Of course, but so is the Coast Guard's mission on law \nenforcement, which includes drug interdiction, and alien migrant \ninterdiction, and general maritime law enforcement.\n  Would it not be nice if we in Florida were not sensitive, as we are, \nto drug interdiction and to alien migrant interdiction? Waves of people \ntry to come to Florida's shores illegally--some with just cause, but of \nwhich the Coast Guard plays a very important role. As resources are \ntransferred to the war on terror, we should not forget about protecting \npeople from the nonterrorist threats that can be harmful to our \ncommunities.\n  The final plan to transfer the Coast Guard to a new Department must \nensure, in my judgment, that law enforcement safety and transportation \nmissions are not unreasonably compromised. That is why I think we have \nto adopt the Senate language and protect it then in the conference \ncommittee--ironing out the differences between the Senate and House \nversions.\n  In addition--and very importantly--the administration's language in \nthe House bill completely undermines workers' rights. Guaranteeing the \nbasic civil service rights of people hired to keep us safe does not and \nwill not jeopardize national security.\n  What are we trying to protect? We are trying to protect the civil \nservice of this Federal Government from being politicized, which is the \nreason why the Hatch Act was passed years ago, decades ago, saying that \nthere was going to be a barrier put up so that any administration, \nafter the Hatch Act, was not going to be able to use the Federal \nbureaucracy for their political ends; thus, the Hatch Act was enacted.\n  What the administration's language does is take away those worker \nrights, those basic civil service rights, and that is not healthy, \nbecause it has been healthy, as we have seen how the Federal \nbureaucracy operates under those protections in the Hatch Act.\n  The House bill would grant the President a blank check to take away \nthe civil service protections of nearly 170,000 employees of the new \nagency. I don't think that is in the interest of the country. That is \nnot going to affect the national security. The vague authority granted \nto the President would exempt employees from traditional labor laws if \nhe determined, without any explanation, that the workers' rights \nsomehow adversely affect the Department's homeland security mission. \nThat is not right for the workers of the new agency, and it is not \nright for the country.\n  Finally, the administration bill hangs consumers out to dry by \nlimiting the liability of firms providing new antiterrorism \ntechnologies and devices because damages caused by untested \ntechnologies that fail to work would be restricted even in cases of \ngross negligence in the manufacture of those new technologies and \nequipment and apparatuses. This limited liability provision gives carte \nblanche then to fly-by-night companies looking to profit from 9/11 by \nselling products that, at best, do nothing and, at worst, could cause \ndirect harm. I don't think we want to hang those consumers out to dry--\nindeed, much more than that, we don't want to harm those consumers.\n  As the clock ticks, the time becomes increasingly somber as we \nreflect back on what we were doing 365 days ago, what happened to us \npersonally, and how we have changed not only as a nation but \nindividually. I think it is important for us to look at the big picture \nand that as we fashion a bureaucratic response that is more flexible to \nprotect our homeland, we do so in a wise and cautious fashion.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/10/senate-section/article/S8433-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8433-S8434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to proceed as \nif in morning business to discuss legislation I have pending, S. 1434, \na bill which has 69 cosponsors, which would give the Congressional \nMedal to all of the crew and passengers on flight 93 which crashed in \nShanksville, PA, on September 11, 2001.\n  As we know from cellphone conversations from passengers on that \nplane, the passengers took over the plane from the terrorists, at least \nto the extent of depriving the terrorists control where the terrorists, \nas was widely suspected, were headed for the Capitol of the United \nStates. And the plane crashed in Shanksville, PA, killing all of those \non board.\n  It seems to me this is a unique place for the Congressional Gold \nMedal, because those passengers saved the Congress. Had that plane \nreached the Capitol, this Chamber would not now be in existence, nor \nthe Rotunda, nor the House of Representatives. It is hard to say in the \nmorning, perhaps midmorning, how many Members of the Congress of the \nUnited States and staff would not be here today. In seeking this \nrecognition, it is a very unique opportunity to acknowledge those \npassengers.\n\n  This bill has languished because it has gotten tied up, as it is not \nuncommon for legislation to be tied up for a variety of other reasons. \nThere are some who want to give medals to everyone who died on \nSeptember 11, which I think is a fine idea. There are some who want to \ngive medals to all of those who were in the rescue squads from the \npolice precincts or fire stations or the Port Authority. And there, \nagain, I think that is a commendable idea. And all the ideas to \nrecognize other people may be fine, but they can take their turn on \nlegislation.\n  But this legislation ought to be enacted before sunset tomorrow, \nbefore September 11, 2002, expires. I am now working with some of my \ncolleagues in the Senate to accomplish that. If we cannot accomplish \nthat, then I am going to ask unanimous consent to call up S. 1434, \nwhich has 69 cosponsors. It should have been discharged from committee \na long time ago. With 69 cosponsors, that is 18 more votes than \nnecessary to pass legislation in the Senate.\n  There is a bill in the House of Representatives which approaches the \nissue slightly differently. The proposal in the House is to leave the \ndecision up to the Attorney General of the United States. Well, that \nmight be a good idea if there was something for the Attorney General to \ndetermine that we do not now know. But all of the knowable facts as to \nwhat happened on flight 93 are now known.\n  The Attorney General cannot conduct an investigation and pinpoint any \nspecific individuals. And it is doubtless true that some individuals \nwere more responsible for taking control of the plane away from the \nterrorists than others. But all were present. And all of those who were \npresent were accessories to heroism. They lent their support by their \npresence. Of course, they could not go anywhere else, but the \npassengers brought down the plane. And the passengers saved the Capitol \nof the United States.\n  Interestingly, just yesterday, The New York Times published a release \nwhich contains confirmation from key al-Qaida operatives that flight 93 \nwas, in fact, headed for the Capitol. That has been a fairly accepted \nconclusion, but this is what the New York Times story of yesterday, \nSeptember 9, says:\n  Yosri Fouda, correspondent for the satellite station Al-Jazeera, told \nThe Associated Press that he was taken, blindfolded, to a secret \nlocation in Pakistan to meet Khalid Shaikh Mohammed and Ramzi \nBinalshibh in a June interview arranged by al-Qaida operatives.\n  The thrust of the story is that the al-Qaida operatives said that \nflight 93 was headed for the Capitol. So, in essence, I think we have \nwaited long enough. I think this action ought to be completed before \nsunset on September 11, 2002.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to proceed as \nif in morning business to discuss legislation I have pending, S. 1434, \na bill which has 69 cosponsors, which would give the Congressional \nMedal to all of the crew and passengers on flight 93 which crashed in \nShanksville, PA, on September 11, 2001.\n  As we know from cellphone conversations from passengers on that \nplane, the passengers took over the plane from the terrorists, at least \nto the extent of depriving the terrorists control where the terrorists, \nas was widely suspected, were headed for the Capitol of the United \nStates. And the plane crashed in Shanksville, PA, killing all of those \non board.\n  It seems to me this is a unique place for the Congressional Gold \nMedal, because those passengers saved the Congress. Had that plane \nreached the Capitol, this Chamber would not now be in existence, nor \nthe Rotunda, nor the House of Representatives. It is hard to say in the \nmorning, perhaps midmorning, how many Members of the Congress of the \nUnited States and staff would not be here today. In seeking this \nrecognition, it is a very unique opportunity to acknowledge those \npassengers.\n\n  This bill has languished because it has gotten tied up, as it is not \nuncommon for legislation to be tied up for a variety of other reasons. \nThere are some who want to give medals to everyone who died on \nSeptember 11, which I think is a fine idea. There are some who want to \ngive medals to all of those who were in the rescue squads from the \npolice precincts or fire stations or the Port Authority. And there, \nagain, I think that is a commendable idea.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to share a few \nthoughts on the eve of tomorrow's anniversary of the terrorist attack, \nSeptember 11, 2001. Tomorrow, a lot of our colleagues, both in this \nChamber and the other body, will be expressing themselves, with many \nMembers attending memorial services at the Pentagon. The Senate, as a \nbody, plans to come together late tomorrow morning to meet as a body \nand to share our thoughts with the country about the events of a year \nago. I take this opportunity to remember and to honor the nearly 3,000 \nof our fellow citizens and others who had come to this country to \nwork--not all were Americans; the majority were--but lost their lives 1 \nyear ago tomorrow in one of America's darkest of days.\n  I also join all of America in paying tribute once again to the \ncountless men and women whose acts of bravery and heroism so inspired \nus on that day and the days that followed the tragedy of September 11, \nand continue to serve as a solemn reminder that the American spirit \nshines as bright as ever despite the events of that day, that horrible \nday a year ago.\n  Thousands of families across this great country of ours, including \nfamilies in my home State of Connecticut--families in my State lost \nsome 149 people, most of whom lost their lives in the World Trade \nCenter--these families and their loved ones have endured a year of \nunimaginable grief and unimaginable bravery. Every American grieves \nwith them as many of our fellow citizens the world over from around the \nglobe have shared with us the sense of grief and horror of a year ago \nand have continued to relate to us and to share their thoughts and \nprayers with all Americans as a result of our commemoration of the \nevents of 12 months ago.\n  Over the past 12 months, I have heard countless stories, tragedies \nthat were once unthinkable. In Connecticut, I know of a man who lost \nboth his wife and his only child on that day a year ago; of parents who \nlost their young children in their twenties, just beginning their lives \nas young adults, with professional careers; of wives who had received \nthe last phone calls from their husbands before the Twin Towers fell.\n  Every American will always remember where they were when the Twin \nTowers were attacked and collapsed. Every American will always remember \nwhere they were when they heard a hijacked plane had crashed into the \nPentagon, only a few blocks from where I am sharing these thoughts this \nafternoon. Every American will always remember how they felt upon \nlearning that a group of passengers fought back against the terrorists \nwho hijacked their plane before it crashed in the field of \nPennsylvania. September 11, 2001, is a day that will be etched in all \nof our memories for the rest of our lives and etched in history \nforever.\n  Although all Americans went through that day together, we will always \nshare its memory. Last September 11 was also a deeply personal day for \neach and every one of us. We each had our own highly personal \nexperiences during those horrid hours that began in the early morning--\nthat wonderful clear, bright, cloudless sky over the eastern part of \nour country.\n  For me, the hours and days and weeks following the terrorist attacks \nwere filled with immensely mixed emotions, as most of my colleagues \nknow. I see my friend and colleague from Texas on the floor. We shared \nthe great joy last year of having children come into our lives. My \nfirst child, my daughter Grace, was born just 48 hours after the \nattacks, born on September 13, at a hospital right across the river in \nVirginia. From the window of the maternity ward, my wife Jackie and I \nwatched the smoke rising from the still-burning Pentagon as we held our \nnewborn child in our hands.\n\n  I can still vividly recall trying to balance my feelings of \nincredible, intense joy with this new beautiful life, mixed with the \npowerful feelings of horror and trepidation over what kind of a world \nmy daughter Grace would grow up in, in the 21st century.\n  Something heartened me that day. I have told this story on numerous \noccasions. In the hospital as my wife held our newborn daughter, many \nof the doctors and nurses, several of them who held her shortly after \nshe was born, came from places outside of America to become citizens. \nThree of them came from Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Lebanon. Here we \nare, 48 hours after the events, those countries had been the places of \nrefuge for those engaged in the attacks on our country, and here were \npeople from that very part of the world, United States citizens today, \nnurturing and caring for my newborn daughter.\n  That was all the evidence I needed at that particular moment that \nAmerica was attacked not for who we are, but for what we stand for: \nFreedom, liberty, and community. And we shared something very powerful \nin common: We were devastated over the attacks, and we were never \nprouder to be Americans, almost simultaneously.\n  Word was already out that the terrorist attacks were the work of al-\nQaeda, a fanatical group which hijacked planes, but also an otherwise\n\n[[Page S8436]]\n\npeaceful religion, Islam, to perform their evil deeds.\n  Word was out that Osama bin Laden and his minions of hate thought \nthat by attacking us, our buildings, our Pentagon, and our planes, they \ncould somehow divide our great Nation and somehow weaken our resolve to \nbe a global power, to be a force for freedom and democracy around the \nglobe.\n  Word was out that those who hate the United States simply for who we \nare, for our freedoms, our prosperity, and our diversity, thought that \nby murdering thousands of innocent Americans and shattering the lives \nof thousands of families, our Nation would somehow lose its ability to \nfunction as a great democracy.\n  They were wrong. We are today stronger, I argue, than ever.\n  September 11 changed America forever. At one level, the attacks made \nus aware of our vulnerabilities and forced us to realize there is no \nsuch thing as the unthinkable. Yet at another level, the way in which \nthe entire Nation came together, in the days and weeks and months after \nthe attacks, has served as a profound and inspirational reminder to \nstrengthen the American people and the breadth and depth of the \nAmerican spirit.\n  So as we mark this historic day, a day of sadness, we look back and \nremember September 11, not just for the tragedy it evokes but also in \nrenewing our faith in the greatness of the wonderfulness of our Nation, \nin which we are charged temporarily to be custodians, as Members of \nthis body, to see that that daughter of mine and the children of our \ncolleague from Texas grow up in a world far safer than what we \nwitnessed a year ago. That becomes our collective responsibility as \npublic officials: To put aside differences and, wherever we can, to \nwork together as one people to make our country stronger and better, to \nachieve that sense of perfection that the Founders of our Nation \nenvisioned more than 200 years ago.\n  With those thoughts in mind, I extend my deepest sympathies, my \nthoughts, and prayers to the families in my State and across our Nation \nwho still grieve terribly for the loss they suffered a year ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Before Senator Dodd leaves the floor, I appreciate so \nmuch his beautiful remarks. We do share something very special, and \nthat is that each of us had a new baby--mine through adoption, yours \nwith your wife. It was right during that very sad time. I think it was \nso helpful to have this new life I knew then we were fighting for, to \nmake sure that my young son and my young daughter would have the same \nkind of life as I did.\n\n  I know you feel that way about Grace, and to look out from her birth \nto see the Pentagon smoldering must have been an emotional experience \nbeyond any ability to describe.\n  So I am so proud that I have two babies born in 2001, and I have the \nfirmest commitment to make sure we do everything in our power to assure \nthat they have the freedom and the love of this country and the \ndiversity we champion and the tolerance we have shown to the world. \nThat is the way people should live. I thank the Senator for his \nremarks. I just wanted to say how their lives will be intertwined \nforever.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/10/senate-section/article/S8436-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8436-S8441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL AMBER ALERT NETWORK ACT OF 2002\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. MILLER).

Mr. President, I would like to speak on the bill. My \ncolleague, Senator Feinstein, will speak, and then I would like to have \nthe bill passed following those remarks.\n  Mr. President, I am so proud that the Senate Judiciary Committee has \nalready passed the AMBER Alert bill on which Senator Feinstein and I \nworked during the recess, after the tragic happening in California with \nthe teenage girls who were lost but then found because of AMBER Alert, \nand the tragic kidnapping in Texas of a baby who was also found because \nof the AMBER Alert.\n  Although in numbers the child abductions through the summer weren't \nany more than previous years, they seemed so much more because we knew \nabout them and we were able to do something about them. Not all of them \nhave had a happy ending, but more than ever before have had a happy \nending.\n  The realization that their child has been abducted must be the most \nterrifying nightmare a parent can endure.\n\n[[Page S8438]]\n\nBut that is what has happened to parent after parent in our country.\n  The AMBER Alert bill is named for Amber Hagerman, who was abducted \nwhen she was 9 years old, riding her bicycle near her home in \nArlington, TX, in 1996. Amber was murdered. But her mother and law \nenforcement personnel in the Arlington-Dallas-Fort Worth area believed \nso strongly there should be some way to do something that would find \nthese children that they created the AMBER Alert on a local level.\n  Today, cities, regions, and States have established AMBER Alerts and \n30 abducted children have been found and rescued because of the AMBER \nAlert.\n  Most of the credit for this remarkable record goes to the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children, which provides technical \nguidance to communities and coordination among widely separated AMBER \nnetworks. And the Center could not be effective without the willing \ncooperation of the National Association of Broadcasters and local \ntelevision and radio stations across the nation.\n  As we have witnessed this summer, AMBER Alert plans in different \ncommunities have been effective in bringing children home safely. \nRecently, an AMBER Alert was sent out to search for 10-year-old Nichole \nTimmons of Riverside, California. The Alert was not only delivered \nthroughout California but contacts also were made in neighboring \nstates, and Nichole was found in Nevada. Nichole and her family were \nextremely lucky because dedicated people at the National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children made the effort to notify every possible \njurisdiction, and local broadcasters devoted previous air time to the \nAlert. The vast majority of States, however, do not yet have \ncomprehensive, statewide coverage and lack the ability to effectively \ncommunicate between plans. This is a critical issue particularly when \nan abducted child is taken across State lines.\n  Nichole's case clearly illustrates the need for a national AMBER \nnetwork. My bill, the National AMBER Alert Network Act, prepared with \nthe help of my friend, Dianne Feinstein of California, will fill the \ngaps that exist in the current patchwork of AMBER systems. We will \nprovide resources for states and communities to build their AMBER Alert \nsystems and spread information to surrounding jurisdictions.\n  Our bill establishes an AMBER Alert Coordinator within the Department \nof Justice to assist states with their AMBER Alert plans. The AMBER \nAlert Coordinator will set minimum, voluntary standards to help states \ncoordinate when necessary. The AMBER Alert Coordinator will help to \nreconcile the different standards for what constitutes an AMBER alert. \nIn doing so, the Coordinator will work with existing participants, \nincluding the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, local \nand state law enforcement and broadcasters to define minimum standards. \nOverall, the AMBER Alert Coordinator's efforts will set safeguards to \nmake sure the AMBER system is used to meet its intended purpose.\n  In addition, the bill provides for matching grant programs at the \nDepartment of Transportation and the Department of Justice. The grant \nprograms will help localities and states build or further enhance their \nefforts to disseminate AMBER Alerts. To this end, the matching grant \nprograms will fund road signage and electronic message boards along \nhighways, dissemination of information on abducted children, education \nand training, and related equipment.\n  When a child is lost, the whole community grieves along with the \nfamily. An AMBER Alert channels this energy to a positive purpose. Tips \nfrom average citizens have resulted in the safe and rapid recovery of \nmany children. We can spread the work about abducted children across \ncounty and state lines quickly, before the kidnappers have the chance \nto cover their tracks and get too far away.\n  I was very touched, when Senator Feinstein and I decided we were \ngoing to introduce this National AMBER Alert bill, that Mr. Ed Smart, \nthe father of Elizabeth Smart, who was abducted from her home in Utah \nand who has not been found, had a press conference with Senator Bennett \nfrom Utah to say: Please enact this national system. Maybe it could \nhave helped if we had had that in place.\n  Senator Hatch from Utah was so helpful in making sure the Judiciary \nCommittee did expedite the passage of this bill. We could not have done \nit without Senator Leahy, who allowed us to go forward, really, in \nmiracle record time. Senator Clinton came forward immediately to offer \nher help. So we have had a lot of people working on this issue. I do \nnot think the Senate has ever come together so uniformly and so quickly \nto enact a piece of legislation as this AMBER Alert bill.\n  It is important that we enact this bill and that the President be \nable to sign it before we leave for a 3-month recess because there is \nno telling how many children could be helped if we had this in place \nand ready to go.\n  In memory of Amber Hagerman and for every family ravaged by the \ntragedy of child abduction, I urge my colleagues to pass the National \nAMBER Alert Network Act to safeguard America's children.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to begin by thanking the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas for her leadership, for her \nperspicacity, for her work on this bill. We have to remember this bill \nwas introduced exactly 1 week ago. We had hearings. It is on the floor. \nIt is going to be passed today.\n\n  I hope it sends a message to the Nation. I hope that message is, if \nyours is a State that doesn't have an AMBER Alert, let us get one. Let \nme tell you why.\n  Seventy-four percent of the children who are abducted are lost within \nthe first day. Therefore, if you can identify the abductor, if you can \nidentify a license plate, you may well save the life of a child.\n  I think that came in loudly and clearly to both Senator Hutchison and \nme in the Judiciary Committee.\n  The Senator mentioned Nichole Timmons and her mother Sharon. It was \ninteresting. Nichole was kidnapped by the gardener who worked at their \nhome. She was taken across the State line from Riverside County into \nNevada. Within 24 hours, a tribal officer in Nevada recognized the \nlicense plate of the vehicle, and that went out on an AMBER Alert. \nThere was duct tape in that car. There was a metal rod in that car. If \nthe license had not been run, Nichole never would have come home. The \nAMBER Alert worked.\n  In my State of California, we have only had the AMBER Alert for about \na month. There have been 13 AMBER Alerts. One was a misstep. Eight were \nstranger abductions. Four were family-related abductions. All 12 of \nthose children were returned. Never before have I seen a statistic such \nas that.\n  We know the AMBER Alert works. Now we have an opportunity to get this \nnationwide.\n  I think the bill is thoughtful. I think it is well set out.\n  Since 1996, when the AMBER Alert went into being, it has been \ncredited with the return of 30 children to their families, including \none case in which the abductor, interestingly enough, released the \nchild himself after hearing the alert. In other words, it can act as a \ndeterrent as well.\n  What is more important than our children, other than war and peace? I \ndon't think anything. This is really important because it means you can \navoid a child being murdered simply by issuing this AMBER Alert.\n  The Senator has indicated the various points of the bill. But I want \nto say this. The AMBER Alert is typically issued only when a law \nenforcement agency confirms that a predatory child abduction has \noccurred. When the child is in imminent danger and there is information \navailable that is disseminated to the public, they can assist in the \nsafe recovery of the child.\n  In the bill, we have provided that the Attorney General would set \nthese minimum standards. So the same standards would be used across \nevery State, probably close to what I have read, and therefore avoid a \nplethora of unnecessary AMBER Alerts. We can have a system which really \nfunctions well in those cases where the likelihood is that something \ngrievous could in fact happen to that child.\n  I am hopeful that we will shortly have a national system with 15 \nAMBER Alerts. We are very proud that the National Association of \nBroadcasters is\n\n[[Page S8439]]\n\nstrongly supportive. As you know, when an AMBER Alert goes out, it \ninterrupts the television program or radio program. It is on the \nhighway. That is what gives the broad knowledge to people.\n  Interestingly enough, at the hearing, Marc Klaas was also there. His \ndaughter Polly several years ago--in the mid-1990s--was taken from her \nbedroom when she had a sleepover with a number of girls in her home. \nSomeone came into her home and took her. He truly believes that had \nAMBER Alert been in place, Polly might have been saved.\n  At that hearing, we had Nichole and her mother. She was saved. And we \nhad Marc Klaas, who lost his daughter because there was not an AMBER \nAlert. For many of us, it was a real juxtaposition.\n  I thank the Center for Missing and Exploited Children. I thank my \ncolleague, Senator Hutchison. I particularly thank the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. Without Senator Leahy, this bill couldn't have \nbeen put on the calendar, it couldn't have been marked up, and it \ncouldn't have been moved in the very short time in which it was.\n  I think it has accomplished something for our children today. It will \npass unanimously. Only 15 States have it. And hopefully other States \nare going to move very rapidly. Hopefully one day Senator Hutchison and \nI will be able to come before you, Mr. President, and the rest of this \nbody, and say that every State in the United States today has an AMBER \nAlert. Here are the statistics, ladies and gentlemen. We have saved a \nlot of children and had them returned to their parents.\n  I only say to the Senator, my friend, good work. I am delighted to be \nhere today.\n  I thank my colleagues for voting for this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California \nfor jumping right in after the tragic abduction of the teenage girls. \nThose lives were probably saved 5 minutes before they would have been \nmurdered. That is what the testimony was. It was the result of the \nAMBER Alert, which is a statewide system in California. Senator \nFeinstein, as the Senator from the home State, has an emotional tie to \nthis issue. I just hope we can prevent in other States other parents \nfrom having this kind of scare in their lives. At least, if they have \nthe scare, we will be able to help them and save the lives of the most \ninnocent in our society. Of course, that is our children.\n  I send a list of cosponsors--we have 38--to the desk and ask that \nthey be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the list of cosponsors was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n         S. 2896--Hutchison-Feinstein AMBER Alert Bill of 2002\n\n\n                            co-sponsors (38)\n\n       Democrats: Senators Biden, Carnahan, Cleland, Clinton, \n     Dayton, Dodd, Durbin, Edwards, Feingold, Feinstein, Harkin, \n     Johnson, Landrieu, Leahy, Bill Nelson, Rockefeller, Stabenow, \n     and Wyden.\n       Republicans: Senators Allard, Bennett, Collins, Crapo, \n     Ensign, Fitzgerald, Hatch, Helms, Hutchinson, Inhofe, Kyl, \n     Lott, Lugar, Santorum, Sessions, Gordon Smith, Snowe, \n     Thurmond, Voinovich, and McConnell.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it is my understanding that other \nSenator's wish to speak. I was not sure if Senator Nelson wanted to \nspeak before we passed the bill. I want to make sure we pass the bill. \nI don't know if we need to wait for other Senators before we do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, if the Senator from Texas would \nbe amenable, while we are waiting for Senators, I have remarks with \nregard to another matter. It is my understanding that we are in morning \nbusiness. I can accommodate you all in whatever way you would like. \nSenators could insert their remarks in the Record after the fact.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I think that is probably what we would like to do. I \nwould like to then go forward.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, over the last few months the American \npeople have awakened to the tragic reality that our children face the \nvery real threat of predatory criminals each and every day.\n  The airwaves have been filled with story after story of children who \nhave been abducted, sometimes to be found alive later thanks to an \nAMBER alert or good law enforcement work; sometimes to be found, \ntragically, dead; and sometimes never to be found at all.\n  This is not a new problem, but the increased attention to the problem \ngives us a real opportunity to make some much-needed changes in the law \nto prevent some of these horrible crimes and to better protect the \nchildren of this Nation.\n  The bill Senator Hatch and I introduce today will help ensure that \nlaw enforcement officers have the tools and resources they need to \nfind, prosecute, and severely punish those who commit crimes against \ninnocent children.\n  Specifically, the Hatch-Feinstein Child Crime Bill would do the \nfollowing:\n  First, the legislation directs the FBI to establish a National Crimes \nAgainst Children Response Center. This Center would have as its primary \nmission the development of a comprehensive, rapid response plan to \nreported crimes involving the victimization of children. Working \nundoubtedly in conjunction with the National Center for Missing and \nExploited Children, the AMBER Alert systems nationwide, and other \nagencies and private entities as well, this Center would be the focal \npoint for seeing that the victimization of children does not go \nunsolved, or unpunished.\n  Second, the legislation will create a new Crimes Against Children \nSection at the Department of Justice, tasked with prosecuting crimes \nagainst children; providing guidance and assistance to Federal, State, \nand local law enforcement agencies and personnel who handle such cases; \ncoordinating efforts with international law enforcement agencies to \ncombat crimes against children; and acting as a liaison with the \nlegislative and judicial branches of government.\n  The bill also directs this new office in DOJ to create a national \nInternet site that will consolidate sex offender information which \nStates currently release under the federal reporting act.\n  The bill also directs States that have not developed Internet sites \nto do so. Currently, all 50 States have registration statutes that \nrequire sex offenders to register and to share information with the \nUnited States Attorney General through the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, and over 30 States make offender information available \nto the public on the Internet. But not all States include all available \ninformation, and there is no single place to easily acquire this \ninformation about local sex offenders. The national database will be \nsuch a place.\n  The legislation also prevents the use of the so-called ``Marital \nPrivilege'' to allow one spouse to protect another in cases where a \nparent, guardian or supervising adult has abused a child in the home. \nIf an adult is abusing a child in his or her own home, it is vital to \nput a stop to the situation. Allowing a spouse to refuse to testify \nabout the abuse by asserting an outdated ``marital privilege'' puts the \nchild at continuing risk. This makes no sense.\n  In order to assist law enforcement track and punish child predators \nand other violent criminals, this legislation also expands the class of \noffenses that are included in the Combined DNA Index System, CODIS, by \nadding to the system all Federal felonies and additional offenses \nthat subject Federal offenders to sex registration requirements. \nCurrently, only select Federal offenses are entered in CODIS.\n\n  The bill makes two modifications to Rule 414 of the Federal Rules of \nEvidence, which already allows evidence of a defendant's prior acts of \nchild molestation to be admitted in a criminal child molestation case.\n  Unfortunately, the definition of prior acts of child abuse includes \nonly children under 14, so acts against 15 or 16-year olds, for \ninstance, are inadmissable. This legislation extends the definition of \n``child'' contained in Rule 414 to include any person below the age of \n18--rather than age 14.\n  And the amendment also makes clear that where a defendant previously \npossessed what may have been virtual, as opposed to actual, child \npornography, such evidence is admissible under Rule 414.\n\n[[Page S8440]]\n\n  We have also included language to expand the Federal Wiretap Act by \nadding as predicate offenses to the statute, sex trafficking, sex \nexploitation, and other interstate sex offenses. Currently, the wiretap \nstatute authorizes the interception of wire, oral, or electronic \ncommunications in the investigation of just two sexual exploitation of \nchildren crimes.\n  To obtain a wiretap, law enforcement authorities will still need to \nmeet the strict statutory guidelines of the wiretap statute and obtain \nauthorization from a court.\n  The legislation would also extend the maximum supervised release \nperiod that applies to sexual offenders, by granting Federal judges the \ndiscretion to impose up to lifetime periods of supervised release for \nindividuals who are convicted of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, \ntransportation for illegal sexual activity, or sex trafficking \noffenses.\n  Under current law, a judge can impose no more than 5 years of \nsupervised release for a serious felony, and no more than 3 years for a \nlesser categorized offense. This amendment will not require judges to \nimpose a period of supervised release longer than 5 years; it simply \nauthorizes them to do so where the judge sees fit based on the nature \nand circumstances of the particular case. Some sexual offenders may \npose a potential risk to their communities for longer than 5 years, and \ndiscretion to supervise those offenders past an artificial time limit \nis simply common sense.\n  The legislation also increases the maximum penalties that apply to \ncertain sexual offenses, by doubling the maximum penalties for sex \noffenses involving the trafficking of children and other interstate \nelements. This will allow the Sentencing Commission, and federal \njudges, greater latitude in determining sentences for the worst of \noffenders. No changes are made to mandatory minimums.\n  Finally, we direct the Sentencing Commission to review the guidelines \nthat apply to child abuse and exploitation offenses to determine \nwhether they are sufficiently severe.\n  Earlier this month Senator Hutchinson and I introduced legislation to \nhelp establish a national AMBER alert system. These systems have been \nproven effective in finding abducted children quickly, and most \ncertainly saving some lives. That bill, which will pass tonight is one \nstep in protecting our children from dangerous predators.\n  The bill I introduce today with my good friend Senator Hatch is \nsimply another piece of the anti-predator puzzle. I hope my colleagues \nwill join us in this effort.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate agree to the committee substitute amendment, that the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, and that any statements relating to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 2896) was read the third time and passed.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  I do not know if a bill has ever gone through the Senate any faster. \nIt couldn't have happened without Senator Leahy. I think passing this \nkind of bill before we leave for 3 months could be responsible for \nsaving lives.\n  I am just so appreciative that we can go forward and that every \nsingle Senator on both sides of the aisle will give their consent to \nthis bill passing.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his \nleadership and for helping us work through what could have been a \ndelay, but it was not because of his leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Texas for her \nkind remarks, but I was simply able to expedite the very good work that \nshe and the distinguished Senator from California have done.\n  I note that what has happened here is an idea which has come from the \nSenator from Texas and the Senator from California, who have worked \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion. Actually, this is a nonpartisan \nissue. They are both parents. The Senator from Texas knows how much I \nadmire her work as a parent, as I do the Senator from California.\n  Whether or not you are a parent, the most terrifying experience is \nfor a child to be suddenly missing, especially if foul play is \ninvolved. I am not talking about a child getting lost on the way home \nfrom school who is going to show up an hour later because all the \nneighbors are out looking for that child or a child who stayed too long \nat a friend's house and forgot to call and then calls a frantic parent \n45 minutes or an hour later and says, ``Gee, I forgot to tell you I was \nat Johnny's or Susie's house,'' or something like that. This comes into \nplay in a case where, much as you hate to suspect there may be foul \nplay, there may well be.\n  If you can return one child--one child--to the parents, look at what \nyou have done. If you can return hundreds, which is the potential with \nthis legislation, look how much more you have done.\n  It is the case where you have big States, such as those of the \nSenator from Texas and the Senator from California. They come from very \nlarge States: large graphically, large in population. I come from a \nvery small State: small in geography, small in population. But if you \ncan tie in my part of the country--the northeastern part--we go from \nvery small States, such as mine, to the bordering States of New York \nand Massachusetts, which are much larger States in population. It is \nthe whole northeastern corridor, but somebody can drive through those \nStates in half the time it takes to drive, for example, across the \nState of Texas or the length of the State of California. So we have to \nbe able to coordinate.\n\n  I think that is why so many came together on this: Senators Hatch, \nBiden, Durbin, Edwards, Feingold, Kyl, Sessions--and I think you have \n34 cosponsors.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Thirty-eight.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Thirty-eight. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  The Senator from Florida represents a State the length of which, if \nit went in the other direction, it would go across time zones.\n  Incidentally, people may see the success stories on one or two \ntelevision programs, where there might have been one last year or last \nmonth or last week, but the Department of Justice estimates the number \nof children taken by strangers annually is between 3,000 and 4,000. \nThat is terrible.\n  This plan originated in Arlington, TX, after the murder of 9-year-old \nAmber Hagerman. We will help coordinate. We will make sure the local, \nState, and Federal officials can work together.\n  But not only that, private citizens will be involved because they \nwill hear from State broadcasters or from law enforcement people. I \ndon't know of anybody who hears of a missing child who would not want \nto help. And this will make that possible.\n  So it will help kidnap victims. It will also preserve the flexibility \nof the States because States are different in how they want to \nimplement it.\n  It is disturbing to see on TV or in the newspapers photo after photo \nof missing children from every corner of the Nation. As the father of \nthree children, as well as a grandfather of one grandson, with another \ngrandchild on the way, I know that an abducted child is a parent's or \ngrandparent's worst nightmare.\n  Unfortunately, it appears this nightmare is happening all too often. \nIndeed, the Justice Department estimates that the number of children \ntaken by strangers annually is between 3,000 and 4,000. These parents \nand grandparents, as well as the precious children, deserve the \nassistance of the American people and helping hand of the Congress.\n  By coordinating their efforts, law enforcement emergency management \nand transportation agencies, radio and television stations, and cable \nsystems have worked to develop an innovative early warning system to \nhelp find abducted children by broadcasting information--including \ndescriptions and pictures of the missing child, the suspected abductor, \na suspected vehicle, and any other information available and valuable \nto identifying the child and suspect--to the public as speedily as \npossible.\n  The AMBER Alert system's popularity has raced across the United\n\n[[Page S8441]]\n\nStates. Since the original AMBER Plan was established in 1996, 55 \nmodified versions have been adopted at local, regional, and statewide \nlevels. Eighteen States have already implemented statewide plans. It is \nalso a proven success--to date the AMBER Plan has been credited with \nrecovering 30 children.\n  This bipartisan legislation will authorize the Attorney General, in \ncooperation with the Secretary of Transportation and the Chairman of \nthe Federal Communications Commission to appoint a Justice Department \nNational AMBER Alert coordinator to oversee the Alert's communication \nnetwork for abducted children. The AMBER Alert Coordinator will work \nwith the States, broadcasters, and law enforcement agencies to set up \nAMBER plans, serve as a point of contact to supplement existing AMBER \nplans, and facilitate regional coordination of AMBER alerts.\n  It also directs the AMBER Alert coordinator, in conjunction with the \nFCC, local broadcasters, and local law enforcement agencies, to \nestablish voluntary guidelines for minimum standards in determining the \ncriteria for AMBER alerts and for the dissemination of those alerts. As \na result, our bipartisan bill helps kidnap victors while preserving \nflexibility for States in implementing the alert system.\n  Because developing and enhancing the AMBER alert system is a costly \nendeavor for States to take on alone, our bipartisan bill establishes \ntwo Federal grant programs to share the burden. First, the bill creates \na Federal grant program, under the direction of the Secretary of \nTransportation for statewide notification and communications systems, \nincluding electronic message boards and road signs, along highways for \nthe recovery of abducted children. Second, the bill establishes a grant \nprogram managed by the Attorney General for the support of AMBER alert \ncommunications plans with law enforcement agencies and others in the \ncommunity.\n  Our Nation's children, parents and grandchildren deserve our help to \nstop the disturbing trend of children abductions. I am gratified the \nSenate has passed the AMBER Alert National Network Act, and I hope the \nHouse and the President will act expeditiously on this important piece \nof legislation to ensure that our communications systems help rescue \nabducted children from their kidnapers and return them safely to their \nfamilies.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senators who have joined on this measure.\n  I yield the floor and thank the distinguished Senator from Florida \nfor his courtesy in allowing me to speak. But I hope he will note, in \nhonoring that, I tried to wear a suit as close in color to his as \npossible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/10/senate-section/article/S8441-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ELECTION REFORM\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, before the distinguished \nchairman of the Judiciary Committee leaves the floor, I want to call to \nhis attention, which I did a few minutes ago to his colleague, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Rules Committee, that, lo and behold, \nthere are problems with the voting equipment in Florida today during \nthe primary elections. It underscores the fact there is a need for this \nCongress to enact an election reform package.\n  In the Senate, we have passed a substantial bill which is a much \ndifferent version than has been passed by the other body, the House of \nRepresentatives. And the conference committee has been unable to come \nto terms of agreement.\n  If it can happen in Florida, almost 2 years after the awful \nexperience that the Nation went through in disputed ballots in the \ngeneral election of November 2000, it can happen anywhere. It was a \ncircumstance which riveted the attention of not only the Nation but the \nworld with ballots that were confusing--ballots that were miscounted \nbecause it was difficult to determine the intent of the voter.\n  In fact, the Florida legislature had responded by providing \nappropriations so that the various counties, through their supervisors \nof elections, could modernize and update voting equipment, as well as \nprocedures and providing voter education.\n  All of that has been in place in the State of Florida, where all of \nour citizens are so highly sensitive to the fact that their vote might \nnot be counted, as happened in the experience 2 years ago. If it can \nhappen in Florida today, as it literally has on primary election night, \nthen how much more likely will it happen in other States? And how much \nmore do we have to make the case that it is so important for us to get \nresolution of the differences and come to agreement in an election \nreform bill for the country as a whole?\n  That clearly is a matter that is relevant to the moment. As a result \nof the discrepancies that have happened earlier today in Florida, the \nGovernor has extended the deadline for voting in Florida from 8 o'clock \nEastern time to 10 o'clock this evening. So the results of the primary \nelections will be coming in quite late. Yet it bears to be underscored \nthis is another reason we need to pass the election reform bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/10/senate-section/article/S8441-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8441-S8443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              IN MEMORY OF THE CALIFORNIA VICTIMS OF 9/11\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for what \nhe said on the need to get homeland security right. He touched on the \nCoast Guard as an example of where we don't want to lose the function \nof the Coast Guard that is so important to our States--those of us who \nhave waterways and oceans and a search-and-rescue element. I could not \nagree more with that point.\n  I am also going to be working on the Federal Emergency Management \nAdministration. We know they have come to our rescue many times, and we \ndon't want to lose the ability of that agency to function in a natural \ndisaster, as well as, of course, utilizing them if, God forbid, we have \nanother terrorist attack. I think these are things on which we need to \nreflect.\n  I am very pleased that Senator Byrd has slowed us up on considering \nthis bill because it is not about an artificial date; it is about \ngetting it right.\n  Mr. President, I am here in a very somber mood. We are approximately \n15 hours away from the very moment 1 year ago that our Nation was hit, \nand I want to take just a moment of the Senate's time--maybe 15 \nminutes--to reflect on that day and, most of all, to remember the \nCalifornians we lost that day, numbering 54.\n  For me, and perhaps for you and many Americans, September has really \nbeen a month of excitement and anticipation. I have always loved \nSeptember. It is the end of the summer, the beginning of a beautiful \nfall with the changing of the leaves, back to school, and perhaps a \nlittle quicker pace, a faster step. September, for most of us, never \nreminds us of loss, of fear, of shock, of the horrors born of an \nextreme, unbridled, blind hatred.\n  In September, we found out about those things. We also found out as a \nNation what heroism truly is, how strong and united we can be, how we \ncan set aside differences for the greater good and work together.\n\n  The images of September 11 are deep in our minds and deep in our \nsouls. The pain is there, just under the surface. For some of us in \nAmerica, it is on the surface, and it will always be on the surface for \nthe families who grieve, for the children who will never know a \nparent--thousands of them--for communities that were decimated.\n  Today I want to remember those in my State who died on that day. Each \nwas unique. Every one of those planes on that fated day was headed to \nCalifornia. So even though my State was 3,000 miles away from Ground \nZero, from the World Trade Center or the Pentagon, we were linked in \nour sorrow, and we were linked in our outrage.\n  I am going to read the 54 names, and then I am going to talk a little \nmore about some of the people whose families wanted me to just say a \nlittle more about them and show their picture to you.\n  David Angell; Lynn Angell; David Aoyama; Melissa Barnes; Alan Beaven; \nBerry Berenson; Dr. Yen Betru; Carol Beug, and her mother Mary Alice \nWahlstrom died together on flight 93.

And we will always \ncling closer to our loved ones. This place, this great democracy, \nAmerica, will endure.\n  Now I am going to tell you a little bit more about a few of the \npeople we lost in California. Many people noted that the New York Times \nhas run an ongoing biography of the people who were lost on that day. I \nwas talking to Bob Kerrey, the former Senator from Nebraska, and he \nsaid this to a group of us: When you read those memorials, what you \nrealize is how wonderful and important each of these people was and \nwhat wonderful stories were related from their families, their friends, \nand their coworkers. What really emerged is why this is such a great \ncountry. These people, they do not get in the news. They get up and go \nabout their lives. That is what you are going to find out as I read \nabout these people and show these pictures in memoriam.\n\n\n                           Lauren Grandcolas\n\n  Mrs. Grandcolas was a 38-year-old advertising sales consultant when \nthe flight she was on, United flight 93, was hijacked by terrorists. As \nwe all know, that plane crashed in a Pennsylvania field killing \neveryone on board. We also know of the heroism of the passengers on \nthat plane.\n  Mrs. Grandcolas was born in Bloomington, IN, and attended the \nUniversity of Texas at Austin where she met her husband, Jack \nGrandcolas. After graduation, she worked as a marketing director for a \nlaw firm and then for PricewaterhouseCoopers.\n  At the time of her tragic death, Mrs. Grandcolas was working as an \nadvertising sales consultant at Good Housekeeping magazine and was \nresearching and writing a nonfiction book to help women boost their \nself-esteem.\n  Lauren had enthusiasm and passion for life, loved the outdoors and \nwas devoted to physical fitness. She hiked, jogged, kayaked, and \nenjoyed in-line skating around her neighborhood. Her energy was \nboundless. She took classes in cooking and gardening, scuba diving, and \nwine appreciation. Lauren was active with the United Way, March of \nDimes, Project Open Hand, Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, Breast Cancer \nAwareness, and Glide Memorial.\n  Her husband Jack recalls she had a heart the size of Texas. Knowing \nher flight had been hijacked, Lauren left her husband a message on \ntheir home answering machine and then loaned her cell phone to another \npassenger to call loved ones.\n  The joy Lauren felt pursuing new interests and developing new skills \nwas being interwoven in the book she was writing for women. Jack \nrecalls:\n\n       She made a point to do things that were good for her, and \n     she thought she could extend what she had learned to help \n     other adult women gain confidence. Her sister and I will \n     fulfill her dream by completing the book.\n\n  Lauren Grandcolas is missed deeply by her family.\n  I wanted to take a moment to tell you a little bit more about her.\n\n\n                          Nicole Carol Miller\n\n  This next picture in memoriam is of Nicole Carol Miller. I want to \nstart out by reading a poem that was dedicated to Nicole that was \nwritten by her father, David James Miller. It was written last \nSeptember 11. If I cannot get through this, I will put it in the \nRecord. My daughter's name is Nicole. This is the poem.\n\n     How I love thee My Nicole.\n     When the thoughts of you come into my mind\n     It's as if a breeze has passed through our rose garden and \n           the sweet savory I smell\n     The taste of roses upon my tongue brings the sweetness of \n           your memory to my mind\n     It comes upon me as the morning dew weighs the roses down\n     Smooth and pleasant are the thoughts of you, as the petals of \n           a rose\n     And once again I am nourished with your love.\n\n  Nicole Carol was a lovely 21-year-old college student when the flight \nshe was on, United flight 93, was hijacked by the terrorists. That was \nthe plane that was brought down by the passengers in Pennsylvania.\n  Nicole's memory lives on in the hearts of those she loved. She took \ngreat joy in life and exemplified this with her wonderful outlook and \nher tenacious personality. Nicole's radiant smile, which we can see in \nthis photo, could light up the room as she energized those around her. \nShe knew how to be an outstanding friend. She was blessed with two \nfamilies, her father and stepmother, David and Catherine Miller of \nChico, CA, and her mother and stepfather, Cathy and Wayne Stefani, Sr., \nof San Jose, CA.\n  In her father's words:\n\n       She had that sweet baby quality. She could make you smile \n     and forget your troubles for a little bit.\n\n  Friend Heidi Barnes describes Nicole as very friendly and welcoming. \nShe had a big heart, and it was open to everyone.\n  Nicole lived in San Jose, CA, with her mother and stepfather. She \nattended local schools and graduated from Pioneer High School in 1998. \nA talented softball player during all 4 years of high school, Nicole \nwon a college softball scholarship during her senior year. Even though \nshe had never been a competitive swimmer, she tried out for the Pioneer \nHigh swim team as a freshman and made the team. At the time of her \ntragic death, she was a dean's list student at West Valley College in \nSaratoga working part time and weighing whether to transfer to \nCalifornia State University at Chico or San Jose State University.\n  I offer this tribute to Nicole.\n\n\n                              hilda marcin\n\n  I would like to take this opportunity to share with the Senate the \nmemory of one of my constituents, Hilda Marcin, who lost her life on \nSeptember 11, 2001. Mrs. Marcin was 79 years old when the flight she \nwas on, United Airlines Flight 93, was hijacked by terrorists. As we \nall know, that plane crashed in a Pennsylvania field, killing everyone \non board.\n  Mrs. Marcin was born in Schwedelbach, Germany. When she was 7 years \nold, her family emigrated to the United States to escape oppression. \nLike many immigrants, her family left all possessions behind and came \nonly with the clothes on their backs.\n  Her family settled in Irvington, NJ, where she attended local \nschools. She worked seven days a week in the payroll department of the \nNew Jersey shipyards during World War II.\n  A friend arranged a blind date with Edward Marcin and they were \nmarried on February 13, 1943. They had two daughters, Elizabeth and \nCarole. The Marcin family enjoyed participating in school functions, \nclass trips, the PTA, and various church activities. Mr. and Mrs. \nMarcin were also socially and politically active in Irvington. Mrs. \nMarcin later worked as a special education teacher's aide.\n  Hilda Marcin embraced life with enthusiasm and made the most of every \nminute. She adored her family and her granddaughter, Melissa Kemmerer \nLata. She was an inspiration to those she touched, including the \nspecial needs children in the school where she worked. Her friends \nadmired her positive attitude and her desire and ability to continue \nworking during the later years of her life. Mrs. Marcin treasured \nfreedom and democracy, and her American citizenship.\n  At the time of her death, Mrs. Marcin was flying to San Francisco to \nlive with her younger daughter, Carole O'Hare. She is survived by her \ndaughter, Elizabeth Kemmerer and son-in-\n\n[[Page S8443]]\n\nlaw Raymond Kemmerer; daughter Carole O'Hare and son-in-law Thomas \nO'Hare; and granddaughter Melissa Lata and Melissa's husband, Edward \nLata. I offer this tribute to her.\n\n\n                               DANIEL LEE\n\n  Daniel Lee lost his life on September 11, 2001. Mr. Lee was 34 years \nold when the plane he was on, American Airlines Flight 11, was hijacked \nby terrorists. As we all know, that plane crashed into the World Trade \nCenter, killing everyone on board.\n  Daniel Lee grew up in Palm Desert, CA. He was a carpenter and a \ndrummer in a local southern California band. He met his wife, Kellie, \nin 1991 at a rock concert in which he was playing the drums. They were \nmarried October 7, 1995 and their first child, Amanda Beth, was born \nDecember 11, 1998.\n  Mr. Lee was a dedicated and successful set carpenter in the music \nindustry, known to work 20 hour days when necessary. He worked with \nmany talented musicians including Neil Diamond, Barbara Streisand, \nN'Sync, Aerosmith and Yanni. He was touring with the Backstreet Boys \nwhen, on September 11, 2001, he left to fly home to be with his wife as \nshe was about to give birth to their second child. Allison Danielle Lee \nwas born September 13, 2001.\n  Kellie Lee recalls Dan's bright, relaxed and charming smile. ``He was \ncaring, loving, funny and romantic. He loved being a Dad and was so \nexcited about having another child on the way,'' she says. One of his \nspecial joys was getting friends together for barbeques and pool \nparties,'' Kellie remembers.\n  Dan Lee is survived by his wife, Kellie Lee, his daughters, Amanda \nand Allison, mother and stepfather Elaine and John Sussino, brothers \nJack Fleishman and Stuart Lee and sister, Randi Kaye. I offer this \ntribute to Daniel Lee.\n  Mr. President, I take this opportunity to share with the Senate the \nmemory of one of my constituents, Mari-Rae Sopper, who lost her life on \nSeptember 11, 2001. Ms. Sopper was a 35-year-old lawyer and gymnastics \ncoach when the flight she was on, American Airlines Flight 77, was \nhijacked by terrorists. As we all know, that plane crashed into the \nPentagon, killing everyone on board.\n  Ms. Sopper was a native of Inverness, IL, and attended William Fremd \nHigh School in Palatine, IL. At the age of 15 she set the goal of \nbecoming a champion gymnast. She succeeded, becoming all-American in 4 \nevents, the school's Athlete of the Year and the state's Outstanding \nSenior Gymnast of the Year.\n  Larry Petrillo, her high school gymnastics coach, remembers her as \nbrash and committed. ``One thing she taught me is, you never settle for \nless than you are capable of. We should never accept limits. We should \nalways fight the good fight. She was a staunch supporter of gymnastics \nand what's right,'' he recalls.\n  Upon graduating from Iowa State University with a degree in exercise \nscience, Ms. Sopper earned a master's degree in athletics \nadministration from the University of North Texas and a law degree from \nthe University of Denver. Ms. Sopper was an accomplished dancer and \nchoreographer and continued to coach at gymnastics clubs.\n  Ms. Sopper practiced law as a Lieutenant in the Navy's JAG Corps, \nfocusing on Defense and Appellate Defense. She had left the Navy JAG \nCorps and was an associate with the law firm Schmeltzer, Aptaker & \nSheperd, P.C. when she found her dream job: to coach the women's \ngymnastics team at the University of California at Santa Barbara.\n  It was a 1-year appointment and Ms. Sopper was looking forward to the \nchallenge. Her mother, Marion Kminek, says Mari-Rae was excited about \nthe opportunity. ``I said go for it. Life is too short. It was \nsomething she had always wanted to do and she was so happy and \nexcited,'' recalls Kminek.\n  At the time of her death, Ms. Sopper was moving to Santa Barbara to \nbegin her appointment. Her close friend, Mike Jacki, recalls ``This was \nto be a new adventure for Mari-Rae, and an opportunity to get back into \nthe sport she loved. We have lost a very special person. She was \nprepared to make her dream come true, and in an instant it was gone.''\n  Mari-Rae Sopper is remembered for her loyalty, strong values, \nexcellent work ethic and spirit for life. She is survived by her \nmother, Marion Kminek and stepfather, Frank Kminek, her father Bill \nSopper, sister Tammy and many loving friends.\n  Mr. President, the last story I share with the Senate is the memory \nof one of my young constituents, Deora Bodley, who lost her life on \nSeptember 11, 2001. Ms. Bodley was a 20-year-old college student when \nthe flight she was on, United Airlines Flight 93, was hijacked by \nterrorists. As we all know, that plane crashed in a Pennsylvania field, \nkilling everyone on board.\n  Ms. Bodley grew up in San Diego, California. As a high school \nstudent, she visited local high schools to discuss HIV/AIDS with her \npeers. She volunteered with the Special Olympics and a local animal \nshelter. Chris Schuck, her English teacher at La Jolla Country Day \nSchool, recalls, ``Deora was always thinking big and going after big \ngame.''\n  At the time of her death, Ms. Bodley was studying psychology at Santa \nClara University. She coordinated volunteers in a literacy program for \nelementary school students. Kathy Almazol, principal at St. Clare \nCatholic Elementary, recalls Ms. Bodley had ``a phenomenal ability to \nwork with people, including the children she read to, her peer \nvolunteers, the school administrators and teachers. We have 68 kids who \nhad a personal association with Deora.''\n  In the words of her mother, Deborah Borza, ``Deora has always been \nabout peace.'' At the tender age of 11 years, Deora wrote in her \njournal, ``People ask who, what, where, when, why, how. I ask peace.'' \nA warm and generous person, Deora was a gifted student and a wonderful \nfriend. Wherever she went, her light shined brightly.\n  Deora's father, Derrill Bodley, of Stockton, CA, feels her life was \nabout ``getting along'' and sharing a message of peace. Her 11-year-old \nsister, Murial, recalls Deora taught her many things and says, ``Most \nof all she taught me to be kind to other people and animals. I cherish \nthe memories of my sister and plan to work hard in school and in \neverything I do so she can be proud of me like I was of her.''\n  Mr. President, none of us is untouched by the terror of September \n11th, and many Californians were part of each tragic moment of that \ntragic day. Some were trapped in the World Trade Center towers. Some \nwere at work in the Pentagon. And the fates of some were sealed as they \nboarded planes bound for San Francisco or Los Angeles.\n  So I am honored and very moved to have had this chance to put into \nthe Record today the names of these more than 50 Californians, every \none now a bright and shining star in the sky. Their memories will live \non and their legacies will live on, as will the memories and legacies \nof every American and every person, every innocent victim, who was cut \ndown in the most hateful way on that tragic day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/10/senate-section/article/S8443-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8443-S8446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from California for her eloquent \nremarks. It is time for a memory indeed. Tomorrow I will be going to \nthe Pentagon for a memorial service, as will many other Senators, to \nmemorialize that terrible day on September 11, when we lost the people \nat the Pentagon. Five of those lost at the Pentagon happened to be from \nthe State of Alabama, but the State has lost 10 or more personnel since \nthis war on terrorism began. It has touched the entire country.\n  Some of our finest people, innocent of any wrongdoing, innocent of \nany involvement in what might be considered to be oppression or \ndisagreements with the terrorists who did these acts, paid the price. \nHistorically, the civilized world has rejected these acts.\n  But there is afoot today terrorist groups and terrorist cells \nthroughout the country. A significant number of people would believe \nthey have a right to use terrorism and weapons of mass destruction to \nkill and maim people who have done nothing in their lives to wrong \nthem. I believe we have to confront that.\n  The President has been talking about Iraq and the problem it \npresents. It is\n\n[[Page S8444]]\n\na real problem. It is a problem that will not go away.\n  We could wish it would go away, but it will not go away. The reason \nis they have been in such continual violation of the agreements they \nmade with regard to not participating in weapons of mass destruction.\n  We are in a critical time right now. I think the President has done \nthe right thing, to say he wants Congress to participate in a debate \nand to give him a resolution of support of his action with regard to \nIraq. I believe that is a good step. I think it is good, not because it \nis absolutely clear to me that it is required--I know Senator Dayton is \na member of the Armed Services Committee and has been through a lot of \nthese hearings--but we are at this point with regard to Iraq because we \nheld back. We did not complete the job. We did not continue to move \ninto Baghdad and capture or kill Saddam Hussein and completely take \nthat country in 1991 during the gulf war--Desert Storm. We didn't do \nthat.\n  We said OK, and the U.N. sort of stepped in, and they wrote up this \nagreement, and Saddam Hussein agreed to many different things. He \nagreed to reject weapons of mass destruction, chemical and biological \nweapons, and not only did he agree not to do those things, he agreed \nU.N. inspectors could be sent there to actually go into his country and \nexamine anything that looked unusual, he would not attempt to stop \nthat, and we could send inspectors to prove he was not participating in \nweapons of mass destruction--chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons.\n  But what has happened? The history is very sad. It is a circumstance \nthat is particularly frustrating. We wish we did not have to direct our \nattention to it, but we do. It is not going away. He has broken \nvirtually every one of the promises he made, and I suspect, from what I \nread, the President is going to talk about that at the U.N.\n  Let me say this about the United Nations. The United Nations is a \nnoble organization, with noble goals, that deserves respect. Remember \nin the Declaration of Independence, they, the fathers of the American \nRevolution, used the phrase ``a decent respect for the opinions of \nmankind'' to require them to set forth the reasons for separation, the \nreasons for revolution.\n  So I think the President should explain to the world--and the U.N. is \na great forum to do that--precisely why he believes we should act now.\n  I suspect what he is going to talk a lot about is resolutions that \nSaddam Hussein agreed to and that were put forth by the U.N. and were \nU.N. resolutions that have been violated. Resolution after resolution, \nfor a decade or more, they have been in violation. He will raise that \ntomorrow--or Thursday, as he should.\n  The gravity of the problem is clear. Saddam Hussein's violations are \nmatters of life and death. I wish it were not so. I wish it were just \nsome disagreement over tariffs, or maybe oil prices, or something like \nthat. But what we are talking about is that Saddam Hussein has, with \ndetermination and consistency for many years before the gulf war--11, \n12 years ago, and since--persisted to develop weapons that he has used \nin this world. So it is a matter of life and death.\n  They demonstrate not just technical infringements on their agreements \nbut they constitute a deliberate and determined program to develop \nweapons of mass destruction that he himself can use if he desires, or \nhe can in secret provide to stateless terrorists so they can use these \nweapons on law-abiding American citizens and people of the world. So \nthere is a real danger here.\n\n  Some say: What new evidence do you have to go forward? What new \nevidence do we have? Apparently, from some of the things you read in \nthe papers--and I will not make reference to anything that is \nconfidential--there have been indications that there is new evidence to \nindicate continued progress toward achieving dangerous weapons. We \nknow, for example--we were shocked to find, at the time of the gulf war \nwhen we were victorious and did the inspection of the nuclear \nfacilities, that Saddam Hussein had--that they were within 6 months of \nbeing able to produce a nuclear bomb when the United States \nsuccessfully defeated Iraq in that war--6 months. The experts did not \nthink that at the time, but the inspection of the country afterwards \nfound that.\n  So I would say first of all, as Secretary Rumsfeld said: Oftentimes \nwe know what we don't know. We know some things that indicate that he \nhas continued steadfastly to improve chemical, biological, and nuclear \nweapons. We know that. But precisely how far he has gone we cannot say. \nBut we know what his goal is. It has not changed. So I would say that \nis important for us to remember.\n  These things should not come as a surprise to any serious observer of \nthe scene. We have been dealing with this man and his deliberate plans \nto obtain weapons of mass destruction for quite a number of years, and \nvirtually daily since the gulf war. The fact is, he had no intention of \ncomplying with the world's demands to stop. He will not stop. Will a \nsingle person in this Congress, will a single person, come forth and \nsay that they believe he will even unequivocally promise to stop? Which \nI doubt he will--but he might. But more important, will he actually \nstop production of these weapons? I challenge this body and the House \nof Representatives, and I will ask that question. Is there anyone here \nwho thinks he sincerely will stop his activities to build weapons of \nmass destruction? I do not think anyone would.\n  Why? Is it just anger we are involved in here? Are we just angry over \nhis bellicose statements about the United States? Are we just angry \nover his attempt to assassinate the President of the United States? Is \nit just anger over the fact that he gave $25,000 rewards to families of \nsuicide bombers in Israel or other places, people who would murder \ninnocent civilians, that cause us to say we don't trust him? No. It is \nnot anger--although we have a right to be indignant over what he does. \nBut we must not act solely out of anger.\n  I used to try criminal cases as a Federal prosecutor. Many times, the \nevidence from credible, honest witnesses would be contradicted solely \nby the words of the defendant. He would say: I didn't do it.\n  I used to do a little deal sometimes and talk to the jury. I said: \nJust because somebody says they won't do it doesn't mean they will not. \nI can say: I don't have a pencil in my hand, and if I do, I am not \ngoing to drop it. And I didn't drop it. I didn't drop the pencil.\n  Does that change the fact that I had a pencil and I dropped it? I \nthink not.\n  This man is not credible. What we have to do when we deal with a man \nof this kind is look at his acts. Can they be just short-term acts? \nThat is important, but long-term acts are even more important.\n  I think a decision that is to be made by a great nation, a nation \nthat desires to protect its citizens and has the protection and \nsecurity of its citizens in this country and around the world as its \nhighest priority, that nation has to be serious. We cannot deal in \nwishful thinking. We cannot do so.\n  People say to me, basically: Can't we get along? Why do you want to \ntalk about war?\n  Why do we have to wrestle with these issues? Isn't it possible that \nSaddam Hussein has seen the light and will change? I think people are \nnot saying that. I don't think people are saying it. But in their \nhearts they are hoping that. Sometimes I think the same way. Isn't it \njust possible that this will change?\n  But let us consider the matter rationally and reasonably. What are \nthe facts? What is the evidence? Is there a case here?\n  When solely evaluated, I submit there is overwhelming evidence that \nthe facts present a demonstration that Saddam Hussein is manipulating \nthe world, acting to keep them at bay while he steadfastly pursues his \nplan for weapons of mass destruction in direct violation of the \nagreement that saved his monstrous regime 11 years ago.\n  There are many ways to detail the charges against this most vicious \ndictator with the possible exception of North Korea, the most brutal \ndictator in the world today, and one who has been more active to export \nhis violence than any other nation in the world today.\n  At this time, I think we should talk about the Iraq Liberation Act of \n1998. This Congress voted on it. It passed the House of Representatives \nalmost unanimously. There were maybe 30 ``no'' votes. It passed in this \nbody unanimously by consent.\n\n[[Page S8445]]\n\n  This is what we found in 1998 at a time when Saddam Hussein ejected \nthe inspectors that he agreed to have come into his country. We did \nnothing about it. This is what the findings say:\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings.\n       On September 22nd, 1980, Iraq invaded Iran, starting an 8-\n     year war in which Iraq employed chemical weapons against \n     Iranian troops, and ballistic missiles against Iranian \n     cities.\n\n  This country is not Iraq. It is not a backward country. It has a \ngovernment of laws, longstanding. It has for that region of the world \nan educated population. They are capable of doing so much better than \nthey are today.\n  Unfortunately, the people of Iraq are suffering more than anyone else \nas a result of Saddam Hussein's bad leadership.\n  It goes on in paragraph 2:\n\n       In February of 1988, Iraq forcibly relocated Kurdish \n     civilians----\n\n  These are citizens of Iraq----\n\n       from their home villages in the Anfal campaign, killing an \n     estimated 50,000 to 180,000 Kurds----\n\n  Fifty-thousand to 100,000 of his own civilians in 1988 after he lost \nthe war, after he signed an agreement not to use weapons of mass \ndestruction, and after he agreed to inspections----\n\n       On March 16th, 1988, Iraq used chemical weapons against the \n     Iraqi Kurdish civilian opponents in the town of Halabja \n     killing an estimated 5,000 Kurds----\n\n  Causing numerous birth defects that affect the town to this day.\n  How long has it been since a nation in the world used chemical \nweapons against anyone, much less their own citizens, killing 5,000 \nKurds? It is a despicable act by a despicable man who is not worthy to \nbe a part of civilized nations, I submit.\n  On August 2nd, 1990, Iraq invaded and began a 7-month occupation of \nKuwait.\n  This is a sovereign, independent nation on its border that happened \nto have substantial oil reserves that Saddam Hussein wanted. So on \nAugust 2, 1990, he invaded and began a 7-month occupation killing and \ncommitting numerous abuses against Kuwaiti citizens and setting Kuwaiti \noilfields ablaze in his retreat.\n\n  Do you remember that? Just out of perversion and pure meanness, he \nset the oilwells on fire, polluting the atmosphere, putting at risk \nthousands of lives, and causing tremendous expense to bring those fires \nunder control. In fact, they were brought under control better than we \nhad any right to expect. At first, people expected it would take much \nlonger than the long period it ultimately took.\n  No. 5--this is our findings, the Congress:\n\n       Hostilities in Operation Desert Storm ended on February \n     28th, 1991, and Iraq subsequently accepted the cease-fire \n     conditions in the United Nations Security Council Resolution \n     687 on April 3, 1991, requiring Iraq, among other things, to \n     disclose and fully permit the dismantlement of his weapons of \n     mass destruction program, and submit to long-term monitoring \n     and verification of such a dismantlement.\n\n  That was the basic condition of it. We said: OK. Mr. Saddam Hussein, \nwe will not continue this war. We have ousted you from Kuwait where you \nhad no right to be, but you have to agree to dismantle your weapons of \nmass destruction. OK. He agreed to that. That was the U.N.-brokered \ndeal.\n  Paragraph 6:\n\n       In April of 1993, Iraq orchestrated a failed plot to \n     assassinate former President George Bush during his April 14 \n     through 16, 1993, visit to Kuwait.\n\n  What a despicable act. I submit to you as a Member of the Senate of \nany party that when a head of a foreign nation deliberately sets about \nto assassinate the leader or former leader of any great nation, that is \nsomething that should not be lightly dealt with. Frankly, I think we \ndealt with it too lightly at the time. We did take some action but not \nenough.\n  This man attempted to kill, assassinate the President, former \nPresident of the United States of America while he was visiting Kuwait, \na country that former President Bush had led the liberation of and \nfreed from this oppressive regime.\n  So it continues. That was in April of 1993:\n\n       In October of 1994, Iraq moved 80,000 troops to areas near \n     the border of Kuwait posing an imminent threat of renewed \n     invasion of or attack against Kuwait.\n\n  This is a man who wants us to get along with him and says, If you \nwant complete destruction of my Government, I will behave and end \nweapons, and I will get along with my neighbors. And here he is moving \n80,000 troops down on the border towards Kuwait where he does not \nstation them normally. It just shows the aggressive hostilities of \nwhich he is capable.\n  On August 31 of 1996, paragraph 8:\n\n       In the findings of the U.S. Congress, Iraq oppressed many \n     of its opponents by helping one Kurdish faction capture the \n     seat of a Kurdish regional government.\n       Since March of 1996, Iraq has systematically sought to deny \n     weapons inspectors from the United Nations Special Commission \n     on Iraq--UNSCOM--access to key facilities and documents, has \n     on several occasions endangered the safe operation of \n     UNSCOM's helicopters transporting UNSCOM personnel in Iraq, \n     and has persisted in a pattern of deception and concealment \n     regarding the history of its weapons of mass destruction \n     program----\n       And persisted in a pattern of deception and concealment \n     regarding the history of his weapons of mass destruction \n     programs----\n\n  The U.S. Congress, U.S. Senate unanimously found:\n\n       On August 5 of 1998, Iraq ceased all cooperation with \n     UNSCOM, and subsequently threatened to end long-term \n     monitoring activities by the International Atomic Energy \n     Agency and UNSCOM.\n\n  The International Atomic Energy Agency is monitoring Iraq's nuclear \nbomb capability.\n  Paragraph 11:\n\n       On August 14, 1998, President Clinton signed Public Law \n     105-235 which declared that ``the Government of Iraq is in \n     material and unacceptable breach of its international \n     obligations'' and urged the President ``to take appropriate \n     action, in accordance with the Constitution and relevant \n     laws of the United States, to bring Iraq into compliance \n     with its international obligations.''\n  No. 12:\n\n       On May 1, 1998, President Clinton signed Public Law 105-\n     174, which made $5,000,000 available for assistance to the \n     Iraqi democratic opposition for such activities as \n     organization, training, communication and dissemination of \n     information, developing and implementing agreements among \n     opposition groups, compiling information to support the \n     indictment of Iraqi officials for war crimes, and for related \n     purposes.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Sense Of The Congress Regarding United States Policy Toward \n     Iraq.\n\n  In Section 3, this is what we found as a Congress:\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States to support \n     efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from \n     power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic \n     government to replace that regime.\n\n  I repeat that. That is so important. We voted unanimously in this \nSenate that:\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States to support \n     efforts to remove the regime headed by Saddam Hussein from \n     power in Iraq and to promote the emergence of a democratic \n     government to replace that regime.\n\n  I suppose we have tried to do so in many different ways. The problem \nis, we have not been very successful. Iraq continues to make a mockery \nof its agreements and continues to build and develop weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  So the President is, I am sure, from newspaper reports, going to talk \nabout that to the United Nations. I am so glad that he is because we \nhave to think about an important subject.\n  Mr. President, you are aware that the Economist magazine, a London \npublication, in England, which is seriously reviewed around the world--\nand people give its opinions great weight--has expressed a view that \nthere is no alternative but to war in this circumstance.\n  A couple months ago, they had an insert on the role of American \nforeign policy in the world, and they talked about this tension between \nmultilateralism and unilateral action by the President, or can the \nUnited States act alone or with a few allies? They raised this \nquestion.\n  Multilateralists say we ought to reach agreements, and those \nagreements ought to be for the purpose of making our world safer. And \nthey can work in that regard. The question the Economist posed is: What \nif the people who sign them do not abide by them? What if the people \nwho have signed them deliberately, deceitfully operate in violation of \nthose agreements, thereby threatening the safety and security of the \nrest of the world? Does the world just sit by and do nothing? Is that a \ncredible response?\n  Do you think that is what was on President Bush's mind when he said, \nin recent words--and I think I can quote\n\n[[Page S8446]]\n\nhim directly--``the credibility of the world is at stake''?\n  Yes, it is one thing to have resolutions. It is one thing to say we \nare going to have agreements so we can go away and wash our hands and \nsay the matter is solved and the danger is over. That may be OK if it \nis a trade issue or some such event as that. But if it is a matter of \nlife and death, dealing with a country that is capable of and has \nproven in the past it will use weapons of mass destruction against \nenemies in its own country and outside their country, if that is so, \nthen we have a big problem.\n\n  So I think the President is determined to confront this issue and \nthat the status quo in Iraq is not sufficient. We need to go back and \nremember what has already occurred. And that is where we are.\n  They say: Well, you have to have a unanimous vote. The United Nations \nhas to support this action. I think a decent respect for the United \nNations calls on the President to go there and state his case. I think \nit is important for the President to explain it to good and decent \nleaders all over the world, and seek their support wherever he can get \nit. But as a member of the Armed Services Committee, I can tell you, we \ndo not have to have the support of any one nation to defeat Iraq. I \nhope we can do it promptly.\n  One thing I do believe is, he does not have popular support in his \ncountry and many of the people will be delighted to see him go. And I \nthink it is not as if we are attacking a country that has loyal and \ndecent people willing to die for their country. There may be some, but \nit is not nearly that many because this man is a brutal dictator.\n  But the President is required to state his case around the world. \nThat is important. I hope he does not feel compelled to describe, in \nany detailed way, precisely how he might conduct a war, if a war \nbecomes necessary. Maybe it will not be. I hope it will not be. But \nfrom my reading of this history, both before Desert Storm and after, of \nSaddam Hussein's absolutely steadfast determination to frustrate the \nworld and do what he wants to do, I do not believe he is going to \nchange. So I think we are going to be confronted with that situation \nsooner or later.\n  The question is, shouldn't we have the support of the United Nations? \nThe problem there is this: A United Nations resolution requires a \nSecurity Council vote, a unanimous vote of the Security Council.\n  The American people have spent a lot of money building up the \ngreatest military force in the history of the world. We will spend, \nnext year, $370 or so billion on a national defense system for this \ncountry. And on the United Nations Security Council there are countries \nsuch as France and Germany and England, and also China and Russia. So \nwhat are we going to do? Are we going to say that the Chinese or the \nRussians, or any other member of the Security Council, for any reason \nthey choose, has the right to say: No, Mr. President, we don't agree. \nYou can't use force against Iraq. You can't use force to liberate \nKuwait. You can't use force against Panama, as President Bush did. You \ncan't act against Kosovo because we say no?\n  That is not something that a great nation, the preeminent world \npower--let's say it frankly--can allow. The preeminent world power--a \ngood and decent nation, whose actions are not for self gain but to \nvindicate legitimate rights and interests--cannot allow its power to be \ncurtailed by the vote of one nation in the U.N. Security Council.\n  So the President cannot say: I am going to defer this matter to the \nU.N. That would be absolutely wrong. It would be unwise. And the \nAmerican people would not support that. It is our military. We did it \nto protect our just national interests--not our unjust national \ninterests, but our just, legitimate national interests. I believe the \nPresident understands that distinction. I hope that we, as Americans, \nthink that through because some tend to believe we have to have a vote \nof the U.N. before we can act to defend our national security interests \naround the world, and that is not correct. Very few would agree with \nthat.\n  We are in a time of remembrance as we move toward September 11. We \nwill be at the Pentagon tomorrow. Others will be in New York. Others \nwill be in Pennsylvania. Others will have memorials in their \ncommunities and towns, as I will be visiting one in Birmingham, hosted \nby the religious community, to commemorate this sad occasion of \nSeptember 11.\n  The President told us we were going to have to return to our \nfundamental beliefs, we were going to have to be courageous, and if we \nstepped out and took on these people, and we chased them to their lairs \nand went after them, we could make the world safer.\n  I believe the world is safer today. I believe it is an unacceptable \npolicy to allow any nation to harbor terrorists, to allow any nation to \nallow their territory to be used as a training base or where they can \nbuild their weapons and plot their diabolical actions. We cannot allow \nthat to happen. It is against the policy of the United States and this \nCongress, I believe.\n  We are in a time that all of us need to study how we got to where we \nare, being quite serious about this entire circumstance. I am coming to \nthe conclusion that it is very unlikely, based on the consistent, long-\nterm history of Saddam Hussein, that we can reach any kind of agreement \nwith him.\n  As the Economist magazine said, for 11 years we have been trying to \ncontain him in a box. The box is leaking. Who has suffered most? The \npeople and children of Iraq. They are the ones who have been suffering \nfor these 12 years. It is difficult for us to defend to the Arab world \nthis kind of oppression that falls mainly on the innocent. They said, \nconcluding their very serious editorial: Painful as it is, our vote is \nfor war.\n  I hope we don't come to that, but I am afraid that is where we are \nheading. It is a subject we have to talk about. I believe that debate \nwill now commence.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/10/senate-section/article/S8446-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8446-S8447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REVISIONS TO THE 2002 APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE ALLOCATIONS AND THE \n                          BUDGETARY AGGREGATES\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, section 314 of the Congressional Budget \nAct, as amended, requires the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee \nto adjust the budgetary aggregates and the allocation for the \nAppropriations Committee by the amount of appropriations designated as \nemergency spending pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced \nBudget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.\n  On July 23, I filed adjustments to the 2002 budgetary aggregates and \nallocation for the Appropriations Committee resulting from the $29.9 \nbillion in emergency funding included in the conference report to H.R. \n4775, the 2002 Supplemental Appropriations Act for Further Recovery \nFrom and Response to Terrorist Attacks on the United States (Public Law \n107-206). The legislation, however, included $5.1 billion in emergency \nfunding that the Congress made contingent on the President designating \nthe total amount as emergency spending within 30 days of enactment. On \nAugust 13, the President announced that he would not declare the $5.1 \nbillion as emergency spending, thereby vitiating the entire amount. \nConsequently, I am lowering the adjustments I made on July 23 by the \namount of the contingency--$5.1 billion in budget authority--as well as \nby the estimated amount of the contingency's impact on 2002 outlays--\n$0.96 billion.\n  Pursuant to section 302 of the Congressional Budget Act, I hereby \nrevise the 2002 allocation provided to the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee in the concurrent budget resolution in the following amounts:\n\n     TABLE 1.--REVISED ALLOCATION FOR APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE, 2002\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              Budget\n                                             authority        Outlays\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCurrent Allocation:\n  General Purpose Discretionary.........         734,126         700,500\n  Highways..............................               0          28,489\n  Mass Transit..........................               0           5,275\n  Conservation..........................           1,760           1,473\n  Mandatory.............................         358,567         350,837\n                                         -------------------------------\n      Total.............................       1,094,453       1,086,574\nAdjustments:\n  General Purpose Discretionary.........          -5,139            -962\n  Highways..............................               0               0\n  Mass Transit..........................               0               0\n  Conservation..........................               0               0\n  Mandatory.............................               0               0\n                                         -------------------------------\n      Total.............................          -5,139            -962\nRevised Allocation:\n  General Purpose Discretionary.........         728,987         699,538\n  Highways..............................               0          28,489\n\n[[Page S8447]]\n\n \n  Mass Transit..........................               0           5,275\n  Conservation..........................           1,760           1,473\n  Mandatory.............................         358,567         350,837\n                                         -------------------------------\n      Total.............................       1,089,314       1,085,612\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Pursuant to section 311 of the Congressional Budget Act, I hereby \nrevise the 2002 budget aggregates included in the concurrent budget \nresolution in the following amounts.\n\n                TABLE 2.--REVISED BUDGET AGGREGATES, 2002\n                        [In millions of dollars]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                              Budget\n                                             authority        Outlays\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCurrent allocation: Budget Resolution...       1,710,450       1,653,782\nAdjustments: Emergency Spending.........          -5,139            -962\nRevised allocation: Budget Resolution...       1,705,311       1,652,820\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPrepared by SBC Majority Staff on 9-10-02.\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/10/senate-section/article/S8447-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8447]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I rise to salute a World War II \nveteran from my home State of Oregon. Today, I want to recognize the \nefforts of August F. ``Gus'' Smoorenburg, a member of the European \nresistance fighters who lived and struggled in Nazi occupied \nterritories throughout the last century's largest and most destructive \nwar.\n  Born in Amsterdam in the 1920s, Gus was 19 years old when Germany \ninvaded Holland, Luxembourg, and France. To stop the Germans, the Dutch \ntried using their own landscape, opening the country's famous dams and \nsluices to stop tanks and trucks filled with soldiers. After the brutal \nkilling of thousands of civilians, including schoolchildren, the Dutch \nsurrendered on May 15, 1940.\n  The European resistance fighters, as they have come to be known, \nbegan as independent groups of youths clandestinely sabotaging the \noccupying German forces by whatever means at their disposal. Resistance \ngroups sprang up in every Nazi-occupied country. Gradually, like-minded \npeople banded together and worked in secret to overthrow the invaders. \nDutch, French and Polish youths risked their lives day and night to \nslow the advance of the Nazi forces. They accomplished small victories \nby such simple methods as rearranging traffic signs and filling the gas \ntanks of their enemy's vehicles with sugar. These groups became a part \nof an organized European resistance movement when they finally \nestablished short-wave radio contact with London and received coded \nmessages.\n  The risks of joining the resistance were great. A resistance worker \ncaught by the Nazis faced certain death. The Germans sometimes rounded \nup and executed hundreds of civilians in revenge for an act of \nsabotage. Gus' life was no exception to this backlash to the resistance \nfighters. By 1944 his family was living on meager rations of tulip \nbulbs and two of his fellow resistance fighters and a cousin had been \nexecuted by firing squad.\n  The ferociousness of the fighting and danger that these unsung heroes \nfaced are conveyed by his description of the bombing of Dortmund: \n``This sight I cannot ever forget: burning roofs collapsing, burning \nwindow sills and brick walls crashing down on sidewalks, bricks and \ndebris lying everywhere from roads as well as from houses, blown to \npieces. It is unforgettable . . . to see and feel a city, an entire \ncity, on fire.''\n  Gus moved to Portland, OR in 1977 to be closer to his oldest \ndaughter. He has been a valuable member of the community and a welcome \npiece of living history. I believe it is time that he, along with other \nresistance fighters, be recognized for the sacrifices they selflessly \nmade fighting the oppressive forces of fascism during those dark years.\n  Each allied nation is indebted to patriots such as Gus; without their \ninvaluable efforts the greatest war of the last century might have \nlasted much longer and cost many more thousands of lives. It is with \nhumble respect and praise that I offer my recognition today to Gus and \nthe European resistance fighters.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/10/senate-section/article/S8447-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8447-S8452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE NOMINATION OF PRISCILLA OWEN\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in light of the continuing criticism of \nRepublicans about the Senate Judiciary Committee's vote on the \nnomination of Priscilla Owen to be a judge on the United States Court \nof Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, I am making my statement from \nSeptember 5, 2002, on that vote a part of the Record.\n  I would also like to respond to the misleading suggestion that the \nSenate Judiciary Committee has never defeated a nominee who received a \n``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association. In fact, \nin the prior six and one-half years of Republican control of the Senate \nthe nominations of more than a dozen judicial candidates with unanimous \nwell qualified ratings were defeated in the Committee through the \ndecision of Republicans to block them from receiving hearings and votes \non their nominations. More than three dozen others received partial \nratings of ``well qualified'' and ``qualified.'' More than 50 of \nPresident Clinton's judicial nominees never received Committee votes, \ndespite their ratings. The truth is that Republicans defeated dozens of \njudicial nominees with well-qualified ratings, not in the light of day \nwith a democratic vote, but in the dark of night through secret, \nanonymous holds or other tactics.\n  Here are some of the Clinton nominees with unanimous well qualified \nor partial well qualified ratings who never received a Senate Judiciary \nCommittee vote and whose nominations ended in Committee: Alston \nJohnson, Fifth Circuit, James Duffy, Ninth Circuit, Kathleen McCree-\nLewis, Sixth Circuit, Enrique Moreno, Fifth Circuit, Judge James Lyons, \nTenth Circuit, Allen Snyder, D.C. Circuit, Judge Robert Cindrich, Third \nCircuit, Judge Stephen Orlofsky, Third Circuit, James Beatty, Fourth \nCircuit, Frederic Woocher, Central District of California, Richard \nAnderson, District of Montana, Jeffrey Coleman, Northern District of \nIllinois, John Bingler, Western District of Pennsylvania, Elena Kagan, \nD.C. Circuit, Elizabeth Gibson, Fourth Circuit, Lynette Norton, Western \nDistrict of Pennsylvania, Judge Legrome Davis, Eastern District of \nPennsylvania, Judge Richard Leonard, Eastern District of North \nCarolina, Judge Linda Reigle, District of Nevada, Gary Sebelius, \nDistrict of Kansas, Judge David Cercone, Western District of \nPennsylvania, Patricia Coan, District of Colorado, Stephen Achelpohl, \nDistrict of Nebraska, Judge Jorge Rangel, Fifth Circuit, Ronald Gould, \nNinth Circuit, and Robert Freedburg, Eastern District of Pennsylvania. \nThis is just a partial list.\n  Of course some of President Clinton's judicial nominees who received \nhearings and Committee votes had also received well-qualified ratings, \nbut that did not stop Republicans from voting against them and trying \nto defeat their nominations. For example, some of the same Republicans \nwho now claim it is unprecedented to defeat a nominee with a well-\nqualified rating voted against several Clinton nominees with that same \nrating, either in Committee, on the floor or both. The following \nnominees with well qualified ratings\n\n[[Page S8448]]\n\nwere subject of Republican efforts to defeat their nominations, despite \nthe rating that Republicans now cling to like a impermeable shield \nagainst criticism: Judge Rosemary Barkett, Eleventh Circuit, Judge \nMerrick Garland, D.C. Circuit, Judge William Fletcher, Ninth Circuit, \nJudge Ray Fisher, Ninth Circuit, Judge Marsha Berzon, Ninth Circuit, \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor, Second Circuit, Judge Margaret McKeown, Ninth \nCircuit, Judge Richard Paez, Ninth Circuit, Judge Margaret Morrow, \nCentral District of California, Judge Gerald Lynch, Southern District \nof New York, and Mary McLaughlin, Eastern District of Pennsylvania.\n  Republicans tried mightily to defeat these nominations. In fact, some \nof these nominees were asked about their ABA membership, as if being \nactive in the Nation's largest bar association were somehow \ndisqualifying. Republicans almost defeated some of these nominations. \nFor example, Judge Paez was voted out of committee with barely a \nmajority, and he received 39 Republican votes against his nomination \ndespite his partial well-qualified rating. Judge Fletcher, who had a \nunanimous well-qualified rating, received negative votes in Committee \nfrom some of the same Republicans now complaining about negative votes \non the nomination of Justice Owen, and Judge Fletcher's nomination \nreceived 41 Republican votes against his confirmation.\n  Thus, what Republicans are really complaining about is not that a \nnominee who received a well- qualified rating was defeated, but that \none of their nominees was defeated, regardless of her ABA rating. That \nis understandable. What is not understandable is their effort to \ndistort the facts and the history of defeat of numerous other nominees \nof President Clinton who had the same rating as Justice Owen. Those \nratings were no obstacle back then to Republican efforts to defeat \nthose nominations, either through blocking hearings and votes or \nthrough attempts to defeat nominations in the Committee and on the \nfloor. It was not due to lack of effort on their part that a nominee \nwith a well-qualified rating was not actually voted down on their \nwatch. In fact, dozens were defeated in far less public ways, but their \nnominations failed, nonetheless, and were returned to the President \nwithout confirmation.\n  Additionally, I would like to respond to the notion that the vote \nagainst Justice Owen was somehow ``anti-woman.'' Such a claim, as that \nmade by Attorney General Ashcroft, is absurd. I recall that when John \nAshcroft was in the Senate he voted against the confirmation of at \nleast 11 judicial nominees of President Clinton and almost half of them \nare women who now sit on the federal bench. The Senate Judiciary \nCommittee has been far fairer to this President's judicial nominees, \nincluding the women he has nominated to the federal bench.\n  Since the reorganization of the Senate Judiciary Committee 14 months \nago, 17 women nominated to the Federal bench by President Bush have \nbeen given a hearing and reported out of committee. Sixteen have \nalready been confirmed by the Democratic-led Senate. Four of these \nwomen were nominated to the Circuit Courts and were some of the first \nnominees in years to receive hearings, after the anonymous holds and \nobstruction during the period of Republican control of the Senate. Ten \nof those women nominees with records of fairness as lower federal \ncourts or State court judges have been voted out of the Democratic-led \nSenate Judiciary Committee, including former Minnesota Supreme Court \nJustice Joan Lancaster.\n  Justice Owen's record, in contrast, was not one of fairness and \nadherence to precedent. Instead, time after time, Justice Owen's \nwritten opinions demonstrated her willingness to substitute her policy \npreferences for those of the Texas legislature and her determination to \ndistort precedent. Even her fellow judges criticized her approach. \nThese issues are discussed in more detail in my full Judiciary \nCommittee statement that follows:\n\n  Statement of Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy on \nSeptember 5, 2002 on the nomination of Justice Priscilla Owen to the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit:\n  Today, the Senate Judiciary Committee considered a number of the \nPresident's nominees, including Priscilla Owen to be a judge on the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and Reena Raggi \nto be a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second \nCircuit. These two nominees were the 80th and 81st judicial nominees \nvoted on by the Committee in less than 15 months, and the 16th and 17th \ncircuit court nominees voted on by the committee in that time. This \ncommittee has worked diligently since the change in majority last \nsummer to consider more than 250 of the President's nominees.\n  During our first year in the majority, we have held twice as many \nhearings for President Bush's Courts of Appeals nominees as were held \nin the first year of the Reagan Administration, when the Senate was \ncontrolled by Republicans, and five times as many as in the first year \nof the Clinton Administration, when the Senate was controlled by \nDemocrats. Under Democratic leadership, this committee has also voted \non more judicial nominees, 79 so far, than in any of the six and one-\nhalf years of Republican control that preceded the change in majority. \nWe have already voted on twice as many circuit court nominees, 15, as \nthe Republican majority averaged in the years they were in control. In \nfact, this last year we voted on more judicial nominees than were voted \non in 1999 and 2000 combined and on more circuit court nominees than \nRepublicans voted on in 1996 and 1997 combined.\n  We have achieved what we said we would by treating President Bush's \nnominees more fairly and more expeditiously than President Clinton's \nnominees were treated. By many measures the Committee has achieved \nalmost twice as much this last year as Republicans averaged during \ntheir years in control.\n  In the six and one-half year period of Republican control before the \nchange in majority last summer, vacancies on the Courts of Appeals more \nthan doubled from 16 to 33 and overall vacancies rose from 63 to 110. \nWe have reversed those trends, even though 43 vacancies have arisen \nsince the changeover last year.\n  I have taken a number of actions to seek a cooperative and \nconstructive working relationship with all Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle and with the White House in order to make the confirmation \nprocess more orderly, less antagonistic, and more productive. Not all \nof my efforts have been successful and very few of my suggestions to \nthe Administration have yielded results, but I have continued to make \nthese efforts in the best interests of the country, the Senate and this \ncommittee.\n  I am proud of the work the Committee has done since the change in the \nmajority. I am proud of the way we have considered nominees fairly and \nexpeditiously.\n  The circuit court nominees voted on by the Senate Judiciary Committee \ntoday are two very different examples of the types of nominees sent to \nthe Senate by this President. Judge Reena Raggi was appointed to the \ntrial court in 1987 by President Ronald Reagan. She has a solid record \nof accomplishment in both the private and public sectors. She received \nthe strong bipartisan support of two Democratic Senators, Charles \nSchumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, and of the New York legal \ncommunity. We have every reason to believe that she will serve with \ndistinction on the Second Circuit as a fair and impartial judge. She is \na conservative Republican.\n  In sharp contrast is the record of the other circuit court nominee we \nconsidered today: Justice Priscilla Owen, a nominee whose record is too \nextreme even in the context of the very conservative Texas Supreme \nCourt.\n  Justice Owen has been nominated to fill a vacancy that has existed \nsince January, 1997. In the intervening five years, President Clinton \nnominated Judge Jorge Rangel, a distinguished Hispanic attorney from \nCorpus Christi, to fill that vacancy. Despite his qualifications, and \nhis unanimous rating of Well Qualified by the ABA, Judge Rangel never \nreceived a hearing from the Committee, and his nomination was returned \nto the President without Senate action at the end of 1998, after a \nfruitless wait of 15 months.\n  On September 16, 1999, President Clinton nominated Enrique Moreno, \nanother outstanding Hispanic attorney, to fill that same vacancy. Mr.\n\n[[Page S8449]]\n\nMoreno did not receive a hearing on his nomination either, for more \nthan 17 months. President Bush withdrew the nomination of Enrique \nMoreno to the Fifth Circuit and later sent Justice Owen's name in its \nplace. It was not until May of this year, at a hearing before Senator \nSchumer, that this committee heard from any of President Clinton's \nthree unsuccessful nominees to the 5th Circuit. This May Mr. Moreno and \nMr. Rangel testified along with a number of other Clinton nominees \nabout their treatment by the Republican majority. Thus, Justice Owen is \nthe third nominee to this vacancy and the first to be accorded a \nhearing before the Committee.\n  In fact, when the Committee held its hearing on the nomination of \nJudge Edith Clement to the Fifth Circuit last fall, it was the first \nhearing on a Fifth Circuit nominee in seven years. By contrast, Justice \nOwen is the third nomination to the Fifth Circuit on which this \ncommittee has held a hearing in less than one year. In spite of the \ntreatment by the former Republican majority of so many moderate \njudicial nominees of the previous President, we proceeded this July, as \nI said that we would, with a hearing on Justice Owen.\n  Justice Owen is one among 16 Texas nominees who have been considered \nby this Committee since I became Chairman. So far, five District Court \njudges, four United State Attorneys, three United States Marshals, and \nthree executive branch appointees from Texas have moved swiftly through \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  When Justice Owen was initially nominated, the President changed the \nconfirmation process from that used by Republican and Democratic \nPresidents for more than 50 years. That resulted in her ABA peer review \nnot being received until later in the summer. As a result of a \nRepublican objection to the Democratic leadership's request to retain \nall judicial nominations pending before the Senate through the August \nrecess, the initial nomination of Justice Owen was required by Senate \nrules to be returned to the President without action. The Committee \nnonetheless took the unprecedented action of proceeding during the \nAugust recess to hold two hearings involving judicial nominations, \nincluding a nominee to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n\n  In my efforts to accommodate a number of Republican Senators, \nincluding the Republican Leader, this Committee's ranking member, and \nat least four other Republican members of this Committee, I have \nscheduled hearings for nominees out of the order in which they were \nreceived. This has been a longstanding practice of the Committee.\n  It is also a fact that less controversial nominations are easier to \nconsider and are, by and large, able to be scheduled sooner than more \ncontroversial nominations. This is especially important in the \ncircumstances that existed last summer at the time of the change in \nmajority. At that time we faced what Republicans have now admitted had \nbecome a vacancies crisis. From January 1995 when the Republican \nmajority assumed control of the confirmation process in the Senate \nuntil the shift in majority last summer, vacancies rose from 65 to 110 \nand vacancies on the Courts of Appeals more than doubled from 16 to 33. \nI thought it important to make as much progress as quickly as we could \nin the time available to us last year, and we did. Evaluating the \nrecord of a nominee whose record raises questions as serious as those \nabout Justice Owen simply takes longer.\n  The responsibility to advice and consent on the President's nominees \nis one that I take seriously and that this committee takes seriously. \nJustice Owen's nomination to the Court of Appeals has been given a fair \nhearing and a fair process before this Committee. I thank all Members \nof the Committee for their fairness. Those who have had concerns have \nraised them and have heard the nominee's responses, in private \nmeetings, at her public hearing and in written follow-up questions.\n  I would particularly like to commend Senator Feinstein for her \nevenhandedness in chairing the hearing for Justice Owen. It was a long \nday, in which nearly every Senator who is a member of this Committee \ncame to question Justice Owen, and Senator Feinstein handled it with \npatience and fairness.\n  I am proud that Democrats and most Republicans have kept to the \nmerits of this nomination, and have not chosen to vilify, castigate, \nunfairly characterize and condemn without basis Senators working \nconscientiously to fulfill their constitutional responsibilities. To \nthose who will take this occasion to engage in name-calling or \naccusations of political posturing, I can only express my \ndisappointment.\n  The constitutional responsibility to advise and consent to the \nPresident's life tenure judicial nominees is not an occasion to rubber \nstamp. The nomination of Justice Priscilla Owen presents a number of \nareas of serious concern to me.\n  The first area of concern to me is Justice Owen's extremism even \namong a conservative Supreme Court of Texas. The conservative \nRepublican majority of the Texas Supreme Court has gone out of its way \nto criticize Justice Owen and the dissents she joined in ways that are \nhighly unusual and that highlight her ends-oriented activism. A number \nof Texas Supreme Court Justices have pointed out how far from the \nlanguage of statute she has strayed in her attempts to push the law \nbeyond what the legislature intended.\n  One example is the majority opinion in Weiner v. Wasson, 900 S.W.2d \n316, Tex. 1995. In this case, Justice Owen wrote a dissent advocating a \nruling against a medical malpractice plaintiff injured while he was \nstill a minor. The issue was the constitutionality of a State law \nrequiring minors to file medical malpractice actions before reaching \nthe age of majority, or risk being outside the statute of limitations. \nOf interest is the majority's discussion of the importance of abiding \nby a prior Texas Supreme Court decision unanimously striking down a \nprevious version of the statute. In what reads as a lecture to the \ndissent, then-Justice John Cornyn, the current Texas Attorney General \nand Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate, explains on behalf of the \nmajority:\n\n       Generally, we adhere to our precedents for reasons of \n     efficiency, fairness, and legitimacy. First, if we did not \n     follow our own decisions, no issue could ever be considered \n     resolved. The potential volume of speculative relitigation \n     under such circumstances alone ought to persuade us that \n     stare decisis is a sound policy. Secondly, we should give due \n     consideration to the settled expectations of litigants like \n     Emmanuel Wasson, who have justifiably relied on the \n     principles articulated in [the previous case]. . . . Finally, \n     under our form of government, the legitimacy of the judiciary \n     rests in large part upon a stable and predictable \n     decisionmaking process that differs dramatically from that \n     properly employed by the political branches of government. \n     Id. at 12-13. (Citations omitted.)\n\n  According to the conservative majority on the Texas Supreme Court, \nJustice Owen went out of her way to ignore precedent and would have \nruled for the defendants. The conservative Republican majority followed \nprecedent and the doctrine of stare decisis.\n  In Montgomery Independent School District v. Davis, 34 S.W. 3d 559 \n(Tex. 2000), Justice Owen wrote another dissent which drew fire from a \nconservative Republican majority, this time for her disregard for \nlegislative language. In a challenge by a teacher who did not receive \nreappointment to her position, the majority found that the school board \nhad exceeded its authority when it disregarded the Texas Education Code \nand tried to overrule a hearing examiner's decision on the matter. \nJustice Owen's dissent advocated for an interpretation contrary to the \nlanguage of the applicable statute. The majority, which included \nAlberto Gonzales and two other appointees of then-Governor Bush, was \nquite explicit about its view that Justice Owen's position disregarded \nthe law:\n\n       The dissenting opinion misconceives the hearing examiner's \n     role in the . . . process by stating that the hearing \n     examiner `refused' to make findings on the evidence the Board \n     relies on to support its additional findings. As we explained \n     above, nothing in the statute requires the hearing examiner \n     to make findings on matters of which he is unpersuaded. . . . \n     Id. at 25-26.\n\n  The majority also noted that:\n\n       The dissenting opinion's misconception of the hearing \n     examiner's role stems from its disregard of the procedural \n     elements the Legislature established in subchapter F to \n     ensure that the hearing-examiner process is fair and \n     efficient for both teachers and school boards. The \n     Legislature maintained\n\n[[Page S8450]]\n\n     local control by giving school boards alone the option to \n     choose the hearing-examiner process in nonrenewal \n     proceedings. . . . By resolving conflicts in disputed \n     evidence, ignoring credibility issues, and essentially \n     stepping into the shoes of the factfinder to reach a specific \n     result, the dissenting opinion not only disregards the \n     procedural limitations in the statute but takes a position \n     even more extreme than that argued for by the board. . . .'' \n     Id. at 28.\n\n  Collins v. Ison-Newsome, 73 S.W.3d 178, is yet another case where a \ndissent, joined by Justice Owen, was roundly criticized by the \nRepublican majority of the Texas Supreme Court. The Court cogently \nstated the legal basis for its conclusion that it had no jurisdiction \nto decide the matter before it, and as in other opinions where Justice \nOwen was in dissent, took time to explicitly criticize the dissent's \npositions as contrary to the clear letter of the law.\n  At issue was whether the Supreme Court had the proper ``conflicts \njurisdiction'' to hear the interlocutory appeal of school officials \nbeing sued for defamation. The majority explained that it did not \nbecause published lower court decisions do not create the necessary \nconflict between themselves. The arguments put forth by the dissent, in \nwhich Justice Owen joined, offended the majority, and they made their \nviews known, writing:\n\n       The dissenting opinion agrees that ``because this is an \n     interlocutory appeal . . . this Court's jurisdiction is \n     limited,'' but then argues for the exact opposite proposition \n     . . . This argument defies the Legislature's clear and \n     express limits on our jurisdiction. . . . The author of the \n     dissenting opinion has written previously that we should take \n     a broader approach to the conflicts-jurisdiction standard. \n     But a majority of the Court continues to abide by the \n     Legislature's clear limits on our interlocutory-appeal \n     jurisdiction. Id. at 182.\n\n  They continue:\n\n       [T]he dissenting opinion's reading of Government Code sec. \n     22.225(c) conflates conflicts jurisdiction with dissent \n     jurisdiction, thereby erasing any distinction between these \n     two separate bases for jurisdiction. The Legislature \n     identified them as distinct bases for jurisdiction in \n     sections 22.001(a)(1) and (a)(2), and section 22.225(c) \n     refers specifically to the two separate provisions of section \n     22.001(a) providing for conflicts and dissent jurisdiction. . \n     . . [W]e cannot simply ignore the legislative limits on our \n     jurisdiction, and not even Petitioners argue that we should \n     do so on this basis. Id. at 183.\n\n  Again, Justice Owen joined a dissent that the Republican majority \ndescribed as defiant of legislative intent and in disregard of \nlegislatively drawn limits.\n  Some of the most striking examples of criticism of Justice Owen's \nwritings, or the dissents and concurrences she joins, come in a series \nof parental notification cases heard in 2000. They include:\n\n       In re Jane Doe 1, where the majority included an extremely \n     unusual section explaining its view of the proper role of \n     judges, admonishing the dissent joined by Justice Owen for \n     going beyond its duty to interpret the law in an attempt to \n     fashion policy.\n       Giving a pointed critique of the dissenters, the majority \n     explained that, ``In reaching the decision to grant Jane \n     Doe's application, we have put aside our personal viewpoints \n     and endeavored to do our job as judges--that is, to interpret \n     and apply the Legislature's will as it has been expressed in \n     the statute.'' 19 S.W.3d 346.\n       In a separate concurrence, Justice Alberto Gonzales wrote \n     that to the construe law as the dissent did, ``would be an \n     unconscionable act of judicial activism.''\n       In re Jane Doe 3, Justice Enoch writes specifically to \n     rebuke Justice Owen and her fellow dissenters for \n     misconstruing the legislature's definition of the sort of \n     abuse that may occur when parents are notified of a minor's \n     intent to have an abortion, saying, ``abuse is abuse; it is \n     neither to be trifled with nor its severity to be second \n     guessed.''\n\n  In one case that is perhaps the exception that proves the rule, \nJustice Owen wrote a majority that was bitterly criticized by the \ndissent for its activism. In In re City of Georgetown, 53 S.W. 3d 328, \n(Tex. 2001), Justice Owen wrote a majority opinion finding that the \ncity did not have to give the Austin American-Statesman a report \nprepared by a consulting expert in connection with pending and \nanticipated litigation because such information was expressly made \nconfidential under other law, namely the Texas Rules of Civil \nProcedure.\n  The dissent is extremely critical of Justice Owen's opinion, citing \nthe Texas law's strong preference for disclosure and liberal \nconstruction. Accusing her of activism, Justice Abbott, joined by Chief \nJustice Phillips and Justice Baker, notes that the legislature, \n``expressly identified eighteen categories of information that are \n'public information' and that must be disclosed upon request . . . \n[sec. (a)] The Legislature attempted to safeguard its policy of open \nrecords by adding subsection (b), which limits courts' encroachment on \nits legislatively established policy decisions.'' Id. at 338. The \ndissent further protests:\n\n     [b]ut if this Court has the power to broaden by judicial rule \n     the categories of information that are `confidential under \n     other law,' then subsection (b) is eviscerated from the \n     statute. By determining what information falls outside \n     subsection (a)'s scope, this Court may evade the mandates of \n     subsection (b) and order information withheld whenever it \n     sees fit. This not only contradicts the spirit and language \n     of subsection (b), it guts it. Id.\n\n  Finally, the opinion concluded by asserting that Justice Owen's \ninterpretation, ``abandons strict construction and rewrites the statute \nto eliminate subsection (b)'s restrictions.'' Id. at 343.\n  These examples, together with the unusually harsh language directed \nat Justice Owen's position by the majority in the Doe cases, show a \njudge out of step with the conservative Republican majority of the \nTexas Supreme Court, a majority not afraid to explain the danger of her \nactivist views.\n  Ends-Oriented Judicial Activism Showing Bias Against Consumers, \nVictims, Individuals.--I am also greatly concerned about Justice Owen's \nrecord of ends-oriented decision making as a Justice on the Texas \nSupreme Court. As one reads case after case, particularly those in \nwhich she was the sole dissenter or dissented with the extreme right \nwing of the Court, her pattern of activism becomes clear. Her legal \nviews in so many cases involving statutory interpretation simply cannot \nbe reconciled with the plain meaning of the statute, the legislative \nintent, or the majority's interpretation, leading to the conclusion \nthat she sets out to justify some pre-conceived idea of what the law \nought to mean. This is not an appropriate way for a judge to make \ndecisions. This is a judge whose record reflects that she is willing \nand sometimes eager to make law from the bench.\n  Justice Owen's activism and extremism is noteworthy in a variety of \ncases, including those dealing with business interests, malpractice, \naccess to public information, employment discrimination and Texas \nSupreme Court jurisdiction, in which she writes against individual \nplaintiffs time and time again, in seeming contradiction of the law as \nwritten.\n  One of the cases where this trend is evident is FM Properties v. City \nof Austin, 22 S.W. 3d 868 (Tex. 1998). I asked Justice Owen about this \n1998 environmental case at her hearing. In her dissent from a 6-3 \nruling, in which Justice Alberto Gonzales was among the majority, \nJustice Owen showed her willingness to rule in favor of large private \nlandowners against the clear public interest in maintaining a fair \nregulatory process and clean water. Her dissent, which the majority \ncharacterized as, ``nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric,'' was an \nattempt to favor big landowners.\n  In this case, the Texas Supreme Court found that a section of the \nTexas Water Code allowing certain private owners of large tracts of \nland to create ``water quality zones,'' and write their own water \nquality regulations and plans, violated the Texas Constitution because \nit improperly delegated legislative power to private entities. The \nCourt found that the Water Code section gave the private landowners, \n``legislative duties and powers, the exercise of which may adversely \naffect public interests, including the constitutionally-protected \npublic interest in water quality.'' Id. at 876-77. The Court also found \nthat certain aspects of the Code and the factors surrounding its \nimplementation weighed against the delegation of power, including the \nlack of meaningful government review, the lack of adequate \nrepresentation of citizens affected by the private owners' actions, the \nbreadth of the delegation, and the big landowners' obvious interest in \nmaximizing their own profits and minimizing their own costs.\n  The majority offered a strong opinion, detailing its legal reasoning \nand explaining the dangers of offering too much legislative power to \nprivate entities. By contrast, in her dissent, Justice Owen argued \nthat, ``[w]hile the Constitution certainly permits the\n\n[[Page S8451]]\n\nLegislature to enact laws that preserve and conserve the State's \nnatural resources, there is nothing in the Constitution that requires \nthe Legislature to exercise that power in any particular manner,'' \nignoring entirely the possibility of an unconstitutional delegation of \npower. Id. at 889. Her view strongly favored large business interests \nto the clear detriment of the public interest, and against the \npersuasive legal arguments of a majority of the Court.\n  When I asked her about this case at her hearing, I found her answer \nperplexing. In a way that she did not argue in her written dissent, at \nher hearing Justice Owen attempted to cast the FM Properties case not \nas, ``a fight between and City of Austin and big business, but in all \nhonesty, . . . really a fight about . . . the State of Texas versus the \nCity of Austin.'' Transcript at 69. In the written dissent however, she \nbegan by stating the, ``importance of this case to private property \nrights and the separation of powers between the judicial and \nlegislative branches . . .'', and went on to decry the Court's decision \nas one that, ``will impair all manner of property rights.'' 22 S.W. 3d \nat 889. At the time she wrote her dissent, Justice Owen was certainly \nclear about the meaning of this case--property rights for corporations.\n  Another case that concerned me is the case of GTE Southwest, Inc. v. \nBruce, 990 S.W.2d 605, where Justice Owen wrote in favor of GTE in a \nlawsuit by employees for intentional infliction of emotional distress. \nThe rest of the Court held that three employees subjected to what the \nmajority characterized as ``constant humiliating and abusive behavior \nof their supervisor'' were entitled to the jury verdict in their favor. \nDespite the Court's recitation of an exhaustive list of sickening \nbehavior by the supervisor, and its clear application of Texas law to \nthose facts, Justice Owen wrote a concurring opinion to explain her \ndifference of opinion on the key legal issue in the case--whether the \nbehavior in evidence met the legal standard for intentional infliction \nof emotional distress.\n  Justice Owen contended that the conduct was not, as the standard \nrequires, ``so outrageous in character, and so extreme in degree, as to \ngo beyond all possible bounds of decency . . .'' Id. at 621. The \nmajority opinion shows Justice Owen's concurrence advocating an \ninexplicable point of view that ignores the facts in evidence in order \nto reach a predetermined outcome in the corporation's favor.\n  At her hearing, in answer to Senator Edwards' questions about this \ncase, Justice Owen again gave an explanation not to be found in her \nwritten views. She told him that she agreed with the majority's \nholding, and wrote separately only to make sure that future litigants \nwould not be confused and think that out of context, any one of the \noutrages suffered by the plaintiffs would not support a judgment. \nLooking again at her dissent, I do not see why, if that was what she \ntruly intended, she did not say so in language plain enough to be \nunderstood, or why she thought it necessary to write and say it in the \nfirst place. It is a somewhat curious distinction to make--to advocate \nthat in a tort case a judge should write a separate concurrence to \nexplain which part of the plaintiff's case, standing alone, would not \nsupport a finding of liability. Neither her written concurrence, nor \nher answers in explanation after the fact, is satisfactory explanation \nof her position in this case.\n\n  In City of Garland v. Dallas Morning News, 22 S.W. 3d 351 (Tex. \n2000), Justice Owen dissented from a majority opinion and, again, it is \ndifficult to justify her views other than as based on a desire to reach \na particular outcome. The majority upheld a decision giving the \nnewspaper access to a document outlining the reasons why the city's \nfinance director was going to be fired. Justice Owen made two \narguments: that because the document was considered a draft it was not \nsubject to disclosure, and that the document was exempt from disclosure \nbecause it was part of policy making. Both of these exceptions were so \nlarge as to swallow the rule requiring disclosure. The majority rightly \npoints out that if Justice Owen's views prevailed, almost any document \ncould be labeled draft to shield it from public view. Moreover, to call \na personnel decision a part of policy making is such an expansive \ninterpretation it would leave little that would not be ``policy''.\n  Quantum Chemical v. Toennies, 47 S.W. 3d 473 (Tex. 2001), is another \ntroubling case where Justice Owen joined a dissent advocating an \nactivist interpretation of a clearly written statute. In this age \ndiscrimination suit brought under the Texas civil rights statute, the \nrelevant parts of which were modeled on Title VII of the federal Civil \nRights Act (and its amendments), the appeal to the Texas Supreme Court \ncentered on the standard of causation necessary for a finding for the \nplaintiff. The plaintiff argued, and the five justices in the majority \nagreed, that the plain meaning of the statute must be followed, and \nthat the plaintiff could prove an unlawful employment practice by \nshowing that discrimination was ``a motivating factor.'' The employer \ncorporation argued, and Justices Hecht and Owen agreed, that the plain \nmeaning could be discarded in favor of a more tortured and unnecessary \nreading of the statute, and that the plaintiff must show that \ndiscrimination was ``the motivating factor,'' in order to recover \ndamages.\n  The portion of Title VII on which the majority relies for its \ninterpretation was part of Congress's 1991 fix to the United States \nSupreme Court's opinion in the Price Waterhouse case, which held that \nan employer could avoid liability if the plaintiff could not show \ndiscrimination was ``the'' motivating factor. Congress's fix, in \nSection 107 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, does not specify whether \nthe motivating factor standard applies to both sorts of discrimination \ncases, the so-called ``mixed motive'' cases as well as the ``pretext'' \ncases.\n  The Texas majority concluded that they must rely on the plain \nlanguage of the statute as amended, which could not be any clearer that \nunder Title VII discrimination can be shown to be ``a'' motivating \nfactor. Justice Owen joined Justice Hecht in claiming that federal case \nlaw is clear (in favor of their view), and opted for a reading of the \nstatute that would turn it into its polar opposite, forcing plaintiffs \ninto just the situation legislators were trying to avoid. This example \nof Justice Owen's desire to change the law from the bench, instead of \ninterpret it, fits President Bush's definition of activism to a ``T''.\n  Justice Owen has also demonstrated her tendency toward ends-oriented \ndecision making quite clearly in a series of dissents and concurrences \nin cases involving a Texas law providing for a judicial bypass of \nparental notification requirements for minors seeking abortions.\n  The most striking example is Justice Owen's expression of \ndisagreement with the majority's decision on key legal issues in Doe 1. \nShe strongly disagreed with the majority's holding on what a minor \nwould have to show in order to establish that she was, as the statute \nrequires, ``sufficiently well informed'' to make the decision on her \nown. While the conservative Republican majority laid out a well-\nreasoned test for this element of the law, based on the plain meaning \nof the statute and well-cited case law, Justice Owen inserted elements \nfound in neither authority. Specifically, Justice Owen insisted that \nthe majority's requirement that the minor be ``aware of the emotional \nand psychological aspects of undergoing an abortion'' was not \nsufficient and that among other requirements with no basis in the law, \nshe, ``would require . . . [that the minor] should . . . indicate to \nthe court that she is aware of and has considered that there are \nphilosophic, social, moral, and religious arguments that can be brought \nto bear when considering abortion.'' In re Doe 1, 19 S.W. 3d 249, 256 \n(Tex. 2000)\n  In her written concurrence, Justice Owen indicated, through legal \ncitation, that support for this proposition could be found in a \nparticular page of the Supreme Court's opinion in Planned Parenthood v. \nCasey. However, when one looks at that portion of the Casey decision, \none finds no mention of requiring a minor to acknowledge religious or \nmoral arguments. The passage talks instead about the ability of a State \nto, ``enact rules and regulations designed to encourage her to know \nthat there are philosophic and social arguments of great weight that \ncan be brought to bear,'' Casey at 872. Justice Owen's reliance on this \nportion of a United\n\n[[Page S8452]]\n\nStates Supreme Court opinion to rewrite Texas law was simply wrong.\n  As she did in answer to questions about a couple of other cases at \nher hearing, Justice Owen tried to explain away this problem with an \nafter the fact justification. She told Senator Cantwell that the \nreference to religion was not to be found in Casey after all, but in \nanother U.S. Supreme Court case, H.L. v. Matheson. She explained that \nin, ``Matheson they talk about that for some people it raises profound \nmoral and religious concerns, and they're talking about the \ndesirability or the State's interest in these kinds of considerations \nin making an informed decision.'' Transcript at 172. But again, on \nreading Matheson, one sees that the only mention of religion comes in a \nquotation meant to explain why the parents of the minor are due \nnotification, not about the contours of what the government may require \nsomeone to prove to show she was fully well informed. Her reliance on \nMatheson for her proposed rewrite of the law is just as faulty as her \nreliance on Casey. Neither one supports her reading of the law. She \nsimply tries a little bit of legal smoke and mirrors to make it appear \nas if they did. This is the sort of ends-oriented decision making that \ndestroys the belief of a citizen in a fair legal system. And most \ntroubling of all was her indicating to Senator Feinstein that she still \nviews her dissents in the Doe cases as the proper reading and \nconstruction of the Texas statute.\n  Last May, President Bush said that his standard for judging judicial \nnominees would be that they ``share a commitment to follow and apply \nthe law, not to make law from the bench.'' Priscilla Owen's record, as \nI have described it today, does not qualify her under that standard for \na lifetime appointment to the Federal bench.\n  The President has often spoken of judicial activism without \nacknowledging that ends-oriented decision making can come easily to \nideological conservative nominees. In the case of Priscilla Owen, we \nsee a perfect example of such an approach to the law, and I cannot \nsupport it.\n  As I said earlier, when the President sends us a nominee who raises \nconcerns over qualifications or integrity or who has a misunderstanding \nof the appropriate role of a federal judge, I will make my concerns \nknown. This is one of those times. In his selection of Priscilla Owen \nfor the Fifth Circuit, the President and his advisors are trying to do \nto the Fifth Circuit what they did to the Texas Supreme Court. Plucked \nfrom a law firm by political consultant Karl Rove, Justice Owen ran as \na conservative, pro-business candidate for the Texas Supreme Court, and \nshe received ample support from the business community. She fulfilled \nher promise, becoming the most conservative judge on a conservative \ncourt, standing out for her ends-oriented, extremist decision making. \nNow, on a bigger stage, the President and Mr. Rove want a repeat \nperformance: sending Justice Owen to a court one step below the Supreme \nCourt of the United States, attempting to skew its decisions out of \nstep with the mainstream.\n  Before and after he took office, President Bush said he wanted to be \na uniter and not a divider, yet he has sent the Senate several nominees \nwho divide the Senate and the American people. Over the last 14 months, \nthe Judiciary Committee has exceeded the pace of recent years in \napproving more than six dozen of the President's judicial nominees--\nmost of them, conservative Republicans. The Senate by now has confirmed \n73 of them. This committee and the Senate have made the judgment that \nthose nominees will fulfill their duties to act fairly and impartially. \nI urge the President to choose nominees who fit that profile, not the \nprofile of Justice Owen.\n  The oath taken by Federal judges affirms their commitment to \n``administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to \nthe poor and to the rich.'' No one who enters a federal courtroom \nshould have to wonder whether he or she will be fairly heard by the \njudge. Justice Priscilla Owen's record shows me that she has not \nfulfilled that commitment on the Supreme Court of Texas, and I cannot \nvote to confirm her for this appointment to one of the highest courts \nin the land.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/10/senate-section/article/S8452-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            IMPROVING THE GENETIC NEWBORN SCREENING PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. DEWINE. Mr. President, on August 1, along with my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Dodd, introduced a bill designed to improve the \nNation's current genetic newborn screening program. Our legislation \nwould provide education grants for physicians and parents, as well as \ngrants to States to improve follow-up and tracking of those children \nwho receive a heelstick screening and receive a positive result for \nmetabolic, genetic, infectious, and other congenital conditions that \nthreaten their health and life.\n  Each year, newborn screening identifies an estimated 3,000 babies \nwith conditions that would otherwise have had dire consequences. But \ndespite their clear importance, our newborn screening systems are \nfragmented. Quite simply, all children do not have access to the same \ngenetic tests. Where a child is born and what tests are offered in that \nState is what determines the tests a newborn receives. In my home State \nof Ohio, we test for 12 disorders, while right across the border in \nKentucky, they test for only four disorders and in Pennsylvania, they \ntest for five. In Massachusetts, however, newborns are tested for 29 \ndisorders.\n  Furthermore, parents often are not sufficiently informed of the \nnumber of tests available in their state and what those tests can help \naccomplish. Physicians may not know to educate parents, or physicians \nmay talk to parents too late in the birthing process for it to make a \ndifference. Also, State health departments may not follow-up adequately \nwith the parents of a child who receives a positive test result, and \nhealth departments may not have the capacity to effectively record or \ntrack a large number of positive results.\n  The bill we are introducing today would go a long way toward \nstreamlining the current newborn screening system by offering states \ngrants to accomplish the following: build and expand existing \nprocedures and systems to report test results to individuals and \nfamilies, and primary care physicians and subspecialties; coordinate \nongoing follow-up treatment with individuals, families, and primary \ncare physicians after a newborn receives an indication of the presence \nof a disorder on a screening test; ensure seamless integration of \nconfirmatory testing, tertiary care, genetic services, including \ncounseling, and access to developing therapies by participation in \napproved clinical trials involving the primary health care of the \ninfant; and analyze collected data to identify populations at high \nrisk, examine and respond to health concerns, recognize and address \nrelevant environmental, behavioral, socioeconomic, demographic, and \nother factors.\n  This bill is a good start toward ensuring that all newborns receive \nequal access to genetic tests and that their follow-up care, if needed, \nis available and coordinated. The importance of these screenings cannot \nbe overstated. It can mean the difference between life and death for a \nnewborn. And that, is something we must address.\n  I ask my colleagues for their support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/10/senate-section/article/S8452-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8452-S8453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        FIESTA 2002 CELEBRATION\n\n Mr. LUGAR.

Mr. President, I would like to take the \nopportunity to congratulate Norma Eudora Cronk Dickson. On October \n16th, 2002 she will celebrate her 100th birthday. Norma is a resident \nof Chinook, MT.\n  Norma Dickson was born October 16, 1902. She was the eldest of four \nchildren born to John Colburn Cronk and Anna Rogers Cronk. John and \nAnna Cronk moved to Montana in 1898, and settled in the Milk River \nValley in Coburg, MT. Her parents were ranchers and prominent members \nof the community. Her father John was elected state representative in \nMontana in 1923. Her parents raised cattle and prize winning Percheron \nhorses. The livestock pavilion at the Blaine County Fairgrounds was \ndedicated to her father's memory.\n  Norma attended college and taught for a few years prior to her \nmarriage in 1928 to Dr. Joseph Robert Dickson, another Montana native \nwho practiced dentistry in Chinook, Montana.\n  Norma and Dr. Dickson had four children; Joseph Robert Dickson Jr., \nMarilyn Dickson Gregg, James Cronk Dickson, and George William Hunt \nDickson. They also have thirteen grandchildren and ten great-\ngrandchildren.\n  In addition to Norma's dedication to her family, she has been very \nactive in her community of Chinook, MT. Her involvements include the \nEastern Star, Chinook Presbyterian Church, and High School Girl's \nState. She has also worked at the Chinook Senior Center as a volunteer \nfrom its inception until she was 97 years old. Finally, she was named \nSenior of the Year in Chinook. She is a treasure to her community, her \nState, and of course, to her family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/10/senate-section/article/S8453-2", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATIONS TO D.C. MURPHY\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to congratulate D.C. Murphy of Nampa, ID on his recent \nachievement of driving two million miles without a preventable \naccident. Put into perspective, that is equivalent to driving around \nthe world eighty times, or driving 275 miles every day for the last \ntwenty years. As I am sure you can imagine, this is an incredible feat. \nOver the twenty years he has been employed by Yellow Transportation, \nthe roads have become increasingly crowded. To travel as many miles as \nhe has without an avoidable accident is an achievement of which he \nshould be very proud.\n  Over the last twenty years there has been a 39 percent increase in \nthe number of registered large trucks, and at the same time also a 90 \npercent increase in the number of miles these trucks traveled. It is a \ncredit to the trucking industry, D.C. Murphy, and other truckers with \nsimilar responsible driving habits that even though there are more \ntrucks than ever before on the road, the number of accidents has \ncontinued to decrease.\n  Again, let me commend D.C. Murphy on this accomplishment. I would \nlike to wish him continued safety for as long as he is on the \nroad.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/10/senate-section/article/S8453-3", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          IN MEMORY OF SAM SIMMONS, SHERIFF OF GREENVILLE, SC\n\n Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I received sad news from my home \nState last week. Sam Simmons, the sheriff of Greenville, SC, was \ntragically taken from us. Sheriff Simmons was a tremendous public \nservant and long-time friend to law enforcement. He began his law \nenforcement career at the age of 20 and served his community and state \nfor nearly 29 years in this field.\n  During his career, this tenacious, yet soft-spoken man worked his way \nup through the ranks in the Greenville County Sheriff's Office from \ndispatcher to the top law enforcement officer for Greenville County. I \nhad the opportunity to work with Sheriff Simmons and his staff over the \nyears and knew him to be an extraordinary example of how law \nenforcement officials should conduct both themselves and their \ndepartments.\n  Last week, several police officers in Sheriff Simmons' department \ncalled him a ``lawman's lawman.'' I echo these sentiments and offer my \nheartfelt condolences to his wife, Mona, and their family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/10/senate-section/article/S8453-4", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/10/senate-section/article/S8453-5", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/10/senate-section/article/S8453-6", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8453]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:46 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of it reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4797.

A bill to enhance national efforts to investigate, \nprosecute, and prevent crimes against children by increasing \ninvestigatory tools, criminal penalties, and resources and by extending \nexisting laws; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this summer we were all devastated by the \nrepeated news flashes reporting violent crimes against children across \nour Nation. In June, Elizabeth Smart, a 14 year old from my home town \nof Salt Lake City, UT, was kidnapped at gun point from her home. To \ndate, neither Elizabeth nor her abductor has been found.\n  In July, five-year-old Samantha Runnion was kidnapped while playing \nwith a neighborhood friend down the street from her home in Stanton, \nCA. The following day, her body was found along a highway, nearly 50 \nmiles from her home. California authorities have charged a man, who \nreportedly was acquitted just 2 years ago of molesting two girls under \nthe age of 14, with Runnion's abduction, sexual assault and murder.\n  Elizabeth Smart and Samantha Runnion are just two, among many, recent \nchild victims. The list of tragic cases goes on and on.\n  These horrific incidents illustrate the need for comprehensive \nlegislation, at both the State and national level, to protect our \nchildren. We need to ensure that our law enforcement officers have all \nthe tools and resources they need to find, prosecute, and punish those \nwho commit crimes against our children.\n  Earlier this year, with Senators Leahy, Sessions, Hutchinson, \nBrownback, Edwards and DeWine, I introduced S. 2520, the ``PROTECT Act \nof 2002''. This bill plugged a loophole that existed as a result of a \nrecent Supreme Court decision which struck down key provisions in the \n``Child Pornography Prevention Act,'' which I authored and Congress \npassed in 1996. Among other things, the PROTECT Act prevents child \npornographers from escaping prosecution by claiming that their sexually \nexplicit material did not involve real children. Where child \npornography includes persons who appear virtually indistinguishable \nfrom actual minors, prosecutions can still occur unless a defendant \nshows that the pornography did not involve a minor.\n  Today I rise to introduce with my colleagues, Senators Feinstein, \nHutchinson, Hutchison, Sessions, DeWine, Thurmond and Grassley, the \n``Comprehensive Child Protection Act of 2002,'' which enhances child \ncrime prosecutions, investigatory tools, penalties and resources in a \nvariety of ways. For the record, I will submit a section by section \nsummary of the bill, but allow me to comment briefly on some of the \nbill's specific provisions.\n  First, and most significantly, the bill creates a National Crimes \nAgainst Children Response Center. The recent series of tragic events \ninvolving child victims has convinced me that we need to take a more \nproactive approach to prevent, deter and prosecute child predators \nof all types, abusers, molesters, pornographers and traffickers. And at \nthe same time, we need to provide our children, the vulnerable victims \nof such predators, with the support systems they need to recover fully \nfrom such horrendous crimes and to assist law enforcement in \neffectively investigating and prosecuting these crimes.\n\n  To this end, our bill directs the Federal Bureau of Investigation to \nestablish a National Response Center whose primary mission will be to \ndevelop a comprehensive and rapid response plan to reported crimes \ninvolving the victimization of children. While the Center is to be \nestablished by the FBI in consultation with the Deputy Assistant \nAttorney General for the new Department of Justice Crimes Against \nChildren Section created by the bill, it will integrate the resources \nand expertise of other Federal, State, and local law enforcement \nagencies, as well as other child services professionals. By forming and \ntraining rapid response teams comprised of Federal, State and local \nprosecutors, investigators, victim witness specialists, mental health \nand other child services professionals, the Center will greatly enhance \nour national response and prevention efforts. The combination of \nvaluable expertise and resources provided by such multi-jurisdictional \nand multi-disciplinary partnerships will increase the likelihood that \nlaw enforcement authorities will successfully identify, prosecute and \npunish child predators, and that child services professionals will \nprovide child victims with much needed support.\n  Second, this legislation tasks the new Crimes Against Children \nSection with creating an Internet site that will consolidate sex \noffender information which States currently release under the Federal \nreporting act. The bill also directs States that have not developed \nInternet sites to do so. The creation of a national Internet site will \nenable concerned citizens to find in one, easily accessible place, \ncritical information about sexual predators.\n  Currently, all 50 States have statutes that require sex offenders to \nregister and share information with the United States Attorney General \nthrough the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and over 30 States make \noffender information available to the public on the Internet. A \nnational Internet site will enhance the public's ability to find and \naccess information that is already available in the public record, and \nwill protect citizens in states where sex offenders travel or move, \noften to avoid detection. In short, the national Internet site will \nprovide parents and other concerned citizens with essential information \nabout the whereabouts and backgrounds of child abusers, so they can \ntake all necessary steps to protect our Nation's children.\n  Third, the bill enhances the ability of federal prosecutors to bring \nand successfully prosecute cases involving children predators in \nseveral ways:\n  The legislation extends the statute of limitations period that \napplies to offenses involving the sexual or physical abuse of children \nby permitting such cases to be brought up until the date the minor \nreaches age 35, as opposed to age 25 as the law currently provides. I \nbelieve that there should rarely, if ever, be a time when we say to a \nvictim who has suffered as a child at the hands of an abuser: you have \nidentified your abuser; you have proven the crime; yet the abuser will \nremain free because you, the victim, waited too long to come forward. \nOur criminal justice system should be ready to adjudicate all \nmeritorious claims of child abuse. Abusers should not benefit from the \nlasting psychological harms they inflict on innocent children. This \nprovision is meant to recognize that the arm of the law should be long \nin the prosecution of crimes of this heinous nature.\n\n  The bill also amends an existing Federal evidentiary rule, Federal \nRule of Evidence 414, to permit the admission into evidence of prior \noffenses involving child molestation or the possession of sexually \nexplicit materials containing minors. The current evidentiary rule \npermits such evidence to be admitted only where the victim is under 14 \nyears of age. This amendment extends the rule to apply to any victim \nwho is under 18 years of age at the time of the offense. This amendment \nalso makes clear that even where an individual possesses what may be \nvirtual, as opposed to actual, child pornography, such evidence is \nadmissible under Rule 414.\n  This legislation limits the scope of the common law marital \nprivileges by making them inapplicable in a criminal case in which a \nspouse stands accused of abusing a child in the home. Where a spouse is \ncharged with abusing a child of either spouse, or a child under the \ncustody or control of either spouse, neither the abuser nor his or her \nspouse should be permitted to invoke a marital privilege to avoid \nproviding critical evidence in a criminal proceeding.\n  Fourth, the bill enhances tools that are used to investigate child \ncrimes. It expands the class of offenses that are included in the \nCombined DNA Index System, CODIS, by adding to the system all federal \nfelony offenses and\n\n[[Page S8459]]\n\nother designated federal and state sexual offenses that subject Federal \noffenders to sex registration requirements. This extension will \nincrease law enforcement's ability to solve crimes where DNA evidence \nis found.\n  The bill also extends the Federal wiretap statute by adding \nadditional sex exploitation offenses, as well as sex trafficking and \nother interstate sex offenses, to the statute's list of predicate \noffenses. As we all know, the Internet is becoming an increasingly \npopular means by which sexual predators make contact with child \nvictims. Predators frequently initiate relationships with children \nonline, but later seek to make personal contact with the child, either \nover the telephone or through face to face meetings. But as the law \nexists today, law enforcement authorities are restricted in their \nability to investigate such predators. This amendment will not only aid \ninvestigators in obtaining evidence of such crimes, it will also help \nstop these crimes before a sexual predator makes contact with a child. \nTo obtain a wiretap, law enforcement authorities will still need to \nmeet the strict statutory guidelines of the wiretap statute and obtain \nauthorization from a court. Thus, the legislation will not undermine \nthe legitimate expectations of privacy of law-abiding Americans.\n  Fifth, this legislation will strengthen criminal penalties by \nextending the supervised release period that applies to child and sex \noffenders, increasing the maximum penalties that apply to offenses \ninvolving transportation for illegal sexual activity, and directing the \nUnited States Sentencing Commission to consider enhancing the \nsentencing guidelines that apply to criminal offenses with which child \npredators are frequently charged.\n  In particular, the bill grants Federal judges the discretion to \nimpose up to lifetime periods of supervised release for individuals who \nare convicted of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation, transportation for \nillegal sexual activity, and sex trafficking offenses. Under current \nlaw, a judge can impose no more than 5 years of supervised release for \na serious felony, and no more than 3 years for a lesser categorized \noffense. This amendment does not require the judge to impose a period \nof supervised release longer than 5 years; it simply authorizes a judge \nto do so where the nature and circumstances of the case justify a \nlonger supervised release period.\n  In my view, if there is any class of offenders on which our criminal \njustice system should keep a close eye, it is sexual predators. It is \nwell documented that sex offenders are more likely than other violent \ncriminals to commit future crimes. And if there is any class of victims \nwe should seek to protect from repeat offenders, it is those who have \nbeen sexually assaulted. They suffer tremendous physical, emotional and \npsychological injuries. By ensuring that egregious sexual offenders are \nsupervised for longer periods of time, we will increase the chance that \nthey will be deterred from and punished for future criminal acts.\n  In addition to increasing the maximum penalties that apply to certain \noffenses that involve the trafficking of children or other interstate \nelements, the bill directs the United States Sentencing commission to \nreview the sentencing guidelines that apply to various federal offenses \nthat are used to prosecute kidnappers, sexual abusers and exploiters to \nensure that the sentences for these crimes are sufficiently severe \nwhere aggravating circumstances exist, such as where the victim was \nabducted, injured, killed, or abused by more than one person.\n  The ``Comprehensive Child Protection Act of 2002'' will enhance our \nability to combat crimes against children, but it is by no means an \nend. Congress needs to continue to explore additional ways in which we \ncan improve our ability on a national level to protect our children. \nOur children fall victim to many of the same crimes we face as adults, \nand they are also subject crimes that are specific to childhood, like \nchild abuse and neglect. The effects of such heinous crimes are \ndevastating and often lead to an intergenerational cycle of violence \nand abuse.\n  I want to do all I can to ensure that we devote the same intensity of \npurpose to crimes committed against children, as we do to other serious \ncriminal offenses, such as those involving terrorism. We have no \ngreater resource than our children. I invite the Department of Justice, \nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation and other entities and \nprofessionals who are charged with protecting our children to work with \nme to improve our federal laws and to assist States in doing the same.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section-by-\nsection summary analysis of S. 2917 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2917\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

MARITAL COMMUNICATION AND ADVERSE SPOUSAL PRIVILEGE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 119 of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after section 1826 the \n     following:\n\n     ``Sec. 1826A.

AUTHORIZATION OF INTERCEPTION OF COMMUNICATIONS IN \n                   THE INVESTIGATION OF SEXUAL CRIMES AND OTHER \n                   CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN.\n\n       Section 2516(1)(c) of title 18, United States Code, is \n     amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``section 1591 (sex trafficking of \n     children or by force, fraud, or coercion)'' after ``section \n     1511 (obstruction of State or local law enforcement),''; and\n       (2) by inserting ``section 2251A (selling or buying of \n     children), section 2252A (relating to material constituting \n     or containing child pornography), section 2260 (production of \n     sexually explicit depictions of a minor for importation into \n     the United States), sections 2421, 2422, 2423, and 2425 \n     (relating to transportation for illegal sexual activity and \n     related crimes),'' after ``sections 2251 and 2252 (sexual \n     exploitation of children),''.\n\n     SEC. 9. INCREASE OF MAXIMUM SUPERVISED RELEASE TERM FOR SEX \n                   OFFENDERS.\n\n       Section 3583 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     adding at the end the following:\n       ``(k) Supervised Release Terms for Sex Offenders.--\n     Notwithstanding subsection (b), the authorized term of \n     supervised release for any offense under chapter 109A, 110, \n     117, section 1201 involving a minor victim, or section 1591 \n     is any term of years or life.''.\n\n     SEC. 10.

DEPUTY ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR CRIMES AGAINST \n                   CHILDREN.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Position.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 31 of title 28, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after section 507 the \n     following:\n\n     ``Sec. 507A. Deputy Assistant Attorney General for Crimes \n       Against Children\n\n       ``(a) The Attorney General shall appoint a Deputy Assistant \n     Attorney General for Crimes Against Children.\n       ``(b) The Deputy Assistant Attorney General shall be the \n     head of the Crimes Against Children Section (CACS) of the \n     Department of Justice.\n       ``(c) The duties of the Deputy Assistant Attorney General \n     shall include the following:\n       ``(1) To prosecute cases involving crimes against children.\n       ``(2) To advise Federal prosecutors and law enforcement \n     personnel regarding crimes against children.\n       ``(3) To provide guidance and assistance to Federal, State, \n     and local law enforcement agencies and personnel, and \n     appropriate foreign entities, regarding responses to crimes \n     against children.\n       ``(4) To propose and comment upon legislation concerning \n     crimes against children.\n       ``(5) Such other duties as the Attorney General may \n     require, including duties carried out by the head of the \n     Child Exploitation and Obscenity Section and the Terrorism \n     and Violent Crime Section of the Department of Justice.''.\n       (2) Technical and conforming amendment.--The table of \n     sections for chapter 31 of title 28, United States Code, is \n     amended by inserting after the item relating to section 507 \n     the following:\n\n``507A.

DIRECTIVE TO SENTENCING COMMISSION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Pursuant to its authority under section \n     994(p) of title 18, United States Code, and in accordance \n     with this section, the United States Sentencing Commission \n     shall review the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and policy \n     statements relating to child abuse and exploitation offenses, \n     including United States Sentencing Guideline sections 2A3.1, \n     2A3.2, 2A3.3, 2A3.4, 2A4.1, 2G1.1, 2G2.1, 2G2.2, 2G2.3, \n     2G2.4, and 2G3.1 to determine whether those sections are \n     sufficiently severe.\n       (b) Considerations.--In reviewing the Federal Sentencing \n     Guidelines in accordance with subsection (a), the United \n     States Sentencing Commission shall consider whether the \n     guidelines are adequate where--\n       (1) the victim had not attained the age of 12 years, or had \n     not attained the age of 16 years;\n       (2) the victim died, or sustained permanent, life-\n     threatening or serious injury as a result of the criminal \n     act;\n       (3) the victim was abducted;\n       (4) the victim was abused by more than 1 participant;\n       (5) the offense involved more than 1 victim;\n       (6) the ability of the victim to appraise or control his or \n     her conduct was substantially impaired;\n       (7) the offense involved a large number of visual \n     depictions, including multiple images of the same victim; and\n       (8) the offense involved material that portrays sadistic or \n     masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             ``Comprehensive Child Protection Act of 2002''\n\n       Section 1. Title--The Comprehensive Child Protection Act of \n     2002.\n       Section 2. Creates a National Crimes Against Children \n     Response Center--The bill directs the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation to establish a National Crimes Against Children \n     Response Center whose primary mission will be to develop a \n     comprehensive and rapid response plan to reported crimes \n     involving the victimization of children. While the National \n     Response Center is to be established by the FBI, in \n     consultation with the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for \n     the Crimes Against Children Office, it will integrate the \n     resources and expertise of other Federal, State and local law \n     enforcement agencies, as well as other child services \n     professionals. By creating and training rapid response teams \n     comprised of Federal, State and local prosecutors, \n     investigators, victim witness specialists, mental health and \n     other child services professionals, the Center will greatly \n     enhance our national efforts to protect our children from \n     child predators.\n       Section 3. Creates a National Internet Site for Sexual \n     Offender Information--The legislation directs the new \n     Department of Justice Crimes Against Children Office to \n     create an Internet site that consolidates sex offender \n     information which States currently release under the federal \n     reporting act. The bill also directs States that have not \n     developed Internet sites to do so.\n       Currently, all 50 states have registration statutes that \n     require sex offenders to register and to share information \n     with the United States Attorney General through the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation, and over 30 States make offender \n     information available to the public on the Internet. The \n     creation of a national Internet site will enable concerned \n     citizens to find in one, easily accessible place, critical \n     information about sexual predators.\n       Section 4. Expands the DNA Analysis and Backlog Elimination \n     Act, 42 U.S.C. 14135a(d), by increasing the categories of \n     offenses that are included in the system of convicted \n     offender DNA profiles, the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). \n     The bill expands the class of offenses that are included in \n     CODIS by adding to the system all Federal felonies and \n     additional offenses that subject Federal offenders to sex \n     registration requirements.\n       Currently, the DNA Analysis and Backlog Elimination Act \n     includes only select Federal offenses in CODIS. The \n     successful experience of a large number of States which \n     authorize the collection of DNA samples from all felony \n     offenders illustrated the merit of this extension. In these \n     States, numerous crimes have been solved based on DNA \n     evidence obtained from nonviolent felony offenders. The \n     addition of other offenses that subject Federal offenders to \n     sex registration requirements will further enhance \n     enforcement's ability to solve crimes.\n       Section 5. Extends the Statute of Limitations Period for \n     Child Abuse Offenses contained in 18 U.S.C. 3283 to allow \n     prosecutions of offenses involving the sexual or physical \n     abuse of a child to be brought until the child reaches the \n     age of 35. Currently, such prosecutions may be brought until \n     the child is 25 years of age.\n       This amendment is intended to recognize that the arm of the \n     law should be long in the prosecution of child abuse \n     offenses. Too often victims of such crimes do not come \n     forward until years after the abuse because they fear their \n     disclosures will lead to further humiliation, shame, and even \n     ostracism. This amendment will reduce the number of \n     meritorious child abuse cases that are barred from \n     prosecution on statute of limitations grounds.\n\n[[Page S8461]]\n\n       Section 6. Expands Rule 414 of the Federal Rules of \n     Evidence which allows evidence of a defendant's prior acts of \n     child molestation to be admitted in a criminal child \n     molestation case.\n       The amendment extends the definition of ``child'' contained \n     in Rule 414 to include any person below the age of 18--rather \n     than age 14, as the Rule now reads. The amendment also makes \n     clear that where a defendant previously possessed what may \n     have been virtual, as opposed to actual, child pornography, \n     such evidence is admissible under Rule 414. Like the \n     possession of actual child pornography, the possession of \n     virtual child pornography is highly probative evidence that \n     should be admissible in a case of child molestation or \n     exploitation.\n       Section 7. Precludes the Assertion of a Marital Privilege \n     in a Criminal Child Abuse Case in which a spouse stands \n     accused of abusing a child in the home. In such a case, \n     neither the abuser nor his or her spouse should be permitted \n     to invoke a marital privilege to preclude critical testimony \n     relating to the child abuse.\n       Section 8. Expands the Federal Wiretap Act, 18 U.S.C. \n     2516(1)(c), by adding as predicate offenses to the statute, \n     sex trafficking, sex exploitation, and other interstate sex \n     offenses. Currently, the wiretap statute authorizes the \n     interception of wire, oral, or electronic communications in \n     the investigation of just two sexual exploitation of children \n     crimes. This expanded tool will be particularly useful to \n     investigators who track sexual predators and child \n     portnographers.\n       To obtain a wiretap, law enforcement authorities will still \n     need to meet the strict statutory guidelines of the wiretap \n     statute and obtain authorization from a court. Thus, the \n     legislation will not undermine the legitimate expectations of \n     privacy of law-abiding Americans.\n       Section 9. Extends the Maximum Supervised Release Period \n     that Applies to Sexual Offenders by granting Federal judges \n     the discretion to impose up to lifetime periods of supervised \n     release for individuals who are convicted of sexual abuse, \n     sexual exploitation, transportation for illegal sexual \n     activity, or sex trafficking offenses.\n       Currently, under the general supervised release statute, 18 \n     U.S.C. 3583, a judge can impose no more than 5 years of \n     supervised release for a serious felony, and no more than 3 \n     years for a lesser categorized offense. This amendment will \n     not require judges to impose a period of supervised release \n     longer than 5 years; it simply authorizes them to do so where \n     the judge sees fit based on the nature and circumstances of \n     the particular case.\n       Section 10. Increases the Maximum Penalties that Apply to \n     Certain Sexual Related Offenses by doubling the maximum \n     penalties for sexual related offenses involving the \n     trafficking of children and other interstate elements. \n     Stiffer penalties are needed to punish and deter individuals \n     who commit such offenses.\n       Section 11. Creates a Crimes Against Children Section at \n     the Department of Justice--The bill also directs the Attorney \n     General to appoint a Deputy Assistant Attorney General to \n     oversee a new section at the Department of Justice designated \n     to focus solely on crimes against children. Among other \n     things, the new section will be tasked with prosecuting \n     crimes against children, providing guidance and assistance to \n     Federal State, and local law enforcement agencies and \n     personnel who handle such cases, coordinating efforts with \n     international law enforcement agencies to combat crimes \n     against children, and acting as a liaison with the \n     legislative and judicial branches of government to ensure \n     that adequate attention and resources are focused on \n     protecting our children from predators of all types.\n       Section 12. Directs the Sentencing Commission to review the \n     guidelines that apply to child abuse and exploitation \n     offenses to determine whether they are sufficiently severe. \n     In so doing, the Sentencing Commission shall consider whether \n     the guidelines are adequate where aggravated circumstances \n     exist: the victim had not attained the age of twelve years, \n     or had not attained the age of sixteen years; the victim \n     died, sustained permanent, life-threatening, or serious \n     injury as a result of the criminal act; the victim was \n     abducted; the victim was abused by more than one individual; \n     the offense involved more than one victim; the offense \n     involved a large number of visual depictions, including \n     multiple images of the same victim; or the offense involved \n     material that portrays sadistic or masochistic conduct or \n     other depictions of violence.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Utah, \nSenator Hatch, to introduce the ``Comprehensive Child Protection Act of \n2002''--a bill to help protect our nation's children from child \nmolestation and other forms of abuse.\n  Sexual abuse of children is a pervasive and extremely troubling \nproblem in the United States. I learned that over 25 years ago when I \nwas serving as the Country Prosecutor in Greene County, Ohio. I saw \nwhat this kind of abuse does to innocent, helpless children and how \npervasive the crimes are in our communities. In fact, according to the \nCongressional Research Service, one of every three girls and one of \nevery seven boys will be sexually abused before they reach the age of \n18.\n  Our local police and prosecutors are on the front line in the fight \nagainst these criminals, and they deserve credit and our thanks for \ntheir hard work. For example, in Greene County recently, a number of \nchild pornographers were identified and prosecuted when local law \nenforcement carried out a successful Internet sting operation.\n  Despite successes like this, however, the data suggest that law \nenforcement is fighting an uphill battle. Last year, there were over \n5,400 registered sex offenders living in my home state of Ohio--an \nincrease of 319 percent over 1998.\n  Equally troubling, many child molesters prey upon dozens of victims \nbefore they are reported to law enforcement. Some evade detection for \nso long because many children never report the abuse. According to the \nBureau of Justice Statistics, between 60 percent and 80 percent of \nchild molestations and 69 percent of sexual assaults are never reported \nto the police. Of reported sexual assaults, 71 percent of the victims \nare children, according to the Congressional Research Service.\n  For these reasons, it is vitally important that Congress do \neverything in its power to support law enforcement in its efforts to \nprotect our nation's most vulnerable citizens. Enacting the \n``Comprehensive Child Protection Act of 2002'' would be a step in the \nright direction. By enacting this measure, we would help protect our \nchildren from sexual predators, pornographers, and others who abuse \nchildren. Among its major provisions, this legislation would:\n\n       1. Direct the FBI to establish a new center that creates \n     and trains ``rapid response teams'' (composed of prosecutors, \n     investigators, and others) to respond promptly to reported \n     crimes against children;\n       2. Establish a national Internet site that would make sex \n     offender information available to the public in one, easy to \n     access place. Currently, about 30 states make offender \n     information available to the public online;\n       3. Authorize the collection of DNA samples from registered \n     sex offenders and the inclusion of these DNA samples in the \n     Combined DNA Index System, or ``CODIS;''\n       4. Permit the prosecution of child abuse offenses until a \n     victim reaches the age of 35 (as opposed to the age of 25 \n     under current law). This provision recognizes that victims of \n     such crimes often do not come forward until years after the \n     abuse, out of shame or a fear of further humiliation;\n       5. Make it easier for investigators to track sexual \n     predators and child pornographers and make it easier to \n     prosecute criminal child abuse/molestation cases;\n       6. Create a new section at the Department of Justice to \n     focus solely on crimes against children; and\n       7. Stiffen penalties for sex-related offenses involving \n     children.\n\n  This is a good bill--a bill that would help ensure that our children \nare protected from some of the most heinous of criminals. It is a bill \nthat would increase the punishment for those criminals. And, it is a \nbill that, quite simply, is the right thing to do. I encourage my \ncolleagues to join us in cosponsoring this important measure.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an act that I \nam cosponsoring with Senator Hatch that represents one of the most \ncomprehensive pieces of legislation ever drafted to protect children, \nthe Comprehensive Child Protection Act of 2002. As Ranking Republican \non the Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, I have been greatly concerned \nwith the recent increase in reports of child abductions and murders, so \nI am glad to be a part of this effort to address this growing problem. \nIn my tenure on the Judiciary Committee, I have long fought for our \nNation's children, and have ardently supported laws that bring them and \ntheir families greater protection. I am also pleased that the President \nwill be hosting a conference on missing and exploited children at the \nend of this month, and I look forward to that conference and appreciate \nthe President's and First Lady's work on behalf of children.\n  This legislation comes at a critical time because we are hearing more \nand more about children being taken from their homes or schools and \nabused, or worse, murdered. Our children are a gift to us, are our \nnational treasure, and are our future. We must do all that we can to \nprotect these innocents and give law enforcement every tool possible to \nferret out the criminals who would do our children harm. With this \nlegislation, we will be ensuring a greater measure of protection for \nour children.\n\n[[Page S8462]]\n\n  The bill does many important things. First, it helps law enforcement \nrespond immediately to incidents of child abduction, because, as we've \nseen with the Amber Alert system, time is critical in any abduction \ncase to thwart further injury or harm. The bill creates a National \nCrimes Against Children Response Center at the FBI that will integrate \nthe resources and expertise of all Federal, State and local law \nenforcement sources to provide a rapid response for crimes involving \nchild victims. The bill also helps law enforcement by making it \npossible to get wire taps for suspected sex trafficking and \nexploitation offenses, and will require that all Federal child sex \ncrimes offenders have their DNA added to the national DNA registry. So \nthe bill will help to centralize information about criminals and \ncrimes, and makes the job of the criminal investigator easier and more \naccurate through wiretaps and DNA evidence.\n\n  The bill also creates a website registry for convicted child sexual \noffenders so that parents, neighbors, and police know who in their \ncommunities is a convicted child predator. This website will supplement \nregistries in all 50 States. This important tool will help families \nmake better and fully-informed decisions about their childrens' safety, \nand will greatly aid law enforcements' response to reports of child \nabductions and other offenses against children.\n  The bill also gives new tools to prosecutors and the courts. It \nextends the statute of limitations for prosecuting child offenders, \nallows prosecutors to introduce evidence of past child sex crimes in \nsentencing hearings, removes the so-called ``spousal privilege'' so \nthat a spouse can't stand silent in the prosecution of the other spouse \nfor child sexual abuse, and increases the maximum sentences and \nprobation periods for child sex offenders. These important tools will \nmake our communities safer by helping to rid them of child predators, \nand by keeping a tight leash on predators when they get released from \nprison.\n  So this bill helps the public know about sexual predators in their \ncommunities, improves the nation's ability to respond to child \nabduction reports, and aids criminal investigators and prosecutors in \ntheir efforts to protect the public by identifying and locking-up child \npredators. I ask my fellow Senators to support this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. CLINTON (for herself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 2918.

A bill to encourage Native contracting over the management \nof Federal lands, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by \nSenator Inouye to introduce the ``Native American Contracting and \nFederal Lands Management Demonstration Project Act'' to expand the \nhighly-successful Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance \nAct of 1975 and to bring Native knowledge and sensitivity to the \nmanagement of Federal lands.\n  Next week is the 140th anniversary of the bloodiest day in U.S. \nmilitary history--the Battle at Antietam Creek in Sharpsburg, Maryland. \nMany Civil War historians see Antietam as the turning point in the \nUnion's victory over the Confederacy and as the victory President \nLincoln needed to issue the Emancipation Proclamation.\n  Americans have a visceral impulse to restrict development of the \nlands like those at Antietam, not because we are sons of the Union or \ndaughters of the Confederacy, but because we are Americans.\n  We know that Antietam, like Omaha Beach and Little Bighorn and other \nplaces, is a sacred place.\n  In 1978, Congress passed the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, \nAIRFA, which declared that it is ``the policy of the United States to \nprotect and preserve for American Indians their inherent right of \nfreedom to believe, express and exercise the traditional religions of \nthe American Indian, Eskimo, Aleut, and Native Hawaiians, including but \nnot limited to access to sites, use and possession of sacred objects, \nand the freedom to worship through ceremonials and traditional rites.''\n  It is clear that twenty-five years after the enactment of the AIRFA, \nthe tools available to protect Native sacred places and religious \nbeliefs are insufficient.\n  At the same time, as our need for economic activities, such as \nlogging, energy and mining, increases, the clashes between economic and \ncultural interests also increase.\n  In 1970, President Nixon's Special Message to Congress on Indian \nAffairs changed forever Federal Indian law and policy. The President \nalso signed into law legislation transferring the sacred Blue Lake \nlands back to the Pueblo of Taos. These two events set the stage for \nboth the Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act, 1975, \nas well as the AIRFA, 1978.\n  The legislation I am introducing builds on these precedents by \nsetting up a demonstration project to expand opportunities for Native \ncontracting on Federal lands. One goal of this bill is to bring to bear \nthe knowledge and sensitivity of Native people to activities that are \ncurrently being carried out by Federal agencies.\n  Under the bill, the Secretary of Interior would select up to 12 \ntribes or tribal organizations per year to provide archaeological, \nanthropological, ethnographic and cultural surveys and analysis; land \nmanagement planning; and activities related to the identification, \nmaintenance, or protection of lands considered to have religious, \nceremonial or cultural significance to Indian tribes.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this measure.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2921\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Contracting \n     and Federal Lands Management Demonstration Project Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For the purposes of this Act, the following definitions \n     shall apply:\n       (1) Federal lands.--The term ``Federal lands'' means any \n     land or interests in land owned by the United States, \n     including leasehold interests held by the United States, \n     except Indian trust lands.\n       (2) Indian tribe.--The term ``Indian tribe'' has the \n     meaning given such term by section 4(e) of the Indian Self-\n     Determination and Education Assistance Act.\n       (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \n     of the Interior.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) In General.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to expand the provisions of the Indian Self \n     Determination and Education Assistance Act, as amended (25 \n     U.S.C. 450 et seq.), in order to expand Native employment and \n     income through greater contracting opportunities with the \n     Federal Government;\n       (2) to encourage Native contracting on Federal lands for \n     purposes of benefiting from the knowledge and expertise of \n     Native people in order to promote innovative management \n     strategies on Federal lands that will lead to greater \n     sensitivity toward, and respect for, Native American \n     religious beliefs and sacred sites;\n       (3) to better accommodate access to and ceremonial use of \n     Indian sacred lands by Indian religious practitioners; and\n\n[[Page S8463]]\n\n       (4) to prevent significant damage to Indian sacred lands.\n\n     SEC. 4.

TRIBAL PROCUREMENT CONTRACTING AND RESERVATION \n                   DEVELOPMENT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 7 of the Indian Self-Determination \n     and Education Assistance Act (25 U.S.C. 450e) is amended by \n     adding at the end thereof the following new subsection (d):\n       ``(d) Fostering Tribal Procurement Contracting and \n     Reservation Development.--\n       ``(1) Upon the request and application of an Indian tribe \n     to provide certain services or deliverables which the \n     Secretary of the Interior would otherwise procure from a \n     private sector entity, and absent a request to contract those \n     services or deliverables pursuant to section 102 of this Act \n     (25 U.S.C. 450f) made by the tribe or tribes to be directly \n     benefited by said services or deliverables, the Secretary of \n     the Interior shall contract for such services or deliverables \n     through the applicant Indian tribe pursuant to section 102 of \n     this Act (25 U.S.C. 450f).\n       ``(2) Subsection (1) shall not apply unless the applicant \n     tribe provides assurances to the Secretary that the principal \n     beneficiary of the contracted services remains the tribe or \n     tribes originally intended to benefit from the services or \n     deliverables.

A bill to facilitate the deployment of wireless \ntelecommunications networks in order to further the availability of the \nEmergency Alert System, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Emergency \nCommunications and Competition Act, ECCA, along with my colleague from \nMontana, Senator Burns. I am pleased that this legislation has also \nbeen cosponsored by Senators Lott, Gregg, Mikulski, Leahy, and Baucus.\n  This bill will ensure that consumers will soon be able to avail \nthemselves of an innovative new wireless technology, recently approved \nby the Federal Communications Commission. It is called the Multichannel \nVideo Distribution and Data Service, MVDDS, a title which accurately \ndescribes what this new service will provide consumers: cable \ncompetition and a high speed access to the Internet.\n  Unless Congress Acts, however, it may be years before service is \nactually\n\n[[Page S8464]]\n\ndeployed to the public. That would be a lost opportunity for consumers, \nwe would lose the opportunity to improve our communications \ninfrastructure, not only for our citizens' access to cable and the \nInternet, but also for public safety purposes. MVDDS technology can \naddress all of these needs, and we should remove unnecessary and \ncounterproductive regulatory obstacles that prevent its swift \ndeployment.\n  This bill is supported by consumer groups. The Consumers Union has \nendorsed this legislation, because it will help ensure that competition \nrapidly emerges for video programming as well as high speed Internet \nservices. The Consumers Union notes that cable rates have risen 45 \npercent since cable was deregulated in 1996, an increase that is almost \nthree times faster than inflation. According to the FCC, just one \npercent of cable communities enjoy ``effective competition.'' MVDDS can \ngo head-to-head with incumbent cable systems everywhere, and I believe \nthat this good old fashioned competition will result in lower prices \nand better service for consumers even for those who don't choose to \nsubscribe to MVDDS.\n  This legislation has also been endorsed by the National Grange, \nAmerica's oldest general farm and rural public interest organization. \nThe National Grange recognizes the extraordinary opportunity this new \nwireless technology can offer rural Americans, but it fears that the \nFCC Order authorizing MVDDS failed to ensure that it will indeed \nadequately serve rural America. At this time I would ask that these two \nletters, and other letters of support, be published in the Record \nfollowing my statement.\n  The bill Senator Burns and I are introducing today will restore \nfairness in the FCC licensing process, and in so doing, speed the \ndeployment of MVDDS to applicants that are ready to launch service to \nthe public now.\n  The ECCA provides that MVDDS applicants will be licensed in the same \nmanner as satellite companies who applied on the same day to share the \nsame spectrum. Currently, the FCC plans to subject only MVDDS \napplicants to an auction process. This would impose a discriminatory \ntax on an innovative new technology. Unfortunately, this is more of the \nsame burdensome regulation that I believe has contributed to the \ncollapse of the telecommunications sector. Government regulation is \nnecessary, certainly; but we must be smart in how we regulate business. \nWe must ensure that our laws and regulations are technologically \nneutral so that government policies don't replace the role of the \nmarketplace in determining the fate of consumer products and services.\n  Furthermore, an auction would drastically delay the introduction of \nservice to the public. Mr. President, this is quite the opposite of \nwhat spectrum auctions are supposed to do. In this case, industry \nincumbents can use the auction to block the introduction of new \ncompetition. A company with vast resources available could easily \ntrounce a small startup in an auction--and then, under the terms of the \nFCC's Order, it would not have to deploy service for 10 years. \nConsumers cannot wait for spectrum to be ``shelved'' for an entire \ndecade.\n  The ECCA solves this problem by ensuring that only qualified \napplicants will be licensed. That is, within six months of enactment, \nthe FCC would issue licenses to any applicant that can demonstrate \nthrough independent testing that it will employ a technology that won't \ncause harmful interference to DBS operators with whom they would share \nspectrum. Then, to be sure that service is in fact deployed, the ECCA \nrequires licensees to provide service to consumers within five rather \nthan ten years.\n  This legislation also requires that parties who apply for licenses \nunder this provision must assume specific public interest obligations \nin exchange for their prompt licensing. The bill requires full must-\ncarry of local television stations, and an additional set aside of 4 \npercent of system capacity for other public interest purposes such as \ntele-medicine and distance learning. I can assure my colleagues that \nthese are issues particularly important in rural areas in states like \nLouisiana.\n  The ECCA will also promote public safety, in two ways. First, it will \nrequire MVDDS licensees to air Emergency Alert System warnings. These \nalerts are presently carried by cable systems and over-the-air \nbroadcasters. However, they are not seen by those who get their \nprogramming from DBS unless the viewer happens to be watching a local \nchannel. In states like Louisiana, where DBS operators do not carry \nlocal stations, this is particularly important. Unfortunately, my state \nis not alone--local stations are also not carried in Alaska, Arkansas, \nIdaho, Iowa, Maine, Montana, Mississippi, Nebraska, North and South \nDakota, West Virginia, and Wyoming. In total, over 1,100 TV stations \nare not carried by DBS.\n  Second, this legislation requires MVDDS licensees to make their \ntransmission systems available to national security and emergency \npreparedness personnel on a top-priority basis in times of need. We all \nknow that when emergencies strike, the need for public safety personnel \nto communicate with one another skyrockets. MVDDS wireless networks, \nwhich will be deployed ubiquitously throughout the country, can help \nalleviate this thirst for spectrum.\n  For these reasons, I believe that Congress should act on this matter \nas soon as possible. I urge my colleagues to support this bill and vote \nfor enactment this year. I ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2922\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This legislation would benefit consumers by ensuring \n     that quality wireless spectrum is available for video \n     programming and a wide range of public services, including \n     emergency warnings.\n       Consumers Union has long advocated for policies that will \n     increase competition to cable television and encourage \n     deployment of advanced Internet services to rural and \n     underserved communities, and we support policies that \n     encourage efficient use of wireless spectrum. We believe that \n     multichannel video and data distribution service (MVDDS) \n     could provide an extraordinary opportunity for consumers to \n     receive video programming, local broadcast, and broadband \n     Internet access at affordable prices, by efficiently reusing \n     satellite spectrum. However, a recent FCC order authorizing \n     MVDDS fails to ensure that this spectrum will be used for the \n     purpose of competition for video programming.\n       Nationwide, consumers have seen their cable television \n     rates rise 45 percent since cable was deregulated in 1996, an \n     increase almost three times faster than inflation. In the few \n     areas where there is robust competition among cable \n     providers, rate increases have been less draconian; consumers \n     receive more channels for less money. Direct competition for \n     video services should be a high public policy priority \n     because it results in lower prices and better service for \n     consumers.\n       Instead, the FCC's decision seems to better serve the \n     interests of companies who want to provide wireless data \n     services to businesses, by defining markets in a way that it \n     will be difficult to provide video services. By basing MVDDS \n     licenses on an entirely different geographic system than what \n     is currently used for television markets, the FCC order would \n     render local television carriage all but impossible, \n     perpetuating artificial scarcity for video spectrum. This \n     virtually forecloses the possibility that MVDDS could be a \n     robust competitor to cable.\n       At a time when the FCC has also eliminated the 45 MHz \n     spectrum cap, inviting more wireless consolidation, it is far \n     less critical to put additional spectrum on the market for \n     non-video services. Accordingly, we support the Emergency \n     Communications and Competition Act of 2002 as a sound \n     approach to ensure that MVDDS is a vehicle for real \n     competition to cable television, especially in rural and \n     underserved areas.\n       First, the bill would facilitate licensing of companies in \n     the 12.2-12.7 GHz band that are committed to providing these \n     needed consumer services. Moreover, this bill requires that \n     licensees build out these services within five years, \n     compared with the FCC's order which allows license holders to \n     warehouse MVDDS spectrum as long as ten years before \n     providing services. Second, the Emergency Communications and \n     Competition Act of 2002 would ensure access to local \n     broadcast signals by including full must carry requirements \n     and retransmission consent requirements in all television \n     markets. Third, this bill fixes the market boundary \n     definition problem by setting license boundaries that conform \n     to existing television market boundaries.\n       Importantly, the bill would also require each licensee to \n     disseminate Federal, State and local Emergency Alert System \n     warnings to all subscribers. Currently, subscribers to \n     Digital Broadcast Satellite (DBS) programming only receive \n     alerts if they happen to live in an area where local \n     programming is carried by DBS providers. This possibility is \n     denied to subscribers in the 13 states in which DBS provides \n     no local channels (AK, AR, ID, IA, LA, ME, MT, MS, NE, ND, \n     SD, WV, and WY). Given the heightened need for effective \n     local security and emergency management plans, consumers must \n     be able to receive Emergency Alerts regardless of where they \n     live and how they access video programming services.\n       Finally, the Emergency Communications and Competition Act \n     of 2002 includes a number of specific public interest \n     obligations of tremendous benefit to consumers. The bill \n     requires a licensee to make its facilities available for \n     candidates for public office and to provide at least 4% of \n     its capacity for services that promote the public interest, \n     including telemedicine services, educational programming, \n     including distance learning, high speed Internet access to \n     unserved and underserved populations, or local data and video \n     services intended to facilitate public participation in local \n     government and community life.\n       Consumers Union has long argued that American consumers \n     must have competitive alternatives for video programming as \n     well as for high speed Internet services. The Emergency \n     Communications and Competition Act 2002 will help ensure such \n     competition rapidly emerges. For all of these reasons, we ask \n     you to support the Emergency Communications and Competition \n     Act of 2002.\n           Respectfully,\n     Chris Murray,\n       Internet & Telecommunications Counsel.\n     Gene Kimmelman,\n       Senior Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  National Grange,\n\n\n                         of the Order of Patrons of Husbandry,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 16, 2002.\n     Hon. Mary L. Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: On behalf of the National Grange, I \n     am writing to thank you for introducing the Emergency \n     Communications and Competition Act of 2002 (ECCA) sponsored \n     by Sen. Mary Landrieu (LA) which would assure that \n     multichannel video and data distribution services (MVDDS) \n     will be available and affordable in every rural community \n     across the nation.\n       The National Grange is America's oldest general farm and \n     rural public interest organization. Founded in 1867, today \n     the Grange represents nearly 300,000 Grange members \n     affiliated with 3200 local, county and state Grange chapters. \n     The Grange members are families and individuals who share a \n     common interest in community involvement, agricultural and \n     rural issues. The Grange is a genuine grassroots, bipartisan, \n     political advocacy organization. The goal of Grange advocacy \n     is the well being and prosperity of rural America.\n       Rural telecommunication service deployment is a top \n     priority for the National Grange. In our priority issues \n     document Blueprint for Rural America 2002, we described the \n     vital need for telecommunications services in rural areas:\n\n     ``Adequate access to telecommunications services such as \n     telephone, Internet, satellite and cable is important to \n     rural America. The Internet delivers services and products \n     efficiently, irrespective of geographic location. Today, \n     workers who telecommute can enjoy a rewarding career and a \n     rural life style. Satellite technology can bring new \n     information to every farm in America. We must assure\n\n[[Page S8466]]\n\n     that advanced telecommunications technologies are available \n     in every rural community at affordable costs.''\n\n       We believe that multichannel video and data distribution \n     services (MVDDS), as set forth in the ECCA, provide an \n     extraordinary opportunity for rural Americans to receive \n     video programming, local broadcast, and broadband Internet \n     access at affordable prices. However, the FCC order \n     authorizing MVDDS failed to ensure that rural America will be \n     adequately served by this new technology. By contrast, the \n     ECCA would assure that MVDDS is available and affordable in \n     every rural community.\n       First, the ECCA would facilitate licensing of services in \n     the 12.2-12.7 GHz band. It requires that licensees build out \n     services within five years. The FCC rule allows license \n     holders to warehouse MVDDS spectrum for as long as ten years \n     before providing services. Rural Americans cannot afford to \n     wait another ten years for access to advanced \n     telecommunitions technologies such as MVDDS. The National \n     Grange believes that license holders should be held to a \n     strict ``use or lose'' standard if they fail to deploy \n     services within the statutory five-year time frame.\n       Second, the ECCA would reverse the FCC's inappropriate \n     decision to auction licenses in this band. Historically, \n     auctions have failed to foster competition, particularly in \n     rural markets. Only 31% of spectrum licenses offered for sale \n     in 2001 were actually sold. Rural areas remain grossly \n     underserved by spectrum licensing programs.\n       Third, it would include full ``must carry'' requirements \n     for all local broadcast signals in all television markets \n     served by MVDDS providers. Consumers in rural areas depend on \n     local programming for news, information about local events, \n     and other important interests. However, in many states, rural \n     consumers are unable to receive those signals over Direct \n     Broadcast Satellite (DBS) services or even, in some cases, by \n     means of over-the-air free broadcasting.\n       Fourth, the ECCA would require each licenses to disseminate \n     Federal, State and local Emergency Alert System warnings to \n     all subscribers. Currently, subscribers to DBS programming \n     may or may not receive alerts. DBS provides no local channels \n     in 13 states (AK, AR, ID, IA, LA, ME, MT, MS, NE, ND, SD, WV, \n     and WY). DBS subscribers in these states receive no emergency \n     or local broadcasts at all. Given the heightened need for \n     effective local security and emergency management plans, \n     rural Americans must receive Emergency Alerts regardless of \n     where they live and how they access video programming \n     services.\n       Finally, the ECCA includes a number of specific public \n     interest obligations that will benefit rural consumers. The \n     bill requires a licenses to provide at least 4% of its \n     capacity for services that promote the public interest, \n     including telemedicine services, distance learning, high \n     speed Internet access to unserved and underserved \n     populations, or local data and video services intended to \n     facilitate public participation in local government and \n     community life. If implemented effectively, these provisions \n     could dramatically change the way that rural Americans engage \n     in civic life, experience education, and find necessary \n     medical services.\n       The National Grange has a suggestion for improving this \n     bill. We support adding language to the ECCA to protect the \n     property interests of rural Americans with a provision \n     forbidding MVDDS licenses from being used as evidence of \n     public good for private property condemnation proceedings, \n     other than in the cases of existing utility or railroad \n     rights of way. We understand that MVDDS transmission \n     technology is very small, and should not require building new \n     towers or other projects that would require condemnation of \n     private property. Because of this we do not believe there \n     will be any technical justification for license holders to \n     ask local governments to exercise eminent domain authority on \n     private property in order to meet build out requirements.\n       The National Grange has long argued that rural Americans \n     must have competitive alternatives to cable and Direct \n     Broadcast Satellite services, both for video and high speed \n     Internet services. The Emergency Communications and \n     Competition Act of 2002 will ensure that competitive service \n     is deployed in a timely manner along with critical local and \n     emergency broadcast signals in rural underserved areas. For \n     all of these reasons, we strongly support the Emergency \n     Communications and Competition Act of 2002.\n           Sincerely,\n     Kermit W. Richardson, President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Leadership Conference\n\n\n                                              on Civil Rights,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 9, 2002.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights \n     (LCCR), the nation's oldest, largest, and most diverse \n     coalition of organizations committed to the protection of \n     civil and human rights in the United States, writes to \n     express our support for the Electronic Communications and \n     Competition Act of 2002, sponsored by Senators Landrieu and \n     Burns. We believe that the legislation will help bridge the \n     digital divide by encouraging rapid deployment of a new \n     wireless multichannel video and data technology (MVDDS). This \n     new technology will bring low-cost broadband Internet and \n     video services to rural and underserved areas and increase \n     the prospects for media ownership by minorities and women.\n       While LCCR was pleased that the Federal Communications \n     Commission approved the creation of MVDDS, the order failed \n     to ensure that MVDDS would provide local broadcast \n     television, video programming, and broadband Internet \n     services throughout the country. There is no question that \n     auctions favor incumbents and are a major impediment to \n     minority media ownership. The Electronic Communications and \n     Competition Act will ensure that MVDDS fulfills, among other \n     things, its potential to increase minority ownership and \n     bridge the digital divide.\n       Notwithstanding the decades of civil rights community \n     advocacy, minority broadcast ownership is declining. Although \n     minorities represent more than one quarter of the nation's \n     population, they are just 23, or 1.9% of the 1288 owners of \n     licensed, full-power commercial broadcast television stations \n     in the United States.\n       The Electronic Communications and Competition Act will \n     eliminate the auction requirement and compel immediate \n     licensing of all conforming MVDDS technologies. In addition, \n     it will require license-holders to build out services within \n     five years, significantly narrowing the digital divide. The \n     act will also require that a percentage of each license-\n     holder's capacity be used for public interest purposes such \n     as distance education, telemedicine, or other important local \n     purposes.\n       In sum, I urge you to support the Electronic Communications \n     and Competition Act. It provides a rare opportunity to \n     increase media diversity and to narrow the digital divide.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Wade J. Henderson,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  National Council of La Raza,\n\n                                Washington, DC, September 4, 2002.\n       Dear Senator: As you know, the National Council of La Raza \n     (NCLR) has long advocated on behalf of the nation's growing \n     Hispanic community on a number of economic, education, and \n     other social policy issues. You may not be aware, however, \n     that NCLR has also had a long-standing interest in policy \n     affecting telecommunications, access to the Internet, and the \n     growing concentration of the media industry. That is why I am \n     writing today to seek your support for the Emergency \n     Communications and Competition Act of 2002, sponsored by \n     Senators Mary Landrieu (D-LA) and Conrad Burns (R-MT).\n       NCLR has been a strong supporter in the past for policies \n     that will increase competition in the cable industry and \n     encourage deployment of advanced Internet services to rural \n     and underserved communities. We have also urged ``must \n     carry'' rules for all video programming competitors, \n     regardless of platform, to ensure that communities, \n     especially rural ones, have full access to local and \n     emergency broadcast signals. That is why earlier this summer \n     we wrote to a number of lawmakers expressing our support for \n     new technology that will provide multichannel video and data \n     distribution services (``MVDDS'') (a copy of that earlier \n     communication is attached). MVDDS provides a significant \n     opportunity for consumers to receive video programming, local \n     broadcasts and broadband Internet access at affordable \n     prices. As noted in that earlier correspondence, the FCC \n     order authorizing MVDDS failed in many significant respects \n     to serve the interests of consumers and underserved \n     communities.\n       We urge Congress to enact the Emergency Communications and \n     Competition Act of 2002 to ensure that MVDDS benefits are \n     available to all consumers, especially in rural and \n     underserved areas, for a range of reasons.\n       First, the bill would facilitate licensing of companies in \n     the 12.2-12.7 GHz band who are committed to providing these \n     needed consumer services. Additionally, this bill requires \n     licensees to build out these services within five years, \n     compared with the current FCC rule which allows license \n     holders to warehouse MVDDS spectrum for as long as ten years \n     before providing services.\n       Second, the Emergency Communications and Competition Act of \n     2002 would include full ``must carry'' requirements and \n     retransmission consent requirements in all television \n     markets, thereby ensuring access to local broadcast signals. \n     Moreover, this bill sets license boundaries that conform to \n     existing television market boundaries. Local access is \n     critical as consumers depend on local programming for news, \n     information about local events, language appropriate \n     programming, and other critical interests. Current FCC rules \n     for the MVDDS licenses call for entirely different geographic \n     boundaries, which would render local television carriage \n     almost impossible.\n       Third, the bill would require each licensee to disseminate \n     federal, state and local Emergency Alert System warnings to \n     all subscribers. Today, subscribers to Digital Broadcast \n     Satellite (``DBS'') programming only receive alerts if they \n     happen to live in areas where local programming is carried by \n     DBS providers. This possibility does not even exist in the 14 \n     states in which DBS provides no local channels (AK, AR, ID, \n     IA, LA, ME, MT, MS, NE, ND, SD, VT, WV, and WY). Given the \n     heightened need for effective local security and emergency \n     management plans, consumers should be able to receive \n     Emergency Alerts regardless of where they live and how they \n     access video programming services.\n       Fourth, the Emergency Communications and Competition Act of \n     2002 provides other\n\n[[Page S8467]]\n\n     important benefits to consumers by requiring a licensee to \n     provide at least 4% of its capacity for services that promote \n     the public interest, including telemedicine services, \n     educational and long distance learning proramming, high-speed \n     Internet access to unserved and underserved populations, and/\n     or local data and video services intended to facilitate \n     public participation in local governments and community life, \n     and also requires a licensee to make its facilities available \n     for candidates for public office.\n       Finally, as noted in our earlier correspondence, MVDDS is \n     likely to increase for minority broadcasting ownership \n     opportunities and Latino content over the airwaves, a \n     critically important consideration for NCLR.\n       NCLR believes that all American consumers are entitled to \n     have access to competitive alternatives to cable and DBS \n     services, for both video and high-speed data services. For \n     the reasons set forth above, we ask you to support the \n     Emergency Communications and Competition Act of 2002.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Raul Yzaguirre,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               Avoyel-Taensa Tribe\n\n\n                                                 of Louisiana,\n\n                                  Simmesport, LA, August 28, 2002.\n     Hon. Mary L. Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: I am writing on behalf of the \n     Avoyel-Taensa Indian Organization. We are a rural people by \n     nature and have an obvious concern about the development of \n     rural areas in Louisiana. The Emergency Communications and \n     Compensation Act of 2002 is critical for further development \n     in this legislation and hope that you decide to sponsor it.\n       This legislation provides benefits for rural areas \n     previously not available. Schoolchildren will have access to \n     the internet--a significant advancement in education for \n     rural communities. Also, this legislation will provide access \n     to a wide-range of television stations for an entire rural \n     area at an affordable cost. Having telemedicine capabilities \n     in community health centers is becoming essential. This new \n     Bill would bring this technology to the rural communities.\n       This new Bill will also require full ``must carry'' \n     requirements for all local broadcast signals in all \n     television markets. Consumers in rural areas depend on local \n     programming for news, information about local events, and \n     other important interests. Subscribers to Direct Broadcast \n     Satellite (DBS) do not have access to local broadcast signals \n     in the State of Louisiana.\n       Most importantly, however, the Emergency Communications and \n     Competition Act of 2002 brings a new level of security to our \n     rural communities. DBS does not distribute Federal, State, \n     and Local emergency alerts to its subscribers. This Act will \n     ensure that emergency alerts will reach the rural \n     communities. Given the heightened need for local security and \n     emergency management, it is imperative that rural Americans \n     receive emergency alerts.\n       There is a new technology, led by Northpoint Technology \n     that can effectively bring the luxury of satellite television \n     and the necessity of local programming and emergency alerts \n     at an affordable cost to the rural areas of Louisiana. We are \n     pleased you have taken an interest in this legislation and \n     stand by you if you decide to sponsor it.\n           Sincerely Yours:\n                                                    Romes Antoine,\n     Tribal Chief\n                                  ____\n\n                                                  Wilma Mankiller,\n\n\n                                             Route 1, Box 945,\n\n                                    Stilwell, OK, August 16, 2002.\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: Thank you for drafting the \n     ``Emergency Communications and Competition Act.'' Passage of \n     your legislation will help facilitate the rapid deployment of \n     the Multichannel Video Distribution and Data Service (MVDDS), \n     a new wireless service that the Federal Communications \n     Commission recently authorized.\n       This innovative wireless technology can provide affordable \n     video programming (including all local channels) and \n     broadband Internet access to consumers throughout the entire \n     country, and it will be particularly important to Native \n     Americans who live in rural areas where competition all too \n     often is lacking or non-existent.\n       Your legislation will ensure that the FCC promptly issues \n     licenses to qualified applicants. As you know, the FCC has \n     decided to issue MVDDS licenses through an auction process. \n     Auctions have yet to facilitate the deployment of video \n     service or broadband to Native American communities. I'm \n     particularly worried that in this case an auction may prevent \n     the deployment of actual service for at least a decade.\n       Unless Congress enacts your legislation, well-heeled \n     opponents of new completion could outbid small startups. \n     Auction participants aren't required to have a proven \n     technology and they don't have to deploy any service for ten \n     years. Your bill corrects this by requiring all applicants to \n     demonstrate they are capable of deploying MVDDS and requiring \n     them to do so in five years.\n       The National Congress of American Indians (NCAI), the \n     nation's oldest, largest and most representative tribal \n     government, as well as the National Indian Telecommunications \n     Institute (NITI), a tribally-owned and operated not-for-\n     profit organization dedicated to ensuring that Native \n     Americans have the same opportunity to participate in, and \n     benefit from, the digital revolution as other Americans have \n     urged the FCC to licenses to qualified applicants without an \n     auction process.\n       As the NCAI wrote to the FCC on March 22, 2002, ``The \n     difficulty in finding service providers willing and able to \n     provide telecommunications to Native American communities is \n     well documented. As the FCC's own records show auctions do \n     nothing to narrow that gap and indeed may exacerbate the \n     problem.... If the FCC auctions use of the 12.2-12.7 GHz \n     band, the potential to bring video and broadband services to \n     our communities in that spectrum will remain unfulfilled.''\n       I heartily share these concerns and thus I am very grateful \n     that you have crafted legislation that will ensure the \n     promise of MVDDS in rural America and tribal communities can \n     be fulfilled through prompt licensing of companies that are \n     ready, willing and able to offer new competitive service.\n       I and several other Native Americans are local affiliates \n     of Northpoint Technology, the only company that has \n     demonstrated its technology through independent testing. We \n     clearly lack the resources to compete at an auction against \n     giant communications companies. I find it remarkable that \n     they are eligible to seek a license when they have no MVDDS \n     technology.\n       It's also grossly unfair to subject us to MVDDS applicants \n     to an auction when the FCC is issuing licenses--without \n     auction--to several satellite companies that applied to share \n     the same spectrum on the same day I filed my license \n     application. Your legislation will ensure that terrestrial \n     and satellite applicants for the same spectrum are treated in \n     a like manner. While I believe that Northpoint is currently \n     the only qualified terrestrial applicant because it alone \n     submitted equipment for the independent testing conducted by \n     the MITRE Corporation last year, your legislation clearly \n     offers an opportunity for other companies to similarly become \n     qualified by subjecting their own technology to independent \n     testing this year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Wilma Mankiller,\n     Principal Chief, Cherokee Nation.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              Marzulla & Marzulla,\n\n\n                                              Attorney at Law,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, August 30, 2002.\n     Re the Emergency Communications and Competition Act of 2002.\n\n     Hon. Mary Landrieu,\n     Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: I am writing to thank you for \n     sponsoring the Emergency Communications and Competition Act \n     of 2002.\n       This measure will promote the deployment of the Multi-\n     channel Video Distribution and Data Service (``MVDDS''), an \n     innovative ground-based wireless digital technology that will \n     share spectrum with satellites in the 12.2-12.7 GHz spectrum \n     band. Sharing this spectrum will dramatically increase the \n     capacity of radio spectrum, and promises consumers new and \n     competitive choices for multi-channel video programming and \n     internet broadband services.\n       Because of its affordability, this technology will also \n     make possible provision of broadband services to underserved \n     populations such as students, library users, Indians on \n     reservations, community center users, seniors, and residents \n     in low-income housing.\n       However, this bill does more than benefit the consumer. \n     This bill also protects the intellectual property rights of \n     the inventors of this new technology, and thus is consistent \n     with the constitutional framers' intent that creators and \n     owners of intellectual property rights enjoy the fruits of \n     their labor.\n       As you know, rather than permitting the inventors to \n     utilize their new technology, the FCC instead chose to \n     dismiss the inventors' licensing applications (after allowing \n     their application to languish for over three years), and \n     called for a nationwide spectrum auction. The FCC's refusal \n     to process the inventors' permit application for over three \n     years itself raises serious due process concerns. See, e.g., \n     MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. FCC, 627 F.2d 322, 341 (1980) \n     (``[D]elay in the resolution administrative proceedings can \n     also deprive regulated entities, their competitors or the \n     public of rights and economic opportunities without the due \n     process the Constitution requires.'').\n       The FCC's decision to auction off the right to use the \n     inventors' technology, the only technology currently proven \n     able to allow terrestrial service to reuse the same spectrum \n     currently used by satellite systems, to the highest bidder \n     also smacks of a taking of private property without payment \n     of just compensation. See Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., 467 \n     U.S. 986, 1003 (1984) (``[I]ntangible property rights ... are \n     deserving of the protection of the Taking Clause has long \n     been implicit in the thing of [the Supreme] Court. . . .''); \n     Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155, \n     164 (1980) (holding that government may not ``by ipse \n     dixit,... transform private [property into public property \n     without just compensation.'').\n       Thus, this bill should be enacted not only because it \n     protects the property rights of the inventors, but because it \n     also benefits consumers. This bill will require the FCC to \n     accept an application for a license to operate a\n\n[[Page S8468]]\n\n     fixed terrestrial service in the 12.2-2.7 GHz band only from \n     an applicant that ``will employ terrestrial service \n     technology under the license that has been successfully \n     demonstrated with operational equipment that the application \n     has furnished for testing pursuant to section 1012 of the \n     Launching Our Communities' Access to Local Television Act of \n     2000 (47 U.S.C. Sec. 1110) and certifies in its application \n     that it has authority to use such terrestrial service \n     technology under the license.'' See proposed bill at Sec. 3 \n     (b)(1)(B)(i). This bill will also require a license to build \n     out the system covered by the license within five years of \n     the grant of the license. See proposed bill at Sec. 3 (c).\n       These requirements will ensure that the FCC issues licenses \n     promptly and in a fair and constitutional manner to qualified \n     applicants (i.e., any party that demonstrates its own \n     technology can share spectrum with satellites would be \n     eligible for a license). This bill will finally enable \n     consumers to enjoy an important new competitive service that \n     is so long overdue.\n       Seldom does one bill protect private property rights, \n     increase competition, and provide more service options for \n     the public. I am happy to report that this bill accomplishes \n     all three. I commend you for authoring this important \n     legislation and ask that you call upon me if any can be of \n     any assistance to help secure its passage.\n           Yours truly,\n     Nancie G. Marzulla.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, today I rise with my colleague from \nLouisiana, Sen. Landrieu, to introduce the ``Emergency Communications \nand Competition Act of 2002'' or ``ECCA.''\n  This bill will build upon previous legislation I authored, the LOCAL \nTV Act, to help ensure that all local TV stations, not just those in \nthe largest markets are available to consumers. As a former \nbroadcaster, I know Montana has some of the smallest of the Nations' \n210 television markets, from 169th-ranked Missoula all the way down to \n210th-ranked Glendive.\n  Today, the satellite operators provide local channels in 52 markets. \nI'm not crossing my fingers that they will get to Glendive anytime \nsoon. That's why we need this legislation. It will enable the rapid \ndeployment of the new Multichannel Video Programming and Data \nDistribution Service, MVDDS, which the Federal Communications \nCommission authorized earlier this year.\n  I commend the FCC for authorizing this new service, it not only \npromises to bring local channels to all markets, regardless of size, \nbut it will also provide broadband Internet access to rural Americans \nwho have no such access today. I expect that the low cost of this \nwireless technology will translate into low prices for consumers. This \nis precisely the kind of innovative new technology we should encourage \nand promote.\n  I am most concerned, however, that unless we pass this legislation, \nwe may never see the deployment of this new service. The FCC has \ndetermined that licenses for this new service should be auctioned. I \nappreciate the FCC's effort to help generate new revenues for the \nFederal Treasury, but we must never let that consideration override \ngood public policy judgments. The public interest is best served when \nthe spectrum is licensed promptly to applicants that are ready to \ndeploy service.\n  While auctions make sense in many instances, this is not always the \ncase. Two years ago, Congress passed the ORBIT Act, legislation I \nauthored which, in part, exempted from auctions ``spectrum used for the \nprovision of international or global satellite communications \nservices.''\n  We are now confronted with a case of first impression in which the \nFCC has determined to issue licenses to both terrestrial and satellite \napplicants that share the same spectrum. Previously this was thought to \nbe technologically impossible, as I mentioned, the FCC has now \ndetermined that the terrestrial-based MVDDS can share with satellites. \nIn my judgment, the same Federal resource must be licensed in the same \nmanner to all applicants, regardless of the technology they will \nemploy. To do otherwise is to pick industry winners and losers. This \nbill corrects this problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/09/10/senate-section/article/S8468-1", "month": "09", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENT SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4516.
