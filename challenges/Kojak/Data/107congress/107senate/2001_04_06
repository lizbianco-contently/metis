Mr. President, today the Senate will immediately resume \nconsideration of the final amendments to the budget resolution. There \nwill be 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote on any of the amendments \nproposed.\n  There are, for the information of Senators, between 30 and 40 \namendments to be considered during today's session. We are working with \nSenators on both sides to see which amendments can be accepted, which \nwill require rollcall votes, and perhaps which we will not be required \nto take action on at all.\n  Senators should be aware that all votes after the first vote will be \nlimited to 10 minutes. Therefore, Members should stay in the Chamber if \npossible between votes. We are working to vote on final passage by 2:30 \nor 3 p.m.\n  I thank my colleagues for their attention.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have looked at the amendments \novernight. We still have 42 amendments pending. Between the two sides \nwe have 42 amendments pending. That does not count the leadership wrap-\nup amendments or the debate on those amendments. So realistically we \nwould be talking about 16 hours of straight voting unless we are able \nto find some give in the good hearts of our colleagues. I am going to \nturn to my side of the aisle and urge colleagues on my side to please \nrelent in the interest of getting the business of the Senate done on \nthis budget resolution.\n  Senator Reid and I have gone to our colleagues and asked them to \nplease refrain from pushing their amendment to\n\n[[Page S3638]]\n\na vote. We understand every Senator has a right to take his or her \namendment to a vote, but if everyone insists on their absolute right, \nwe are going to be here 16 hours. Truthfully, it would probably be more \nthan that because we have not been able to do three votes an hour.\n  That is the reality of the situation we confront. We urge our \ncolleagues to try to work with us as the morning proceeds and to reduce \namendments.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Just for the record, would the Senator do me the favor \nof emphasizing this amendment dealing with veterans' health care \nbenefits is an amendment from yesterday? I have, indeed, withdrawn my \nother two amendments, just so colleagues will know that. Will the \nSenator amplify that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am pleased to say the amendment of the Senator from \nMinnesota was actually scheduled for last night for a vote and it was \nheld over because of a parliamentary situation that developed last \nevening. So I am not making this request of the Senator from Minnesota. \nHe has been patient. He has been one who has cooperated and dropped \namendments, which we appreciate very much.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Does the chairman wish we go to a quorum call or go to the vote?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, let me suggest we have three or four \nSenators we want to talk with on the phone. We may significantly change \nour numbers. We do not have anything like those--we are one-third of \nyour number or one-fourth.\n  I believe we ought to proceed. I believe Senator Bond is ready on our \nside with a second-degree.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation? I \nunderstood we were going to have votes at 9:30?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We are ready to go. We will get an amendment up and be \nready to go.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3638-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3638-S3650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR THE FISCAL \n                            YEARS 2001--2011\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume consideration of H. Con. Res. 83, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 83) establishing the \n     congressional budget for the United States Government for \n     fiscal year 2002, revising the congressional budget for the \n     United States Government for fiscal year 2001, and setting \n     forth appropriate budgetary levels for each of fiscal years \n     2003 through 2011.)\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Domenici amendment No. 170, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Motion to reconsider the vote by which Harkin amendment No. \n     185 (to amendment No. 170) was agreed to.\n       Wellstone amendment No. 269 (to amendment No. 170) to \n     increase discretionary funding for veterans' medical care by \n     $1.718 billion in 2002 and each year thereafter to ensure \n     that veterans have access to quality medical care.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 269\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill now be 2 minutes for debate on the Wellstone amendment No. 269.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Colleagues, this amendment adds $1.7 billion to the \nveterans' health care budget over the next 10 years. The President's \nbudget proposal is a terrible proposal; it leaves so many gaps, there \nis no question about it. This amendment has the support of AMVETS, VFW, \nParalyzed Veterans, Disabled American Veterans, and many colleagues \nhave signed on to it. I especially thank Senator Johnson and Senator \nRockefeller.\n  The problem is between $900 million of medical inflation and then the \ncommitment we made to elderly veterans with the Millennium Program and \nthe commitment for mental health services, hepatitis C, and the \ncommitment to treat veterans who have no health care coverage, this is \ntotally inadequate.\n  This is not a game. If we are committed to veterans, you are going to \nvote for this amendment. This really does deal with some of the unmet \nneeds. There are amendments that can come in with less funding, but \nthis is the only way we say thank you to veterans. It is extremely \nimportant. I can't think of any more important vote from the point of \nview of working with a very, very important group of people.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who seeks time?\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute on this side to \nrespond to the comments of the proponent of the underlying amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 351\n\n  Mr. President, I send a second-degree amendment to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Missouri [Mr. Bond] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 351.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: Increase Veterans discretionary spending for FY02)\n\n       On page 36, line 6, increase the amount by $967,000,000.\n       On page 36, line 7, increase the amount by $967,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 15, decrease the amount by $967,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 16, decrease the amount by $967,000,000.\n       On page 48, line 8, increase the amount by $967,000,000.\n       On page 48, line 9, increase the amount by $967,000,000.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, this underlying amendment, as others before \nand after, chips away at the tax relief package proposed by the \nPresident. All citizens, including our veterans, deserve tax relief. \nThis amendment that I have just offered on behalf of Senator Domenici \nwould increase veterans' discretionary spending for the coming year by \nalmost $2 billion, including a $1.7 billion increase for medical care. \nThis is the highest increase ever; this is the first increase in recent \nyears.\n  Let me make a point that the President's budget request for VA is an \nexcellent one. This body should recall from previous years that the \nprior administration proposed to freeze veterans' medical care with no \nincrease at all.\n  This amendment also provides the highest increase ever for the \nVeterans' Benefit Administration, where a backlog of claims continues \nto mount. This is a problem that the prior administration refused to \naddress.\n  Finally, this amendment does not assume spending beyond fiscal year \n2002 because VA has a new administration, new management, and a massive \nstrategic review.\n  I urge support of the second-degree amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 269\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President and colleagues, please follow the \narithmetic. The President's budget is opposed by so many veterans \norganizations.\n  With $1 billion for the whole VA budget, medical inflation alone is \n$900 million. We passed a millennium bill with a commitment to elderly \nveterans with another $100 million. We talk about mental health \nservices, and another $100 million for treating veterans with hepatitis \nC. That provides more resources.\n  I do not know, in all due respect, where my colleague gets his \nnumbers. I am glad that we have an amendment on the other side of the \naisle that calls for a $900 million increase. I am pleased we are \npushing this forward. But, in all due respect, the President's budget \nis no way to say thanks to veterans. Sure, we can take a little bit out \nof tax cuts with 40 percent going to the top 1 percent and make the \ncommitment to veterans' health care.\n  This is a clear vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 \nminute out of order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Mikulski, who has waited patiently for 2 days to \noffer her amendment, came to us a few minutes ago and said, because of \nthe rush\n\n[[Page S3639]]\n\nof things, she would be willing to take a voice vote.\n  The reason I mention that is I think Members have a pretty good idea \nhow the votes are going to turn out. She sets a very good example for \nthis body, as she always does. I suggest others follow her example.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask that we proceed in the following \nmanner: No amendment be in order to these amendments prior to the vote; \nthat the votes occur in relation to these amendments in a stacked \nsequence; first, in relationship to the Wellstone amendment and then in \nrelation to Senator Bond's amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Wellstone amendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that there be no \namendments in order to the Enzi amendment, No. 284.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this might be one of the most important \namendments you will vote on if you are interested in your State banks. \nThis is an issue we have dealt with every year recently. Mr. Carper, \nthe Senator from Delaware, and I have worked on this diligently. \nMembers would be amazed at the cosponsors. We have nine Democrats and \nnine Republicans on it. We have other Members who have pledged their \nsupport.\n  The budget resolution would impose a new federal fee on State banks, \nbut it would be a fee that receives no service. It is a fee we have \nrejected every year as a new tax.\n  Don't approve a new tax in this budget. Help roll it back one more \ntime and make sure that State banks will not be charged a new fee.\n  I especially thank the junior Senator from Delaware, Mr. Carper, for \nworking with me on this amendment. As a former Governor, he understands \nthe importance of state banks and their contribution to a healthy \nbanking system. I also thank the other cosponsors of this amendment, \nMr. Bennett, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Allard, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. \nGrassley, Mr. Miller, Ms. Collins, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Nickles, \nMr. Corzine, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Nelson.\n  The budget resolution before us assumes that the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Federal Reserve will impose new \nfees on state-chartered bank and bank holding companies. The amendment \nwe are offering will ensure that these new fees will not be assessed.\n  The proposal included in the budget would amount to a federal tax on \nstate-chartered entities that have already paid their state chartering \nagencies for the same service. In effect, these banks would be double-\ncharged, with no added benefit.\n  The dual-banking system, consisting of both state and national bank \ncharters, has served the United States and its communities well for \nmany years. The current fee structure is identical for state and \nnational banks. They both pay their chartering organization for their \nexaminations. They are also both subject to deposit insurance premiums \nassessed by the FDIC. Additional fees for state banks will not increase \nsafety and soundness.\n  Banks should have an option of a federal or state charter, depending \nupon their particular needs. The new fees assumed to be a part of the \nbudget resolution would reduce the attractiveness of state bank \ncharters, which traditionally have provided a lower-cost alternative to \nthe federal bank charter. The effect would be to drive up costs for \nboth banks and consumers.\n  Our amendment will help preserve the competitiveness of state-bank \ncharters and maintain the balance of the dual banking system. The \namendment would save state banks and bank holding companies \napproximately $2 billion over 10 years. It would allow these banks to \ninvest this money in their local communities, rather than paying a \ndiscriminatory fee.\n  The Congress has rejected new federal fees on state banks in each of \nthe previous seven budgets. The Senate Banking Committee has \nconsistently opposed this proposal. The major banking associations--the \nAmerican Bankers Association (ABA), the Independent Community Bankers \nof America (ICBA), America's Community Bankers (ACB), the Conference of \nState Bank Supervisors (CSBS) and the Financial Services Roundtable--\nhave all endorsed the amendment. In addition, the National Governor's \nAssociation and the National Conference of State Legislatures are \nsupporting the amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from the National Governor's \nAssociation and the correspondence from the banking associations be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    April 3, 2001.\n     To: Members of the U.S. Senate.\n     From: American Bankers Association, America's Community \n         Bankers, Conference of State Bank Supervisors, \n         Independent Community Bankers of America, The Financial \n         Services Roundtable.\n\n     Re: Support Enzi/Carper Amendment to Strike Bank Exam Fees \n         from Budget.\n\n       The FY 2002 budget that the Senate is expected to vote on \n     this week would require the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation (FDIC) and Federal Reserve Board (FRB) to charge \n     for their examinations of state-chartered banks and bank \n     holding companies. Similar language was also included in \n     seven Clinton Administration budgets, but was rejected by \n     Congress each time.\n       The above-noted national member organizations and trade \n     associations, representing all segments of the U.S. banking \n     industry, are united in opposition to this examination fee \n     requirement. It would impose an unfair, new tax on state-\n     chartered banks and bank holding companies, costing them over \n     $2 billion in the next ten years.\n       The FDIC and FRB have had authority to charge examination \n     fees since 1991, but they never have charged such fees and \n     are already financially healthy, self-funded entities. All \n     banking institutions already pay examination fees to their \n     chartering agencies (whether federal or state), as well as \n     deposit insurance premiums to the FDIC. Thus, imposing \n     examination fees on state-chartered banks and bank holding \n     companies would constitute a discriminatory, double fee \n     imposed on these entities simply on the basis of their \n     charter and/or organizational structure. It would also be a \n     threat to the balance of the dual banking system, which has \n     so well served this country by providing much needed \n     diversification to the U.S. economy.\n       Senate Banking Committee members Mike Enzi (R-Wyoming) and \n     Tom Carper (D-Delaware) will join together to offer an \n     amendment to strike the examination fees provision. The \n     above-noted parties urge you to support the Enzi/Carper \n     amendment. Just last week, the House of Representatives \n     rejected this new tax during its consideration of the budget. \n     Also, last month, the Senate Banking Committee informed the \n     Senate Budget Committee that it ``has consistently opposed'' \n     such new examination fees for many of the reasons noted \n     above. Finally, the proposal its quite simply at odds with \n     the Administration's overall tax reduction goals.\n       Please support the Enzi/Carper amendment to strike new \n     banking examination fees from the FY 2002 budget. We thank \n     you for your consideration of this important matter.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    April 4, 2000.\n     Senator Pete Domenici,\n     Chairman, Senate Budget Committee, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Senator Kent Conrad,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Budget Committee, U.S. Senate, Hart \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Domenici and Senator Conrad: On behalf of the \n     nation's Governors, we urge you to support Senator Enzi and \n     Senator Carper's amendment to strike the examination fee on \n     the state-chartered banks provision contained in H. Con. Res. \n     83, the Congressional Budget Resolution For FY2002. The \n     Governors oppose the imposition of the new fee on the basis \n     that it is discriminatory, costly, and a double fee on the \n     more than 6,000 state-chartered banks and holding \n     institutions in the U.S.\n       The new fee would only be assessed on state-chartered banks \n     and holding institutions impacting the competitiveness of our \n     dual banking system. The Governors strongly oppose any effort \n     that would penalize the state system for attempting to \n     develop high quality yet cost-effective operations.\n       The Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional \n     Budget Office have reported that the new fee would cost \n     state-chartered banks and holding institutions two billion \n     dollars over the next ten years. A new fee would also run \n     counter to the declining trend in bank regulatory fees. The \n     Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has slashed \n     deposit insurance premiums. The Office of Comptroller General \n     has also reduced supervisory fees. Congress rejected seven \n     budget proposals for the previous administration that \n     included these proposed fees.\n       Although the FDIC and the Federal Reserve Board have \n     existing authority to charge examination fees since 1991, \n     they\n\n[[Page S3641]]\n\n     have elected not to do so as they are financially healthy, \n     self-funded entities. All banking institutions, including \n     state-chartered banks, already pay examination fees to their \n     chartering agency to conduct examinations. The new fee would \n     not increase the number or quality of these examinations. The \n     fee would also penalize the economic efficiencies that state-\n     chartered banks have gained and are represented in declining \n     examination fees.\n       Thank you for considering our views on this important \n     matter. If the NGA can assist you in any manner on this \n     issue, please contact Frank J. Principi of the NGA staff at \n     202.624.7818.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gov. Mike Johanns,\n       Chair, Committee on Economic Development and Commerce.\n     Gov. Don Siegelman,\n       Vice Chair, Committee on Economic Development and Commerce.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, this budget resolution includes a proposal \nto require new Federal fees on State-chartered banks and bank holding \ncompanies. The amendment that I am offering with Senator Enzi would \nstrike these unnecessary and inequitable fees from the budget.\n  Currently, the exam fee structure for both federally and State-\nchartered banks is identical: federally chartered banks pay the Federal \nGovernment for their examinations, and State-chartered banks pay States \nfor theirs. Charging State-chartered banks a fee on top of what they \nalready pay does not increase safety and soundness or provide for \nadditional exams. These fees only increase the Federal fisc at the \nexpense of the State banking system.\n  We have seen State-chartered banks be engines of innovation. As a \nformer Governor, I believe this is one of the great values of our dual \nbanking system. Under this system, States and the Federal Government \nindependently charter and regulate financial institutions. A key \nbenefit of our dual banking system is that it provides for innovations \nat both the State and Federal level. In fact, State initiatives have \nspurred most advances in U.S. bank products and services. Everything \nfrom checking accounts to adjustable-rate mortgages, from electronic \nfunds transfers to the powers and structures endorsed by Gramm-Leach-\nBliley, originated at the State level. State-chartered banks also play \nan important role in credit availability and economic development. \nAdditional Federal fees for State banks would stifle the innovation \ntaking place at the State level. The very innovation which benefits all \nconsumers by providing competition and creativity in the marketplace.\n  On seven prior occasions, Congress has wisely rejected these Federal \nfee proposals. Last week, the House refused to include these fees in \nits budget resolution. The Senate Banking Committee also opposed these \nfees in its views to the Budget Committee. In addition, the American \nBankers Association, America's Community Bankers, the Conference of \nState Bank Supervisors, the Independent Community Bankers of America, \nthe Financial Services Roundtable, National Conference of State \nLegislatures, and the National Governors Association all oppose these \nnew fees on State-chartered institutions.\n  I urge you to support the dual banking system and vote for this \namendment to strike these harmful Federal fees.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Senator Gramm asked to address this issue for 30 \nseconds, and I ask unanimous consent he be permitted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as chairman of the Banking Committee, I \nsupport this amendment. Obviously, nothing in the proposal actually \nchanges banking law, it merely sets out budgetary assumptions. Broader \nissues are involved and I pledge to both authors of the amendment to \nhold hearings or otherwise deal with these broader issues. Given that \nunderstanding, I ask our colleagues to not force a rollcall vote so \nthat we can save that time and get on about our business.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. What is the pleasure of the Senator?\n  Mr. ENZI. Would the Senator accept a voice vote?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would ask for a voice vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Parliamentary inquiry. Have the yeas and nays been \nordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not been ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment, No. 284.\n  The amendment (No. 284) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 249\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Let me say to my colleagues, this is an amendment to add \nmoney back on behalf of Senator Lieberman, Senator Collins, and others, \nto the areas which we have already funded, to try to determine what we \ncan do to understand global warming better, to fund new technologies, \nand to fund the export of American products with respect to those \ntechnologies. There is no unauthorized plan in this. There is nothing \nregulatory in it. This has nothing whatever to do with Kyoto. It is all \npreauthorized, existing programs, which we bring back to a funding \nlevel which most people think is appropriate, $4.5 billion over 10 \nyears. It does not come out of the tax cut; it comes out of the \ncontingency funds. I hope on a bipartisan basis we could signal our \napproval of the efforts to continue to understand the impact of global \nclimate change on the technologies which can help us respond.\n  Mr. President, There is a world-wide consensus among climate \nscientists that global average temperature will rise over the next 100 \nyears if greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow. Scientists report \nthat some of the signs of this warming are already evident: the 90s was \nthe hottest decade on record; glaciers around the world are receding at \nrecord rates; 1,000 square miles of the Larsen ice shelf in Antarctica \nhave collapsed into the ocean; Arctic sea ice has thinned by 40 percent \nin only 20 years; and ocean temperatures throughout the world are \nrising. And scientists warn that the potential impacts of global \nwarming include the intensification of floods, storms and droughts; the \ndislocation of millions of people; the spread of tropical diseases; \ndestructive sea level rise; the die-off of species; the loss of \nforests, coral reefs and other ecosystems and other far reaching and \nadverse impacts.\n\n  To address the threat of global warming, the U.S. has invested in a \nrange of programs aimed at understanding the global climate, reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants, saving energy and money, \nspurring innovation in energy technologies, and sequestering carbon. At \nthe same time, we have engaged internationally to encourage the global \nuse of clean energy technologies developed and manufactured here in the \nU.S. and to craft an international solution to the threat of climate \nchange. Unfortunately, overall\n\n[[Page S3643]]\n\nfunding levels in the Bush budget proposal and press reports of \nAdministration budgeting plans make clear that these important programs \nare facing drastic cuts--cuts that could cripple even these minimal \nefforts to understand and mitigate climate change. The Climate Change \nAmendment increases budget authority by $4.5 billion over 10 years to \nmake up for anticipated cuts to these essential programs. The increased \nbudget authority in the amendment is offset by an equal reduction in \nthe proposed Bush tax cut that amounts to a mere three-tenths of 1 \npercent of the overall tax cut.\n  The Climate Change Amendment provides additional budget authority of \n$4.5 billion over 10 years. It is offset by a reduction in the Bush tax \ncut of three-tenths of 1 percent. The additional budget authority is \nallocated to essential programs described below.\n  International Affairs--Function 150: The amendment increases budget \nauthority by $500 million for 10 years. The increase is to offset cuts \nto the Global Environment Facility, USAID, State Department offices \nengaged in international negotiations on climate change and related \nprograms. The GEF forges international cooperation to address critical \nthreats to the global environment, including climate change but \nproviding financial and technical assistance primarily in developing \nnations. USAID programs accelerate the development and deployment of \nclean energy technologies around the world and assist U.S. \nmanufacturers in establishing a position in a clean energy market that \nit expect to total $5 trillion over the next 20 years. Additional \nauthority for the State Department is to ensure that the budget \nincludes sufficient funding for the U.S. to fully engage with the \ninternational community in on-going and highly complex negotiations \npursuant to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.\n\n  Science, Space and Technology--Function 250: The amendment increases \nbudget authority by $500 million over 10 years. The increase is to \noffset cuts to programs like the United States Global Change Research \nProgram and similar efforts that provide basic and essential research \ninto the global climate system and how pollution may be impacting it. \nThe program is working to improve climate observations and our \nunderstanding of the global water cycle, ecosystem changes and the \ncarbon cycle. It is a multi-agency effort that draws on the expertise \nof USDA, NASA, Energy, NOAA and other agencies. This research is \nfundamental to understanding and responding to the threat of global \nwarming.\n  Energy--Function 270: The amendment increases budget authority by $2 \nbillion over 10 years. The increase is to offset cuts in energy \nefficiency, renewable energy and other programs at the Department of \nEnergy that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save consumers money. \nThese programs are the cornerstone of the U.S. effort to produce clean \nenergy through technological innovation. They include the research, \ndevelopment and deployment of solar, wind, biomass, geothermal and \nother renewable power and technologies that will increase efficiency \nand reduce pollution from fossil fuel energy sources. The increased \nauthority will also offset cuts to energy efficiency programs that cut \nenergy use, reduce pollution and save consumers money. These programs \nalso strengthen U.S. energy security by reducing demand and increasing \nclean domestic energy production.\n  Natural Resources--Function 300: The amendment increases budget \nauthority by $1 billion over 10 years. The increase is to offset cuts \nin a range of programs that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, save \nenergy and provide essential research. The Environmental Protection \nAgency has established several successful, incentive-based, non-\nregulatory programs to reduce emissions and save money, such as the \nEnergyStar labeling program for products ranging from computers to \nrefrigerators. Similar programs achieve emissions reductions through \nincreased building efficiency, business-wide efficiency gains and \nincreased transportation efficiency. Also included in this increased \nbudget authority is funding to offset cuts to the US Forest Service and \nNOAA programs investigating carbon sequestration and basic research \ninto the global climate.\n  Agriculture--Function 350: The amendment increases budget authority \nby $450 million over 10 years. The increase is to offset cuts to \nprograms that develop technologies that can produce energy from \nswitchgrass, agricultural waste, timber waste and other biomass. These \nbioenergy technologies produce very low or no net greenhouse gas \nemissions and provide a market for U.S. farm products. Also offset are \ncuts to USDA programs studying how different farming practices and \nfarmland conservation can increase carbon sequestration and reduce \natmospheric concentrations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are trying to work on this issue for \na couple of minutes. It will not take us long. I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask Senator Jeffords be added as a \ncosponsor, as well as Senators Lieberman, Reid, Bingaman, Landrieu, \nCantwell, Biden, Kennedy, Feinstein, Murray, Leahy, and Collins.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I understand the primary sponsor and those cosponsoring \nit will accept a voice vote. Is that the case?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Massachusetts has been here all week \nworking on this amendment. It is one of the most important issues we \nhave taken up all week. The Senator from Massachusetts and the Senator \nfrom Maine should be complimented for their brilliant work on this \npiece of legislation.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the \namendment sponsored by my distinguished colleagues from Massachusetts \nand Maine to ensure full funding of all Federal programs aimed at \naddressing a growing and increasingly troubling international problem, \nglobal warming.\n  If left unchecked, global warming has the potential to dramatically \nalter life as we know it, leaving our children and grandchildren to \ninherit a planet suffering from all manner of ailments. While we cannot \nknow precisely how dramatic these changes may be over time, recent \nscience paints a rather bleak picture of what we can expect to happen. \nThe implication to act now could not be more clear. Yet the Bush \nAdministration has inexplicably withdrawn its support for almost all of \nthe initiatives, both domestic and international, to begin to nurse our \nplanet back to health. We must not let this happen. This amendment \nwould ensure that those initiatives are properly funded.\n  Over the last three months, the United Nation's Intergovernmental \nPanel on Climate Change, or the IPCC, released its third report on \nglobal warming. The report was authored by over 700 expert scientists.\n  According to these experts, unless we find ways to stop global \nwarming, the Earth's average temperature can be expected to rise \nbetween 2.5 and 10.4 degrees Fahrenheit during this next century. Such \na large, rapid rise in temperature will profoundly alter the Earth's \nlandscape in very real and consequential terms. Sea levels could swell \nup to 35 feet, potentially submerging millions of homes and coastal \nproperty under our present-day oceans. Precipitation would become more \nerratic, leading to droughts that would make hunger an even more \nserious global problem than it is today. Diseases such as malaria and \ndengue fever could spread at an accelerated pace. Severe weather \ndisturbances and storms triggered by climatic phenomena, such as El \nNino, would be aggravated by global warming and become more routine.\n  This new data should end serious debate about whether global warming \nis a fact. The science is now inconvertible.\n\n[[Page S3644]]\n\nThe only thing left to do is debate and decide how we should respond, \nnot if we should.\n  As the latest scientific report reminds us, this threat is being \ndriven by our own behavior. Let me quote the scientists directly, \n``There is new and stronger evidence that most of the warming observed \nover the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.'' Mr. \nPresident, human beings have added more than three billion metric tons \nof carbon to the atmosphere every year for the past two decades. More \namazing, and more disturbing, is the fact that current levels of carbon \ndioxide are likely the highest they have been in 20 million years of \nhistory and 31 percent higher than those present in 1750.\n  Faced with these findings, President Bush has said that he ``takes \nthe issue of global warming very seriously.'' Unfortunately, his recent \nacts contradict his statement. In fact, it appears that the only \ncooling of the globe that will occur under President Bush is the \ncooling of our foreign relations.\n  I was deeply disappointed last month when the President reneged on \nhis campaign pledge to regulate carbon dioxide emissions from power \nplants. Just last week, the Bush Administration unilaterally also \nannounced, without consultation with Congress and apparently without \nregard for our interests abroad, that it had ``no interest in \nimplementing'' the Kyoto Protocol. In doing so, they did not just back \naway from the United States' signature on an international agreement; \nthey backed away from the international process that resulted in the \naccord. Finally, while we do not yet have the exact numbers of the \nPresident's budget, it appears that he plans to significantly cut a \nnumber of the programs aimed at reducing greenhouse emissions \ndomestically and overseas.\n  Most troubling are the reductions in the budgets of the Nation's \nenergy efficiency programs and the funding for USAID's program to \nencourage developing countries to reduce emissions. How can the White \nHouse justify walking away from the Kyoto Protocol because of \ninadequate participation by developing countries when they are cutting \nthe chief U.S. program aimed at securing that participation?\n  Global warming is a real threat to us, our children, and our \ngrandchildren. We must demonstrate leadership and confront it now. This \namendment will fund the programs we have to provide that leadership. We \nmust pass it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 249), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 238\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Harkin and myself, I \ncall up amendment 238.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for himself and Mr. \n     Harkin, proposes an amendment numbered 238.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Those programs to help acquire bulletproof \nvests, reduce DNA backlogs, encourage modern communications, provide \nmodern crime labs, and place cops on the beat have been so helpful to \nour crime control efforts.\n  Under Attorney General Reno, and due in part to her emphasis on a \ncoordinated effort with State and local law enforcement, crime rates \nfell in each of the past 8 years. Violent crimes, including murder and \nrape, have been reduced to the lowest levels in decades, since before \nthe Reagan Administration. In fact, the national rate of violent crime \nis at its lowest level since 1978.\n  We need to redouble our efforts, not cut them short or leave them \nshort of funds.\n  Unfortunately, President Bush's budget highlights in his ``Blueprint \nfor New Beginnings'' appears to call for cutting federal assistance to \nState and local law enforcement by 30 percent--by ``redirecting'' $1.5 \nbillion in Department of Justice programs for state and local law \nenforcement assistance.\n  This is quite troubling.\n  In addition, this budget resolution cuts $7.5 billion in Department \nof Justice funding over the next 5 years when compared to the \nCongressional Budget Office baseline. Over the next 10 years, this \nbudget resolution cuts $19 billion in Department of Justice funding \nwhen compared to the CBO baseline.\n  Why does this budget resolution cut funding for the Department of \nJustice?\n  With school shootings continuing across the country and the use of \nheroin, methamphetamine and other dangerous drugs in rural and urban \nsettings, now is not the time to be ``redirecting'' $1.5 million away \nfrom federal assistance to State and local law enforcement.\n  Now is not the time to be pulling back from the strong national \ncommitment we should be making to continue to assist those on the front \nlines in the fight against crime and battle over illegal drug use.\n  The success in reducing serious crime and violent crime across the \nnation is due in large part to the crime-fighting partnership between \nthe Department of Justice and state and local law enforcement agencies, \nwhich benefits from Department of Justice state and local law \nenforcement assistance.\n  We should all remember the bipartisan success stories that make up \nthe Department of Justice's state and local law enforcement assistance \nprograms.\n  For example, last year, Congress appropriated $60 million to the Boys \nand Girls Clubs of America for grants to Boys and Girls Clubs across \nthe nation within the Department of Justice's programs for state and \nlocal law enforcement assistance. In Vermont and every other state in \nthe nation, Boys and Girls Clubs are a great and growing success in \npreventing crime and supporting our children.\n  In FY 2001, Congress appropriated $523 million for the Local Law \nEnforcement Block Grant Program within the Department of Justice's \nprograms for state and local law enforcement assistance programs.\n  Republicans and Democrats support this essential block grant for law \nenforcement equipment and other needs for state and local police \ndepartments.\n  The Department of Justice's programs for state and local law \nenforcement assistance include the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant \nProgram. Senator Campbell and I authored the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Act in 1998.\n  In its first two years of operation, this program funded more than \n325,000 new bulletproof vests for our nation's police officers, \nincluding more than 536 vests for Vermont law enforcement officers.\n  In FY 2001, Congress appropriated $569 million for the Edward Byrne \nMemorial State and Local Assistance Program for Byrne discretionary and \nformula grants within the Department of Justice's programs for state \nand local law enforcement assistance programs.\n  In Vermont, the Department of Public Safety receives about $2 million \nin Byrne grant funding a year to maintain the Vermont Drug Task Force \nto combat heroin and other illegal drugs. Byrne grants fund drug task \nforces in many other states as well.\n  The Department of Justice's programs for state and local law \nenforcement assistance also include such proven crime-fighting and \ndrug-prevention programs as the Violent Offender Incarceration Prison \nGrant Program; Truth-In-Sentencing Incentive Prison Grant Program; \nJuvenile Accountability Incentive Block Grant Program; COPS Program; \nViolence Against Women Act; Crime Identification Technology Act; and \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Programs.\n  Moreover, this year's budget request for Department of Justice state \nand local law enforcement assistance should include new bipartisan \ncrime-fighting programs that Congress passed last year. In 2000, on a \nbipartisan basis, the Senate and House passed the Computer Crime \nEnforcement Act, the DNA Analysis Backlog Elimination Act and the Paul \nCoverdell National Forensic Science Improvement Act.\n  These Department of Justice programs are needed to support our \nnation's police officers.\n  Mr. President, I urge the Senate to adopt the Leahy-Harkin amendment \nto increase funding by $1.5 billion for the 2002 fiscal year for the \nDepartment of Justice programs for state and local law enforcement \nassistance.\n  I yield to my friend from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, these are the programs that go right down \nto our local cops on the beat in our towns and communities all over \nAmerica, especially the Byrne grant program, which has done much in my \nState and in the upper Midwest to fight the methamphetamine plague that \nhas surged all over this country. The Bush budget cuts it out--a $1.5 \nbillion shortfall. The Leahy amendment puts that money back to help \nsupport local law enforcement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I say to the distinguished Senators who offered the \namendment, I think their intentions are wonderful, but essentially all \nwe are doing is adding more money to the appropriated accounts. No \nmatter what anybody says it is going to be used for, it will not be \nused for that; it will be used for what the appropriators say.\n  With that in mind, we accept the amendment if they do not insist on a \nvote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Minnesota be \nadded as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 238) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are going to try to take up six \namendments here--three on our side, three on their side. They do not \naffect the appropriations, total appropriations, because they are \noffset within the budget, each one, for the amount that is being \nsought.\n  Can we proceed with Senator Smith, No. 217, in that regard? Is there \nobjection to that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have no objection to Smith amendment No. 217.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 217\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n\n[[Page S3646]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oregon [Mr. Smith] for himself, Mrs. \n     Clinton, Mrs. Snowe, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Sarbanes, proposes \n     and amendment numbered 217.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To protect public health, to improve water quality in the \n   nation's rivers and lakes, at the nation's beaches, and along the \n nation's coasts, to promote endangered species recovery, and to work \ntowards meeting the nation's extensive wastewater infrastructure needs \nby increasing funding for wastewater infrastructure in fiscal year 2002 \n  in an amount that will allow funding for the State water pollution \n control revolving funds at an amount equal to the amount appropriated \n   in fiscal year 2001 and to fully fund grants to address municipal \n              combined sewer and sanitary sewer overflows)\n\n       On page 17, line 23 increase the amount by $800,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 24 increase the amount by $800,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 15 decrease the amount by $800,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 16 decrease the amount by $800,000,000.\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with my \ncolleagues, Senators Smith of Oregon, Collins, Snowe, Sarbanes and Bayh \nto provide additional funding that will help meet our Nation's critical \nwastewater infrastructure needs.\n  Specifically, this amendment provides an additional $800 million in \nfiscal year 2002 for grants for wastewater infrastructure projects, \nincluding $50 million for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and $750 \nmillion to fully fund the new grant program authorized under the Wet \nWeather Water Quality Act of 2000.\n  These new grants will help municipalities address one of our largest \nremaining water quality challenges, combined and sanitary sewer \noverflows. Sewer overflows remain the leading cause of beach closures \nacross the country, putting public health at risk and robbing \ncommunities of millions of tourism dollars annually.\n  This is a real problem in New York where so many cities, big and \nsmall, are confronted with pipe and equipment failures or have \nundersized systems that can't meet the increased demands of their \ngrowing populations. according to EPA's most recent estimates, there is \na 20-year need of $139 billion for wastewater infrastructure \nnationwide. And this doesn't even account for the funding needed to \nadequately address the sanitary sewer overflows problems facing our \ncommunities.\n  This amendment is an important first step towards meeting our \ncountry's enormous water infrastructure needs. This amendment will \nensure that our beaches are safer for swimming. And it will lead to \nsignificant improvements in the quality of the Nation's rivers, lakes, \nbays and estuaries.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an \namendment to the Senate Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2002. This \namendment will increase the amount available to fully fund the sewer \noverflow control grants program at a level of $750 million for FY2002. \nIt is important that Congress makes this level of commitment to clean \nwater for a number of reasons.\n  The condition of our nation's wastewater collection and treatment \nfacilities is alarming. In its 1996 ``Clean Water Needs Survey,'' the \nEPA estimates that nearly $140 billion will be needed over the next 20 \nyears to address wastewater infrastructure problems in our communities. \nIn March 1999, the EPA revised its figures, infrastructure needs are \nnow estimated at $200 billion. Other independent studies indicate that \nEPA has undershot the mark, estimating that these unmet needs exceed \n$300 billion over 20 years.\n  In my state of Oregon, the challenge of municipal water treatment is \never-present. Roughly seventy percent of Oregon's population lives in \nthe Willamette River watershed, with that number continuing to grow. \nThe increasing demand on water supply and treatment is made even more \nacute by the responsibility to protect endangered salmon and steelhead \nin the Willamette River. Add to that the extremely low water and poor \nsnowpack conditions facing the Northwest this year, and the urgency of \nmaintaining high water quality in the river is greatly intensified.\n  The city of Portland is Oregon's largest, and its proximity to the \nWillamette River has been a contributor to water quality problems. At \nits worst, Portland's combined sewage overflow system dumped an \nestimated 10 billion gallons of combined sewage annually into the river \nin years past. During the past 7 years, however, Portland has invested \nover $300 million in clean water infrastructure, and will spend another \n$300 million in the next 5 years to meet its obligations under the \nClean Water Act. I am working closely with the City of Portland to \ninfuse targeted federal funds into its unique efforts to meet rigorous \nenvironmental requirements and responsibilities.\n  I am sponsoring this amendment because I strongly believe that \nCongress must make a firm commitment to helping cities like Portland, \nOR that are fully engaged in updating and improving their water \ntreatment programs. The effects of such a commitment will be manifold, \nparticularly upon a river like the Willamette that is long treasured, \nbut heavily used by the many that derive their lives and livelihood \nfrom it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 217) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, could we have order in the Chamber?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be order in the Chamber, please. \nSenators please take your seats.\n  Is this a motion to vote on these amendments en bloc or separately?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If the Senator is willing, I would like to do them en \nbloc.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We would be willing to do them en bloc as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me go back to the chairman for the next amendment \nthat would be in this en bloc group.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Have we accepted 217?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We have accepted 217.\n\n\n          Amendments Nos. 334, 236, 196, 244, and 335, en bloc\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The five amendments I ask be called up and then be \nconsidered en bloc for voice vote are Inhofe No. 334, DeWine No. 236, \nDorgan No. 196, Mikulski No. 244, and Nelson of Florida No. 335.\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 334\n\n      (Purpose: To increase Impact Aid funding to $1,293,302,000)\n\n       On page 27, line 3, increase the amount by $300,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 4, increase the amount by $150,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 8, increase the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 12, increase the amount by $50,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 15, decrease the amount by $300,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 16, decrease the amount by $150,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, decrease the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 9, decrease the amount by $50,000,000.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                           amendment no. 236\n\n  (Purpose: To provide additional funding for the United States Coast \n                    Guard for the fiscal year 2002)\n\n       On page 23, line 11, increase the amount by $250,000,000.\n       On page 23, line 12, increase the amount by $250,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 15, decrease the amount by $250,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 16, decrease the amount by $250,000,000.\n       At the end of the amendment, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   .

Mr. President, I call up amendment number 244 on behalf \nof myself and my cosponsors--Senators Bingaman, Boxer, Kennedy, Levin, \nand Sarbanes. My amendment is very simple: it provides $1.5 billion \nannually for education technology programs, and will be offset by a \nreduction in the tax cut. It will give every American child a ``digital \nopportunity ladder'' to climb to success, as well as help every child \nto be computer literate by the 6th grade, regardless of race, \nethnicity, income, gender, geography, or disability.\n  My amendment does 3 things: it provides $1 billion a year for \nconsolidated education technology programs, which will go to states \nbased on formula grants. Schools could use these funds for almost any \ntechnology-related activity: wiring, hardware, software, training, \nmaintenance or repair.\n  Second, my amendment doubles teacher training funds by adding $400 \nmillion, per year for the next ten years. Teachers want to help their \nstudents cross the digital divide but less than 20 percent of them feel \nconfident using technology in their daily lesson plans. Technology \nwithout training is a hollow opportunity.\n  Finally, my amendment also provides $100 million to create one \nthousand community technology centers. Community technology centers are \nnecessary because kids don't just learn in school--they also learn in \ntheir communities. Technology centers make it easier for children to do \ntheir homework or to surf the web under adult supervision, and also \nmake it easier for parents to upgrade their skills or write a resume.\n  The opportunities here are tremendous: to use technology to improve \nour lives, to use technology to remove barriers such as income, race, \nethnicity, or geography. Every student in America should have access to \na digital opportunity ladder. My amendment does that and I urge my \ncolleagues' support.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 236\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Budget Committee, Senators Domenici and Conrad, for working with \nme, Senator Graham from Florida, Senator Snowe from Maine, and so many \nothers in support of our amendment that would provide additional \nassistance for one of our most important agencies, the U.S. Coast \nGuard.\n  The amendment we have offered would provide an additional $250 \nmillion increase in Coast Guard operating expenses above the fiscal \nyear 2002 level recommended by the President. The House has included \nthis $250 million increase in its budget resolution, and I am pleased \nthat the Senate will do the same.\n  Over the past few years, our Coast Guard has faced significant \nfunding shortfalls, which are directly impacting its operations on an \nannual basis. Additional funding, would eliminate Coast Guard vessel \nand aircraft spare parts problems, improve personnel training, fund new \nDepartment of Defense entitlements, and run drug interdiction \noperations at optimal levels.\n  Because of funding shortfalls in the Fiscal Year 2001 budget, the \nCoast Guard has been forced to reduce operations by 10 percent in the \nsecond quarter of this year. If funding shortfalls go unaddressed, the \nCoast Guard anticipates cutting operations by 30 percent in the third \nand fourth quarters. To address budget shortfalls and restore vital \noperations, the Coast Guard has requested $91 million in supplemental \nfunding from the Office of Management and Budget.\n  The same thing happened last year. The Coast Guard was forced to \nreduce operations by 30 percent last summer, and Congress again had to \ncome to the rescue with $77 million in supplemental operating funding.\n  The Coast Guard has developed an unhealthy budgetary dependence on \nemergency supplementals to pay for normal ongoing mission operations. \nThe recent enactment of two successive Defense Authorization bills, \nwhich increased personnel costs dramatically, has exacerbated the Coast \nGuard's funding problems even further. These bills mandated pay raises, \nnew medical entitlements, recruiting and retention incentives, and \nother entitlements that far exceeded what was appropriated in the \nTransportation Appropriations Bill for the Coast Guard.\n  The money to fund these initiatives doesn't just magically appear. It \nmust come from someplace. And, what usually happens is that the Coast \nGuard either absorbs these costs directly from within its own budget, \ncreating service-related cutbacks, or it simply doesn't match benefits \nprovided to other defense personnel. Neither scenario is ideal, and in \nthe end, it is the Coast Guard personnel who lose.\n  The Coast Guard is reaching the point where it is stretched so thin \nand the condition of its equipment is so poor that it is essentially \ncannibalizing equipment for parts, deferring maintenance, and working \nits people overtime--and this is just to sustain daily operations. This \ndoesn't even take into account rapidly rising fuel costs, which have \nbeen exacerbating problems this fiscal year.\n  We need to provide the Coast Guard with the resources necessary to \nrestore normal operations through the normal budget and appropriations \nprocess. We need to adequately fund the Coast Guard on an annual basis \nso the American people can have the services that they not only expect, \nbut require from our Coast Guard.\n  Drug interdiction is one of those services and one of our Coast \nGuard's most important missions. As my colleagues all know, the scourge \nof drugs is a national and international challenge that threatens our \ncommunities here at home, as well as many fragile democracies in the \nCaribbean and South and Central America.\n  I am very pleased to report, however, that with the help of \nadditional funding provided by the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination \nAct, WHDEA, which my dear friend, the late Senator Coverdell and \nSenators Grassley, Graham, and I sponsored, our Coast Guard has \nincreased cocaine seizures by an astounding 60 percent over the last \ntwo years.\n  As my colleagues may recall, we passed the Western Hemisphere Drug \nElimination Act as part of the Fiscal Year 1999 Omnibus Appropriations \nBill. Through this legislation, we were able to allocate an additional \n$844 million to upgrade U.S. counter-drug and interdiction programs. \nOut of this funding, the Coast Guard received $276 million. Since \nreceiving this added investment, our Coast Guard went from seizing \n82,623 pounds of cocaine in Fiscal Year 1998 to seizing 132,800 pounds \nin Fiscal Year 2000 at an estimated street value of over $4 billion. \nThat amount represents the value of nearly the entire Coast Guard \nannual budget.\n  With adequate resources, this is the kind of success we can expect \nbecause we are able to level the playing field with the drug smugglers. \nIn other words, the drug smugglers in the past have had the upper hand \nin terms of technology and resources to transport drugs into the United \nStates. By giving the Coast Guard additional funding, we are giving \nthem the means to fight against the drug traffickers, and the means to \nbeat them.\n  Resources allow the Coast Guard to seek innovative solutions to \nimprove the efficiency of counter-drug operations in drug transit \nzones. Take for example, Operation New Frontier, which was conducted \nmainly in the Western Caribbean (Windward Passage, off of Haiti, \nJamaica, and Colombia), and tested the concept of the Coast Guard's \n``use of force'' helicopters and used Over-the-Horizon cutter boats to \nsuccessfully seize six ``go-fast'' drug-smuggling vessels in six \nattempts. This\n\n[[Page S3649]]\n\nis an unprecedented success rate. Similarly, the Coast Guard's \nDeployable Pursuit Boats, DPBs, high-speed, 38-foot, 840-horsepower \nfiberglass boats--have been operating as another tool to stem the \nthreat posed by drug smugglers' ``go-fast'' boats.\n  But unfortunately, despite recent successes, the fact is that we need \nto do more to help our Coast Guard in the long-term. Past funding \nshortfalls for the Coast Guard have had negative impacts on its \noperations. We need to do more. We need to make sure that every year \nour Coast Guard receives the funds it needs to continue its high level \nof service and necessary counter-drug operations.\n  The Coast Guard must be able to perform routine and emergency \noperations, while still providing vital training and maintenance \nfunctions. The Coast Guard must do this within their annual budget and \nwithout placing an unreasonable workload on its people.\n  I stand ready to continue working with my colleagues to make sure our \nCoast Guard has the funding and the support to meet its missions now \nand well into the future.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 244\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, my amendment is very simple: it provides \n$1.5 billion annually for education technology programs, and will be \noffset by a reduction in the tax cut.

My amendment does that and I urge my \ncolleagues' support.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 335\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, 2 years ago following an \nindepth study requested by Congress, the National Academy of Sciences \nrecommended we reduce the level of arsenic in drinking water by a \nsignificant amount.\n  This is the standard that was, in fact, required in a rule issued by \nthe previous administration, but one that the present administration \nabruptly overturned last month.\n  In response, I have filed legislation that aims to impose the safer \nstandard of having 80 percent less arsenic in our drinking water than \nthe Bush administration would allow.\n  I believe this is a step needed to protect consumers, children and \nour environment. Better safe than sorry is a good rule in such matters.\n  This amendment would provide first-year funding of $43 million the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency says is needed for smaller cities to be \nable to improve water systems.\n  This amendment is needed to ensure that cost doesn't prevent public \nwater systems from providing safe, clean drinking water.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an amendment \noffered by myself and Senator Mikulski.\n  Today, teachers expend significant money out of their own pocket to \nbetter the education of our children. Most typically, our teachers are \nspending money out of their own pocket on three types of expenses: \neducation expenses brought into the classroom--such as books, supplies, \npens, paper, and computer equipment; professional development \nexpenses--such as tuition, fees, books, and supplies associated with \ncourses that help our teachers become even better instructors; and \ninterest paid by the teacher for previously incurred higher education \nloans.\n  These out-of-pocket costs placed on the backs of our teachers are but \none reason our teachers are leaving the profession, and why this \ncountry is in the midst of a teacher shortage.\n  Therefore, I introduced The Teacher Tax Credit. This legislation \ncreates a $1,000 tax credit for eligible teachers for qualified \neducation expenses, qualified professional development expenses, and \ninterest paid by the teacher during the taxable year on any qualified \neducation loan.\n  This legislation, S. 225, is cosponsored by Senators Mikulski, Allen, \nDeWine, Cochran, and Harkin. It is supported by the National Education \nAssociation.\n  We all agree that our education system must ensure that no child is \nleft behind. As we move towards education reforms to achieve this goal, \nwe must keep in mind the other component in our education system--the \nteachers.\n  This amendment to the budget resolution will set a reserve fund of \n$39.5 billion over the next 10 years to reimburse teachers for these \nout-of-pocket costs. Teachers will benefit and our children will \nbenefit as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. On this side we agree and support all of those amendments \nen bloc and ask our colleagues' support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 334, 236, 196, 244, 335) en bloc were agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will please call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, last night we called up amendment No. \n237, the Grassley amendment. We agreed to it and then withdrew it. It \nhas now been corrected technically. It was agreed to last night, and we \nask that it now be agreed to without a vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator describes correctly what \nhappened last night. This is a Grassley-Kennedy amendment. It has been \ncleared on both sides. We ask again the support of our colleagues. It \nwas a technical glitch last night that has been corrected.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 237, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will please \nreport the amendment as modified.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. \n     Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 237, as modified.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To establish a reserve fund for the Family Opportunity Act)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. RESERVE FUND FOR FAMILY OPPORTUNITY ACT.\n\n       If the Committee on Finance of the Senate reports a bill or \n     joint resolution which provides States with the opportunity \n     to expand medicaid coverage for children with special needs, \n     allowing families of disabled children with the opportunity \n     to purchase coverage under the medicaid program for such \n     children (commonly referred to as the ``Family Opportunity \n     Act of 2001''), the Chairman of the Committee on the Budget \n     of the Senate may revise committee allocations for the \n     Committee on Finance and other appropriate budgetary \n     aggregates and allocations of new budget authority (and the \n     outlays resulting therefrom) in this resolution by the amount \n     provided by that measure for that purpose, but not to exceed \n     $200,000,000 in new budget authority and outlays for fiscal \n     year 2002 and $7,900,000,000 in new budget authority and \n     outlays for the period of fiscal years 2002\n\n[[Page S3650]]\n\n     through 2011, subject to the condition that such legislation \n     will not, when taken together with all other previously-\n     enacted legislation, reduce the on-budget surplus below the \n     level of the Medicare Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund \n     surplus in any fiscal year covered by this resolution.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I would like to express some concerns I \nhave regarding the Family Opportunity Act. I agree with Chairman \nGrassley's position that it is critically important to make sure that \nour federal safety net programs do not create disadvantages for \nfamilies to work and therefore earn their way off federal assistance. \nHe has made the argument that it is wrong that families, who are \ncurrently served by public programs such as Supplemental Security \nIncome, must decline promotions and raises which would improve their \nsituation for fear of losing their health care coverage. I agree and \nwill support an effort to address these inequities and help those \nfamilies move off of federal programs. The legislation currently \ncontemplated by Senators Grassley and Kennedy does not simply remove \nthe work disincentive in SSI. In fact, the legislation applies to \nfamilies who have never been on SSI nor would ever qualify for SSI. \nThis legislation would open up Medicaid to a family who earns up to \n$51,000 for a family of four.\n  In this situation, these families would be competing against families \nwho do qualify for SSI and are currently waiting, in some cases, up to \n900 days to simply get on the program they desperately need. These are \nthe poorest of the poor. They are the people for whom this program was \ndesigned but they are not being served effectively. In my opinion it is \nunacceptable to punish lower income Medicaid eligible persons presently \nwaiting for needed assistance. There are many of us who would wonder \nabout adding more applicants who would not be receiving the SSI benefit \nbut rather just the certification for this Medicaid expansion to an \noverburdened system.\n  In recent years, we have seen a series of rifle shot expansions to \nthe Medicaid program based on specific disease categories or groups. I \nam concerned that those expansions are not consistent with the \nintention of the program and undermine its purpose. It would be my hope \nthat we could address these issues in the broader context of Medicaid \nreform and that the Finance Committee could responsibly evaluate any \nnew federal entitlements to ensure that we are not duplicating existing \nhealth programs like SCHIP or discouraging private employer insurance.\n  This country has 43 million uninsured Americans. This bill, which \ncosts $7.9 billion, impacts 200,000 kids; 60,000 of whom have, or have \naccess to, employer sponsored insurance and many of whom have access to \nSCHIP as well. It is a higher priority to provide health care to the \nuninsured with no health options than to create multiple health \ninsurance options for a select population.\n  I do commend Chairman Grassley for his hard work with Senator Kennedy \non this bill. I know that they have been working on this program for a \nnumber of years now and hope we can work together in this process \ntoward a final bill. I look forward to working with the chairman and \nothers on the committee to ensure this bill addresses the issue it was \ndesigned to fix.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We yield back any time in favor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 237), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I wish to announce to everyone that we \nare down to three amendments on our side. There are a few more than \nthat on the other side. I wonder if we could have just a little bit of \ntime. I think it would permit us to work out a number of these. I am \ngoing to put in a quorum call. I think it might last as long as 10 or \n15 minutes for those who are interested.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. First, I want to say to the Senate, we are getting very \nclose. We only have about four amendments on each side. We think we can \nwork them out. And if not, we would not have more than three or four \nvotes on what we have remaining. We need some time to work on modifying \nthese amendments to make them acceptable, in most cases. So we can do \nthat properly, we need until about 12:30. We have consulted with the \nleadership. I ask unanimous consent that we now stand in recess until \n12:30.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the chairman of the committee describes it \nvery well. We have worked through a lot of amendments. We still have \nsome outstanding that will require some additional staff time. Also, we \nneed to do a careful analysis of where we are in terms of spending, \nwhere we are on a year-by-year basis. This additional time will help us \ndo that final analysis so Senators, when we are voting on a final \npackage, will have a very accurate picture of where we are in terms of \nthe tax cut, in terms of spending, and in terms of debt reduction.\n  We hope we can take this time and then come back and finish our \nbusiness expeditiously.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have a question for either of the managers. My \nunderstanding is that we have a Senator who will not be back until \n2:30. Is that affecting our voting schedule?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. From what I can tell, we need the time now to do some \nwork. We can't move ahead with any dispatch now. We would like this \ntime to work on it. There is no outside reason for this. It is our \nreason, internal to our work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3650-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have been working diligently to get a \nseries of amendments we can accept. We are operating on the premise \nthat any of the amendments that were offered either from our side or \nthe other side--that they be budget neutral in the language that is \nused to formulate them.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 214, as modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify \namendment No. 214 offered by Senator Collins.\n  I send the amendment, as modified, to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Ms. \n     Collins, for herself, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Daschle, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 214, as modified.\n\n  The amendment, as modified, reads as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for a reserve fund for veterans' education)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n[[Page S3651]]\n\n     SEC.   . RESERVE FUND FOR VETERANS' EDUCATION.\n\n       If the Committee on Veterans' Affairs of the House or the \n     Senate reports a bill that increases the basic monthly \n     benefit under the Montgomery G.I. Bill to reflect the \n     increasing cost of higher education, the Chairman of the \n     Committee on the Budget of the House or Senate, as \n     applicable, may increase the allocation of new budget \n     authority and outlays to such committee by the amount of new \n     budget authority (and the outlays resulting therefrom) \n     provided by that measure for that purpose not to exceed \n     $775,000,000 in new budget authority and outlays for fiscal \n     year 2002, $4,300,000,000 in new budget authority and outlays \n     for the period of fiscal years 2002 through 2006, and \n     $9,900,000,000 in new budget authority and outlays for the \n     period of fiscal years 2002 through 2011, subject to the \n     condition that such legislation will not, when taken together \n     with all other previously enacted legislation, reduce the on-\n     budget surplus below the level of the Medicare Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund surplus in any fiscal years covered by \n     this resolution.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nwill create a reserve fund for the improvement of veterans' education \nbenefits under the Montgomery GI bill. I am delighted to be joined by \nmy friend and colleague, Senator Johnson, in this effort.\n  This amendment will set aside funding for S. 131, the Veterans' \nHigher Education Opportunities Act, which Senator Johnson and I \nintroduced earlier this year. Our legislation would provide a much-\nneeded increase in the basic monthly benefit under the GI bill, a \nbenefit that over the past 15 years has failed to keep pace with the \never-increasing cost of higher education.\n  Our legislation is very simple. It establishes a benchmark by which \nthe basic Montgomery GI bill benefit will be calculated, allowing the \nbenefit to increase as the cost of higher education increases. Endorsed \nby the Partnership for Veterans Education, a broad coalition including \nover 40 veterans service organizations and education associations, our \nlegislation provides a new model for today's GI bill that is logical, \nfair, and worthy of a nation that values both higher education and our \nveterans.\n  While the Montgomery GI bill has served our country well since its \npassage in 1985, the value of the educational benefit assistance it \nprovides has greatly eroded over time due to inflation and the \nescalating cost of higher education. Military recruiters indicate that \nthe program's benefits no longer serve as a strong incentive to join \nthe military; nor do they serve as a retention tool valuable enough to \npersuade men and women to stay in the military and defer the full or \npart-time pursuit of their higher education until a later date. Perhaps \nmost important, the program is losing its value as a means to help our \nmen and women in uniform readjust to civilian life after military \nservice.\n  The basic benefit program of the Vietnam era GI bill provided $493 \nper month in 1981 to a veteran with a spouse and two children. Before \nthe reforms of last year, a veteran in identical circumstances received \nonly $43 more, a mere 8 percent increase over a time period when \ninflation has nearly doubled, and dollar buys only half of what it once \npurchased.\n  While we made progress last year in increasing stipend levels under \nthe GI bill, the reforms fell short of allocating sufficient funds to \ncover the current cost of higher education. Moreover, the increase \nfailed to establish a benchmark, the reform most needed to ensure that \nthe GI bill provides sufficient funds for the education of our Nation's \nveterans long into the 21st century.\n  Our new model establishes a sensible, easily understood benchmark for \nGI bill benefits. The benchmark sets GI bill benefits at ``the average \nmonthly costs of tuition and expenses for commuter students at public \ninstitutions of higher education that award baccalaureate degrees.'' \nThis commonsense provision would serve as the foundation upon which \nfuture education stipends for all veterans would be based and would set \nbenefits at a level sufficient to provide veterans the education \npromised to them at recruitment.\n  Today's GI bill is woefully under-funded and does not provide the \nfinancial support necessary for our veterans to meet their educational \ngoals. This amendment would provide the budget authority necessary to \nensure that GI bill benefits reflect the true cost of higher education. \nI am very pleased that our amendment has been agreed to by both sides \nof the aisle and that it will become part of this budget resolution.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased today to join Senator \nCollins in offering an amendment to the budget resolution that provides \na reserve fund for veterans' education. This reserve fund will allow \nfor legislation to be passed later this year that would increase the \nmonthly benefit under the Montgomery GI Bill to reflect the rising cost \nof education.\n  The 1944 GI Bill of Rights is one of the most important pieces of \nlegislation ever passed by Congress. No program has been more \nsuccessful in increasing educational opportunities for our country's \nveterans while also providing a valuable incentive for the best and \nbrightest to make a career out of military service.\n  Unfortunately, the current Montgomery GI Bill can no longer deliver \nthese results and fails in its promise to veterans, new recruits and \nthe men and women of the armed services.\n  Over 96 percent of recruits currently sign up for the Montgomery GI \nBill and pay $1,200 out of their first year's pay to guarantee \neligibility. But only one-half of these military personnel use any of \nthe current Montgomery GI Bill benefits.\n  There is consensus among national higher education and veterans \nassociations that at a minimum, the GI Bill should pay the costs of \nattending the average four-year public institution as a commuter \nstudent. The current Montgomery GI Bill benefit pays a little more than \nhalf of that cost.\n  In addition to our reserve fund budget amendment, Senator Collins and \nI have introduced legislation called the Veterans' Higher Education \nOpportunities Act, S.131, which creates that benchmark by indexing the \nGI Bill to the costs of attending the average four-year public \ninstitution as a commuter student. This benchmark cost will be updated \nannually by the College Board in order for the GI Bill to keep pace \nwith increasing costs of education.\n  The Veterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act is truly a \nbipartisan effort to address recruitment and retention in the armed \nforces. The Veterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act has the \noverwhelming support of the Partnership for Veterans' Education a \ncoalition of the nation's leading veterans groups and higher education \norganizations including the VFW, the American Council on Education, the \nNon Commissioned Officers Association, the National Association of \nState Universities and Land Grant Colleges, and The Retired Officers \nAssociation.\n  As the parent of a son who serves in the Army, these military \n``quality of life'' issues are of particular concern to me. Making the \nGI Bill pay for viable educational opportunity makes as much sense \ntoday as it did following World War II.\n  Congress took an important step last year toward improving the \nMontgomery GI Bill. These changes are long overdue, and the next step \nin restoring the effectiveness of the Montgomery GI Bill is through our \nveterans' education reserve fund amendment to the budget resolution and \nthe Veterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our amendment and ask unanimous \nconsent that letters of support for the amendment be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                    American Council on Education,\n\n\n                                Government and Public Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 5, 2001.\n     Re amendment to improve educational opportunities for \n         veterans.\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the American Council on \n     Education, representing 1,800 two- and four-year public and \n     private colleges and universities, I write to encourage you \n     to support Senators Collins and Johnson with their amendment \n     to the Senate budget resolution providing a reserve fund for \n     enhancements to the Montgomery G.I. Bill.\n       While the G.I. Bill has allowed more than two million \n     veterans to pursue the dream of a college education, \n     inflation has severely diminished the value of this vital \n     benefit. Despite the generous intentions of the G.I. Bill, it \n     fails in its promise to help our veterans continue their \n     education, and must be modernized to ensure its viability as \n     education costs continue to increase.\n       As a member organization of the Partnership for Veteran's \n     Education, we strongly support this amendment, which creates \n     a benchmark for Montgomery G.I. Bill monthly benefits equal \n     to the average cost of a\n\n[[Page S3652]]\n\n     commuter student attending a four-year public institution. \n     The benchmark would be updated annually by the College Board, \n     thereby guaranteeing that G.I. Bill benefits meet the rising \n     costs of higher education. This benchmark is currently \n     reflected in the Veterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act \n     of 2001 (S. 131).\n       We urge you to support the Collins-Johnson veteran's \n     education amendment, which will ensure that we fulfill our \n     promise to America's veterans.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Terry W. Hartle,\n     Senior Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             The Retired Officers Association,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, April 4, 2001.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: the Retired Officers Association \n     (TROA) is writing to express support for the proposed \n     amendment to the Senate Budget Resolution that you are \n     cosponsoring with Senator Collins (R-ME) that would earmark \n     in a reserve fund additional funds for needed increases in \n     the Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB).\n       The ``Collins-Johnson Reserve Fund for Veterans Education \n     Amendment'' to the FY2002 Budget Resolution would earmark \n     $775 million in a reserve fund to support a potential \n     increase in the MGIB under your bill, S. 131, the Veterans' \n     Higher Education Opportunities Act of 2001. As you know, S. \n     131 has broad bi-partisan support including Senate Majority \n     Leader Lott and Senator Minority Leader Daschle. Should the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs or the Senate favorably report \n     legislation to increase the basic monthly benefit under the \n     MGIB to reflect the rising cost of education for America's \n     veterans, there would be new budget authority to cover the \n     increase.\n       Indexing the MGIB to keep pace with the cost of higher \n     education is a legislative goal of TROA and The Military \n     Coalition. TROA supports the amendment you are co-sponsoring \n     with Senator Collins to establish a reserve fund for veterans \n     education and we will continue our efforts to urge passage of \n     S. 131.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Steve Strobridge,\n         Colonel, USAF (Ret.), Director, Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Veterans of Foreign Wars\n\n\n                                         of The United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 4, 2001.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate,\n      Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: On behalf of the 1.9 million members \n     of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, we extend our deepest thanks \n     to you for your efforts in making veterans education a \n     priority in S. 131, legislation offered jointly by you and \n     Senator Susan Collins.\n       The Montgomery GI Bill has lost ground over the last few \n     years. It is no longer able to meet the educational needs of \n     today's veterans. The funding level has not kept pace with \n     the rising costs of higher education. S. 131 abates the GI \n     Bill's loss of value by creating an index system so funding \n     can be increased as higher education costs rise.\n       We also thank you for your announced intention to offer an \n     amendment to the Senate Budget Committee to create a reserve \n     fund for veterans education. This amendment would provide the \n     necessary funding to implement S. 131, resulting in a \n     significant increase in funding for the Montgomery GI Bill.\n       The Montgomery GI Bill is in dire need of additional \n     resources, and we fully support your efforts, both in the \n     original bill, and in the amendment. We are committed to \n     working with you to make this legislation a success.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Dennis Cullinan,\n         Director, National Legislative Service.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          The American Legion,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 4, 2001.\n     Hon. Tim Johnson,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Johnson: The American Legion thanks you for \n     offering the Collins/Johnson Reserve Fund for Veterans' \n     Education Amendment. We fully support this amendment to the \n     Senate Budget Resolution that would provide a reserve fund \n     for veterans' education.\n       The American Legion has long supported legislation that \n     would base veterans' educational benefits on the average cost \n     of attending a four-year public institution as a commuter \n     student. The Collins/Johnson amendment will provide the \n     budgetary requirements needed to reach this goal.\n       The educational enhancements contained in S. 131, the \n     Veterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act, will help to \n     transform the current Montgomery GI Bill (MGIB) program into \n     a true veterans' benefit that parallels the quality of the \n     original ``GI Bill of Rights''. A strong veterans' \n     educational benefit program will not only strengthen national \n     defense by improving recruitment, it will also prepare \n     veterans for a smooth transition into the civilian workforce.\n       Once again, The American Legion fully supports the Collins/\n     Johnson Reserve Fund for Veterans' Education Amendment and \n     appreciates your continued leadership in addressing the \n     issues that are important to veterans and active duty \n     servicemembers.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                           Steve A.

Mr. President, I rise today to address the urgent need \nfor increased levels of Department of Defense basic research funding in \nfiscal year 2002. I offer an amendment which will significantly \nincrease funding for Department of Defense basic research carried out \nin American universities.\n  This past September, then-Governor George W. Bush addressed an \naudience at The Citadel in South Carolina and raised the notion of \nskipping a generation of weapons systems and of making leap ahead \nadvances in American military capabilities. Governor Bush recognized \nthat 21st century threats facing the United States are qualitatively \ndifferent than the threats that occupied our military and our \nindustrial base during the cold war and in the decade that followed the \ndownfall of the Soviet Union.\n  Since that speech, many others have articulated a need to transform \nour Nation's military to better respond to these threat trends. They \nnote that our current military is ill equipped to meet threats such as \nincidents of terrorism, information warfare, biological warfare, and \nurban conflict. The only way to meet these challenges is to redouble \nour energies on meeting these challenges.\n  While procuring updated or evolutionary weapons systems might seem \nlike the most expeditious way to meet these new threats, I believe that \nwe need to work our way back and look first at the basic sciences and \nbasic research efforts that will support the development of new weapons \nsystems. Without critical investments in Department of Defense basic \nresearch we cannot hope to make key understandings that will drive leap \nahead advances or spur on revolutionary weapons systems.\n  Oftentimes, the funding that supports basic research for the \nDepartment of Defense has been referred to as ``seed corn'' funding. It \nis funding that, when properly invested, will return advances in our \nunderstanding of what we know about a property, an entity, a \nphenomenon, or relationship. Not all of these investments are \nsuccessful in outcome, and for this reason basic research can be \nclassified as high-risk in nature. However, these basic research \ninvestments inevitably add to our knowledge base and improve our \nunderstanding of the world.\n  Regrettably, we have been taking funds from these crucial accounts \nand using them to pay for the near-term modernization or procurement \nneeds of today's military. While this has proven to be a useful short-\nterm fix, in the long-run, we have compromised those resources \nnecessary to drive innovation and leap ahead advances, advances \nnecessary to meet 21st century threats. Part of the problem lies in the \nnature of basic research. Unlike investments in applied research or \nadvanced development research, the incubation period for basic research \nis perhaps as long as a decade. This requires the executive and \nlegislative branches of government to maintain a long-term focus when \nmaking budgetary decisions.\n\n[[Page S3653]]\n\n  American universities offer the Department of Defense the \nlaboratories and knowledge base necessary to successfully complete this \ntransformation objective. The Department of Defense has historically \nplayed a major federal role in funding basic research and has been a \nsignificant sponsor of engineering research and technology development \nconducted in American universities. For over 50 years, Department of \nDefense investment in university research has been a dominant element \nof the nation's research and development infrastructure and an \nessential component of the United states capacity for technological \ninnovation.\n  According to recent figures, 54 percent of all Department of Defense-\nsponsored basic research is performed in American universities. \nFurthermore, in aeronautical, electrical and mechanical engineering, \nthe Department of Defense's share of governmentwide investment exceeds \n50 percent. In addition, with respect to the fields of mathematics and \ncomputer science, the Department of Defense accounts for nearly 50 \npercent of all federal investment. Moreover, Department of Defense \nbasic research programs make a significant contribution to the national \neconomy by educating new generations of scientists and engineers and by \nhelping to maintain a university research infrastructure that is the \nenvy of the world.\n  The unpredictability of long-term research in combination with \nshortened product cycles and an intense competition has led many \nprivate sector companies to retrench their research programs to focus \non near-term product development. Only the Department of Defense and \nother Federal agencies can invest in university research at the levels \nrequired to meet future challenges to American security, prosperity and \nhealth.\n  Throughout the decades of the 1950's, 1960's, 1970's and 1980's, the \nDepartment of Defense and other Federal agencies sustained their \ncommitments to these investments in American universities. This \ninvestment can be measured by the number of systems relied upon by \nAmerica today to project power and maintain our interests around the \nglobe. For example, fundamental stimulated emission basic research at \nColumbia University in the 1950's led to military advances in lasers \nnecessary for precision weapon guidance capabilities. Department of \nDefense basic research funds supported activities at the California \nInstitute of Technology in the 1970's which studied metal semiconductor \nfield effect transistor gallium-arsenide devices now used in ballistic \nmissile ground-based radar. Department of Defense basic research \nfunding supported scientific study at the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology and Stanford University on lightweight composite structural \nmaterials now utilized by the Marine Corps' AV-8B Harrier aircraft.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the incubation period for basic research can \nbe as long as a decade. Companies competing in today's market-driven, \nglobal economy, are now reducing their investments in long-term, high-\nrisk research. It is up to the federal government to make the critical \ninvestment in this high-risk, long-term research if we are to make \nrevolutionary or leap ahead scientific breakthroughs.\n  Without increased investment in Department of Defense basic research, \nthe number of graduate student opportunities to pursue Department of \nDefense research cannot increase. A decline in the pool of scientists, \nengineers, mathematicians, and skilled technicians will prevent the \nDepartment of Defense from achieving success in the pursuit of leap \nahead technologies. In addition, our cadre of skilled scientists and \nengineers--cultivated by Department of Defense basic research funds--\nare the individuals who will drive innovation in the areas of our \neconomy which depend on advances in science and technology.\n  In the end, there has to be a recognition by U.S. policy leaders that \nthese critical funds are crucial to the U.S. military being able to \nmeet future threats. A recent Defense Science Board (DSB) Task Force \nidentified several key capabilities that would be necessary to allow \nour military forces to meet future warfighting challenges. The \ncapabilities identified by the DSB Task Force were: Response to \nengineered biological threats; real-time surveillance and targeting, \nespecially hidden and moving targets; and real-day projection of \ndominant U.S./Coalition military forces.\n  For advances to occur in these capabilities, we will first need to \nmake wise investments in key enabling technologies. Department of \nDefense basic research can provide the stimulus to make this possible. \nExamples of key enabling technologies include: biotechnology; \ninformation technology; microsystems; and energy and materials. The DSB \nTask Force report observed that commercial sector investment in these \ntechnologies are short-term in nature, as opposed to long-term. In \naddition, the DSB Task Force recommended a focus on the \ninterdisciplinary combinations of these technologies, as it is in these \nintersections that the truly revolutionary advances in military \ncapabilities take place.\n  For fiscal year 2001, President Clinton requested $1.22 billion in \nfunding for Department of Defense basic research. Congress, for fiscal \nyear 2001, appropriated $1.35 billion for Department of Defense basic \nresearch. With this in mind, my amendment is quite reasonable and, I \nbelieve, quite modest. For fiscal year 2002, I propose investing an \nadditional $353.5 million in Department of Defense basic research \nfunding spent in American universities. This amendment begins the \nprocess of transforming our military to meet 21st century threats.\n  Given the importance of these funds in making leap ahead advances in \nour military capabilities and because our quality of life as Americans \nis tied to basic research, I believe this is an initiative Congress \nshould support with great enthusiasm.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment, as modified, be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 182), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Tim \nHutchinson of Arkansas be added as a cosponsor of amendment No. 317.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this amendment addresses a huge, but \nsimple problem. American Indians and Alaska Natives were guaranteed \nhealth insurance. They are not getting it.\n  The Indian Health Service is supposed to provide full health coverage \nand care to every Indian in the country. In fiscal year 2002, the cost \nof that care is conservatively estimated at $6 billion. The IHS budget \nfor those Personal Clinical Services is $1.8 billion. My amendment \nwould give the Indian Health Service the $4.2 billion it needs to \nprovide the basic, essential health coverage it is required to provide.\n  What is happening now without that critical funding? Health care is \nbeing rationed, often with tragic results. Indians are being told they \nface a literal ``life or limb'' test. They cannot see a doctor unless \ntheir life is threatened or they are about to lose a limb. They are \ntold they have to wait until they get worse; then, if there is any \nmoney left, they might get treatment. Non-emergency care is routinely \ndenied.\n  It's hard to believe this is happening in America in 2001, but it is.\n  And the pain is felt not just in Indian Country, but also in the \nsurrounding areas where non-IHS facilities try to fill in some of the \ntreatment gaps. Because IHS has no money to reimburse them, they are \nfacing their own budget crises.\n  The problem is real; the solution is simple. Give the Indian Health \nService the funds it needs to provide 2.45 million Native Americans the \nhealth benefits they have been promised.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be added \nas an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection to the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I, too, want to be listed as an original \ncosponsor of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. This is an amendment that deals with Indian health and is \nstrongly supported on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 325) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 246\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 246 be called \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. Smith \n     of Oregon, proposes an amendment numbered 246.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 5, line 8, decrease the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 3, increase the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17 increase the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 23, increase the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 24, increase the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 2, increase the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 18, line 3, increase the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 15, decrease the amount by $100,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 16, decrease the amount by $100,000,000.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an \namendment to the Senate Budget Resolution for Fiscal Year 2002. This \namendment would increase the construction funds available to the Bureau \nof Reclamation by $100 million annually in fiscal years 2002 and 2003.\n  Mr. President, there is a crying need for water infrastructure in the \nWestern United States. Many existing Reclamation projects are over 40 \nyears old and need improvements and rehabilitation. A new environmental \nethic has caused projects to provide more water for the environment, or \nto be reconfigured to be more environmentally friendly. These types of \nconstruction projects include screening diversions, lining canals, and \ntemperature control devices.\n  The 106th Congress authorized several new projects to be funded by \nthe Bureau of Reclamation, including the Lewis and Clark Water Supply \nProject in South Dakota, and a reconfigured Dakota Water Supply Project \nfor North Dakota. The views and estimates of the Senate Energy \nCommittee also anticipated Committee action on a major Indian water \nsettlement in Arizona, and the enactment of a CAL-FED authorizations \nbill.\n  In the face of these existing and anticipated demands on the \nReclamation budget, construction funds available to the agency declined \nthirty-six percent over the last ten years. This bipartisan amendment \nwould provide $100 million in additional construction funds for the \nBureau of Reclamation in both 2002 and 2003. In 2002, the funds come \nfrom the function 920 account. In 2003, they come from the budget \nsurplus.\n  As the National Urban Agricultural Council aptly stated: ``It is time \nto turn the corner on the funding for the Bureau and put it on a course \nso that the West is not left withering in the desert.'' I urge my \ncolleagues' support of this amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we do not have a copy of this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let's make it sound better and say we thought we had \ngiven it to the Senator but perhaps we did not.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator may well have. As the Senator from New Mexico \nknows, we are dealing with a large number of amendments. We just do not \nhave it in the stack of amendments.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection to the amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We support this amendment on this side as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 246) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This is a zero effect amendment. It affects the Bureau \nof Reclamation without affecting the budget in any way. It is a neutral \namendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We agree, Mr. President, that it is budget neutral.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 283, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have reached agreement on a budget-\nneutral amendment, a modification to amendment No. 283. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be permitted to send a modification to amendment No. 283 \nto the desk. The principal sponsors are Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. \nHarkin, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Crapo, and Mrs. Boxer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. Smith \n     of Oregon, for himself, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \n     Crapo, and Mrs. Boxer, proposes an amendment numbered 283, as \n     modified.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n[[Page S3656]]\n\n  (Purpose: To provide an increase in funds of $1.3 billion in fiscal \n   year 2002 for the promotion of voluntary agriculture and forestry \n  conservation programs that enhance and protect natural resources on \n        private lands and without taking from the HI Trust Fund)\n\n       On page 17, line 23, increase the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 17, line 24, increase the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 15, decrease the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 16, decrease the amount by $1,300,000,000.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I want to thank the distinguished \nChairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee for helping \nto reach this agreement to adopt this amendment today. While this \nmodified version does not contain the $2.7 billion in fiscal year 2003 \nthat the original did, it does call for the $1.3 billion increase in \nfiscal year 2002 for agriculture conservation under function 300 of the \nbudget. This amount, combined with $350 million authorized under an \namendment adopted yesterday, totals more than $1.6 billion for \nconservation activities in fiscal year 2002.\n  As our farmers and ranchers are faced with new environmental \nregulations and development pressures, agriculture conservation \nprograms become even more important. Right now, demand for conservation \nassistance far outstrips available funding for such programs as the \nEnvironmental Quality Incentives Program. In addition, there is a need \nfor more NRCS technical assistance support and a new incentives-based \nconservation initiative such as the Conservation Security Act.\n  I want to thank Senators Harkin, Leahy, Snowe, Crapo, Boxer, Wyden, \nDayton, Bingaman, Levin, Durbin, Johnson, and Landrieu who joined me in \nintroducing this bipartisan amendment. I have enjoyed working with them \nand believe that we have a growing core of interest in agriculture \nconservation funding here in the Senate. I look forward to working \nclosely with my friends on both sides of the aisle to pursue this \nfunding in the upcoming conference on the budget as well as in future \nagriculture appropriations acts.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection to the amendment, as modified, on \nthis side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We support the amendment, as modified, on this side as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 283), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I repeat, this amendment does not increase spending. It \nis a neutral amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 197\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have three amendments we want to voice \nvote. The first one is amendment No. 197 by Senator Dorgan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we accept that amendment and we are \nwilling to do that at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. If the distinguished managers would not object, I know \nSenator Kerry would like to add a brief statement.\n  A recent visitor to my Small Business Committee office spoke \nexcitedly that his small business won a Government contract. But when \nhe sought financing at a local bank, the bank would not lend to him \nunless he was willing to pay a 28-percent interest rate. It is odd to \nsee the Government willing to do business with him but banks consider \nthe small business too risky. The SBA fills that role, and this \namendment will ensure that the SBA can continue to do that.\n  I urge adoption of this bipartisan amendment on SBA. The funds are \ncritical for SBA programs such as HUBZones, 7(a) loan programs, and the \nBDC program.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment that ensures the \nsmall business programs at the Small Business Administration are \nadequately funded for FY 2002 and can continue to provide loans and \nbusiness assistance to the country's 24 million small businesses. It is \nnecessary to restore and reasonably increase funding to specific \nprograms, such as the 7(a) loan program and the Women's Business \nCenters, at the SBA because the current budget request would reduce \nfunding for the agency by a minimum of 26 percent. These cuts come at a \ntime when the economy is volatile and the Federal Reserve Board reports \nthat 45 percent of banks surveyed have reduced lending to small \nbusinesses by making it harder to obtain loans and more expensive to \nborrow. This amendment also shores up resources for the agency's \nmanagement training and counseling programs, which are sometimes more \nimportant to the success of small businesses than loans.\n  This amendment is not controversial, and it is bipartisan. I want to \nthank my colleagues--Senators Bond, Bingaman, Wellstone, Landrieu, \nDaschle, Leahy, Johnson, Schumer, Collins, Levin, and Snowe--for \ncosponsoring what I consider sensible and realistic changes to the \nbudget.\n  In order to foster small businesses creation and growth in this \ncountry, we need to restore $264 million to the SBA's budget for \nFY2002. That amount would leverage $13.2 billion in loans and venture \ncapital and counsel more than one million entrepreneurs. That may seem \ntiny compared to some amendments we've been considering, but let me \nassure you the impact is great on the economy. Small businesses provide \n50 percent of private-sector jobs. For less than $2 per taxpayer, we \ncan provide access to credit and capital for our nation's job creators.\n\n[[Page S3658]]\n\n  Mr. President, every single State in this Nation benefits from the \nsmall business support the SBA provides. I ask my colleagues to vote \nfor this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support and a summary of the \namendment be printed in the Record.\n         The National Association of Government Guaranteed \n           Lenders, Inc.,\n                                    Stillwater, OK, April 5, 2001.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: I am writing on behalf of NAGGL's \n     nearly 700 members in support of your amendment, number 183, \n     to the Budget Resolution that would revise the proposed \n     budget for the Small Business Administration in fiscal year \n     2002. Specifically, your amendment would restore $264 million \n     to the SBA's budget in fiscal year 2002 of which $118 million \n     is earmarked for the agency's 7(a) guaranteed loan program. \n     We strongly believe it is in the best interest of small \n     business that your amendment be adopted.\n       The present budget proposes no fiscal year 2002 \n     appropriations for the 7(a) loan program and instead proposes \n     to make the program self-funding through the imposition of \n     increased fees. The previous SBA Administrator testified \n     before the House Small Business Committee last year that the \n     7(a) program was already being run at a ``profit'' to the \n     government. This statement was confirmed in a September 2000 \n     Congressional Budget Office report entitled ``Credit Subsidy \n     Reestimates, 1993-1999.'' Unfortunately, the budget as \n     currently proposed would, in our view, have the effect of \n     imposing additional taxes by increasing program fees. This \n     result would be ironic given the Administration's push for \n     tax cuts.\n       A recent survey of NAGGL's membership, who currently make \n     approximately 80 percent of SBA 7(a) guaranteed loans, shows \n     that if the budget were adopted as proposed, most lenders \n     would significantly curtail their 7(a) lending activities. \n     Therefore, small businesses would find it more difficult and \n     expensive to obtain crucial long-term financing. The proposed \n     budget would increase the lender's cost of making a loan by \n     75 percent and would increase the direct cost to the borrower \n     by 12 percent. Any fee increase is unacceptable when the \n     program is already profitable for the government.\n       The small business consequences of a slowdown in 7(a) \n     guaranteed lending are manifold. Currently, according to \n     statistics available from the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation and the SBA, approximately 30 percent of all \n     long-term loans, those with a maturity of 3 years or more, \n     carry an SBA 7(a) guarantee. This is because lenders \n     generally are unwilling to make long-term loans with a short-\n     term deposit base. Therefore, reducing the availability of \n     7(a) capital to small businesses will have a significant \n     effect on them and on the economy.\n       The average maturity for an SBA 7(a) guaranteed loan is 14 \n     years. The average conventional small business loan carries \n     an average maturity of one year or less. For those \n     conventional loans with original maturities over one year, \n     the average maturity is just three years. The majority of SBA \n     7(a) borrowers are new business startups or early stage \n     companies. The longer maturities provided by the SBA 7(a) \n     loan program give small businesses valuable payment relief, \n     as the longer maturity loans carry substantially lower \n     monthly payments.\n       For example, if a small business borrower had to take a 5 \n     year conventional loan instead of a 10 year SBA 7(a) loan, \n     the result would be a 35%-40% increase in monthly payments. \n     The lower debt payments are critical to startup and early \n     stage companies. Small business loans, where they can be \n     found, would have vastly increased monthly payments. This at \n     a time when the economy appears to be struggling and when \n     bank regulators have spurred banks to tighten credit \n     criteria, the current budget only proposes to worsen the \n     situation for small business borrowers.\n       Your amendment would help mitigate this problem. It would \n     provide small businesses far better access to long-term \n     financing on reasonable terms and conditions at a time when \n     their access to such capital is critical. We urge your \n     colleagues to support your initiative and adopt your \n     amendment.\n           Respectfully,\n     Anthony R. Wilkinson.\n                                  ____\n\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     U.S. Hispanic\n\n\n                                          Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 5, 2001.\n     Hon.

Kerry,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Small Business Committee, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: We write in support of the Kerry/Bond \n     Amendment to restore $264 million of the proposed cuts to the \n     Small Business Administration's (SBA) budget. We further \n     support the amendment's proposal to have these funds come out \n     of the contingency fund and not the tax cut or the Medicare/\n     Social Security trust fund. Your amendment would ensure that \n     the small business programs at the SBA are adequately funded \n     and continue to provide loan and business assistance to \n     Hispanic-owned small businesses in this country.\n       The United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce (USHCC) \n     represents the interest of approximately 1.5 million \n     Hispanic-owned businesses in the United States and Puerto \n     Rico. With a network of over 200 local Hispanic chambers of \n     commerce across the country, the USHCC stands as the \n     preeminent business organization that promotes the economic \n     growth and development of Hispanic entrepreneurs.\n       The SBA programs that are currently in jeopardy of losing \n     funds have been extremely instrumental in helping our \n     Hispanic entrepreneurs start and maintain successful \n     businesses in the United States. Without these programs, the \n     Hispanic business community will suffer huge setbacks to the \n     strides we have been able to achieve over the years. It is \n     therefore necessary to restore and increase funding to these \n     programs so that the Hispanic business community will \n     continue to experience economic growth and success in this \n     country.\n       We support your efforts and urge other members of the \n     Senate to support the Kerry/Bond amendment in restoring these \n     necessary funds to the SBA.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n\n                                               Maritza Rivera,\n\n                                                Vice President for\n     Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             Independent Community\n\n\n                                           Bankers of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 5, 2001.\n\n     To: Members of the U.S. Senate.\n\n     From: Independent Community Bankers of America.\n\n     Re ICBA support the Kerry-Bond amendment to preserve small \n         business loan programs and to prevent new fees.\n\n       On behalf of the 5,300 members of the ICBA, we support the \n     Kerry-Bond amendment to the FY 2002 Budget and urge all \n     Senators to join in support of this important bipartisan \n     amendment. The amendment to be offered by Sens. John Kerry \n     (D-Mass) and Christopher Bond (R-Missouri) would prevent new \n     hidden taxes in the form of additional fees imposed on small \n     business lenders and borrowers. The proposed FY 2002 Budget \n     pending in the Senate would levy significant new fees on the \n     SBA 7(a) loan program. These increased fees would jeopardize \n     needed lending and credit to small business at the worst \n     possible time as our economy has slowed dramatically and \n     small business lending has become more difficult. Therefore, \n     the Kerry-Bond amendment would restore the appropriation for \n     the 7(a) small business loan program and prevent onerous new \n     fees from being levied on borrowers and lenders.\n       This amendment shares bipartisan support. The Chairmen and \n     Ranking Members of the Senate Small Business Committees \n     oppose new taxes on small businesses in the form of higher \n     loan fees. Specifically, Small Business Committee Chairman \n     Chris Bond and Ranking Member John Kerry have asked for the \n     $118 million appropriation to support the 7(a) loan program \n     to be restored in the FY 2002 Budget. The ICBA applauds the \n     bipartisan efforts of Sens. Kerry and Bond in offering their \n     amendment.\n       We urge every Senators' support for the Kerry-Bond \n     amendment so that small businesses have continued access to \n     needed credit and that the 7(a) loan program is not \n     devastated by taxing new fees.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Association of Small Business\n\n\n                                          Development Centers,\n\n                                                        Burke, VA.\n     Hon. John F. Kerry,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Senate Small Business Committee, \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: We wish to commend you for proposing an \n     amendment to the Budget Resolution calling for the \n     restoration of funding for the Small Business Development \n     Center (SBDC) and 7(a) Guaranteed Loan Programs. During this \n     period of economic downturn, it is even more important that \n     funding for these two critically important programs not be \n     compromised as hundreds of thousands of small businesses will \n     need management and technical assistance and long term debt \n     financing more than ever.\n       As for the SBDC Program specifically, we are proud to \n     report that the most recent impact survey of the program \n     found that in one year SBDC's helped small businesses create \n     92,000 new jobs, generate $630 million in new tax revenues, \n     increased by 67,000 the number of entrepreneurs counseled \n     above previous levels, and provided training to more than \n     84,000 small business owners than were trained during the \n     last reporting period. In all, over 750,000 small business \n     and preventure clients received SBDC assistance in the last \n     fiscal year. And that was during good economic times.\n       Your seeking funding of $105,000,000 for the SBDC Program \n     is bipartisan as Senator Kit Bond, Chairman of the senate \n     Small Business Committee in his Views and Estimates letter to \n     the Senate Budget Committee called for the same funding \n     level. Likewise\n\n[[Page S3659]]\n\n     Senator Bond opposed any funding cut for the 7(a) Guaranteed \n     Loan Program. Both recommendations we applaud.\n       We also understand that your amendment would restore \n     funding for the New Markets and PRIME programs. This \n     association has taken no formal position regarding funding \n     for these well intended programs.\n       thank you for soliciting our views. We appreciate your \n     leadership regarding these two outstanding SBA programs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Donald T.

John F. Kerry,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kerry: As the President of the Association of \n     Women's Business Centers (AWBC), I am writing on behalf of \n     the 80+ Women's Business Centers who have been funded by the \n     Small Business Administration's Office of Women's Business \n     Ownership. We write to support your amendment #183 to \n     increase funding for the SBA programs and, in particular, to \n     fund the Women's Business Center Program at $13.7 million.\n       The President's budget only provides level funding of $12 \n     million for the WBC program, which is inadequate at this time \n     as women are continuing to start two-thirds of all new \n     businesses. Clearly, we need an increase in funding at this \n     time to continue to ensure that we are keeping pace with this \n     fast growth and providing services to as many women business \n     owners as possible.\n       Thank you very much for your continued support and advocacy \n     on our behalf.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Andrea C.

It is necessary to restore and \nreasonably increase funding to specific programs at the SBA because the \n current budget request reduces funding for the Agency by a minimum of \n   26 percent at a time when the economy is volatile and the Federal \nReserve Board reports that 45 percent of banks have reduced lending to \nsmall businesses by making it harder to obtain loans and more expensive \n                               to borrow)\n\n       All funds are added to Function 376, which funds the SBA \n     for FY 2002.\n\n\n                            credit programs\n\n       $118 million for 7(a) loans, funding an $11 billion \n     program.\n       $26.2 million for SBIC participating securities, will \n     support a $2 billion program.\n       $750,000 for direct microloans, funding a $30 million \n     program.\n       $21 million for new markets venture capital debentures, \n     funding $150 million program.\n       Total request for credit programs=$166 million.\n\n\n                          non-credit programs\n\n       $4 million for the National Veterans Business Development \n     Corporation.\n       $10 million for Microloan Technical Assistance, total of \n     $30 million.\n       $30 million for the Small Business Development Centers, \n     total of $105 million.\n       $30 million for New Markets Venture Capital Technical \n     Assistance.\n       $15 million for the Program for Investment in \n     Microenterprise.\n       $7 million for BusinessLINC.\n       $1.7 million for Women's Business Centers, bringing total \n     to $13.7 million.\n       $250,000 for Women's Business Council, bringing total to $1 \n     million.\n       Total request for non-credit program=$98 million.\n       Total request for credit and non-credit programs=$264 \n     million.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in conclusion, we have noticed in the last \nmonths small businesses have been severely constrained because banks \nare tightening up credit. This amendment is going to leverage some $13 \nbillion worth of investment in the country. There isn't a State in the \nNation where small business doesn't make an enormous difference. Small \nbusiness represents 50 percent of the jobs in the private sector. By \nrestoring these funds, we are going to help to turn around the slowness \nthat people perceive in the economy today and I think give a lot of \nrelief to an awful lot of businesses in the Nation.\n  I thank the managers for accepting this amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. This also is budget neutral. We have no objection to \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it is supported on this side as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 183) was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 231, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We call up Senator Murray's amendment No. 231, and I \nask unanimous consent to send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mrs. \n     Murray, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Edwards, Mrs. Lincoln, \n     Ms. Cantwell, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Reid, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 231, as modified.\n\n (Purpose: To increase budget authority and outlays in Function 450 to \nprovide adequate funding for Project Impact and FEMA Hazard Mitigation \n                                grants)\n\n       On page 25, line 6, increase the amount by $108,000,000.\n       On page 25, line 7, increase the amount by $108,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 15, decrease the amount by $108,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 16, decrease the amount by $48,000,000.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Washington, Mrs. Murray, to reinstate \nFEMA's pre-disaster mitigation program, Project Impact. Established in \n1997, Project Impact assists communities in identifying risks and \nvulnerabilities, developing programs to lessen risks, and involving the \npublic and private sectors in the process. With over 250 community \nProject Impact partners nationwide and more than 2,500 business \npartners, Project Impact is the only Federal program that provides \nfunds for pre-disaster mitigation.\n  In Hawaii, all four of the state's counties are Project Impact \npartners. For example, Maui County is using Project Impact to review \ncommunity mitigation plans in regions that are more isolated than \nothers to reduce disruptions during and after disasters. The County of \nKauai is using funds to assist with retrofitting and hardening public \nstructures to protect them from damaging hurricanes, and the state's \nmost populous area, the City and County of Honolulu, is working on an \naggressive public education and awareness program, developing a \nmitigation strategy to include a risk-vulnerability assessment, \nhardening and retrofitting essential facilities, and flood control \nmeasures.\n\n[[Page S3660]]\n\n  My distinguished colleague from Washington described how Seattle has \nbenefited from its partnership with Project Impact. I was interested \nthat 6 months before the city's massive earthquake, Mayor Paul Schell \nsaid, ``Seattle Project Impact helps us realize we are not powerless \nagainst the threat of earthquakes. This public-private partnership is a \nstellar example of how local communities can work together to become \ndisaster resistant.'' Ironically, the President's budget, which was \nreleased on the same day as the Seattle earthquake, proposed to \nterminate Project Impact from FEMA's fiscal year 2002 budget because \nthe program ``has not proven effective.''\n  I would like to take a moment to discuss the effectiveness of this \nprogram. My first action was to ask OMB Director Mitchell Daniels and \nFEMA Director Joseph Allbaugh how they reached their decision to \neliminate this successful program. During Director Allbaugh's \nconfirmation hearing, he said that, with respect to the importance of \ndisaster mitigation, ``taking my lead from Congress' enactment of the \n2000 Stafford Act amendments, I plan to focus on implementing pre-\ndisaster mitigation programs that encourage the building of disaster \nresistant communities. FEMA has made solid progress in this area, but \nmore can be done to limit the human and financial toll of disasters.'' \nWe must assume that the ``solid progress'' in pre-disaster mitigation \nrefers to Project Impact since it is the only pre-disaster mitigation \nprogram funded by FEMA. Eliminating its funding will not meet the goal \nof doing more to ``focus on implementing pre-disaster mitigation \nprograms'' and ``limit the human and financial toll of disasters.''\n  Director Daniels recently replied to my earlier letter. He expressed \nstrong support for Project Impact but surprisingly indicated that \nfunding would be eliminated. Instead he suggested that a new National \nEmergency Reserve fund would be used for disaster mitigation although \nthe President's proposed budget blueprint makes clear that the \nreserve's funds are ``limited to expenditures that are sudden, urgent, \nunforeseen, and not permanent.'' His letter, which I ask unanimous \nconsent be entered into the Record along with the description of the \nPresident's National Emergency Reserve fund, deepens my concern that \nthis program's functions will not be funded. Consequently, there will \nbe no funding for disaster mitigation programs in the President's \nbudget.\n  I also was interested to learn that there has been no formal review \nby the General Accounting Office of the effectiveness of this program, \neither by itself or with respect to the other mitigation programs in \nFEMA. A March 2000 FEMA Inspector General report outlined some of the \nmanagement difficulties Project Impact faced as a new and rapidly \nexpanding program. The IG found several areas lacking or in need of \nreform, and the agency addressed each issue. Moreover, the report \nstated that many of the benefits derived from Project Impact could not \nbe quantified, which is a never-ending burden of mitigation and \nprevention programs: a positive outcome results in a smaller effect, or \nnone at all.\n  Supporters of the President's proposed budget cut may say that all we \nhave heard is anecdotal evidence in support of Project Impact. However, \nI say that we have not heard any evidence, anecdotal or otherwise, \nagainst the program. We must consider qualitative results and benefits, \nsuch as public awareness, education and greater community-industry \ncooperation, when determining its effectiveness. These are very \nimportant to a community that hopes to sustain disaster preparedness \nmeasures long after the initial seed money is spent.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our amendment to reinstate the $25 \nmillion for Project Impact. With so many of our communities, especially \nsmaller cities and towns, participating in this important program, I \nbelieve we must first determine its effectiveness before voting for its \nelimination. I am asking GAO to provide Congress with a detailed \nassessment of the program so that we may determined its effectiveness.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this \namendment offered by Senators Murray and Akaka to restore funding \nauthorization for the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Project \nImpact and Hazard Mitigation grants. I have also indicated my \nopposition to the administration's cuts in these programs in a letter \nto Chairman Domenici and Senator Conrad, pursuant to my obligation as \nranking member of the Governmental Affairs Committee to express views \non the President's budget as it affects matters within our \njurisdiction.\n  The administration's proposed cuts in these programs would shift part \nor all of the funding burden for these programs back on the States, \nwhose resources are already tightly stretched. Moreover, these programs \nare designed to reduce future losses that would in many cases greatly \noutstrip the Federal Government's original investment; as a result, we \nwill spend more on recovery programs tomorrow than we will save today \nby eliminating these programs. Overall, my State of Connecticut is \nalready receiving less federal funding for emergency management than it \ndid in 1995, it will be hard for States like Connecticut to absorb \nthese additional cuts and still maintain the current level of services.\n  Specifically, the amendment would restore funding authorization for \n``Project Impact'' which the administration proposes to zero out. This \nis a $25 million pre-disaster mitigation and preparedness program that \nwas recently instituted by FEMA. The agency partners with cities at \nrisk for flooding and other disasters to create programs boosting \nawareness of how to prepare and lessen the damage from disasters. In \nConnecticut, for example, four cities have been included in this \nprogram: Westport, East Haven, Norwich, and Milford. Since Project \nImpact is new and still being implemented, it has not yet been fully \nevaluated; however, one of Project Impact's strengths is providing \nfunding directly to cities. Zeroing this program out without providing \nsomething in its place is ``not prudent,'' according to Connecticut's \nDirector of Emergency Management. Moreover, the program helps FEMA to \nachieve its Strategic Goal 1, which seeks to protect lives and prevent \nthe loss of property by implementing pre-disaster mitigation and \npreparedness measures. Project Impact is a key part of this effort.\n  The amendment would also reverse the Administration's decision to cut \nthe federal share of funding for hazard mitigation grants which are \ngiven for post-disaster mitigation to prevent future losses. Instead of \nproviding funding to states on a 75-25 ratio, the Administration would \nreduce the federal government's share to 50 percent. Again, this places \nthe burden back on the states to fund these efforts.\n  These two programs provide needed assistance to States and \ncommunities across the country that experience losses due to major \ndisasters. The amount of money that would be saved by these proposed \ncuts is relatively small. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment and to restore funding authorization for these two worthy \nFEMA programs.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the amendment Senator Akaka and I have \nintroduced today would restore funding for FEMA's Project Impact and \nmaintain the existing 75 percent Federal cost-share for hazard \nmitigation grants. The Murray-Akaka amendment would not increase any \nfunding. It would simply keep the same commitment the Federal \nGovernment has provided in previous years.\n  I would like to thank Senator Akaka for his work on this important \namendment, I would also like to thank Senators Lieberman, Edwards, \nLincoln, Cantwell, Boxer, Reid, and Mikulski for cosponsoring the \nMurray-Akaka amendment.\n  On February 28 an earthquake measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale \ncaused significant damage throughout western Washington State killing \none person, injuring more than 400 people, and causing hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in damage. It was a big scare. Everyone in western \nWashington has an earthquake story.\n  Some of the biggest stories involve a small program called Project \nImpact. My home State was very lucky the damage wasn't worse. But \ncommunities in my State created some of their own luck by being \nprepared. I am proud to say the Federal Government was a good partner \nin those efforts. Project Impact is a pre-disaster mitigation\n\n[[Page S3661]]\n\nprogram run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The premise is \nsimple: in the 1990s, the Federal Government spent more than $20 \nbillion responding to natural disasters. This sum doesn't count the \nloss of loved ones. It doesn't count the hardship Americans ensure when \nMother Nature strikes.\n  Congress and the Clinton administration decided that simply \nresponding to disasters wasn't enough. We made the decision to invest \nin communities that wanted to invest in limiting the damage caused by \nnatural disasters. That philosophy has translated into real life \nresults through Project Impact. But just hours before the earthquake in \nWashington State, the budget blueprint produced by the Bush \nadministration eliminated Project Impact. The blueprint dismissed \nProject Impact as ineffective.\n  As I toured the earthquake damage in the days after the earthquake, I \nwas left wondering who the new administration had spoken with to reach \nthat conclusion. The administration certainly didn't speak with the \nCity of Seattle. Seattle was one of the seven original Project Impact \ncommunities. Today, there are nearly 248 Project Impact communities in \nall 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. \nVirgin Islands.\n  Two days after the earthquake, I toured Stevens Elementary School in \nSeattle. The current school building is one of the oldest run by the \nSeattle public Schools. The teachers and students practice constantly \nfor earthquakes. Stevens Elementary is one of the 46 Seattle schools \nthat have had overhead hazards removed. In this case, I saw how Project \nImpact dollars were used to drain an overhead water tank and to secure \nthe tank so it wouldn't fall through a classroom ceiling and onto \nstudents during an earthquake. In other Seattle schools, Project Impact \ndollars are used to disaster-proof classrooms. This involves tying down \ncomputers and strapping televisions to ensure they don't fall during an \nearthquake.\n\n  As parents and grandparents, we want to know that our children are \nsafe when they are at school. Project Impact has allowed many \ncommunities to make sure that more of their students will be safe when \nnatural disasters strike. Washington State has five Project Impact \ncommunities. These communities partner with local businesses and \norganizations to educate homeowners and professionals about home \nretrofitting, to do hazard mapping, to set-up better communications \nsystems for disaster situations, to disaster-proof schools, and to help \nbusinesses prepare for disasters. These actions are effective. These \nactions save lives and property and businesses.\n  The amendment I offer today restores Project Impact funding for \nfiscal year 2002 and fiscal year 2003. Funding Project Impact for the \nnext 2 years will allow us to better evaluate its success. Last year, \nCongress passed legislation to authorize a pre-disaster mitigation \nprogram. If Project Impact is not meeting the nation's needs for such a \nprogram, we will have the next 2 years to develop a program that will \nmeet our goals.\n  The Bush administration recommended other budget cuts for FEMA as \nwell. I am especially concerned the administration's budget would \nreduce the Federal cost-share for hazard mitigation grants from 75 \npercent to 50 percent. Communities covered by a Federal disaster \ndeclaration can access hazard mitigation grants to repair or replace \ndamaged public facilities and infrastructure. These grants help to \nensure that future disasters will not cripple critical facilities \ninfrastructure and services. The grants allow communities to make the \ninvestments when they are most likely to be effective. If the federal \ncost-share falls from 75 percent to 50 percent cash-strapped States and \nlocalities will not be able to afford to use all available grants. This \nmeans more lives will be lost, more jobs and businesses will be lost \nafter a disaster, and more Federal spending will be needed to pick up \nthe pieces when the next disaster strikes.\n  The amendment I am offering will fix this cost-share problem and will \nrestore Project Impact, so that communities across America can take \nsteps today to prevent damage tomorrow. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important amendment.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. As modified, this also is budget neutral and we are \nwilling to accept it.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we support this amendment on this side as \nwell.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Murray \namendment, No. 231, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 231), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank the managers for the efficient way \nthey have been handling business. Last night in wrap-up, they passed \namendment No. 210 which dealt with restoring money for critical health \nprograms and graduate medical education at community health centers. I \nask unanimous consent Senators Hollings, DeWine, Kennedy, Feinstein, \nSmith of Oregon, Kerry, and Dodd be added as cosponsors to Bond \namendment No. 210.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. May I be added as a cosponsor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to be listed as a cosponsor \non the Kerry-Bond amendment No. 183 of which we have just disposed. I \nask unanimous consent to be shown as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 285 Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. ALLEN.

RESERVE FUND FOR EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY TAX RELIEF.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the Senate and the House, the Chairmen \n     of the Committees on the Budget may reduce the spending and \n     revenue aggregates and may revise committee allocations for \n     legislation that is reported by the Senate Committee on \n     Finance and the House Committee on Ways and Means, \n     respectively, that reduces tax liabilities for parents of \n     primary and secondary education students to increase access \n     to K through 12 education-related opportunities and improve \n     the quality of their children's education experience, \n     especially with regards to, but not limited to, expenses \n     related to the purchase of home computer hardware, education \n     software, and internet access, and for expenses related to \n     tutoring services.\n       (b) Limitation.--The Chairmen shall not make adjustment \n     authorized in this section if legislation described in \n     subsection (a) would cause an on-budget deficit when taken \n     with all other legislation enacted for--\n       (1) fiscal year 2002;\n       (2) the period of fiscal years 2002 through 2006; or\n       (3) the period of fiscal years 2002 through 2011.\n       (c) Budgetary Enforcement.--Revised allocations and \n     aggregates under subsection (a) shall be considered for the \n     purposes of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 as \n     allocations and aggregates contained in this resolution.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. This amendment is an amendment to empower parents in \neducation spending, especially if they have children in kindergarten \nthrough 12, in purchasing technology such as computers, educational \nsoftware, Internet access, and tutor funding--but not tuition. The \namendment had some problems on the other side of the aisle. This \namendment was never intended to allow a tax credit for tuition.\n  I very much appreciate the work of the staff of Senator Domenici and \nthe folks with Finance. I appreciate working with Senator Conrad and \nSenator Reid, and Senator Daschle brought forward some of the problems \nthis would cause with a flood of further amendments. I thank the \nPresiding Officer, Senator Miller, for his support and Senator Nelson \nof Nebraska.\n  I say to the fellow Members of the Senate I was hoping to achieve a \ngoal and I will continue to do so and hope the Finance Committee, when \nacting on tax relief, will take into account giving tax relief to hard-\nworking families who have children in schools. We need to reduce their \ntax burden. Parents ought to be making education decisions for their \nchildren. This idea is\n\n[[Page S3662]]\n\nsupported by the technology community, and it also helps bridge the \ndivide to make sure that all children have computers at home or make it \nmore affordable to have computers at home and access information on the \nInternet. Again, it should not be used for tuition.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the distinguished Senator from Virginia, Mr. \nAllen. The way he has worked on this, it is obvious this is not the \nlast we will hear of it. From this Senator's standpoint, I hope we will \nhear more about it.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment for \nanother day on the tax committee, and hopefully they will have this for \nparents and education spending and technology for our youngsters across \nour Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand Senator Clinton wants to \ncomment on the amendment adopted in her behalf.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 328, as modified\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I rise to thank the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee for accepting an amendment that I \nbelieve is so important to safeguard the food supplies in our country \nand thereby safeguard our children from the growing threat of \ncontamination.\n  Presently we enjoy one of the most safe food supplies in the world, \nbut we are clearly not immune to the threats we read about every day in \nour newspapers.\n  I saw a recent headline in the New York Times that the public does \nhave reason to be alarmed. The Times reported that there are only 400 \ninspectors to investigate problems at the 57,000 plants in our country. \nBecause of this lack of resources, the FDA inspects food manufacturers \nonly once every 8 years. The American people deserve better than that. \nSo this important measure will strengthen our food safety \ninfrastructure by increasing the number of FDA inspectors so high-risk \nsites can be inspected annually and would also step up research and \nsurveillance to identify the sources of contamination and track the \nincidence of foodborne illnesses to help us better meet emerging \nthreats from abroad.\n  Finally, it would protect against cuts in funding for the Department \nof Health and Human Services and Department of Agriculture food safety \ninitiatives and ensure sufficient funds in the cases of threats from \nfood safety emergencies.\n  I am very pleased the administration changed its announced policy \nyesterday about testing the ground meat in our Nation's schools. I \nthank them for that reversal because clearly there is nothing more \nimportant than providing our children with safe food, and particularly \nin our schools. I am very pleased that in a bipartisan way we have \nadopted this amendment which I think will go a long way towards easing \nthe concerns and fears of so many parents in ensuring a safe food \nsupply for generations to come.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 253, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are prepared to call up amendment \n253, Senator Lincoln's amendment. We ask unanimous consent it be in \norder to modify the amendment and send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici] for Mrs. \n     Lincoln, for herself, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Leahy, and Ms. \n     Landrieu, proposes an amendment numbered 253, as modified.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask unanimous consent the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, my amendment to the budget resolution would \nadd $100 million in Fiscal Year 2002 to Function 500 (Education). This \nincreased funding will allow for the continuation of an American \nhistory grant program that I initiated last year. This program is \ndesigned to promote the teaching of history as a separate subject in \nour nation's schools. An unfortunate trend of blending history with a \nvariety of other subjects to form a hybrid called social studies has \ntaken hold in our schools. Further, the history books provided to our \nyoung people, all too frequently, gloss over the finer points of \nAmerica's past. My amendment provides incentives to help spur a return \nto the teaching of traditional American history.\n  Every February our nation celebrates the birth of two of our most \nrevered presidents--George Washington, the father of our nation, who \nvictoriously led his ill-fitted assembly of militiamen against the \narmies of King George, and Abraham Lincoln, the eternal martyr of \nfreedom, whose powerful voice and iron will shepherded a divided nation \ntoward a more perfect Union. Sadly, I fear that many of our nation's \nschool children may never fully appreciate the lives and \naccomplishments of these two American giants of history. They have been \nrobbed of that appreciation--robbed by schools that no longer stress a \nknowledge of American history. In fact, study after study has shown \nthat the historical significance of our nation's grand celebrations of \npatriotism--such as Memorial Day or the Fourth of July--are lost on the \nmajority of young Americans. What a waste. What a shame.\n  An American student, regardless of race, religion, or gender, must \nknow the history of the land to which they pledge allegiance. They \nshould be taught about the Founding Fathers of this nation, the battles \nthat they fought, the ideals that they championed, and the enduring \neffects of their accomplishments. They should be taught about our \nnation's failures, our mistakes, and the inequities of our past. \nWithout this knowledge, they cannot appreciate the hard won freedoms \nthat are our birthright.\n  Our failure to insist that the words and actions of our forefathers \nbe handed down from generation to generation will ultimately mean a \nfailure to perpetuate this wonderful experiment in representative \ndemocracy. Without the lessons learned from the past, how can we ensure \nthat our nation's core ideals--life, liberty, equality, and freedom--\nwill survive? As Marcus Tullius Cicero stated:\n\n       . . . to be ignorant of what occurred before you were born \n     is to remain always a child. For what is the worth of human \n     life, unless it is woven into the life of our ancestors by \n     the records of history?\n\n  I am not the only one who recognizes the importance of teaching \nAmerican history. Many groups are interested and have expressed support \nfor this grant program. Representatives from the National Council for \nHistory Education, the National Coordinating Committee for the \nPromotion of History, the American Historical Association, and National \nHistory Day have all expressed enthusiasm for this grant program. They \nare very supportive of this effort.\n  So, for those reasons, I offer this amendment to the budget \nresolution to increase Function 500 (Education) by $100 million in \nFiscal Year 2002.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 207\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the State of California has been beset by an \nenergy crisis. We see daily reports of rolling blackouts, epidemic \nshortages of electricity, and, most recently, utility rate hikes, which \nfor some customers could mean a forty percent increase in their \nelectric bill. And, as bad as things are now, it is only going to get \nworse this summer when the weather heats up and demand for electricity \nincreases. Moreover, the problems being faced today in California are \nnot limited to that state. On the contrary, this crisis threatens other \nparts of the country as well.\n  Given that situation, one would think that policymakers here in \nWashington would be focused like a laser on the idea of increasing \nenergy supplies while at the same time trying to stem demand. The Bush \nAdministration is working to put together a national energy policy. \nBut, until the President's Energy Task Force completes its work and \nreports to the American people, the only guidance we have from the \nAdministration is that which can be gleaned from official statements \nand the sparse information contained in the so-called Budget Blueprint.\n  Mr. President, I am deeply concerned with where this Administration \nis going, because what I hear with my ears is not the same as what I \nread with my eyes. When I listen to the President and his senior \ncabinet officials, I am at a loss to reconcile their verbal \npronouncements with what the Administration has proposed by way of its \nbudget. Let me give you some examples.\n  On February 27, just five weeks ago, President Bush came up to \nCapitol Hill, and he spoke to the American people before a joint \nsession of Congress. In that address, the President laid out several \npolicy goals, not the least of which was the need for a national energy \npolicy that would enhance this nation's energy security. During his \nspeech, the President said:\n\n       Our energy demand outstrips our supply. We can produce more \n     energy at home while protecting our environment, and we must. \n     We can produce more electricity to meet demand, and we must. \n     We can promote alternative energy sources and conservation, \n     and we must. America must become more energy independent, and \n     we will.\n\n  Little more than two weeks ago, on March 19, the Secretary of Energy \nreiterated the problems with supply when he spoke to the U.S. Chamber \nof Commerce here in Washington. At an event billed as a National Energy \nSummit, Secretary Abraham stated flat out that this nation had an \nenergy supply crisis. He went on to say that that supply crisis was not \nthe fault of depleted natural resources; the United States has not run \nout of coal, or natural gas, or oil. Rather, in the Secretary's \nopinion, it was ``political leadership that has been scarce.''\n\n[[Page S3664]]\n\n  Consequently, when I hear these statements, I come away thinking that \nthis administration is truly committed to increasing our supply of \ndomestic energy. I was heartened by these comments because I believed \nthey meant that the President and the Secretary would understand that \nthe only way we were going to get more supply is through the use of \nnewer and better technology. And, the only way we can get better \ntechnology is through the kind of investments in research and \ndevelopment being done by the Department of Energy.\n  I regret to say, however, that I may have been wrong. I may have \noverestimated the administration's commitment to increasing domestic \nenergy supplies, particularly, if those increases do not come easily or \ncheaply. The Budget Blueprint does not appear to include the increases \nin supply that the President and the Secretary say we need. Why? \nBecause, in its budget plan, the White House has drastically pulled \nback from a whole-hearted dedication to research and development.\n  The proposed budget for the Department of Energy's Office of Fossil \nEnergy would underfund--severely underfund--many of our most important \nfossil energy research programs. It is true that the President will \ncarry through on his promise of proposing $2 billion over the next ten \nyears for the Clean Coal Technology program, a program I started in \n1985 and one which has been one of the most successful public/private \npartnerships ever created. Unfortunately, while fulfilling his campaign \npromise related to clean coal, the President will do so at the expense \nof the other gas, oil, and coal research programs.\n  Specifically, the Budget Blueprint states that Clean Coal funding, \nwhich the Secretary of Energy has said would amount to $150 million in \nFY 2002, ``. . . would come from a consolidated budget that redirects \nresearch funds from the current Fossil Energy research and development \ncoal budget, matched with balances in the Clean Coal technology \naccount. . . .'' However, the ``balances'' in the Clean Coal account \nthe Blueprint talks about are only $33.7 million, less than 2 percent \nof the $2 billion commitment. Consequently, we must conclude that, for \nall intents and purposes, the entire cost of the Administration's Clean \nCoal proposal is going to come at the expense of basic research and \ndevelopment in the areas of coal, natural gas and oil.\n  For Fiscal Year 2001, Congress provided $445 million in Fossil Energy \nResearch and Development funding. Taking $150 million for Clean Coal \nfunding out of that $445 million amounts to a 34 percent cut and would \ndevastate the kind of research that is critical to this nation's energy \nsecurity.\n  How is one to reconcile this inconsistency? On the one hand, the \nAdministration is adamant that our domestic energy supplies must be \nincreased. Yet, at the same time, it fails to fund the research \nnecessary to make that happen. The natural gas everyone wants to get \ntheir hands on is not going to rise from the ground by itself. Nor is \nthe coal that currently supplies fifty-four percent of our nation's \nelectricity. There may be those who wish it were not so, but the fact \nis that coal remains today--and will for the next several decades--our \nnation's cheapest and most abundant energy resource. But we cannot get \nto those domestic energy resources and we cannot get them out of the \nground in an economical and environmentally sound manner unless we are \nwilling to investment in the research that will make the technology \npossible.\n  Thus, the amendment I am offering today will restore the $150 million \nin fossil energy research and development that is so important to this \nnation's energy independence. This amendment, which I urge my \ncolleagues to support, would increase the budget authority allocations \nfor Function 270, the Energy Function, by $150 million in Fiscal Year \n2002.\n  We do not need to wait for the Administration's Energy Task Force to \ntell us that we need more domestic energy. That is a fact we already \nknow. The President knows it, the Secretary of Energy knows it, and, I \nsuspect, the people of California now know it. Adopting my amendment \nwill be the first step in ensuring that this nation has the energy it \nneeds. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so that we can \nget about the task of ensuring that what is happening in California \ndoes not spread throughout the United States.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 209\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am today offering an amendment to the \nSenate Budget Resolution for fiscal year 2002 that will increase \ndomestic discretionary spending for rural water and wastewater \nprograms. In all parts of the nation, there are men, women, and \nchildren who live every day without the basic necessities of clean, \nsafe, drinking water or sanitary wastewater disposal. This is a great \nnation, and over the past decade we have witnessed tremendous gains in \nprosperity for much of our population. It would, therefore, surprise a \ngreat many of us to realize the poor living conditions with which many \nAmericans have to face day-in and day-out.\n  The United States Department of Agriculture administers a program \nthrough its Rural Utilities Service that provides loans and grants to \nrural communities with populations less than 10,000 to help establish, \nexpand, or upgrade water and wastewater systems in all states. This \nprogram is one of the most successful of all federal programs. It has, \nperhaps, the best loan default rate within the federal government, it \nprovides an essential catalyst for economic development, and it helps \ncombat conditions which put the health of Americans at risk.\n  But even more important than all those attributes, it would help \nerase the schism that separates the ``haves'' from the ``have-nots'' \nacross our land. Consider for a moment how most of us take for granted \nthe clean glass of water that we can draw from our nearest faucet. \nConsider how most of us expect our streets and waterways to be free \nfrom flows of raw sewage. Then imagine yourself in small communities \nand rural areas all across America where clean water means dipping a \nglass in a rain barrel and wastewater disposal means the nearest ditch. \nAmerica is greater than that.\n  In 1997, the Environmental Protection Agency released a report on \nunmet wastewater improvement needs in rural areas of this country. That \ndocument estimated that nearly $20 billion was needed to establish or \nupgrade systems necessary to avoid runoff of failed septic systems, or \nworse, from polluting our rivers and streams and posing serious threats \nto public health. The EPA is now working on a new report on this \nsubject, due to be released in the coming year, and I fear that we will \nlearn that the costs necessary to correct these sad conditions have \nseriously increased.\n  In February of this year, the EPA issued a new report on the state of \nunmet drinking water needs across America. That document finds that for \nrural areas and communities of 10,000 or less, the total unmet need is \nnearly $48 billion. Of that total, $33.5 billion has been identified as \nan immediate need. Even with the surpluses now before the Congress, we \nmay not be able to meet this entire need overnight, but we can, indeed, \ndo better than we have.\n  As of last month, the Rural Utilities Service at the Department of \nAgriculture had a backlog of applications awaiting funding totaling \nnearly $800 million in grants and $2.2 billion in loans. This backlog, \nwhich has skyrocketed in this fiscal year, includes applications from \nevery state and I know every Senator is aware of the benefits of this \nprogram. My friend from Alaska, the Chairman of the Senate \nAppropriations Committee knows how important this program is for rural \nAlaskan Native Villages. My friend from New Mexico, Chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee, knows how important this program is to the \nColonias region of his state. I can provide many more from my home \nstate of West Virginia.\n  The amendment I am offering will provide a modest investment in the \nhealth and security of the American people. By increasing the total \nbudget authority of this program by $1 billion--which is a mere 2 \npercent of the outstanding need identified in February by the EPA for \ndrinking water systems alone--we can begin to help speed up services to \nrural families in every state. With an additional $1 billion, we can \nmake gains in meeting the ever-increasing demands of unfunded \napplications at the Department of Agriculture. There are certain \nfunctions\n\n[[Page S3665]]\n\nof government that go straight to the basic fabric of the social \ncontract, and helping provide all Americans with the basic necessities \nof life is paramount among them. My amendment supports this noble role \nof government, and I ask all Senators to join me in its passage.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we have no objection to the amendments \nbeing adopted en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendments are agreed \nto en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 205, 207, 209) en bloc were agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 317\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we call up amendment 317.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Domenici), for Mr. Graham, \n     and Mrs. Hutchison, proposes an amendment numbered 317.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To extend the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) \n               Supplemental Grants for fiscal year 2002)\n\n       On page 4, line 2, increase the amount by $319,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 16, increase the amount by $80,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 17, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 18, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 19, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 20, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 21, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 22, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 4, line 23, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 1, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 2, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 7, decrease the amount by $80,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 8, decrease the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 9, decrease the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 10, decrease the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 11, decrease the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 12, decrease the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 13, decrease the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 14, decrease the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 15, decrease the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 5, line 16, decrease the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 32, line 15, increase the amount by $319,000,000.\n       On page 32, line 16, increase the amount by $80,000,000.\n       On page 32, line 20, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 32, line 24, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 33, line 3, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 33, line 7, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 33, line 11, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 33, line 15, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 33, line 19, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 33, line 23, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n       On page 34, line 3, increase the amount by $25,000,000.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this Graham amendment numbered 317 is \ncosponsored by Senator Hutchison of Texas.\n  I understand that Senator Hutchinson is here on the floor, and he \nwould like to share part of the discussion on the affirmative side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I applaud Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison \nof Texas for her leadership and for her aggressive work on this \namendment, also Senator Bob Graham of the State of Florida, who has \ndone such great work.\n  This amendment extends for fiscal year 2002 the supplemental grants \nfor rapidly growing States under the Temporary Assistance for Needy \nFamilies program. These States include Arkansas, Florida, Texas, and \nabout 14 other States that are dramatically impacted by this \nsituation--all of which receive lower levels of block grant funding per \nchild than other States.\n  The TANF program was created back in 1996 to provide States with \nflexible block grants to meet the needs of low-income families trying \nto get off traditional welfare rolls. The program has worked well. It \nhas been successful.\n  Flexibility with this funding is vital to support low-income \nindividuals and families and keep them in the workplace.\n  These supplemental grants are set to expire. Unless we do something, \nit is going to dramatically negatively impact these States.\n  The child poverty rate in the States affected is 19\\1/2\\ percent--a \nquarter above the child poverty rate in other States.\n  These supplemental grants are very important. They need to be \nextended.\n  I think this has bipartisan support. I appreciate Senator Hutchison \nallowing me to speak on behalf of this amendment.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I applaud my colleague from Arkansas for \nthe very excellent description that he gave.\n  Essentially, we are asking for a 1-year bridge between the time that \nthese supplemental funds will expire in the fall of 2001 and the time \nthat we reauthorize the total Welfare-to-Work Program in 2002.\n  It is a very important amendment for those States that already start \noff getting the least amount of funding to meet their welfare-to-work \nrequirements. Because of the growth in low per-capita income, they are \nparticularly in need of this support. Congress recognized that it would \ncontinue the program until we reauthorize Welfare-to-Work.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, there is nothing further on our side to \nbe added.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 317) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank both Senators for their cooperation.\n  Mr. President, I say to the ranking Member that Senator Schumer still \nhas an issue.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we understand that Senator Stabenow is \nnext in line, and we understand that she is going to talk about an \namendment and withdraw it when she is finished.\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 313\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today with an amendment that I \nwish we were able to pass at this moment. I realize the votes are not \nhere. But in order to demonstrate grave concern on this side of the \naisle about what is happening to the Medicare trust fund, I submit with \nSenator Bob Graham, a leader on this issue, an amendment that would \nprotect the Medicare Part A trust fund by raising a point of order on \nthe process, and hopefully it will be put into place before we are \nfinished with this budget resolution.\n  It is supported by the American Health Care Association, and the \nAmerican Hospital Association.\n  I ask unanimous consent that two letters in support be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              American Health Care\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 6, 2001.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the 12,000 non-profit and \n     for-profit nursing facility, subacute, assisted living, and \n     ICF/MR providers represented by the American Health Care \n     Association nationwide, I am writing to strongly support your \n     amendment to the FY 2002 Budget Resolution.\n       Your amendment to require a 60 vote majority in the Senate \n     to approve new programs that tap into the Medicare Part A\n\n[[Page S3666]]\n\n     trust fund is critical to protecting the trust fund from new \n     spending programs that would threaten its viability. As we \n     saw from the bankruptcies that followed the BBA of 97, \n     funding levels for skilled nursing facility patients cannot \n     withstand additional cuts to the program that may be forced \n     if additional benefits are financed out of the HI trust fund. \n     Indeed, the only way to ensure the adequate financing of all \n     of our laudable programs is to increase funding to Medicare \n     Part A.\n       The approximately 2 million Medicare residents who receive \n     skilled nursing care in our homes every year depend on the \n     solvency of the program. The skilled nursing and \n     rehabilitative services we provide are often the difference \n     between life and death for our patients.\n       Your amendment is critical to ``keeping the promise'' our \n     country made to the seniors we care for.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                William R. Abrams,\n     Chief Operating Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                American Hospital Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, April 5, 2001.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Graham: On behalf of the American Hospital \n     Association (AHA), I would like to express our strong support \n     of your amendment to H. Con. Res. 83, the fiscal year (FY) \n     2002 budget resolution requiring a ``super majority'' of 60 \n     votes in the Senate in order to spend Hospital Insurance (HI) \n     Trust Fund dollars for non-Part A services.\n       The AHA represents nearly 5,000 hospitals, health systems, \n     networks and other health care provider members.\n       The Medicare program is expected to experience very rapid \n     growth over the next decade as our nation's 78 million ``baby \n     boomers'' begin to retire. The Part A Trust Fund, which is \n     supported by a payroll tax, is projected to see its \n     obligations exceed its income by 2015, and its assets could \n     be exhausted by 2029.\n       We believe that the Part A Trust Fund should be used for \n     the purpose for which it was intended: to provide \n     beneficiaries with the highest quality hospital acute care \n     services. Congress must be careful not to dilute the trust \n     fund or divert dollars currently in the trust fund for other \n     purposes. It is imperative that Congress avoids legislation \n     that accelerates the insolvency of the Medicare Part A Trust \n     Fund. We need to ensure that Medicare Part A services are \n     there when our seniors need them.\n       Since its inception, the Medicare program has ensured \n     seniors access to high quality, affordable health care. It is \n     incumbent upon all of us to ensure that the program is \n     preserved, protected and strengthened for future generations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Rick Pollack,\n                                         Executive Vice President.\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, we have been trying all week to pass a \nprescription drug plan under Medicare to update it. We don't support \nraiding it, which is what is happening now. We need to be putting in \nplace prescription drug coverage under Medicare. It came before this \nbody on Tuesday with a 50-50 vote. Unfortunately, the tie vote was not \ncast. Instead, we now find ourselves in a situation where Medicare is \nbeing used as a contingency fund.\n  This is not the direction in which the American people wish us to go. \nWe need to be strengthening and updating Medicare, not dipping into it \nand spending it as part of a contingency fund.\n  Unfortunately, with the President's budget and tax cut combined, it \nis impossible to do what has been suggested without using the Medicare \ntrust fund. That is my concern.\n  The message that the American people want us to send loudly and \nclearly is that we need to update Medicare. We need to strengthen it. \nWe don't need to raid it. We need to update it, not raid it. I am very \nhopeful that this will be the goal and the ultimate conclusion.\n  I know that is what we have been fighting for on this side of the \naisle since this budget process began.\n  I yield the time and ask unanimous consent that the amendment be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want everybody in the Senate to know \nthat I don't have a sign. I can't put up a sign about our position. But \nI want everyone to know that we are as concerned about not spending the \nMedicare Part A trust fund as anybody. Republicans don't take a \nbackseat on that issue. This budget does not spend any of the funds \nthat are being alluded to. So the sign could be placed on our side of \nthe aisle, and we would agree with it.\n  Actually, I don't think we need to explain our position. We will just \ndo it with our words. We don't need the amendment. It has been \nwithdrawn. Frankly, the budget takes care of that problem. The \nRepublicans are united. We are not going to spend Medicare funds for \nanything other than Medicare.\n  I yield the floor at this point and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I advise my colleague that while we are \nwaiting for some additional amendments to arrive that are being \nredrafted in compliance with our agreement, the Senator from Louisiana \nwould like to talk for just 3 minutes with respect to an issue in which \nshe has been deeply involved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair and the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. President, I commend the Senators from New Mexico and North \nDakota for their extraordinary management skills in helping to bring us \nto the final point of this week-long debate. I appreciate their \npatience in working with each Member on issues that are so important to \nus and to our States.\n  While the staff is working on some details of some of the last few \namendments that need to be offered, I thought I would make mention of \none particular tax cut that is so widely supported on both sides of \nthis aisle and something on which a group of us have worked now for \nabout 2 years. I am hoping the language will be included in the final \nnegotiations and that has to do with the tax credit for adoption.\n  It is a tax credit that is really one of the smallest calls on the \ntax cut, on the budget in terms of the dollar amount. It is small, but \nit goes a long way because it helps families who are trying to open up \ntheir homes, and have opened up their hearts, to adopt a child--either \nan infant or a toddler or an older child; either a child through a \ntraditional adoption through an agency in the United States or the \nadoption of a child from another country--and we have seen that number \nincrease substantially, which is really wonderful--or it helps us find \nhomes for the more than 100,000 children in foster care who deserve so \nmuch to have a home and a family to call their own.\n  I want to take a moment while we have some time to congratulate the \nleaders of the House. I understand there are 275 cosponsors in the \nHouse of Representatives for this particular tax cut or tax relief.\n  There are many good ways to give Americans tax relief. We have heard \nthat debate now on this floor--from the marriage penalty relief, to \nmarginal tax relief, which I support, to estate tax relief or reform--\nbut I want to take a moment to thank Senators and House Members who \ncontinue to speak out for this adoption tax credit--to extend it, to \ndouble it, and to fix it so that it works for foster care children and \nso that we give families a broad choice, if they have made that \nterrific decision to adopt children, to help them with those initial \nexpenses, which can be quite high.\n  In fact, there are families who, as you know, travel to many parts of \nthe world, and not only are there expenses associated with the agencies \nor the attorneys or facilitators with whom they are working but also \nthere are the travel expenses.\n  So this $10,000 tax credit we are proposing--it is $5,000 now, and we \npropose to double it, extend it, and make it work, which was the \noriginal intent of the law--for children being adopted out of foster \ncare. It is something we have debated this week and will continue to \ndebate.\n  I know Senator Grassley, the chairman of the committee, Senator \nBaucus, our ranking member, Senator Breaux, and others have expressed \nan interest in being able to include this particular item in the tax \npackage that is finally passed. I know there are many families in \nLouisiana, in Georgia, the State of the Presiding Officer, and in all \nof our States who would welcome our fixing, extending, and doubling \nthis tax credit because it can\n\n[[Page S3667]]\n\nmake the difference in finding a child a home who perhaps would never \notherwise be able to find one and helping those parents with at least \nsome of the expenses associated with the cost of raising children \ntoday.\n  So I am really very hopeful. There is no amendment pending, but there \nis language that hopefully will be included in this final package.\n  I thank the managers for giving me time to talk about this important \nissue. Again, I want to recognize the great support in the House of \nRepresentatives--by both Republicans and Democrats--for this particular \ntax credit.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, awhile ago I spoke in opposition to the \namendment Senator Graham had originally offered that I believe the \nSenator from Michigan withdrew a while ago. I am not sure when I spoke \nin opposition to it that I had the microphone on. If you wouldn't mind, \nmay I remake that statement for 30 seconds. When I spoke previously, I \nwasn't sure we were heard, which was my fault, no one else's.\n  There was a sign up on that amendment with reference to Medicare that \nwe want to make sure we don't take anything out of Medicare and spend \nit on anything else or use it for tax cuts. I said: We don't have a \nsign. All we can do is use our words.\n  I repeat them: There is nothing in this budget that we intend to in \nany way spend Medicare money on other than Medicare. That has been our \ncommitment; that will remain our commitment. We will not spend Medicare \nmoney on anything other than Medicare. We won't violate that at any \ntime in this budget.\n  Frankly, I will repeat it every time we have an opportunity. Those \nsupporting this budget, when we finish tonight, need not have any fear \nthat we are going to in any way minimize the totality of that Medicare \nfund. It will be there.\n  With that, I am prepared to move on to another amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 303\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. \n     Bingaman, for himself, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Enzi, Mr. \n     Johnson, Mr. Domenici, and Mr. Conrad, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 303.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To establish a reserve fund for permanent, mandatory funding \n       for Payments In Lieu of Taxes and Refuge Revenue Sharing)\n\n       Insert at the appropriate place the following:\n\n     SEC.  . RESERVE FUND FOR PAYMENTS IN LIEU OF TAXES AND REFUGE \n                   REVENUE SHARING.\n\n       If the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the \n     Senate reports a bill, or an amendment thereto is offered, or \n     a conference report thereon is submitted, that provides full, \n     permanent, mandatory funding for Payments In Lieu of Taxes \n     for entitlement lands under chapter 69 of title 31, United \n     States Code and for Refuge Revenue Sharing, the chairman of \n     the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may increase the \n     aggregates, functional totals, allocations and other \n     appropriate levels and limits in this resolution by up to \n     $353,000,000 in new budget authority and outlays for fiscal \n     year 2002 and $3,709,000,000 in new budget authority and \n     outlays for the period of fiscal years 2002 through 2011, \n     provided that such legislation will not, when taken together \n     with all other previously enacted legislation, reduce the on-\n     budget surplus below the level of the Medicare Hospital \n     Insurance Trust Fund surplus in any fiscal year provided in \n     this resolution.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be made a \ncosponsor of the amendment, as well as Senator Conrad.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, Senators Thomas, Baucus, Enzi, and \nJohnson are also cosponsors of the amendment.\n  I thank my colleague for his strong support for this effort, as well \nas Senator Conrad. What this deals with is the payments in lieu of \ntaxes which are very important for counties in States such as our own \nwhere there are substantial amounts of Federal property. There is no \ntax base, essentially. There is no way for those counties to raise the \nfunds needed to operate county government.\n  This has been a program for some years, and we have recognized this, \nbut we have not made the funds permanent. This year in this session of \nCongress, we are going to try to pass legislation which would authorize \npermanent funding for this. If we are able to, then we would like to \nhave that permitted here for consideration by the Senate.\n  This is budget neutral. This does not change the figures in the \nbudget, but it is a very important initiative and one that I believe \nvery strongly the Senate ought to approve.\n  I appreciate the support of all my colleagues and all the cosponsors \nand urge colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 303) was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this amendment is budget neutral. \nClearly, there is nothing added. This amendment says if in the future \ncertain things happen to the PILT fund such that it is higher than in \nthis budget, then allowances can be made for it. I understand, as one \nof the cosponsors, that that is all the amendment does.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we see this as a budget-neutral amendment \nbecause of the language of the amendment that provides that only if the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources reports a bill that provides \nfull, permanent, mandatory funding for PILT, this actually comes \nthrough the authorizing committee.\n  On that basis, this is an important amendment. With payment in lieu \nof taxes, the Federal Government has made a commitment to those \nlocalities within which they have property that they are going to be a \ngood neighbor, that they are going to pay the taxes anybody else would \npay.\n  I salute the Senator from New Mexico. This is an important amendment \nthat says the Federal Government keeps its word. It is as simple as \nthat.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

Mr. President, I would like to go in whatever order the \nformat is. If it is appropriate at this time, I will go now.\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself, Senators Bingaman, Wyden, Edwards, Rockefeller, Corzine, \nMurray, and Clinton and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier in the week the Senate accepted \nan amendment from Senator Smith and Senator Biden to provide resources \nfor a health insurance program for basically the parents of those \nchildren who are eligible for the CHIP program. That money would be \ntaken out of the contingency fund. This amendment continues that \nprogram for the 10-year period. Therefore, it would take some $50 \nbillion out of the tax cut, and the use of those resources would be to \nbuild on the CHIP program which has been so effective for the parents \nof those CHIP workers, who are American workers at the lower end of the \neconomic scale. They cannot afford health insurance, and the provisions \nwe have in the current budget of some $80 billion could be used as tax \nincentives for workers.\n  These workers are not going to be paying the taxes. And even with a \nrefundable tax credit, it will not be sufficient to afford the health \ninsurance. This amendment will help them to do so.\n  I hope the Senate will take this, with the amendment that is in the \nbudget, and that we will have with that a combination of this amendment \nand the tax programs that will reach out to look after the health \ninsurance needs of the hardest workers in this country who are pressed \nevery single day for lack of health insurance. That is effectively what \nthe amendment does.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield the remaining 40 seconds to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts \nfor offering this amendment. This is a very important amendment. We \nhave over 6 million children in this country who do not have health \ninsurance. Of course, their parents do not as well. One way to get \nthose children covered with health insurance is to get their parents \neligible, too. This program tries to do that. There are 129,000 of \nthese children who are uninsured in my own State.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we need to have a quorum call for a \nlittle while while Senators meet. We are just going to have to wait a \nwhile.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 218) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, to alert colleagues, we are getting close \nto the end of our business on the budget resolution. I want to alert \ncolleagues that we still have a few matters that require working out so \nthat we can conclude business. I ask staff who are working on those \namendments to inform the managers as to the status of those works in \nprogress so that we can conclude business expeditiously. I don't know \nif the chairman has an observation or statement at this point. I think \nwe are very close to being able to conclude our business.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, first let me say I am very grateful to \neverybody for being accommodating. We are just about ready to adopt the \nbudget resolution. We have two amendments that are being worked on. \nThey should be worked out soon. I don't think it will be very long \nbefore we start the vote. We will be ready to wrap it up. While that is \ncontinuing on the other side, and they have amendments they are going \nto be working on, I want to say this process is a very tough process. \nIt is very difficult when you have five or six votes to spare on one \nside or the other. It is difficult when it is tied and, as a matter of \nfact, when you have 50 Senators on each side of the aisle and you are \nattempting to pass a budget resolution--actually, on a budget \nresolution, a lot of things are voted on that don't mean what they say.\n  But we have gotten into the habit of doing that, so everybody thinks \nthey do what they say. We will try to get out of conference as quickly \nas we can. It is my understanding that we have resolved the issues on \nthat side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I say to the chairman, the amendment we \npreviously discussed, the Bingaman amendment, as modified--the \nSenator's side has a copy of that. This is the low-income heating \nassistance amendment. We dealt with the PILT amendment. We would be \nprepared to deal with this one as well and be closer to a conclusion.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 302\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. Senator Bingaman \nhas an amendment No. 302 regarding LIHEAP. I ask that it be appropriate \nto modify that amendment. Two of the cosponsors are Senators Murkowski \nand Jeffords. I ask that I be made a cosponsor also.\n  I send this amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Domenici], for Mr. \n     Bingaman, for himself, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Dorgan, \n     Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Leahy, Ms. Lincoln, \n     Mr. Reid, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Schumer, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. \n     Domenici, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Murkowski, and Mr. Jeffords, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 302, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 32, line 15, increase the amount by $2,600,000,000.\n       On page 32, line 16, increase the amount by $2,600,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 15, decrease the amount by $2,600,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 16, decrease the amount by $2,600,000,000.\n\n\n[[Page S3669]]\n\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, this is budget neutral.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is correct. I also would like to be shown as \nan original cosponsor, if I might. I ask unanimous consent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Stevens). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if I might indicate to the chairman, we \nhave one amendment on our side, the Graham SSBG amendment. It is being \nmodified in accordance with the request of the other side. As I \nunderstand it, the Senator is on his way to the floor with that \namendment. That would bring us even closer to conclusion.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. The Senator is correct. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I understand that on the Bingaman LIHEAP \namendment we did not complete action; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair informs the Senator that is correct.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We have no objection on this side.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have no objection on this side. In fact, we support it \non this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 302), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we modified the amendment. Now we need to \nmove to consideration of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was adopted. It has been agreed to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 316, As Modified\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, our final amendment on this side is an \namendment from the Senator from Florida. If we can go to that \namendment, we will be very close to completing amendments on this side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask the distinguished Senator, has he modified the \namendment so it is budget neutral?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. It is. We made that modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, briefly, this amendment fulfills a \ncommitment that the Congress made in 1996 to the States upon the \nadoption of Welfare-to-Work, and that is that we would support the \nSocial Services Block Grant Program which is a program within Social \nSecurity which has provided for a number of important programs that \nhave assisted people on welfare, getting to work, and particularly \nchild care programs. This has broad support. Senators Hutchison, \nGrassley, Collins, Snowe, Rockefeller, Carnahan, Murray, Schumer, \nWellstone, Kennedy, Landrieu, Kerry, and Bingaman are some of the \ncosponsors of this amendment. I believe it has broad bipartisan \nsupport. I urge its adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida [Mr. Graham], for himself, Mrs. \n     Hutchison, Mr. Grassley, Ms. Collins, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \n     Rockefeller, Mrs. Carnahan, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n     Wellstone, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. \n     Bingaman, proposes an amendment numbered 316, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To restore the Social Services Block Grants to $2.38 billion \n    in accordance with the statutory agreement made in the Personal \n    Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996)\n\n       On page 27, line 3, increase the amount by $680,000,000.\n       On page 27, line 4, increase the amount by $680,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 15, decrease the amount by $680,000,000.\n       On page 43, line 16, decrease the amount by $680,000,000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator seek recognition?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Only to say we have no objection to the amendment. As \ndrafted, it is budget neutral, and we accept it on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other comments concerning this \namendment?\n  Without objection, the amendment, as modified, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 316), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                                 AMTRAK\n\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, as we debate the budget resolution, I rise \ntoday with the distinguished Senators from Texas, South Dakota, \nMississippi and Massachusetts to bring to the attention of our \ncolleagues the urgent need to provide Amtrak and the states with the \nstable source of capital funding they need for a national system of \nhigh speed rail corridors. Specifically, we would like to discuss the \nneed for action on S. 250, the High Speed Rail Investment Act of 2001. \nWe introduced this legislation earlier this year, and already more than \n50 of our colleagues from both sides of the aisle have signed on with \nus.\n  This bill is cosponsored by both the majority and minority leaders, \nwhich brings me to the point of my comments today, as we are \nconsidering the budget resolution, that will set our priorities for \nthis year's session of Congress.\n  Last December, on the very last day of the last session, I took the \nfloor to discuss identical legislation with Senator Lott, Senator \nDaschle, and other leaders of our body. Our leaders were gracious \nenough to make a commitment to bring this legislation to the Finance \nCommittee, on which they both serve, and to the Senate floor, during \nthis session.\n  For reasons beyond our control, we could not include important \nlegislation in the omnibus appropriations bill, but many of us in the \nSenate, and I was among them, would not take ``no'' for an answer. My \ngreat friend Senator Roth, along with Senators Moynihan and Lautenberg, \nhad worked too long on this issue to let this die.\n  While we could not get this done last year, we got the next best \nthing: the word of our leaders, on both sides of the aisle that this \nlegislation would be on their list of priorities for this year. So as \nwe discuss our priorities in this budget resolution, it is important to \nhear from them that the High Speed Rail Investment Act is still on that \nlist.\n  I yield to Senator Hutchison, who has done so much to promote \nrational, efficient surface transportation in this country, including \nthe indispensable component of passenger rail.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Delaware. I join with him in \nthanking our leadership for their commitment to us at the end of the \nlast Congress. As we discuss the budget resolution, it is important to \nmake it clear, on the record, that our determination to pass the High \nSpeed Rail Investment Act this year, as soon as possible, is as strong \nas ever.\n  Virtually all of our key modes of transportation are under stress \ntoday. From our overcrowded highways to our packed airports, we are \nlosing billions of dollars in wasted time just trying to get to where \nwe need to go. And lying right along side those crowded highways, \nrunning right past those overloaded airports, are neglected rail lines \nthat could be carrying passengers between our nations cities.\n  That is why so many Senators have already joined us in support of our \nlegislation, and that is why the nation's governors, mayors, state \nlegislators, and many others support us, as well.\n  I ask our leaders directly if this budget resolution, which \nestablishes the overall priorities for this session of the Senate, \nmakes room for the commitment they made here on the floor last year.\n  Does the distinguished minority leader care to respond?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to respond to my good friend, the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas. She, and my colleague from Delaware, \nSenator Biden, are correct. Last session we made a promise to consider \nlegislation\n\n[[Page S3670]]\n\nto provide Amtrak with the authority to issue tax credit bonds for \ncapital improvements. This bonding authority is critical to Amtrak's \nfuture and to the economic health of the Northeast and many other areas \nof the country.\n  Last year, I discussed this issue with members of my caucus. We had a \nvery spirited discussion on the morning of December 15, and I know how \nstrongly they support Amtrak and this legislation. We kept our promise \nand re-introduced this praiseworthy legislation earlier this year with \n51 original co-sponsors. Amtrak supporters will not give up on passing \nit and we promised to help them accomplish this task. I yield the floor \nto the majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I thank the Democratic leader and praise his \ncommitment and dedication to this issue. I am honored to be working \nwith him, and my other colleagues, on strengthening our national rail \npassenger system. I have been an active supporter, and was very much \ninvolved a couple of years ago when we passed the Amtrak legislation. I \nthink we need it.\n  Now, I must confess one of the reasons I think we need it is I want \nus to have good service, not just in the Northeast, but I also would \nlike to have access for my own State of Mississippi to be able to get \nto Atlanta and Washington and Dallas. We are the beneficiaries of \nAmtrak service. I think we have to support it.\n  What's most important is that we give Amtrak an opportunity to \nsucceed. If you do not have adequate capital investment, if you don't \nhave modern equipment, if you don't have the new fast trains, if you \ndon't have a rapid rail system, it will not work.\n  So I support this legislation, and will work with my colleagues to \nget the appropriate hearings in the Finance Committee and hopefully in \nthe Commerce Committee. I am on both committees, and Senator Daschle \nand I will work with the ranking member and the chairman to get \nhearings and move this legislation.\n  When we talk about bipartisanship, transportation is an issue on \nwhich we have been able to work together in a bipartisan way, whether \nit is roads, AIR-21, TEA-21, Amtrak, rapid rail system. We can do it \nagain, and I am committed to ensure that we do.\n  I now yield to the Distinguished Senator from the state of \nMassachusetts, Senator Kerry.\n  Mr. KERRY. The leaders are exactly right. There was a lot of \npassionate dialogue in our caucus last year about the High Speed Rail \nInvestment Act, and the minority leader listened to all of us very \ncarefully. Our caucus, I must say, was united in its commitment to the \nnotion that those of us who cared about this innovative bonding \nlegislation needed to have some kind of response on the floor that \nindicated how we could proceed with this legislation. I am pleased with \nthe commitment made by the leadership last year, and I am pleased with \nthe quick introduction and overwhelming support for this legislation \nthis year. I am also very grateful for the majority leader's \ncommitment, given last December, to getting movement on this bill \nwithin the first six months of this session.\n  As summer approaches, intercity travelers can look forward to \nbottlenecked highways and airports strained beyond capacity. Is it any \nwonder that Amtrak's ridership is on the rise? But in order to improve \nour ability to travel the country without delay, the Federal Government \nneeds to provide business travelers and vacationers with a third \noption. At the moment, the Federal Government invests in road-building \nand air transportation, but only about 5 percent of our transportation \nbudget over the last 30 years has gone to help Amtrak provide top-\nquality intercity rail service. We've got to do more in order to have a \ntruly intermodal transportation network, and a large majority of this \nbody recognizes that fact.\n  Fifty-six Members of the Senate are now cosponsors of this \nlegislation, Mr. President. As I have said many times before, high-\nspeed rail is not a partisan issue. It is not a regional issue. It is \nnot an urban issue. So I look forward to building on the legacy of \nSenator Moynihan and Senator Lautenberg and completing what is \nabsolutely essential for this country, which is a high-speed intercity \nrail system of which the Nation can be proud.\n\n\n                 funding for graduate medical education\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I would like to raise an important \nissue impacting close to 60 independent children's hospitals across the \nNation and numerous sick children and their families: the need for full \nfunding for graduate medical education (GME) at our Nation's \nfreestanding children's hospitals to train pediatricians.\n  Independent children's hospitals face a serious financial burden and \ncompetitive disadvantage because they do not receive GME support \nthrough Medicare. Medicare is the only source of significant and stable \nGME support available to hospitals for the training of medical \nresidents. In the absence of any movement towards GME reform, the \nchildren's hospitals GME discretionary grant program was enacted to \nensure that these institutions could sustain their teaching programs--\nprograms that are important not only to the future of these children's \nhospitals and their essential services, but also to the future of the \npediatric workforce and pediatric research.\n  The Lewin Group, an independent firm, has calculated that pediatric \nresidents at free-standing children's hospitals would receive a total \nof $285 million from the Federal Government if they were reimbursed \naccording to the formulas established for residents at other teaching \nhospitals. Consequently, I believe that Congress must commit to provide \n$285 million for the children's hospitals GME program in the fiscal \nyear 2002 Labor/HHS/Education appropriations bill.\n  California has six independent children's hospitals across the State. \nThese hospitals provided state-of-the-art care and conduct ground \nbreaking research to make life better for our children. Equally \nimportant, these teaching hospitals train future pediatricians. Without \nthe necessary funds, the children's hospitals in my State will be \nunable to train pediatricians to provide the care and conduct the \nresearch necessary to improve the quality of life for some of \nCalifornia's sickest children. These relatively few institutions play \nan indispensable role in our children's care, serving as centers of \nexcellence in pediatric medicine and as a major piece of the pediatric \nhealth care safety net.\n  I ask the Senator from Missouri if he has anything he would add at \nthis point.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank Senator Feinstein for her comments. \nOur goal here is simple: We must, once and for all, treat children's \nhospitals the same as we do other teaching hospitals when it comes to \nfunding physician training. This year, that means Congress must fully \nfund the Pediatric GME program as its authorized level of $285 million \nin fiscal year 2002.\n  Two years ago, Congress finally recognized this need by passing \nlegislation I sponsored with my friend, former Senator Kerrey of \nNebraska, to authorize the children's hospitals GME initiative. Over \nthe last couple of years, I have led the effort to fund this important \ninitiative.\n  Last year, Congress appropriated $235 million for the children's \nhospitals GME program--not quite enough for full parity with other \nteaching hospitals, but a good step forward. This year, we need to \ncontinue that momentum and finally treat all teaching hospitals \nequally. If it is important to train a doctor who treats adults, it's \nequally as important to train a doctor who treats children. We must \nmake our policies reflect that important principle, and I am confident \nwe can get there this year.\n\n  I see the Senator from Massachusetts on the floor, and I ask if he \nhas anything he wishes to add.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank Senator Bond for his comments. I could not agree \nmore with the Senator from Missouri. We must work together to fully \nfund the Pediatric GME program at $285 million in fiscal year 2002.\n  Independent children's hospitals are experiencing very serious \nfinancial challenges that affect their ability to sustain their \nmissions. In addition to the challenges of covering the costs of their \nacademic programs, they include challenges in covering the higher costs \nof sicker patients in a price competitive marketplace, meeting the \ncosts of uncovered services such as child protection services and \npoison control centers, and assuming the costs of devoting a large \nportion of their patient care to children from low-income families.\n  On average, independent acute care children's hospitals devote nearly \nhalf\n\n[[Page S3671]]\n\nof their patient care to children who are assisted by Medicaid or are \nuninsured. They devote more than 75 percent of their care for children \nwith one or more chronic or congenital conditions. For children with \nrare and complex conditions, independent children's hospitals often \nprovide the majority of care in their region or even nationwide.\n  Furthermore, independent children's hospitals--including Boston \nChildren's--serve as advocates for the public health of children, and \nthey are essential to the health care safety net for children of low-\nincome families. Our children are our most vulnerable patients. \nPediatricians and pediatric specialists provide a crucial voice for \nthese children who are not able to ensure their own health care. \nWithout funding for this training even our Nation's number one \nChildren's Hospital, Boston Children's, will no longer be able to \nensure that our children receive state-of-the-art care targeted to \ntheir special needs.\n  The Senator from Ohio and I have worked together on this issue over \nthe years. I ask the Senator from Ohio, would he agree that graduate \nmedical education programs at children's hospitals are essential to \nmeeting the health care needs of our Nation's children?\n  Mr. DeWINE. I agree wholeheartedly. I appreciate the comments from \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, and I would like to mention a few more \nreasons why these funds are so important.\n  Fully funding the GME program will enable our independent children's \nteaching hospitals to sustain their core missions medical care, \nteaching and research which benefit all children. These children's \nhospitals serve as the health care safety net for low income children \nand are often the sole regional providers of many critical pediatric \nservices. Their teaching mission is also essential. Even though they \ncomprise less than one percent of all hospitals, children's hospitals \ntrain 5 percent of all physicians, nearly 30 percent of all \npediatricians, almost 50 percent of all pediatric specialists, and two-\nthirds of all pediatric critical care doctors. The research that our \ncountry's pediatric academic medical centers perform is also essential \nand the need for more pediatric researchers is growing. Fully funding \nthe GME program within our children's teaching hospitals is an \ninvestment in children's health that I would urge my colleagues to \nsupport.\n\n\n                    DOD CIVILIAN WORKFORCE RESHAPING\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, last year, my colleague from Ohio, \nSenator DeWine and I introduced the Department of Defense Civilian \nWorkforce Realignment Act. The purpose of this legislation was to \nextend, revise, and expand the Defense Department's limited authority \nto use voluntary incentive pay and voluntary early retirement in order \nto restructure the civilian workforce to meet missions needs and to \ncorrect skill imbalances, especially in high skilled fields. Given the \nsignificant numbers of eligible Federal retirees the Department will \nface in just a few short years, we believed then and now that the \nDepartment needs the ability to better manage this extraordinary \nworkforce transition period. Just as important, this smoother \ntransition period would allow for better and more effective development \nof our younger workers, who will have a better chance to learn and gain \nfrom the expertise of the older generation of innovators. A similar \nbill was also introduced by our Ohio colleagues in the House, \nCongressmen Dave Hobson and Tony Hall.\n  After discussions with the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, \nSenator Warner, we included language in the fiscal year 2001 Defense \nauthorization bill to allow for voluntary early retirement authority \nand voluntary separation incentive pay for a total of 9,000 Department \nof Defense civilian employees for fiscal year 2001 through 2003. This \nlanguage provided, at least initially, the critical new flexibility to \nthe Department of Defense to better manage its civilian workforce. \nHowever, this language simply gave the Defense Department the authority \nto initiate the program in fiscal year 2001 utilizing discretionary \nfunds, but required that ``the Secretary of Defense may carry out the \nprogram authorized . . . during fiscal years 2002 and 2003 with respect \nto workforce restructuring only to the extent provided in a law enacted \nby the 107th Congress.'' Senator DeWine and I intend to work closely \nwith Chairman Warner, and the Ranking member of the Committee, Senator \nLevin to ensure that the necessary workforce restructuring provisions \nare enacted this year. I see my colleague from Ohio on the floor, and \nwould yield to him for any comments.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my friend from Ohio for yielding, and agree with \nhis comments. The reason why we had to settle on limited language in \nlast year's defense authorization bill is mainly because our initial \nlegislation required mandatory, or direct spending, which must be \nprovided for as part of the budget resolution. The actual direct \nspending involved, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \namounts to $82 million through fiscal year 2011. So, as my colleague \nfrom Ohio would agree, we are seeking a minimal amount to provide the \nDefense Department with the maximum flexibility needed to meet its \nworkforce challenges. We are hopeful that the Bush administration will \ncall for this financing as part of the fiscal year 2002 defense budget, \nand for that reason, we have been working with the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Senator Domenici, to ensure that the necessary direct \nspending amounts are assumed in this year's concurrent resolution. I \nsee Chairman Domenici on the floor, and will yield to him at this time.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the two Senators from Ohio for their interest \nand hard work in this important issue. This is a matter that impacts a \nnumber of states that are home to civilian employees of the Defense \nDepartment, including New Mexico. I know my colleagues from Ohio have \nbeen working on this issue for several years, and I agree that \nsomething needs to be done. As this budget resolution assumes the \nPresident's budget, if the President's budget accommodates the direct \nspending necessary for this program, then the Senators from Ohio can \nassume that this budget resolution accommodates this program. So, the \nSenators from Ohio can be sure that if this matter is addressed in the \nPresident's budget, I will work with them to be sure that the final \nbudget resolution we will work out with the House will assume all the \nincreases and new programs in the President's budget for important \nprograms, such as this one.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank the Chairman of the Budget Committee for his \ncomments, and look forward to working with him and Senator DeWine to \nensure this assumption is maintained in the final budget resolution \napproved by Congress.\n\n\n                    Long-Term Care Staffing Shortage\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. With the many priorities we have to cope with, I would \nsimply like to point out that we cannot lose sight of the need to \naddress the very critical problem of labor shortages plaguing our \nhealth care providers both in my State, and all across the Nation.\n  It is important that the budget resolution we ultimately pass address \nthese labor shortages.\n  In my own State of South Dakota, for example, it is not uncommon to \nhave a 100 percent turnover rate for Certified Nursing Assistants--\nclearly that's a crisis that should not and cannot continue if we are \ngoing to maintain quality care for seniors. And for anyone who doesn't \nknow what the Certified Nursing Assistants do--they are the ones who \nprovide the front line, bedside care to the frail and elderly. A very \ndifficult and demanding job.\n  Another major problem is that the average starting salary for South \nDakota's certified nursing assistants is just $7.32 per hour--and the \naverage wage is $8.10 per hour.\n  Mr. GREGG. We have similar problems in New Hampshire, and I agree \nwith my colleague that we have a shortage of trained health care \nworkers, particularly those providing services to our nation's elderly. \nIf this problem is not addressed, the viability of our nation's entire \nhealth care system will be threatened.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Just as bad, and yet another problem that creates a \nparallel crisis, is the fact that many states--including my own--simply \ndo not have realistic Medicaid reimbursement rates.\n  In my state, Medicaid provides the resources for care for more than \ntwo out of three patients in nursing homes. South Dakota's average \ndaily Medicaid\n\n[[Page S3672]]\n\nreimbursement rate is $83.78 per patient, which, in fact, is a $17.34 \nshortfall from covering the actual cost of care. It's simply not \nplausible for $83.78 per day to cover the cost of care, room and board, \nthree meals a day, medicine, specialized equipment and other critical \nneeds.\n  The net result of these artificially low Medicaid reimbursement rates \nis that they further squeeze an already difficult labor and staffing \nsituation--and these problems feed on themselves to make matters very, \nvery problematic for our health care providers.\n  Until we begin increasing Medicaid reimbursement rates to levels more \nthan we pay a babysitter, for example, this squeeze will continue and \nseniors will be threatened.\n  Mr. GREGG. Like your State of South Dakota, New Hampshire is \ncurrently plagued by low Medicaid reimbursement rates. Skilled nursing \nfacilities caring for our frail and elderly are expected to take this \nmeager reimbursement rate and provide 24-hour care, room, board, meals, \nand some therapies--and of course, nursing salaries come out of this \ncost as well. So it is no surprise that the average Certified Nurse \nAssistant turnover rate is approximately 80 percent.\n  In New Hampshire, the livable wage for a single parent with two kids \nis $18.92 an hour. The average starting salary of a Certified Nursing \nAssistant starts at $8.50 an hour, and the average salary is $10.26. \nSkilled nursing facilities in our state have their hands tied over how \nmuch they can pay due to low reimbursement rates. We simply must invest \nin the care of our frail and elderly. I hope Congress will address this \nproblem of long term care staffing shortage.\n\n\n                 restrictions on advance appropriations\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I bring to your attention, my concern about a provision \nin the House version of the Concurrent Budget Resolution, H. Con. Res. \n83, concerning restrictions on advance appropriations. The Senate \nprovision more properly addresses this issue. The House provision \n(Section 13) is extremely vague and restricts both the Congress and the \nAdministration concerning the funding of capital projects using advance \nappropriations. As you prepare to conference the Fiscal Year 2002 \nConcurrent Budget Resolution, I urge you to sustain the Senate \nprovision (Section 201) in the final conference report.\n  Mr. LOTT. I strongly concur with the Chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee on this issue, and also urge that the Senate provision on \nadvance appropriations be included in the final conference report.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. As Chairman of the Seapower Subcommittee, I fully \nsupport the Senate provision concerning advance appropriations in the \nConcurrent Budget Resolution. I think it is important that members have \ntools such as advance appropriations available to consider as a \nfinancing option for capital projects such as building ships.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I want to thank the distinguished Chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for his consideration and cooperation in this very important \nmatter as well as the distinguished Chairman of the Armed Services \nCommittee and Majority Leader for bringing this issue to my colleague's \nattention. The Senate version reinforces the President's budget \nblueprint for advance appropriations as a full funding mechanism that \ncan be used by various departments, such as the Department of Energy, \nthe Department of Transportation, and the Department of Defense, and \nagencies, such as NASA, to level fund capital projects. Without this \nvaluable tool, the ability of Congress to budget the federal \ngovernment's capital investment projects will be severely restricted. I \nmost strongly concur with my esteemed colleagues that the Senate \nversion must be sustained in conference.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I want to take a moment to commend and thank my \ndistinguished colleagues for their insight and leadership on this \ncritical issue. The use of advance appropriations would provide our \nfederal agencies the flexibility to alternatively fund large capital \ninvestments. Specifically, I am aware that the Navy is currently \nstudying advance appropriations as a means to reform the way it \nacquires its ship in an effort to stabilize the shipbuilding program, \nflatten out budget spikes, and potentially reduce costs through \neconomic order quantity buys of ships and their systems. I believe that \nthis funding alternative should be pursued, and I hope to see the \nSenate provision sustained in Conference.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. These are important concerns that the Majority Leader, \nthe distinguished Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and \nSenators Sessions, Snowe and Collins have raised. The Senate version, \nsection 201, Restriction on Advance Appropriations, provides for the \nfunding of capital projects, while maintaining the discipline of full \nadvance funding. I assure my colleagues that I will work to ensure that \nthis issue is adequately addressed.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the distinguished Chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for his cooperation.\n\n\n          funding for the corporation for public broadcasting\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I would like to raise a concern with the \nChairman of the Budget Committee regarding advance appropriations. \nSpecifically, I am concerned about the funding for public broadcasting.\n  Consistent with the President's budget request, the Resolution \nprovides that any advance appropriation would be scored in the year in \nwhich it is appropriated instead of the year in which it is obligated, \nthe past policy. This provision was included because of past problems \nwith the practice. Last year, for example, the Administration \nthreatened to veto appropriations bills unless increases in funding \nwere provided using the mechanism of advance appropriations. The \nprovision is intended to close that loophole.\n  Despite its strong support for this provision, the Office of \nManagement and Budget has indicated its willingness to examine specific \nprograms, on a case by case basis, to determine whether an advance \nappropriation is merited for programmatic reasons. For example, I was \ninformed today the Office may consider advance funding for certain \ndefense construction or procurement items which by definition often \ninvolve multi-year obligations.\n  My office has talked to OMB officials as recently as this morning on \nthis issue. They are willing to work with the Appropriations Committee \nand the Budget Committee over the recess to determine whether CPB \nshould be granted an exception to the rule. If an agreement could be \nworked out acceptable to all the parties, I believe the Budget \nCommittee should have the flexibility to consider it in conference if \nit so chooses.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, If the distinguished Chairman of the \nBudget Committee is willing to review this matter with OMB and the \nAppropriations Committee, there are several issues I hope he will \nconsider. First and most important, the practice provides the lead time \nstations need to line up programs that may take up to two or three \nyears to produce--programs like Baseball and the Civil War that are \nyears in the making. In other words, advance funding encourages prudent \nplanning.\n  Second, it allows the stations to use the availability of federal \nfunds to leverage private sector funding both through foundations and \nviewer fundraising to maximize the resources available for quality \nprograms. And lastly, advance funding reduces the potential of \npolitical interference in programming decisions.\n\n\n               DEDUCTIBILITY OF STATE AND LOCAL SALES TAX\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, Section 17 of the House-passed budget \nresolution for fiscal year 2002, H. Con. Res. 83, contains language \nrelating to an issue that is important to the citizens of my home State \nof Tennessee, and the citizens of Texas, Wyoming, Florida, South \nDakota, Nevada and Washington. The issue is the deductibility of state \nand local sales taxes. Section 17 of H. Con. Res. 83 states that it is \nthe sense of the House of Representatives that the Committee on Ways \nand Means should consider legislation to make State sales taxes \ndeductible against Federal income tax.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced the AMT and Tax Deduction Fairness \nAct of 2001, S. 291. My bill would allow individuals to deduct either \ntheir state and local sales taxes, or their state and local income \ntaxes on their federal tax\n\n[[Page S3673]]\n\nreturn, but not both. Currently, the federal tax laws discriminate \nagainst residents of states like mine that choose to raise revenue \nprimarily through a sales tax, because federal law does not permit a \ndeduction for state and local sales taxes. Federal tax law does provide \na deduction for state and local income taxes, however. Prior to 1986, \ntaxpayers were permitted to deduct all of their state and local taxes \npaid, income, sales and property. This deduction was based on the \nprinciple that imposing a tax on a tax is unfair. The Tax Reform Act of \n1986 eliminated the deductibility of state and local sales taxes, but \nretained the deduction for state and local income taxes. My bill is \nsimply intended to address this inequity in the tax code. According to \na March 2000 Joint Committee on Taxation revenue estimate, the cost of \nallowing individuals to deduct either their state and local sales taxes \nor state and local income taxes, but not both, is $25.1 billion over 10 \nyears.\n  It was my intent to offer an amendment to the Senate budget \nresolution similar to Section 17 of H. Con. Res. 83, expressing the \nsense of the Senate that the Committee on Finance should consider \nlegislation to make state and local sales taxes deductible against \nfederal income tax. However, I recognize that such an amendment would \nbe ruled non-germane under the Senate's budget rules. Therefore, I want \nto ask the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to work with me \nduring the conference on the budget resolution to retain the House \nlanguage on this issue with some minor modifications.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I recognize the importance of this issue \nto the Senator from Tennessee, as well as the Senators from Texas, \nWyoming, Florida, South Dakota, Nevada and Washington. New Mexico has a \ngross receipts tax which is a complicated type of sales tax. New Mexico \nraises about the same amount of revenue from its gross receipts tax as \nit does from its state income tax. I point this out so that the Senate \nrealizes that the Senator from Tennessee's proposal is an improvement \nfor some states, but it may be a wash for other states.\n  I believe that it is not good federal income tax policy for the code \nto favor one state's revenue raising scheme over another state's. This \nis the situation in the code now. States that have substantial state \nincome taxes, but low or no state sales tax are favored over states \nthat rely exclusively, or more heavily on state sales taxes. A fairness \nargument can be made for fully restoring the state sales tax deduction, \nhowever, to do so would cost the Treasury $83 billion over ten years. \nNonetheless, the Senator from Tennessee has raised an important issue, \nand I pledge to work with my colleague during the conference on the \nbudget resolution to include language regarding the deductibility of \nstate and local sales taxes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his assistance.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, over the past few days, we have heard a \ngreat deal of promises made regarding the FY 2002 budget resolution. As \nI have listened to the arguments made in support of this budget \nresolution, I am reminded of a scene from Jerome Lawrence's and Robert \nE. Lee's play, Inherit the Wind.\n  On a sultry summer evening in a small town, two men sit in rocking \nchairs, reminiscing about their childhoods. One man tells the other of \na beautiful rocking horse that he had longed for as a child. That \nrocking horse--Golden Dancer--shimmered in the sunlight that streamed \nthrough a storefront window. Knowing the rocking horse would cost his \nfather a week's wages, he harbored little hope of ever owning that \nmagnificent steed--expecting that it would always lie just beyond his \nreach, behind the storefront glass. But knowing of their son's dream, \nhis father worked nights and his mother scrimped on groceries to buy \nthat rocking horse. On the morning of his birthday, he awoke to find, \nat the foot of his bed, the rocking horse of his dreams, Golden Dancer. \nHe hopped out of bed, jumped into the saddle, and began to rock. Almost \nin an instant, the rocking horse split in two. The wood was rotten. The \nwhole thing had been put together ``with spit and ceiling wax. All \nshine and no substance . . . all glitter and glamour.'' That's how I \nfeel about the promises made regarding this budget resolution and the \napproximately $1.5 trillion tax cut it authorizes.\n  Mr. President, it was not too long ago that the American people were \nbeing enticed by the glittering promises of another Republican \nAdministration. In 1981, President Reagan promised that massive tax \ncuts would balance the budget and reinvigorate an economy plagued by \nunemployment and inflation. Congress approved the Reagan economic plan. \nI even voted for it. I said at the time, President Reagan ``is the new \nPresident, give him a chance.'' But four years later, I stood on this \nfloor and spoke of my regret at having cast that vote.\n  That was in 1985, the year President Reagan had promised a balanced \nbudget. In fact, according to the Reagan Administration's 1981 \nprojections, our nation was supposed to be enjoying a $500 million \nsurplus in FY 1984, a $6 billion surplus in FY 1985, and a $28 billion \nsurplus in FY 1986. Instead, the nation recorded a $185 billion deficit \nin FY 1984, a $212 billion deficit in FY 1985, and a $221 billion \ndeficit in FY 1986. As a result, President Reagan's deficit/surplus \nestimates for FY 1982-FY 1986 fell short of their targets by $921 \nbillion. That golden promise of a bright fiscal reward turned out to be \nmere fool's gold.\n  The American economy was in shambles. In 1982 and 1983, the annual \nunemployment rate was 9.7 and 9.6 percent, respectively, the highest \nrates recorded since 1950. In 1985, while America's wealthy were \nreaping the largest share of the national income since World War II, \nbusinesses and banks were failing at a record breaking pace. Our \nsavings rate was the lowest in four decades, and our national trade \ndeficit was ascending to a record high. There were record poverty rates \nin that year as well.\n  Instead of beginning to pay off the federal debt, our debt \nobligations had more than doubled, soaring from $1 trillion in 1981 to \n$2.1 trillion in 1986. In 5 years, the Reagan Administration, with its \nsacred tax cuts, had accomplished what it took the previous 39 \npresidential administrations the entire history of the United States to \ndo--increase the Federal debt by a trillion dollars.\n  In 1981, then-Senate Republican Leader Howard Baker had called the \nReagan economic plan a ``river boat gamble.'' It is clear that the \ncountry had lost the bet.\n  It took the hard-nosed, realistic 1993 Democratic plan to put \nAmerica's economic house back in order. That was a real budget, a \nbudget of hard choices and hard decisions, including tax increases. \nDemocrats understood the political fall out that would come from \nraising taxes. No one really wanted tax increases. No one ever does. \nBut we put the country first, we did what was necessary to cut the \ndeficit, and we paid for it in the 1994 congressional elections.\n\n  I call that 1993 budget a Democratic budget because not one single \nRepublican in either the House or the Senate, voted for it. The \nRepublican Senate Leader at the time claimed that the budget did ``not \ntackle the deficit.'' Another Republican Senator said: ``the plan \ncannot help the economy.'' Another even used the dreaded ``R'' word, \nclaiming that it was a ``one-way ticket to a recession.'' And yet \nanother Republican Senator said of the tax increases in that budget: \n``make no mistake, these higher rates will cost (American) jobs.''\n  Yet, no recession came. There were eight years of solid economic \ngrowth, eight years of job growth. We finally achieved a balanced \nbudget, and we are paying off the national debt.\n  Now, 20 years after the 1981 Reagan fiscal disaster, a new Republican \nAdministration is making the same glittering promises to the American \npeople. The Senate today was asked to buy another ``Golden Dancer.'' \nThis budget resolution looks alluring sitting in the store window. But \nall that holds it together are the spit and ceiling wax of rosy ten-\nyear surplus projections and unrealistic spending cuts.\n  Mr. President, I have already spoken at length this week about how \nthe Senate has considered this year's budget resolution with maximum \nhurry and minimal information, debate, and opportunity for amendment. \nFirst, the Budget Committee--for the first time ever--was not allowed \nto draft a budget resolution. Instead, one was presented\n\n[[Page S3674]]\n\nto the Senate by the Chairman of the Budget Committee and his party's \nleadership. Second, the Senate considered this budget resolution \nwithout the benefit of the President's budget, which means that the \nSenate has no way of knowing what programs will be cut to make room for \nthese massive tax cuts.\n  The most egregious example of this can be found as a footnote on page \n188 of the President's budget outline, A Blueprint For New Beginnings, \nat the bottom of Table S-4. The footnote reads: ``The final \ndistribution of offsets has yet to be determined.'' Until April 9th, \nwhen the Congress receives a detailed copy of the President's budget, \nthe Senate has no way of knowing what the specific reductions will be \nfor $20 billion in spending cuts that are proposed on page 188 of the \nPresident's ``Blueprint'' for this year's budget.\n  What we do know is based on what was presented to us by the Budget \nCommittee Chairman and the Republican leadership in the form of this \nbudget resolution. What we have here is a ten-year spending plan built \non the Congressional Budget Office's ten-year surplus projections. But \nwhat of those projections?\n  In testimony before the Senate Budget Committee, Deputy Director \nBarry Anderson repeatedly warned about the volatility of these \nprojections. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office devoted an entire \nchapter in its Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2002-2011 to \nthe uncertainties in forecasting economic and budget conditions. On \npage 93 of that document CBO cautions that there is only a 10 percent \nchance that budget surpluses will materialize as they have projected. \nOn page 95 the CBO warns that, based on historical averages, its \nprojections will be off by $52 billion in FY 2001, $120 billion in FY \n2002, and $412 billion in FY 2006.\n  To be considering a ten-year budget plan that includes permanent tax \ncuts, after the Congressional Budget Office has gone to such lengths to \nexplain just what a crapshoot these projections are, is the pinnacle of \nfiscal irresponsibility. The Congressional Budget Office has put \nwarning labels on everything this year. CBO officials say that this \nbudget could be hazardous to the fiscal health of the nation. Yet, we \nhopped onto a ten-year budget plan without so much as blinking.\n  Why? What was the hurry? Why couldn't we have waited until we saw a \ncopy of the President's budget? Why couldn't we have waited until the \nJoint Tax Committee and the Congressional Budget Office had the details \nthey needed to examine the President's budget and report back its \nfindings to the Congress? We accepted these surplus projections based \non little more than faith, without any real idea how these massive tax \ncuts would affect the overall budget.\n\n  Fiscal prudence dictates that we should move slowly before enacting \nmassive tax cuts based on these highly speculative surpluses. Does this \nbudget resolution embrace that notion? No. In fact, it includes \nreconciliation instructions to expedite--not delay--but expedite \nconsideration of these tax cuts.\n  I have already spoken at length about reconciliation, and how using \nsuch a procedure to limit the Senate's consideration of the President's \ntax cut plan would ``break faith with the Senate's historical \nuniqueness as a forum for the exercise of minority and individual \nrights.'' This is my greatest concern. But reconciliation would also \nput us on the fast track for passing massive tax cuts without any room \nto reverse or correct our course later if these surplus projections \nturn out to be false. This train has us speeding through a long, dark \ntunnel with no lights and with no idea of what lies ahead.\n  The only thing that we know for certain is that these tax cuts will \nprevent any substantial domestic investments over the next ten years, \neven if we accept these surplus projections at face value. This budget \nresolution barely keeps pace with what the Congressional Budget Office \nsays is necessary to maintain current services. In addition, this \nbudget contains no adjustment for the fact that we are a growing \nnation, with our population expected to increase by 8.9 percent over \nthe next ten years. There will not be enough money to address the \nbacklog of infrastructure needs that have built up over the past years. \nOur schools are crumbling, our roads need repair, our bridges are \nfalling down, our drinking water is polluted, our sanitation systems \nare inadequate, our dams are unsafe. Are we expected to ignore these \nproblems so that we can finance a tax cut for the wealthy!\n  What about Social Security and Medicare reform? When the baby-boom \ngeneration begins to retire over the next ten years, financial pressure \non the Social Security and Medicare trust funds will rise rapidly as \npayroll tax income falls short of what is needed to pay benefits. Both \nprograms are expected to have expenditures in excess of receipts in \n2016. Where will the federal government find the money to finance these \nbenefits? In the absence of budget surpluses for the rest of the \ngovernment's operations, policymakers would have three options: raise \nother taxes, curtail other spending, or borrow money from the financial \nmarkets. If we go along with these massive tax cuts, how will we honor \nour pledge to protect Social Security and Medicare?\n  And, what about the unforseen disasters that will inevitably occur \nover the next ten years, or the increases in defense spending that \nultimately be recommend by the President's advisory committee? How is \nCongress expected to pay for these needs if it has already frittered \naway available surpluses?\n  Mr. President, 170 years ago, a frustrated German philosopher \nFriedrich Hegel pointed out that ``what experience and history teach is \nthis--that people and governments never have learned anything from \nhistory, or acted on principles deduced from it.'' What better way to \nreaffirm that opinion than by the Congress enacting a massive tax cut \nbased on highly speculative surplus projections.\n  By passing this budget resolution today, the Senate has ignored what \nhistory has tried to teach us. I say to my colleagues, we have taken \nthis ride before. This budget is nothing more than spit-shined \nReaganomics, and it deserved to be defeated.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will vote for the budget resolution for \nfiscal year 2002 in the interest of moving the budget process forward. \nMy vote for the resolution should not be interpreted as an endorsement \nof the budget package. Indeed, I have some serious reservations about \nthe priorities and assumptions contained in this resolution. At this \npoint in the process, we do not know the details of a final budget. \nRather, the Senate is only voting on a blueprint, not a completed \nbudget document.\n  I have a statement of principles that I believe should be reflected \nin the final budget proposal. I believe that these five principles \nreflect the Main Street economic realities that Americans talk about at \ntheir dinner tables.\n  My first principle is that the budget must provide sufficient \nresources for our national security. We have a solemn obligation to \nprovide enough resources for those American military personnel who have \nvolunteered to risk their lives to defend the rest of us.\n  For too many years, the Clinton Administration neglected the people \nwho volunteered for military service. But with appropriate increases \nand money freed up from eliminating waste and inefficiency in the \ndefense budget, we can make progress toward restoring the morale and \nreadiness of our Armed Forces.\n  Currently, the Administration is undertaking an extensive review of \nour defense needs and necessary reforms. I want to make certain that \nthe budget provides the resources for these overdue reforms, but also \nrecognize that in the near term our air, sea, and land forces need to \nbe substantially strengthened. That is why I supported the amendment by \nSenator Landrieu to substantially increase our defense budget over the \nnext ten years.\n  The second principle that will guide my judgement of a final budget \nis tax relief for those who need it the most, lower- and middle-income \nworking families. I am in favor of a tax cut, but a responsible one \nthat provides much needed tax relief for lower and middle-income \nfamilies.\n  I agree with the President that consumer debt is a massive problem \nfor working Americans. If there is an economic downturn, I am concerned \nthat debt will overwhelm many American households. That is why tax \nrelief should be targeted to middle-income\n\n[[Page S3675]]\n\nAmericans. The more fortunate among us have less concern about debt. It \nis the parents struggling to make ends meet who are most in need of tax \nrelief.\n\n  I hope that when the reconciliation bills are reported out of the \nSenate Finance Committee, the tax cuts outlined will also address the \npressing issues such as the child tax credit, reduction of the marriage \ntax penalty, payroll tax reform to lighten the burden of this tax on \nhard-working Americans, and estate tax reform that will take into \naccount the effect such reform will have on our robust charitable \ncommunity. For this and other reasons, I support a $5 million cap with \nregard to the estate tax cut.\n  In this tax debate, we should avoid class war rhetoric, but a final \nbudget plan should reflect Main Street realities. The Senate Finance \nCommittee should firmly resist granting tax relief that benefits the \nspecial interests and K Street lobbyists at the expense of lower- and \nmiddle-income American taxpayers.\n  That kind of tax relief I would never support.\n  Third, the budget must provide for future obligations in Social \nSecurity and Medicare. Reforms are urgently needed in both programs, \nbut we must have the resources to pay for them.\n  For the first time in history, economic projections show a surplus of \n$3.1 trillion over the next ten years, exclusive of the surplus in the \nSocial Security Trust Fund. At the same time, we know that the Social \nSecurities system is projected to be bankrupt by about 2037 and \nMedicare will be broke around 2023, leaving millions of elderly \nAmericans without the promised benefits they need to live comfortably \nin their retirement years. I am concerned that this budget resolution \nuses none of the surplus to shore up Social Security, does not use \nenough to shore up Medicare, and does not provide the resources needed \nto support reforms of these entitlement programs that will ensure their \nlong-term solvency.\n  My fourth principle is paying down as much of the national debt as \npossible. On Main Street, Americans believe it is conservative common \nsense to meet your financial obligations. Lower federal debt means \nlower interest rates on consumer loans, especially lower mortgage \npayments so people will have more money to spend or save.\n  I applaud the resolution's goal of reducing the level of debt held by \nthe public by nearly $2.4 trillion from a level of $3.2 trillion today \nto $818 billion in 2011. But I believe that we should use even more of \nthe non-Social Security surplus in the early years to reduce the \nfederal debt burden on future generations, given these surplus \nprojections in the out years could be significantly off.\n  My fifth principle is restraining spending, which Federal Reserve \nChairman Greenspan warns could ``resurrect the deficits of the past.'' \nMany of the specific funding assumptions in the resolution are \nlaudable, but I have identified tens of billions of dollars of port-\nbarrel spending in annual appropriations bills over the past several \nyears--earmarks that never went through a merit-review process. Because \nof the compelling need to deal with the problems in Social Security and \nMedicare, we should look within the budget to eliminate waste in order \nto fund higher priority requirements, rather than spend the entire \nsurplus on more government.\n  I am pleased to note that the resolution includes a provision to \nensure Congress complies with the revenue and spending levels in the \nresolution to limit budgetary gimmicks such as a new scoring rule that \nprevents the use of advanced appropriations to circumvent spending \nlimits.\n  I also fully support President Bush's intention to eliminate funding \nfor earmarks in his first budget.\n  While I am concerned that this budget resolution rests on uncertain \nsurplus projections that will surely be affected by a changing domestic \nand world economic environment, this is just a resolution, not a final \nbudget. In the coming weeks and months, I look forward to working with \nthe Administration and my colleagues for a budget that reflects the \nprinciples that I outlined today.\n  I thank the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Budget Committee for \nconducting the debate in a civilized and constructive manner. The \nreconciliation bill that results from this budget blueprint should \nprovide for necessary defense increases, tax relief for the American \ntaxpayer, adequate funding for Social Security or Medicare reform, \nsignificant debt reduction, and spending restraint.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about our country's \nfuture and how it is being determined in the debate over this budget \nresolution, H. Con. Res. 83, which I oppose.\n  At this propitious moment, we face a set of choices, both pleasant \nand consequential, about what to do with this precious surplus we have \nworked so hard as a nation to accumulate. The question is, how do we \nmake the projected surplus work best for us? How do we take advantage \nof this extraordinary opportunity today to strengthen our economy and \ncountry for tomorrow, to expand this prosperity and security for \ngenerations to come?\n  It is my view that this Congress must implement an effective long-\nterm vision. The central point I want to make today is that as we \ndevelop a budget, we need to be concerned with more than just a tax \nplan. We need a strategic blueprint for how to extend and expand our \neconomic growth and how to widen the circle of opportunity and security \nto allow more Americans to share in the nation's prosperity.\n  Unfortunately, that blueprint is not coming from our Republican \ncolleagues or from the White House. The President has put forward a tax \ncut that was designed 15 months ago, in the midst of the Republican \nprimaries, when one of his opponents, Steve Forbes, was promoting flat \ntaxes. The Bush tax plan abandons fiscal responsibility and blithely \nspends, indeed, overspends, a projected surplus whose size six months \ndown the road is unclear, to say nothing of its dimensions 10 years \nlater. It is a tax plan that gives the most to those who need it least \nand leaves little or nothing for making the kinds of investments that \nwill secure and brighten our future. Our Republican colleagues have put \ntogether a partisan budget blueprint that simply accommodates the \nPresident's tax cut.\n  But neither the Bush plan nor the Republican budget are right for our \ncountry. They will waste the wealth our nation has earned over the last \neight years and send us back down the road to debt, higher interest \nrates, and higher unemployment. They cannot answer the big questions of \nwhat kind of country we want to be ten years from now, because they do \nnot ask the right questions. They lack vision and therefore squander \nthis moment's opportunity.\n  The Republican Budget Resolution does not protect the Social Security \nor Medicare trust fund surpluses. It claims to set aside $453 billion \nfor a ``contingency fund'' in order to prevent Congress from spending \nthe Social Security and Medicare surpluses; however, that amount is not \nsufficient to maintain current policies, such as extending expiring tax \ncredits, reforming the alternative minimum tax, and providing \nagricultural assistance--and to pay for the cost of new initiatives \nsuch as a national missile defense system. Because of the excessive \nRepublican tax cut and the inadequate size of this contingency fund, \nCongress may be forced to raid the Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds or face the prospect of a return to budget deficits. The GOP \nbudget imposes deep cuts on important programs. The Budget Resolution \nwould cut non-defense discretionary spending by about $8 to $9 billion \nor two percent below the level needed to keep pace with what was \nprovided last year, adjusted for inflation. Funding for environmental \nprotection, disaster assistance, veterans' medical care, Community \nOriented Policing (COPS) and the Army Corps of Engineers would be \nparticularly hard hit.\n  The Republican budget also falls short on debt reduction. The Budget \nResolution would reduce the publicly-held federal debt from $3.4 \ntrillion at the end of Fiscal Year 2000 to $818 billion by Fiscal Year \n2011. Many experts believe that the publicly-held debt could be reduced \nto under $500 billion, $300 billion more in debt reduction than \nproposed by the Republicans.\n  If we are to seize this moment, we must have a clear vision and a \nlong view of where we want to go, and how best to get there. We need a \nnew approach, rooted in old values--the\n\n[[Page S3676]]\n\nbroadly cherished principles of freedom, opportunity, responsibility \nand community upon which this democracy was built--values so ingrained \nin our national consciousness as to transcend the rhythms of history. \nWe must be guided by the promise of growth and opportunity that moved \nthe pioneers, by the hard-work and enterprise that gave rise to the \nmiddle class, by the sense of responsibility to one another that has \ncreated good citizens and strong communities, and by that indefatigable \nAmerican spirit of optimism and innovation that drives us forward in \nour pursuit of better lives and brighter vistas. What we need is a \nbudget based on fiscal responsibility and wise investments, an agenda \nthat empowers our citizens to succeed in the near term but that also \nguarantees their long term security.\n  We must begin with a fiscally sensible budget, a budget that places \nthe highest priority on paying down the national debt. One of the most \nenduring lessons of the last 20 years is that debt reduction pays off \nin the long term. Our surplus now gives us a historic opportunity to be \ndebt free by the end of this decade, which will keep interest rates \ndown on home mortgages, car loans, credit card bills and student loans, \nloosening the budgets of millions of American families. Low interest \nrates also cut the cost for capital available for business innovation \nand expansion. We must set aside at least one-third of the projected \nsurplus to continue to pay off America's long-term debt. If the surplus \ndoes not turn out to be as large as we hope it will, then we will not \nhave committed to obligations that might drive us into deficit spending \nagain. The funds we set aside for debt reduction will become a rainy \nday fund.\n  The next steps would be to invest in the building blocks of our \nsociety and economy: defense, healthcare, the environment, education, \nscientific research and development, and a robust private sector. And \nyet, the Bush partisan budget does just the opposite.\n  For example, in healthcare the Bush budget would cut aid to the \nuninsured. By decreasing the funding for programs that increase access \nto health services for people without health insurance by 86 percent, \nthe President jeopardizes the health and well being of the nearly 42 \nmillion Americans that cannot afford health insurance and will actually \ndecrease their access to health care services. His budget also fails to \nprovide an adequate prescription drug benefit, providing only $153 \nbillion over 10 years to provide for a four year, low-income \nprescription drug benefit. CBO estimates this level of funding ``won't \nprovide a great deal for any one person.'' I believe America should be \nincreasing access to health insurance and health care services . . . \nnot cutting critical programs. I am committed to passing a prescription \ndrug plan that meets the need of seniors.\n  I also am discouraged by the lack of funding that the Bush \nadministration plans to designate for essential programs to protect our \npublic health and environment. At the same time the Bush Administration \nhas rolled back a number of regulations for protection in these areas \nand has walked away from its domestic and international commitments to \naddress the problem of climate change, it also has slashed the funds \navailable to the agencies responsible for these important issues. The \namount the Republican Budget Resolution designates for these essential \nenvironmental programs is 15 percent below what is needed to maintain \nFY2001 spending power.\n\n  I have supported efforts to put this funding back in the budget \nresolution. The amendment that I co-sponsored with Senator Kerry \nrenewed the funding for the range of government programs intended to \naddress our climate change problem. I thank my colleagues for \nrecognizing the dire need for these programs and passing the amendment. \nI also supported the amendment sponsored by Senator Corzine, which \nwould have provided the funding that is needed for the full range of \nenvironmental programs. Mr. President, the protection of the \nenvironment is not a luxury item; we must not sacrifice it to pay for a \ntax cut.\n  This budget resolution also must recognize that skills and learning \nnot only drive productivity growth, but increasingly determine \nindividual opportunity. We must concentrate our resolve and our \nresources on changing the way we teach and train our labor force. We \nneed to start at the beginning and reform our K-12 system to raise \nacademic achievement for all children. Congressional Democratic \neducation proposals all provide more funding for our public schools \nthan President Bush and the Republicans do, and that is undoubtedly \nbecause they spend so much on his tax cut plan, that he has little left \nover for other critical societal investments.\n  As we move forward, we can and should create a direct and progressive \nconnection between taxes and education. Parents, workers and employees \nshould be given tax credits to make lifelong learning easier. The \nexpenses of employers investing in remedial education--to make up for \nfailures in the performances of our K-12 school system--should be \noffset with a new education tax credit. And most importantly, I support \ntax relief for low- and middle-income families struggling to pay the \ncost of their children's college education and their own mid-career re-\ntraining. These families should be allowed to deduct up to $10,000 of \nhigher education costs from their income tax each year.\n  Equally as important are adequate funds for basic science and \nresearch and development. The role of scientific innovation is central \nto our country's economic growth. The story of the American economy is \nthe story of scientific breakthroughs leading to economic growth. Yet, \nPresident Bush's budget outline starves three of the greatest \ngenerators of innovative ideas: The National Science Foundation, NASA, \nand the Department of Energy. For instance, the National Science \nFoundation is slated for a 1.3 percent funding boost, which is \neffectively a cut, since that increase is less than the rate of \ninflation. Rather than curtailing physical science R funding, we \nshould be doubling the federal basic research investment over the next \n10 years and promoting education initiatives to expand the technically-\ntrained workforce. Increases in federal research dollars, at NSF, NASA, \nand DoE are critical to educating the next generation of scientists and \nengineers.\n  A visionary budget must allow for a tax package with a purpose. And \nthat purpose must be, above all else, to stimulate economic growth, to \nraise the tide that lifts the lot of all Americans. One-third of the \nprojected surplus should be dedicated to tax reductions, some to reward \nworking families and the rest to business tax cuts that stimulate \neconomic growth and new jobs. In the spirit of the Innovation Economy, \nwe should look to tax incentives that will spur the drivers of growth: \ninnovation investment, a skilled workforce, and productivity and there \nare many possibilities to consider.\n  In 1997, I supported reducing the capital gains rate to help reduce \nthe cost of innovation investment in our economy, and I think it helped \nbuild our economic boom. I believe the capital gains rate should be \nreduced again. Eliminating capital gains entirely for long-term \ninvestments in start-up entrepreneurial firms would encourage a strong \nventure capital market, and the investment in new companies that is \nfalling off now.\n  Small firms lagging behind their larger brethren in productivity \ngrowth should be given tax credits to invest in information technology. \nSmall business accounts for 40 percent of our economy and 60 percent of \nthe new jobs. But less than one-third of small businesses are wired to \nthe Internet today. Those that are wired--and this is a stunning \nstatistic--have grown 46 percent faster than their counterparts who are \nunplugged.\n  One of the most effective ways to spur business investment, \nproductivity increases and economic growth is adjusting depreciation \nschedules in the tax code to more accurately reflect the lifetime of a \nproduct. For some classes of investments, particularly rapidly changing \ninformation technology equipment, current depreciation schedules no \nlonger match actual replacement rates, so companies that use technology \nmust continue to carry an expense on their books long after the \nexpenditure has ended its useful life. I suggest that, where \nappropriate, depreciation schedules should be shortened to reflect \nactual replacement rates.\n  Removal of economic and governmental barriers to the build-out of a \nbroadband should be a top priority so\n\n[[Page S3677]]\n\nwe can erect the next stage of the IT infrastructure. Broadband offers \nnew opportunities for new products, services, and efficiencies. We \nshould offer a tax credit to get this new infrastructure build-out \npromptly.\n  Making the R tax credit permanent would encourage industry to \ninvest in research and technological innovation. Additional reforms to \nthe credit could make it more accessible to small businesses and start \nups and encourage more cooperative research consortia.\n  If we are successful in building on our prosperity, we will be able \nto guarantee the future of Social Security and Medicare. Everyone knows \nthat strengthening Medicare will require more resources, not less. Yet \nthe President's tax cut reaches into the Medicare surplus, leaving \nscant hope for modernization, or a new, meaningful prescription drug \nbenefit, as the President promised. While today's workers will rely \nmore and more on personal savings for retirement, for millions of \nAmericans, Social Security is still the foundation of their old-age \nsupport. We must meet our obligations to our retirees, but we must also \nseek reforms that will make their retirements more secure.\n  A responsible, long term budget also must be attentive to short term \nchallenges. While I am confident it is the inherent strength of our \nprivate sector that will do most to bring our economy out of its \ncurrent dip, we in government can provide some help through Federal \nReserve monetary policy and federal government fiscal policy. Finally, \nthe administration and its congressional allies have acknowledged that \nthe $1.6 trillion Bush tax cut plan would give nothing back to \ntaxpayers this year and little next year. So now, they talk about \nwanting to add a one year economic stimulus to their larger plan and \npass the two together. Mr. President, as I have stated before, I fear \nthat doing so would hold hostage the help our lagging economy needs now \nto a drawn-out congressional debate about the long-term Bush plan. In \nother words, help would not come until it was too late.\n  We need a fair, fast and fiscally responsible tax stimulus. \nEconomists tell us that it would take a tax cut of at least $60 billion \nto have a positive effect on our economy this year. Current estimates \nare that the federal government will have a surplus of about $100 \nbillion at the end of this fiscal year, September 30, so we can safely \nafford a $60 billion stimulus. I would divide that $60 billion by the \n200 million Americans who paid income or payroll taxes last year and \nsend each one of them a $300 check as soon as possible--a surplus \ndividend tax rebate that can give our economy and our national \nconfidence the kick-start they need. That check would go to every \nmember of a family who worked last year.\n  Ten years from now, we will be judged by the decisions we make today. \nPeople will ask, did we fully understand the awesome changes taking \nplace in our economy and in our society? Did we direct our \nunprecedented surpluses into investments with the greatest returns? Did \nwe give our workers the tools they need to seize the opportunities an \ninnovation economy offers? And were we guided by those proud American \nvalues that have brought us this far?\n  If we keep that perspective in view from the vantage point of our \ndaily lives, we'll have a good shot at answering those questions \naffirmatively. But we must exercise discipline and follow a regimen: We \ncannot spend money we don't have, despite the temptations to do so. We \nmust pay our bills and make investments for our future before we take \nvacations. A short term economic stimulus to help lift us out of this \neconomic slowdown has to be followed by business tax credits and smart \ninvestments to sustain longer-term growth. Only then, can we be \nconfident of our ability to provide comfort and security to our parents \nand for a bright future to our children.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to thank the Chairman of the \nBudget Committee for provisions in his substitute amendment that \nreinforce President Bush's budget blueprint for the use of advance \nappropriations as a mechanism for capital investment. The chairman's \nextraordinary foresight will ensure that the option to use advance \nappropriations will still be available as a budget management tool for \nCongress and Federal departments and agencies.\n  As described by OMB Circular A-11, advance appropriations is a \nfunding mechanism, which together with funding in the current year, \nprovides full funding of capital projects and scores following year \nfunds as new budget authority in the year in which funds become \navailable for obligation. This mechanism is used by various \ndepartments, such as the Department of Energy and the Department of \nTransportation, and agencies, such as NASA, to level fund capital \nprojects. In addition, the Department of Defense is considering \nemploying advance appropriations for capital projects in the future.\n  Section 13 of the House Budget Resolution recommends severely \nrestricting the ability to use the method of advance appropriations by \nrequiring a capital investment program be scored against 302(a) \nallocations and totaled in the year in which these appropriations are \nenacted. This differs from scoring the appropriations in the year in \nwhich it is obligated.\n  The flexibility to use the advance appropriations method is an \nimportant management tool that enables federal agencies and departments \nto score capital investment project appropriations in the year in which \nthey are obligated rather than scoring the whole cost of the project in \nthe year in which the appropriations are enacted. This option allows \nthe federal government to make selected capital investments in much the \nway the American people would, and that is pay as you go. I urge my \ncolleagues to support and sustain the advance appropriations provision \nincluded by our distinguished Budget Committee chairman in his \nsubstitute amendment.\n\n\n                          workforce investment\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nattached letters of support for the Harkin-Wellstone amendment be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Council,\n                                    Saint Paul, MN, April 3, 2001.\n     Hon. Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       The Minnesota Governor's Workforce Development Council \n     (GWDC) is in support of your efforts to increase funding for \n     workforce development programs in the FY2002 budget \n     resolution.\n       As you know, Minnesota is experiencing a long-term labor \n     shortage and, in some sectors, short-term economic slowdowns. \n     The combination makes a particularly compelling case for \n     increased federal support for workforce development efforts \n     that benefit incumbent workers, new entrants into the labor \n     market including new Americans, working families, and others \n     seeking to advance their education and upgrade their skills.\n       Minnesota has worked hard to build a strong and dynamic \n     workforce system. We are currently exploring several options \n     to further strengthen our efforts through a reorganization of \n     some state agencies and a shift toward more local \n     decisionmaking about workforce investments. A constant theme \n     we have heard during these discussions is that the federal \n     resources for training and skill advancement are woefully \n     inadequate.\n       We have successfully used Workforce Investment Act (WIA), \n     Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), and Welfare-\n     To-Work Block Grant funds, augmented by significant state \n     resources, to transition thousands into the labor market and \n     advance through the workforce. However, the broad workers \n     shortage, coupled with significant dislocations right now, \n     strains our resources. Additional federal funding would allow \n     us to better serve Minnesotans who need skills training to \n     advance, other training and support to enter the workforce, \n     and training and education to transition to new jobs after a \n     layoff. Additional investment by Congress now would go a long \n     way toward moving us through this short-term dip in the \n     economy and addressing our longer term workforce needs.\n       On behalf of the Governor's Council, stakeholders in \n     Minnesota's workforce system, and your Minnesota \n     constituents, I urge you to move forward with your efforts \n     knowing that you have our support and confidence. If you need \n     any additional information or assistance, please contact me \n     directly or GWDC staff Luke Weisberg (651-205-4728 or \n     luke.weisberg@state.mn.us) or Kathy Sweeney (651-296-3700 or \n     ksweeney@ngwmail.des.state.mn.us).\n       Again, we applaud your efforts and appreciate your support \n     on this and other issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Roger L. Hale,\n                                                            Chair.\n\n[[Page S3678]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                       Minnesota Workforce Council\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                    Saint Paul, MN, April 3, 2001.\n     Re Senate Budget Resolution--Amendment to Increase WIA \n         Funding.\n\n     Hon. Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: On behalf of the members of the \n     Minnesota Workforce Council association (MWCA), I am writing \n     to express our strong support for your efforts to increase \n     funding for Workforce Investment Act (WIA) programs. MWCA's \n     membership consists of the workforce investment board chairs, \n     chief local elected officials, and the program administrators \n     from each of the 16 workforce services areas in Minnesota.\n       We agree with you that now is the time to invest in \n     workforce development! Unfortunately, President Bush's budget \n     blueprint indicates that funding for WIA programs would be \n     significantly reduced.\n       Attached is a chart that highlights the funding trends over \n     the past eight years, adjusted for inflation, for the \n     Minnesota Job Services and the Minnesota Job Training \n     Partnership Act (JTPA)/Workforce Investment Act (WIA). As you \n     can see, funding for these key workforce development programs \n     has significantly declined from 1993 to 2000. In Minnesota, \n     using CPI adjusted numbers, we have experienced nearly a 60% \n     reduction in funding for JTPA/WIA (FY 1993 = $34,391,000; FY \n     2000 $14,522,000).\n       The Workforce Investment Act provides a structure for \n     coordinating programs that are designed to help individuals \n     escape poverty, achieve economic independence,and recover \n     from job loss. Further, WIA provides a foundation for \n     developing the skilled workforce that is critical to our \n     long-term economic success. When Congress passed WIA, one of \n     the key goals was to create a more integrated system that is \n     flexible and responsive to the community needs. Through our \n     one-stop WorkForce Center System in Minnesota, we have \n     started to realize the benefits of working cooperatively \n     across programs to deliver better services to both job \n     seekers and employers within our communities. Without \n     adequate funding, we will not be able to realize the vision \n     of a seamless workforce development system that meets demands \n     of both job seekers and employers.\n       Thank you for your efforts to secure additional funding for \n     WIA programs. If the members of MWCA can be of further \n     assistance, please contact Lee Helgen, MWCA Executive \n     Director, at 651-224-3344.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Gordon Aanerud,\n\n                               Carlton County Commissioner, Chair,\n     Minnesota Workforce Council Association.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Rural Minnesota CEP, Inc.,\n\n                                 Detroit Lakes, MN, April 2, 2001.\n     Senator Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: On behalf of rural counties and \n     their residents, I am writing to urge you to support any \n     amendment to the budget resolution that would increase \n     funding for workforce investment act (WIA) programs.\n       WIA Dislocated Worker Programs: WIA programs are critical \n     to the future economy of rural areas. In our 19 county \n     service area, workers are being laid off from their jobs \n     every day. Our unemployment rate is significantly higher than \n     the state average. We need the resources to help these people \n     get back on their feet so they can support their families and \n     contribute to our local economy. A $200 million cut, as \n     proposed in the President's budget, in dislocated worker \n     programs will have a very negative impact on your \n     constituents.\n       WIA Adult Programs: Our Nation is experiencing a skill \n     shortage. Many more people could get high paying jobs if they \n     had the right skills. Rural businesses have a tough enough \n     time making their hard earned dollars stretch. Taking away \n     funds that provide them with a skilled workforce is taking \n     away any hope of their survival. If Congress cuts our \n     training budget, we won't be able to provide your \n     constituents with the skills training they need to get these \n     better jobs. A $100 million cut in the adult training budget \n     is going to make it very difficult for rural employers to be \n     competitive.\n       We have helped rural people move from welfare dependency to \n     financial independence. Our success includes moving people \n     into good jobs with career potential and upward mobility. We \n     will not be able to continue that if WIA program funds are \n     slashed by $500 million from current levels, as proposed in \n     the President's budget.\n       WIA Youth Programs: Many of our youth remain at risk. If \n     Congress doesn't fund this program adequately, too many of \n     our young people are going to be left behind. A $100 million \n     cut in the youth employment program will surely cost tax \n     payers increased expenditures in public assistance or \n     juvenile offender costs. And then there is the long-term cost \n     of a poorly prepared, inadequate workforce.\n       On behalf of employers, workers and future workers in my 19 \n     country service area, I am asking you to support any efforts \n     to increase budget authority for these Workforce Investment \n     Act programs. Please remember this is not a partisan issue. \n     It is an issue that deeply affects rural areas. Your support \n     will assure that rural people will receive the kind of \n     assistance that they need to succeed in the workplace.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Larry G. Buboltz,\n     Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Board of Hennepin County\n\n\n                                                Commissioners,\n\n                                   Minneapolis, MN, April 3, 2001.\n     Hon. Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: I am sending you this note to urge \n     you to support the Kennedy/Harkin amendment to the Budget \n     Resolution to increasing funding for the Workforce Investment \n     Act programs.\n       Here in Hennepin County, Minnesota, we have seen a decline \n     in the JTPA and then the WIA funding from $1,688,652 in 1984 \n     to $234,779 in 1999. As a county of over 1 million people, \n     the $200,000 dollar funding level is not adequate to meet the \n     needs of our constituents. In the area of dislocated workers, \n     the recent downturn in economic conditions has resulted in \n     daily notices of layoffs from companies in and around \n     Hennepin County. One of our major companies, ADC a major \n     supplier to the telecommunications industry, had an initial \n     layoff of some 500 people and last week indicated additional \n     layoffs of another 400-500 people. This is just one example \n     of many that we are seeing in our community. In today's \n     economy a skilled workforce in the cornerstone of economic \n     growth and prosperity and we believe that the Workforce \n     Investment Act allows us to respond to the needs of employers \n     and allows our residents the opportunity for jobs that can \n     support a family.\n       The outcomes for the Workforce Investment Act programs in \n     our area are as follows:\n\nEnrolled............................................................238\nProgram terminations................................................194\nPlaced in jobs......................................................164\nAverage wage at placement........................................$10.92\nCost per enrollment...........................................$1,195.70\nCost per job placement........................................$2,735.23\n\n       As you can see from the data, this program is cost \n     effective, driven by performance standards and performs \n     beyond the expectations set by Congress and the Department of \n     Labor.\n       Again, I urge you to vote for the amendment at $1 billion \n     per year over the next ten years.\n           Sincerely\n                                                 Peter McLaughlin,\n                                                     Commissioner.\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President I rise today to join my colleagues in the \nimportant dialogue surrounding the budget resolution. As has been well \ndocumented this week, the Bush-Domenici Resolution before this body is \na close approximation of the President's Budget Blueprint for New \nBeginnings. As member of the Senate Budget Committee I have been \nstudying this document for a number of weeks. I am convinced that this \nBudget represents a commitment to tax cuts, the repayment of the Debt \nOwed to the Public, and sensible reform.\n  Many of our priorities in Colorado are not radically different from \nthose of Americans all over this vast country. We are concerned with \neducation, the solvency of Social Security and Medicare, the \nstrengthening of our national defense, and the protection of our \nwonderful natural resources and environment. The President has also \naddressed one of the most pressing needs for our soldiers, providing \nfunding to improve the quality of life for our troops and their \nfamilies. I am pleased to say that I believe President Bush has \naddressed these national priorities in a direct and sensible way while \nalso speaking to the unique needs of Colorado.\n  The budget blueprint proposed by President bush makes an historic \nattack on the debt owed to the American people. If we have the courage \nto pass this budget we will begin the fastest and largest debt \nreduction in history. Lower government debt means greater fiscal \nsecurity for large government programs such as Social Security and \nlower interest rates on Coloradans who purchase homes, automobiles, and \nuse credit cards. Most importantly, future generations will not beard \nthe burden of our past fiscal irresponsibility. My grandchildren are \nseventh generation Coloradans, and I am dedicated to leaving them a \nbrighter fiscal outlook than we have before us today.\n  Fair tax relief for all taxpayers is a clear priority in the Budget \nResolution. In recent weeks there have been numerous assaults against \nthe tax cuts provided for in this legislation. In January, addressing \nthe Senate Budget Committee, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan \ndescribed this tax cut as moderate. In the scope of a $5.6 trillion \nfederal surplus over the next ten years I find it laughable that there \nare members of this body who claim this tax cut is unaffordable. In \nColorado the\n\n[[Page S3679]]\n\ntax cut results in $1,600 of tax relief for a typical tax paying family \nof four. A Colorado family of four making thirty-five thousand dollars \na year will receive a one-hundred percent federal income tax cut. \nFamilies making fifty thousand dollars will receive a fifty percent tax \ncut. More than one-and-a-half million Colorado taxpayers will benefit \nfrom the new, lowered rate structure, as will 329,000 Colorado small \nbusinesses and entrepreneurs.\n  The President's Budget also locks away every penny of the $2.6 \ntrillion Social Security surplus, an important step in preparing to \naddress the much needed reform of Social Security in the coming years. \nThe budget likewise directs every dollar of Medicare receipts be spent \nsolely for Medicare expenditures, including a modern and fiscally \nresponsible prescription drug program for the senior citizens of \nColorado and the nation.\n\n  The proposal before us dedicates the largest percentage spending \nincrease of any federal department to the Department of Education, an \nincrease of 11.5 percent. Further, the resolution before us will triple \nfunding for children's reading programs. Colorado's education funding \nwill increase over current levels to more than $461 million to give \nlocal schools more options and opportunities. Colorado's Head Start \nfunding will increase over current levels to more than $63.9 million. \nThis is truly an enormous fiscal commitment to the children of \nColorado. I would be remiss not to note, I am encouraged to see \nincreased funding over current levels to more than $21 million to help \nmore Colorado children awaiting adoption find homes faster.\n  The Budget Resolution also fully funds the Land and Water \nConservation Fund and gives the Environmental Protection Agency its \nsecond highest operating budget ever. In Colorado the budget provides \nmore than $6.6 million in funding for water resource projects, $32.8 \nmillion to fund Colorado environmental protection efforts, and over $8 \nmillion to help conserve Colorado's natural resources. As anyone who \nhas visited my home state in recent months knows, transportation \ncapacity is also an issue, and one this budget addresses. An estimated \n$334.8 million will go to Colorado highway funding.\n  Recognizing the long-term social benefits of accessible health \nservices and medical research the Bush-Domenici Resolution continues \nour pledge to double funding for the National Institutes of Health and \ncreates more than 1,200 new community health centers nationwide. The \nbudget further provides $391 million for programs and grants to help \nlocal fire departments and emergency services all across America with \ntraining, equipment and life-saving efforts.\n  I am pleased to support the Bush-Domenici Resolution and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues this year as we appropriate the \nfunds as outlined in this budget.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the budget \nresolution as well as an amendment I am offering which concerns the tax \ncut portion of the resolution.\n  This week's debate is quite likely the most important debate in this \nbody we have had, and will have, for several years. What we have before \nus is a budget blueprint that would completely reverse the direction of \nthe United States federal government budget, a 180 degree change from \nbudget policies we have pursued over the last eight years. What the \nMajority is offering is a repudiation of the fiscal discipline of the \n1990s and a return to the bold tax-cutting era of the 1980s.\n  And why not? The Congressional Budget Office projects surpluses as \nfar as the eye can see. Ten years from now, in 2011, they project a \nunified budget surplus of nearly 900 billion dollars. Social Security \nand Medicare, for at least several years, are on firm footing. Let's \nget this surplus money out of town, they say, before Washington \nbureaucrats have an opportunity to throw it down the drain.\n  It's a strong argument, it sounds good in TV ads and Sunday morning \ntalk shows. The American people should decide how their money is spent, \nnot Washington politicians detached and removed from Mainstreet, USA.\n  But the reality is quite different. The American people are not so \neasily deceived. Thanks to a previous Administration that demonstrated \nthe benefits for everyone of turning around government deficits, \ntaxpayers understand and appreciate the undeniable advantages of fiscal \ndiscipline. That is why when one puts before the public the following \nquestion, should the government send the surplus back in a tax cut or \ndivide the surplus equally between debt reduction, tax relief, and \npriority investments, the second option, the prudent and reasonable \noption, always wins.\n  So let's take a close look at the two options we have before us. This \ndebate should not be about sound bites. It is far too important.\n  The two options are the Democratic-favored balanced budget approach \nbased on principles of fairness, reasonable tax relief, and fiscal \ndiscipline or the Republican-favored approach of risky, back-loaded tax \ncuts dependent on surpluses which may or may not appear. Is this \nDemocratic approach, as the able senior Senator from Texas calls it, \njust an excuse not to support a tax cut? Far from it.\n  For the last 8 years, fiscal discipline has meant turning around 300 \nbillion dollar deficits into 200 billion plus surpluses. And what is a \nsurplus, it is savings. It means the government is a net saver instead \nof a net debtor. It means that the federal government is buying back \noutstanding Treasury bonds from the public. The public turns around and \ninvests that money elsewhere. In effect, every dollar of paid-down debt \nfrees up a dollar for the public to invest in the private sector, the \nengine of growth.\n  With the government acting as a net saver rather than a debtor, \ninflation is held in check and interest rates come down. The benefits \nto the American people are real. Auto loan rates are lower. Home \nmortgage rates are lower. Businesses have access to credit for \ninvestments, leading them to hire more workers and keeping unemployment \ndown. As everyone from Greenspan to Rubin to Summers have recognized, \nit is a virtuous cycle.\n  So what we have before us today is an effort to reverse that cycle, \nan effort to revert to another era, a prior era. We have been down that \nroad. Is that the direction we want to steer the country?\n  In the real world, a business would never write a check that it was \nnot sure it could pay. But that is exactly what Republicans want to do \nwith the biggest check of all. Let's write the check now and hope that \nwhen it comes due, there will be enough money in the bank to pay for \nit. Would any self-respecting businessman manage his company in such a \nfashion? The answer is no.\n  The reality is that most of the Republican tax cut would not even \ntake effect for several years, many provisions are so far into the \nfuture that they won't show up in any IRS form you file for nine or ten \nyears. Building an estate? Great. I just hope you don't have the \nmisfortune to pass away before 2011 because that is the year they \nrepeal the estate tax.\n  Can we really afford the check they are writing? That is the $64,000 \nquestion. Economic and budget forecasting is somewhat like a weather \nforecast, the further you go into the future and the more long-range \nthe forecast, the less likely it is to prove accurate.\n  What we do know is that if productivity levels drop to their \nhistorical average, rather than staying at the levels they reached in \nthe last few years, the surplus could fall by as much as $2 trillion.\n  And 84 percent of the surplus comes after the next presidential \nelection. Or put another way, two-thirds of the surplus comes in the \nsecond five years of the 10-year projection.\n\n  But we need to pass a tax cut today to keep from spending the money. \nLast time I checked there were no spending proposals on the table that \npostpone their effective dates for 5 years. In the same way, we \nshouldn't be passing tax cuts that don't take effect for another 5 \nyears. Let's pass a short-term tax cut, and if the money comes in like \nthe rosy forecasts indicate, we can extend it when the date arrives.\n  I want to address some specific aspects of this budget before us. \nBack in February, we held a special joint session to hear our new \nPresident's priorities for the future. President Bush stated, \n``Education is my top priority and, by supporting this budget, you'll\n\n[[Page S3680]]\n\nmake it yours, as well.'' The truth rests in the numbers. The Bush \nbudget includes 40 dollars in tax cuts for every one dollar increase in \neducation.\n  This budget resolution makes clear that President Bush's tax cut \nproposal is a higher priority than addressing key priorities, such as \neducation and child care and that his enormous tax cut crowds out \nsignificant investments in education.\n  Yesterday this body made significant strides toward increasing the \nbudget numbers for education by reducing the tax cut. I am thrilled \nthat the Senate voted to increase funding for important education \npriorities by $250 billion over 10 years. The majority leader has \nexpressed his intention to attempt to overturn that vote later this \nweek. I sincerely hope that that does not occur. The President's budget \ndoes not include a sufficient investment in public education. The \namendment passed yesterday brings us much closer to the investment that \nwe must make in public education in order to ensure each child has \naccess to a first-rate education.\n  Despite the President's claims, education funding in his budget does \nnot keep pace with previous congressional funding increases for \neducation. The President says that he is requesting an increase of $4.6 \nbillion for education, and he takes great pride in claiming a 11.5 \npercent funding increase over the last fiscal year. But the President's \noutline includes only a 5.9 percent increase at the program level. To \nput that in plain English, almost half of the increase that Bush is \ntouting as his major investment in education would happen even if the \nbudget didn't pass and the appropriations process did not occur.\n  About $2 billion of Bush's funding increase for his so-called ``top \npriority'' was forward-funded last year. So the actual increase in new \nspending that Bush is proposing is only about $2.5 billion. That is \none-third the average rate of increase in education spending over the \npast four years, after adjusting for inflation. Here is the area that \nthe President has identified as his highest priority, education, and it \nwould have its recent rate of growth reduced by two-thirds.\n  We don't know yet exactly which education programs Bush will increase \nfunding for, because none of us have seen the details of Bush's budget. \nBut he has said that he plans to provide funding for his reading first \ninitiative, increase funding for special education, increase the \nmaximum level of Pell Grants, increase funding for improving teacher \nquality, and provide more funding for character education. All of these \nare laudable goals and funding increases that I wholeheartedly support. \nBut what about Title I funding? Does the President propose to increase \nfunding for the most disadvantaged students? And what about after-\nschool programs and making our schools safe? What about more funding \nfor education technology? In the last administration, we accomplished \nthe amazing feat of connecting every school to the Internet. But will \nthis President help schools to incorporate technology into the \ncurriculum? We just don't know, and by math there won't be enough money \nfor these priorities after this massive tax cut. That is why it is so \ncritically important that the Harkin amendment not be overturned and \nthe tax cut be decreased in order to pay for these important \ninitiatives.\n  One critically important initiative that we know the President's \nbudget will not make a priority is school renovation and construction. \nThere is overwhelming need for school construction funding. Three-\nquarters of our schools are in need of repairs, renovation, or \nmodernization. More than one-third of schools rely on portable \nclassrooms, such as trailers, many of which lack heat or air \nconditioning. Twenty percent of public schools report unsafe \nconditions, such as failing fire alarms or electric problems. At the \nsame time our schools are aging, the number of students is growing, up \nnine percent since 1990. The Department of Education estimates that \n2,400 new schools will be needed by 2003. Last month the American \nSociety of Civil Engineers released their ``2001 Report Card for \nAmerica's Infrastructure,'' which grades the condition of the nation's \nschools, drinking water, wastewater, transportation needs and so forth. \nOf all the categories included in the report, schools received the \nlowest mark, a D-. Despite these facts, despite the desperate need for \nrepair and renovation, the Bush budget provides only a modest \ninvestment in school construction and only allows for the use of \nprivate activity bonds for schools, a mechanism that requires a major \ncorporate sponsor to finance a school, which would help only a few \ncommunities that are struggling to meet growing enrollments or upgrade \ntheir crumbling schools.\n  As many of my colleagues have already mentioned, there was a very \ndisturbing report in the New York Times several weeks ago about the \nanticipated cuts to critical children's programs. I am extremely \ndistressed by this news. The President's singular focus on cutting \ntaxes undermines critical programs like child care, early learning \nfunding, child abuse treatment and prevention. The President plans to \ncut, not just slow the rate of spending, $200 million from the Child \nCare and Development Fund. I would like to point out that there is a \nwaiting list of more than 16,000 children in Massachusetts who await \nthe opportunity to receive quality child care through this fund.\n\n  I cannot figure out what has motivated the President to zero out the \nEarly Learning Opportunities Act. This legislation, sponsored by \nSenator Stevens, passed the Congress last year with bipartisan support. \nPresident Bush believes strongly in literacy. And we all know that \nchildren who begin school lacking the ability to recognize letters, \nnumbers, and shapes quickly fall behind their peers. Students who reach \nthe first grade without having had the opportunity to develop cognitive \nor language comprehension skills begin school at a disadvantage. \nChildren who have not had the chance to develop social and emotional \nskills do not begin school ready to learn. I'm sure that President Bush \nknows these things. So why would he cut funding for the Early Learning \nOpportunities Act, which seeks to bring together state and local \nresources to ensure that children begin school ready to learn?\n  I guarantee you this, if you ask the American people whether they \nwould prefer this enormous tax cut at the expense of funding for child \ncare, child abuse prevention and treatment, and funding for early \nlearning programs, they will unequivocally tell you that they want \nthose programs strengthened and enhanced, not decimated, or in the case \nof the Early Learning Opportunities Act, zeroed out. It's certainly \nclear that children are not the President's top priority, his enormous \ntax cut is. We voted yesterday to support those programs that we know \nthe American people care about. We must hold strong and resist attempts \nto undermine the funding commitment for these important programs.\n  As we all know, the real details of the Bush budget are still locked \nup somewhere in the White House. The President wants Congress to leave \ntown before those numbers are released. And well he should, because \nthose numbers are going to show what we have all known for some time. \nCompassionate conservatism is code language for cuts in children's \nprograms, health care, the environment and other national priorities.\n  While we have not yet received the real Bush budget, what we are \nlearning through confirmed accounts is that the budget will: cut child \ncare grants by $200 million, cut child abuse programs by $16 million, \nand would entirely eliminate the $20 million ``early learning'' fund \nfor child care and education for children under the age of 5 which is \nbased on legislation I wrote.\n  Cut funding for training health care providers in medically \nunderserved areas by nearly $100 million.\n  Cut the Office of Minority Health by 12 percent.\n  Cut training for doctors at children's hospitals.\n  Eliminate the COPS, or Community Policy Services Program.\n  The list goes on. Someone will have to explain to me how cutting \nchild care grants and child abuse programs is compassionate because I \njust don't see it.\n  Let's take a couple minutes to look at the President's research and \ndevelopment agenda.\n  Unfortunately, the President's budget plan will do serious damage to \nfunding available for scientific R Experts agree that over the past \n50 years,\n\n[[Page S3681]]\n\nadvances in science and technology have contributed to half our \nnation's economic growth. It's true that investments in R tend to pay \noff only in the long term. For instance, much of the growth we enjoyed \nin the 90s stemmed from investments the federal government made in \nscience in the 1960s. The ubiquitous computer which is so critical to \nour productivity today would not be available to us if serious research \nhad not begun decades ago. But, this budget fails to look to the long \nterm, and by failing to adequately provide for investment in science \nand technology, will slow economic growth and leave our children and \nour grandchildren with far fewer opportunities than we had just a few \nshort years ago.\n  Instead of increasing the growth of science and technology, the \nPresident's budget proposal ignores the R needs of the nation. \nAlthough the Administration has indicated support for a $2.8 billion \nincrease in the National Institutes of Health budget for FY 2002, many \nother research initiatives will not receive the funding levels they \nneed. The President's budget proposal for next year projects that non-\ndefense R will decline by 7.8 percent adjusted for inflation, by \nfiscal year 2005. This is more than five times faster than the decline \nin total federal spending. After accounting for inflation, the Bush \nbudget cuts the National Science Foundation by 2.6 percent, NASA by 3.6 \npercent and the Department of Energy by 7.1 percent. In the end, under \nthe Bush budget federal support for science will decrease by 6 percent \nby 2005 as a share of the Gross Domestic Product. This is contrary to \nthe commitment we should be making to innovation and entrepreneurship.\n  This budget's approach to science and technology research is short-\nsighted and irresponsible. But don't take my word for it. Take the word \nof the science and technology advisor to the first President Bush. \nAllan Bromley, a nuclear physics professor at Yale, recently wrote an \neditorial that was published in the New York Times in which he \nexpressed his concern about the impact the President's R cuts will \nhave on the economy. He succinctly stated:\n\n       The proposed cuts to scientific research are a self-\n     defeating policy. Congress must increase the federal \n     investment in science. No science, no surplus. It's that \n     simple.\n\n  So we have a budget blueprint before us that essentially rubberstamps \na Presidential budget which we have yet to see, but that we are slowly \nlearning, through leaks, will substantially cut a number of priorities \nthat many of my Colleagues and the nation share.\n  Now, I would like to take some time to discuss the President's tax \nplan and an amendment I am offering. We hear so much talk about how the \nPresident's tax plan provides the largest percentage reductions to low \nand middle-income families. Mr. President, it's just not true. The \nreality is that the President's tax cut would leave out 28 million \ntaxpayers, taxpayers who see 15.3 percent of every paycheck go directly \nto the taxman. I'm talking about people who pay payroll taxes.\n  For all taxpaying families, the average annual payroll tax burden is \nover $5,000. The average payroll tax payment has risen from $3,640 in \n1979 to $5,010 in 1999. For the vast majority of taxpayers, payroll \ntaxes, Social Security and Medicare, generate the largest tax burden.\n  Federal payroll taxes actually exceed federal income taxes for 80 \npercent of all families and individuals with earnings. For single-\nparent families, the number is even more alarming. Today, 95 percent of \nsingle-parent households pay more in payroll taxes than income taxes.\n  According to the National Women's Law Center, over 3 million women \nraising children as a single parent, or 36 percent of all single \nmothers and their families, will receive no tax benefit from the Bush \nplan. Likewise, almost half of the black and Hispanic women raising \nchildren as a single parent would not benefit a one penny.\n  These taxpayers lose out because the President's tax plan focuses \nonly on marginal income tax rates. The House has made some small steps \nto address this issue, but more needs to be done if we are going to \npass a balanced and fair tax bill.\n  My amendment would require that any substantial tax relief \nlegislation, 500 billion or greater, which comes to the floor of the \nSenate this year include a certification by the Senate Finance \nCommittee that it provides significant relief for the 28 million \ntaxpayers who pay payroll taxes but who do not have sufficient earnings \nto generate income tax liability. Tax legislation which did not include \na certification by the Senate Finance Committee, or conferees in the \ncase of a tax bill conference report, would be subject to a 60-vote \npoint of order.\n  This amendment is a small step we need to take to ensure that as the \nSenate develops tax legislation, it maintains a commitment to providing \nREAL relief to all taxpayers, not a selected few. I can not imagine why \nanyone would oppose such a reasonable amendment. Clearly, any large tax \nbill should hold dearly the interests of all working families and I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I must oppose this budget because it is an \nirresponsible gamble with our economic future.\n  This resolution sets aside trillions of projected budget surpluses \nfor tax cuts proposed by President Bush that are steeply tilted to the \nwealthy. It pays for the Bush tax plan at the expense of needed \ninvestments in Social Security, Medicare, education, law enforcement \nand the environment. In addition, the cost of the Bush tax plan \nimperils our ability to pay off the national debt so that this nation \ncan finally be debt free by the end of the decade.\n  We should remember that the nation still carries the burden of a \nnational debt of $3.4 trillion. Like someone who had finally paid off \nhis or her credit card balance but still has a home mortgage, the \nfederal government has finally balanced its annual budget, but we still \nhave a national debt to pay off. In the meantime, the Federal \ngovernment has to pay almost $900 million in interest every working day \non this national debt.\n  Paying off our national debt will help to sustain our sound economy \nby keeping interest rates low. Vermonters gain ground with lower \nmortgage costs, car payments and credit card charges with low interest \nrates. In addition, small business owners in Vermont can invest, expand \nand create jobs with low interest rates.\n  I want to leave a legacy for our children and grandchildren of a \ndebt-free nation by 2010. We can achieve that legacy if the Congress \nmaintains its fiscal discipline. But this budget resolution tosses out \nfiscal responsibility for voodoo economics. It is based on a house of \ncards made up of rosy budget scenarios for the next ten years. Any \ndownturn in the economy, are of which we are now beginning to \nexperience, threatens to topple this house of cards.\n  The $5.6 trillion surplus that President Bush and others are counting \non to pay for huge tax cuts tilted toward the wealthiest one percent is \nbased on mere projections over the next decade. It is not real. Many in \nCongress have been talking about the $5.6 trillion surplus as if it is \nalready money in the United States Treasury. It is not.\n  Let us take a close look at this $5.6 trillion. When you subtract the \nportion of the projected surplus that is expected to come from Social \nSecurity, we are left with $3.1 trillion over ten years. When you set \nthe Medicare surpluses to the side, and use more realistic assumptions \nabout taxes and spending over the next several years, that reduces the \navailable surplus to $2.0 trillion. Under this scenario, the \nPresident's proposed tax cut of $1.6 trillion therefore has the \npotential to wipe out the entire surplus in one fell swoop. And that's \nIF the budget surplus projections are accurate.\n\n  While none of us hope that the budget surpluses are lower than we \nexpect, to be responsible we need to understand that this is a real \npossibility. In its budget and economic outlook released on January \n1st, CBO devotes an entire chapter to the uncertainty of budget \nprojections. CBO says that ``considerable uncertainty surrounds those \nprojections.'' This is because CBO cannot predict what legislation \nCongress might pass that would alter federal spending and revenues. In \naddition, CBO says--and anyone who watched the volatility of our \nmarkets over the past few weeks knows--that the U.S. economy and \nfederal budget are highly complex and are affected by many factors that \nare difficult to predict.\n\n[[Page S3682]]\n\n  In their economic outlook CBO warns Congress that there is only a 10 \npercent chance that the surpluses will materialize as projected. When \nCBO takes its own track record on forecasting surpluses, they caution \nthat the projected surpluses over the next five years may be off in one \ndirection or the other, on average, by about $52 billion in 2001, $120 \nbillion in 2002, and $412 billion in 2006. Remember, that data is only \nfor five-year projections. CBO has been making 10-year projections for \nless than a decade, so they admit it is not yet possible to assess \ntheir accuracy. But 10-year projections are likely to be even less \naccurate than five-year projections.\n  For 2001 alone, there is considerable uncertainty about the size of \nthe budget surplus. In January, CBO estimated that the total surplus in \n2001 would reach $281 billion. Earlier in this month, however, Merrill \nLynch dropped its estimate to $250 billion. Wells Capital Management, \nan arm of Wells Fargo, estimates a $225 billion surplus this year and a \n$185 billion surplus next year, 40 percent lower than the CBO's \nestimate for 2002.\n  With all of this uncertainty in projecting future surpluses, it is \namazing to me that the budget resolution insists on a fixed $1.2 \ntrillion in tax cut. And the tax cuts proposed by President Bush may \ncost much more than $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  Let us take a closer look at these proposed tax cuts.\n  The President's tax plan, by focusing only on income tax rate \nreductions, leaves out millions of taxpayers who do not pay federal \nincome taxes but who do pay payroll taxes. In Vermont, there are 23,000 \nfamilies who do not pay federal income taxes. But 82 percent of those \nfamilies do pay payroll taxes. For the vast majority of taxpayers, \npayroll taxes generate the largest tax burden, and yet the President's \nplan does not touch payroll taxes.\n  With all of the uncertainty in these projections, Congress should \ntread very carefully when considering the size of the tax cut. While \nrosy surplus projections may have been accurate yesterday, we need to \npay attention to circumstances today. Even Goldilocks could tell you \nthat porridge that's just right one day, may be too cold a few days \nlater. Congress needs to recognize that the surplus projections are not \nset in stone, that it is not only possible, but even likely that the \nprojections will change and that the surpluses themselves will differ \nfrom those projections.\n  I was one of five Senators who are still in the Senate who voted \nagainst the Reagan tax plan in 1981. We saw what happened there--we had \na huge tax cut, defense spending increased, and the national debt \nquadrupled.\n  I am concerned about enacting a huge tax cut before fulfilling our \ncurrent unfunded federal mandates. The President's budget outline \nproposed up to a 30 percent cut in grants to state an local law \nenforcement. I've written a letter to the President and the Department \nof Justice, along with 17 other Senators, opposing those cuts. I am \npleased that my amendment restoring $1.5 billion to fully fund the \nDepartment of Justice's local law enforcement programs was accepted.\n  I supported an amendment to increase funding for private lands \nagriculture conservation programs by $1.3 billion for Fiscal Year 2002, \nincluding the Farmland Protection Program and EQIP--the Environmental \nQuality Incentives Program. I know there is a need for five to ten \ntimes this amount for these programs.\n  I supported several education amendments. These included amendments \nto increase the Pell Grant for student financial aid and increased \nsupport for the TRIO program, a successful initiative that provides \nsupport to first generation college students, particularly those from \nrural areas. However, the current budget proposal does not commit \nsufficient funds in this area. I was pleased to join my colleague from \nVermont, Senator Jeffords, in an effort to fully fund the federal \ngovernment's portion of IDEA costs.\n  The President's budget proposes a $1 billion increase in \ndiscretionary veterans health spending. Such a meager increase barely \ncovers inflation in the Department of Veterans Affairs' current \nprograms, let alone provides the department flexibility to increase the \navailability and quality of care. I am also concerned that this budget \nsqueezes this money out of critical veterans health research programs, \nleaving investigations into spinal injuries and war wounds at \ninadequate levels.\n  After years of hard choices, we have balanced the budget and started \nbuilding surpluses. Now we must make responsible choices for the \nfuture. Our top four priorities should be paying off the national debt, \npassing a fair and responsible tax cut, saving Social Security, and \ncreating a real Medicare prescription drug benefit.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise in support of final passage of the \nbudget resolution and to declare victory.\n  Today, all Americans who believe in fiscal responsibility, budget, a \nsound economy, and fair treatment for taxpayers, can declare victory. \nAll of us who want a government that restrains its appetites and lives \nwithin its means, while meeting critical national needs, and letting \nhard-working individuals and families keep a little more of the fruits \nof their labor, can declare victory.\n  Today we are approving a budget that is balanced, not only because it \nis in surplus, but balanced in how it would allocate the resources \nprovided by the American people.\n  Today we are approving a budget plan that, if we follow it, will: \nfirst and foremost, pay off all the publicly held debt that possibly \ncan be paid off in the next ten years; hold the line on the growth of \nfederal spending and the size of government; fully protect Social \nSecurity and Medicare for today's and tomorrow's seniors, and begin the \nprocess of modernizing them, to make them ready for today's workers; \nanswer the demands of the American people to take action on major needs \nin areas like education, medical research, national defense, care for \nour veterans, the environment, and prescription drugs; and provide \nmodest, reasonable, and prompt tax relief to the most heavily taxed \ngeneration in American history.\n  Could we have produced a better budget this week? Of course we could. \nBut I will never let the perfect be the enemy of the very, very good.\n  The Senate has added several billion dollars in new spending to this \nbudget. I wish we could have done that without raiding the surplus or \ncollecting more taxes. I wish we could have addressed priorities within \nthe reasonable total, the increased total, proposed by the President.\n  But we have wisely turned down amendments for hundreds of billions of \ndollars in new spending, and we have stuck fairly closely to the \nresponsible plan we and the President started with.\n  And whether, at the end of the year, we enact ten-year tax relief \ntotaling $1.2 trillion, $1.6 trillion as proposed by the President, or \n$2 trillion, which this Senator thinks is closer to the right amount, \nwe will have won, common-sense conservatism will have won, and the \nAmerican people will have won.\n  To fully appreciate where we are, we need to remember where we have \nbeen.\n  When I first came to Congress, in the other body, I plunged into \nfighting for a balanced federal budget. The jaded political veterans \ntold me, You will never see it in your lifetime. The problem was so \nintractable, we formed a bipartisan coalition to push for a balanced \nbudget amendment to the Constitution.\n  Eight short years ago, the experts told us we faced $300 billion \nbudget deficits as far as the eye could see. The previous president \nsaid balancing the budget was a bad idea, and he pushed through the \nbiggest tax increase in history to pay for more and more spending. By \n1994, that tax hike, along with the Clinton health care plan to \nnationalize one-seventh of the economy, produced the first Republican \nCongress in 40 years.\n\n  Observant students of history and those with good memories will \nrecall that the economy was limping and anemic during 1993 and 1994. \nThat new Congress took office declaring that Job One was balancing the \nbudget, so we could produce surpluses that would save Social Security \nand Medicare, pay down the debt, and provide tax relief. The real \nupturn, the acceleration of the markets and confidence in the economy, \nbegan when we made this commitment to responsible, limited government.\n  The economy received a booster shot with the bipartisan Taxpayer \nRelief\n\n[[Page S3683]]\n\nAct of 1997. In that bill, we cut capital gains taxes, which further \nunleashed the economic activity that is producing today's surpluses.\n  Now, with a slowing economy, the time has come, again, for a booster \nshot. Today's budget resolution, with spending restraint, tax relief, \nand paying down the debt, is that booster shot.\n  It is positive that, this week, we have voted to accelerate tax \nrelief. American workers and their families needed tax relief \nyesterday, relief from the death tax, from the marriage penalty, and to \nhelp meet education and other family needs.\n  We've heard a lot of revisionist history this week, with Senators \ncriticizing President Reagan's 1981 tax relief package. The single \nbiggest mistake Congress made in revising President Reagan's plan was \nin not starting is soon enough. The economic recovery of 1982 began, \nthe boom of the 1980s began, when President Reagan's tax plan finally \ntook effect. If we really can learn from the mistakes of the past, we \nshould learn that prompt tax relief keeps the nation healthy.\n  It's also a positive sign for prompt tax relief that the Senate has \nagreed to keep the tax relief in this budget free from filibusters \nlater in the year.\n  This is a budget that will keep the nation healthy, if we continue to \nfollow through on it. It is the Senate's budget, and we have made \nadjustments throughout the week. But make no mistake about it, when you \nlook at all of it, it is still mostly the President's budget, too.\n  I also want to comment on a couple specifics in this budget.\n  As a member of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I am always \nwatchful of how the Congress and the Administration propose to treat \nour nation's veterans. This President's budget began with a $1 billion \nincrease in discretionary veterans programs and a $4 billion increase, \noverall--more than 8 percent. Without a doubt, this president has a \nhigher level of commitment to the well-being of veterans than we saw in \nthe previous administration.\n  The House-passed budget added to that amount and now, so has the \nSenate. Spending per veteran, not overall, but per veteran, accounting \nfor increased caseload, will be about 50 percent more than in 1995.\n  The Veterans Administration (VA) represents millions of men and women \nwho have served our great nation, often at extreme sacrifice. \nTherefore, in gratitude it is important that we insure that our \nveterans receive the care and services they were promised and most \ncertainly deserve. Over the past years, since I have been a member of \nthe Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, there has been a steady \nincrease in spending per veteran. In 1995, VA spending was $1,465 per \nveteran. In 2002, the Senate committee on Veterans' Affairs recommends \nspending $2,228 per veteran. That is a 52 percent increase since 1995.\n  I also commend my Idaho colleague, Senator Crapo, for the amendment \nadopted last night by the Senate, to safeguard necessary funding for \nthe Department of Energy's Atomic Energy Defense Account. This is \nneeded to continue progress in waste treatment and management, site \nmaintenance and closure, environmental restoration, and technology \ndevelopment, while meeting its legally binding compliance commitments \nto the states. This is of vital interest in our home state of Idaho, \nhome of the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, to \nsimilar sites in other states, and to the environmental safety and \nwell-being of the nation. I was pleased to cosponsor and support the \nbipartisan Crapo-Murray-Craig amendment.\n  I now look forward to resolving the differences between the Senate-\npassed budget and the House's version and working in the coming months \non the legislation necessary to implement this budget. We have made a \ngood start and today is a good day to declare victory for the American \npeople.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I rise to express my support of the budget \nresolution we approved today. This was a long and arduous process, but \nI am pleased that at the end of the day we have a document that both \nRepublicans and Democrats can embrace.\n  I also extend my deep appreciation and admiration to Budget Chairman \nDomenici for doing his usual outstanding job of overseeing the Senate's \nconsideration of the federal budget.\n  This weeks' debate was about how best to allocate the apparent budget \nsurplus that our nation is beginning to achieve. I appreciate President \nBush's leadership in calling for a part of our surplus to be returned \nto the taxpayers.\n  While all Americans may desire a tax cut, I believe it is also true \nthat all Americans would like Congress to continue its prudent course \nof balanced budgets. I am concerned that a tax cut of $1.6 trillion \nover ten years would seriously impair our ability to maintain a \nbalanced budget, while meeting the necessary priorities of debt \nreduction, infrastructure development, improvement in health and \neducation, and Social Security and Medicare reform.\n  I was pleased to work within the Centrist Coalition, a bipartisan \ngroup of Senators, to fashion a compromise tax cut. I am very thankful \nfor the friendship and leadership in particular of Senators John \nBreaux, Jim Jeffords, and Ben Nelson. I believe that we have helped the \nSenate come to a compromise, and am proud to have joined a group of \nsuch thoughtful and constructive people.\n  I am not without my reservations about the compromise tax cut of $1.2 \ntrillion over ten years that we have approved today. It is still large \nfor my preference, but I recognize that in order to work in a \nbipartisan manner one must be able to compromise in a principled \nmanner. I believe that that is what we have accomplished here, and that \nbelief is borne out by the fact that 65 Senators supported the final \nbudget, which included the compromise tax cut.\n  Beyond the tax cut, the Senate has made its mark on this budget. \nSenator Domenici brought to the floor a budget that closely reflected \nthe President's priorities. We took up amendment after amendment, \nconsidered each by its merits, and dispensed with them. These \namendments reflected our priorities in several areas. We can see those \npriorities in the document that we now send to the House and Senate \nconferees to negotiate. We see a doubling of the money set aside for \nprescription drugs, to $300 billion over ten years. We see $320 billion \nset aside for education, which includes enough money to fully fund the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act. As a former Mayor who has \nhad to budget for the costs of providing the best service for these \nspecial children, it was a particular priority of mine to have the \nfederal government pay its fair share. We see increased money for \ndefense, for veterans, and for farmers. We see the work on \nenvironmental issues, including funding for conservation and global \nwarming. And, we see the work on urgent health matters, including \nincreased health care coverage for the uninsured. And, of great \nimportance to those of us in the Northeast, we see an increase of \nenergy funds for our low-income citizens.\n  This is a good budget. It is perhaps not perfect, but it shows the \nbenefit of having a strong President providing leadership in stating \nhis priorities, and the value of centrist leadership in Congress to win \nwider acceptance of the President's proposals.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Senate has begun debating the Federal \nbudget for next year and the years ahead. We are fortunate after years \nof large budget deficits, to finally enjoy a projected budget surplus, \na real surplus separate and apart from the Social Security surplus. \nWhile this new ``on-budget'' surplus provides us with many \npossibilities, it also requires us to balance how best to use our \nresources within a framework of fiscal responsibility. If we choose the \nwrong path we could return to the days of big Federal deficits and all \nthe damage they did to our economy.\n  In approaching our Federal budget, I believe we should divide the \nprojected surplus among four budget goals: giving the American people \nfair and fiscally responsible tax relief, paying down the debt, \nprotecting Social Security and Medicare, and responsibly investing in \nkey priorities such as education, prescription drug coverage for \nseniors, environmental protection and national defense.\n  In deciding how to allocate the new surplus, we should first and \nforemost remember it is a projection for ten years downstream, so it is \nhighly speculative. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, \ncautions legislators that there is only a 10 percent\n\n[[Page S3684]]\n\nlikelihood that its ten-year projection will prove accurate. This is \nespecially troublesome because most of the surplus, upon which the \nPresident's tax cuts rely, is not projected to accrue until after 2005, \nthe most unreliable years of the forecast. History has shown that CBO \nprojections only 5 years in to the future have been off by as much as \n268 percent.\n  Understanding that these projections are uncertain, here's what I \nthink should be done with surplus dollars that actually materialize:\n  First, I would protect the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. \nWe have to take prudent steps today to ensure that as 77 million baby \nboomers retire over the next 30 years, the costs of their Social \nSecurity and Medicare won't explode the Federal budget. In just 15 \nyears, the Social Security and Medicare programs will require transfers \nfrom the ``non-Social Security and non-Medicare'' side of the Federal \nbudget in order to pay benefits. Without reform, these transfers will \nget larger and larger, placing enormous pressure on the federal \nbudget--pressure that would be compounded if President Bush's proposed \ntax cuts were enacted. Thus I think it is imperative to set aside the \nsurpluses that are currently accumulating in these trust funds and not \nuse them for new spending or tax cuts--as the President's budget \nproposes to do.\n  Next, I would allocate one-third of the projected $2.5 trillion non-\nSocial Security, non-Medicare surplus for tax cuts. We have proposed an \nimmediate stimulus tax cut package that could provide taxpayers with up \nto $450 of relief this year, $900 for married couples filing jointly. \nThe first part of the package would to give a one-time tax refund to \neveryone who paid payroll or income taxes last year, in 2000. Couples \nwould get a check for $600 and singles would get a check for $300 as \nearly as July, if the provision were enacted now. The second part of \nthe package would permanently cut the 15 percent income tax rate to 10 \npercent for the first $12,000 of taxable income for couples and the \nfirst $6,000 of taxable income for singles. This would save couples an \nadditional $600 per year and singles an additional $300 per year and, \nif enacted soon, the decrease in paycheck withholding could begin in \nJuly. This package is a truly broad-based relief measure aimed at \nstimulating the economy.\n\n  We also should increase the Earned Income Tax Credit for working \nfamilies with children, substantial marriage penalty relief, and the \namount of money exempt from estate taxes, so that less than one percent \nof the country's wealthiest estates would remain on the tax roll. Under \nthis approach, all American taxpayers would get a tax cut, but the \nlion's share would go to middle income Americans, that is to those who \nneed it most.\n  President Bush's plan mostly benefits the wealthiest among us. Under \nhis plan, 5 percent of taxpayers would get more than 50 percent of the \nbenefit. As a result, most of the surplus is used in tax cuts, leaving \nlittle or nothing for debt reduction and other important priorities.\n  While this top 5 percent would receive huge tax breaks under the \nPresident's plan, it leaves 25 million taxpaying Americans, who pay \ntheir Federal taxes through payroll taxes, without a single dollar of \ntax relief. I agreed with President Bush when he said that every \nAmerican taxpayer should receive tax relief. But his plan, which leaves \nout 25 million people, falls far short of that goal and leaves out \nthose taxpayers who need relief the most.\n  In addition to providing tax relief, we need to dedicate a large \nportion of the surplus to reducing our debt so that we don't push this \nimmense burden onto our children and grandchildren. For the first time \nin a generation, we have the opportunity and the resources to pay down \nthe enormous debt and we should do so. Additionally, by paying down the \ndebt, we can help keep interest rates low well into the future giving \nall Americans an economic benefit.\n  Our plan calls for dedicating one-third of the non-Social Security, \nnon-Medicare surplus to reducing the $3 trillion plus portion of our \nnational debt that is outstanding and held by domestic and foreign \ninvestors. In contrast, the President's budget does not use any of the \nprojected non-Social security, non-Medicare surplus for debt reduction.\n  Finally, we need to invest some of our surplus responsibly in new \ninitiatives and important benefits, like prescription drug coverage for \nseniors and education programs for our students. Using one-third of our \nnon-Social Security, non-Medicare surplus to meet the basic life-\nsustaining needs of our seniors, to build a smarter 21st century \nworkforce, and to prepare for other. unforeseen challenges, will pay \nhuge dividends in the long run. President Bush's budget--focusing on \ntax cuts at the expense of everything else--leaves little room for new \ninvestments or unanticipated needs and actually makes drastic cuts to \nsome very important federal programs which millions of Americans and \nthe communities they live in count on.\n\n  The next chart compares the Democratic plan to President Bush's plan, \nshowing how the Bush plan comes up short in key areas because of the \nsize of the tax cut.\n  As budget debate continues in the weeks ahead, Congress will be \nmaking some important decisions regarding our country's future. We have \nthe ability to provide targeted tax relief, fund some important \nnational priorities and protect Social Security and Medicare for future \ngenerations, while dedicating significant resources to paying down the \nnational debt.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the budget \nbefore us and to outline a few points that I believe need to be \nconsidered while we debate our national budget priorities.\n  There is no doubt that the focus of much of this week has been on the \nperceived need for, and the size of, a tax cut. I support efforts to \nprovide hard-working families in my home state of Washington, and \nacross the country, with tax relief. I expect Congress to take up \nlegislation to eliminate the marriage penalty, provide estate tax \nrelief, make college tuition tax deductible, and assist workers in \nsaving for their retirement. In addition, I believe that comprehensive \ntax reform proposals must expand the Dependent Care Tax Credit to help \nfamilies provide care for their children and expand the Earned Income \nTax Credit to make it work better for more hard-working families.\n  However, I am concerned that we balance our efforts to cut taxes with \nour nation's fiscal and policy responsibilities, and our obligation not \nto increase our national debt level. Comprehensive tax relief must be \nmeasured against the need to maintain fiscal discipline, and stimulate \neconomic growth through continued federal investment in education, job \ntraining and infrastructure, while also protecting the environment. We \nalso need to invest in our nation's economic future by making a \ncommitment to public research and development in science and \ntechnology--maintaining our status as a global leader. And, it is \ncritical that we meet the needs of the nation's elderly and enact a \nmeaningful prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Furthermore, we must realize that much of the debate on the shape and \nsize of tax cuts is dependent on the reliability of surplus projections \nthat may or may not materialize.\n  These are the numbers at issue this week: The projected unified \nsurplus over the next ten years is supposed to be $5.6 trillion. But \nwhat we need to be discussing is not this amount--but the amount of the \nnon-Social Security, non-Medicare surplus. And when we take both of \nthose trust funds off the budget line, we are left with $2.7 trillion \nover ten years with which to work.\n  It is critical that the funding levels in our budget guarantee that \nAmericans have access to needed health care. We also need to invest in \nour children's education by hiring more teachers, increasing teacher \npay, providing enhanced training opportunities, and modernizing our \neducational system. And, we need to commit to programs that keep our \ncitizens safe, and our environment clean.\n  We seem to be tripping over ourselves right now to spend a surplus--\neither on tax cuts or on increased discretionary spending--that, \nfrankly, we are uncertain will even appear. As we all know, projections \nare notoriously inaccurate and, therefore, highly likely to be wrong \neven if they are only for the upcoming year. Based on its track record, \nthe Congressional Budget Office says its surplus estimate for 2001 \ncould be off in one direction or the other by $52 billion. By 2006, \nthis figure could be off by $412 billion.\n  Remember that last year CBO projected that the ten-year surplus would \nbe $3.2 trillion, $2.4 trillion less than the projection it released \nthis past January. This means that in just one year the surplus \nestimate has increased by 75 percent.\n  In fact, CBO admits that it is most uncertain about projections for \nthe years it forecasts the largest surpluses. CBO makes clear that $3.6 \ntrillion of the $5.6 trillion unified surplus is open to question.\n  Besides debating surpluses that may or may not materialize, this \nbudget process is the first step in outlining our nation's fiscal \npriorities for the upcoming year. However, we must not forget that in \naddition to figuring ways to fund our political priorities, it is our \nduty to focus on meeting our national responsibilities.\n  And this is where my concern rests with the President's budget. I \nbelieve that Congress can enact reasonable and responsible tax relief \nwhile fulfilling our nation's responsibilities.\n  But it seems that the President is funding a $2.0 trillion tax cut at \nthe expense of other programs. A tax cut this large would use 81 \npercent of the non-Social Security, non-Medicare surplus over the next \n10 years, leaving the President and Congress $527 billion, or just 20 \npercent of the on-budget surpluses to address critical priorities such \nas additional debt reduction, expanding educational opportunities, \nproviding a prescription drug benefit, keeping our environment safe, \nand ensuring a strong national defense.\n  In reviewing the President's Budget Blueprint, I am concerned that \nhis proposals shortchange important needs that Americans depend upon.\n  I find it remarkable, for example, that the President proposes to cut \nfunding to the Energy Department by almost one billion dollars--in the \nmidst of an energy crisis the likes of which our country hasn't seen in \nyears, if ever. I am particularly concerned that such a cut at the \nDepartment of Energy would be taken out of nuclear weapons facilities, \nparticularly the Hanford Reservation in Washington State. This move \nwould break the moral contract between the United States government and \nthe people of Washington State--the moral obligation to protect the \npeople from the hazards of nuclear waste. The Hanford clean-up is an \nongoing federal responsibility and a timely clean-up is essential to \nthe quality of our water and environment, as well as our public safety. \nTo fall behind in the clean-up because of ill-advised funding cuts is \nan unacceptable risk. This is why I joined with Senator Crapo to \nintroduce an amendment, adopted last night by voice vote, to ensure \nthat the Atomic Energy Defense Account is increased by $1 billion in \nfiscal year 2002 for just this purpose.\n  I am also concerned about the President's proposed budget for the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. Although the President does \nincrease funding for the DHHS by $2.8 billion, I see that he is \nincreasing the National Institutes of Health by just that amount. If \nNIH is getting a $2.8 billion increase in the upcoming fiscal year, \nwhile its parent agency is only getting that amount as an overall \nincrease, something else is going to be cut, or level funded. Are the \ncuts going to come from the Child Care Development Block Grant, funding \nto investigate child abuse and neglect, or services for our elderly?\n  The President proposes only $153 billion over 10 years to provide a \nlow-income prescription drug benefit and finance overall Medicare \nreform. This is completely inadequate considering that over one-third \nof our nation's elderly lack coverage for their prescription drug \nneeds, that the average senior spends more that $1,100 on medications \nevery year, and despite the fact that prescription drugs are today's \nfastest growing segment of health care.\n  On Wednesday, the Senate adopted an amendment to increase the \navailable funding for a new prescription drug benefit by up to $300 \nbillion over 10 years. However, I think it is important to point out \nthat this additional funding is coming from money already earmarked for \nthe Medicare program, and from the broad cuts proposed by the President \nin other areas.\n  While I have the floor I want to talk about two very specific cuts \nthat the President has proposed.\n  Since 1997, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has spent $107 \nmillion to help communities to prepare for and mitigate the potentially \ncalamitous consequences of natural disasters. This funding--Project \nImpact--helps communities plan and implement preventive measures in \norder to prevent large-scale destruction of property and human life. \nYet, when the President released his budget he proposed canceling \nProject Impact because ``it has not proven effective.''\n  Well, I can tell you that the very same morning the President \nreleased his budget, my State was hit with a 6.8 earthquake, and, \nthough there was extensive structural damage throughout\n\n[[Page S3686]]\n\nthe region, there were no deaths. And there is no doubt in anyone's \nmind, especially mine, that one of the main reasons this powerful quake \ndid relatively little damage was because of the millions of dollars my \nstate and our local communities have put into retrofitting buildings \nand preparing for such an event, dollars that were leveraged by Project \nImpact. For example, inspectors at Stevens elementary school in the \nSeattle school district following the earthquake revealed that a 300-\ngallon water tank directly above a classroom had broken free of its \ncables. The inspectors concluded that if it were not for a Project \nImpact retrofit project, the tank could have caused serious, \npotentially fatal injuries to children in the classroom, as well as \nsignificant property damage.\n  Mr. President, as I toured the communities in my state affected by \nthe earthquake and spoke with local officials, I heard other examples, \nlike this story of Stevens Elementary, that prove the effectiveness of \nthe Project Impact program. By cutting funds for this vital program, we \nwould be depriving cities throughout our country an opportunity to \nmitigate and possibly avert the potentially catastrophic consequences \nof natural disaster.\n  I am also concerned about the massive cuts proposed for the U.S. \nExport-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. \nThese two agencies are critical to maintaining U.S. competitiveness in \nthe international economy through assistance programs that effectively \nincrease U.S. exports and provides jobs to American workers. Although \nEx-Im represents a minuscule fraction of the Federal budget, it \nprovided $15 billion in export sales last year. The President's \nproposed 25 percent cut in Ex-Im bank would be a terrible mistake that \ncould eliminate up to $4 billion in U.S. export sales. And OPIC, which \nover the past thirty years has generated $63.6 billion in U.S. exports \nand nearly 250,000 American jobs, ultimately operates at no net cost to \nU.S. taxpayers. Indeed, it actually returns money to the U.S. treasury \nand provides valuable assistance to U.S. companies seeking to invest \nand expand their operations abroad.\n  The support and funding of Ex-Im Bank and OPIC is a highly efficient \nway to increase U.S. competitiveness, especially for smaller companies \nexporting to higher-risk markets. The proposed cuts could be \ndevastating to American companies and undermine our efforts to compete \nin the international economy. Mr. President, these programs should be \nde-politicized and their efforts to support U.S. exporters globally \nshould be backed solidly by this chamber.\n  I know there are some in the Senate who support the President's \nproposed $2.0 trillion tax cut as a means for stimulating the economy. \nBut this proposal would do little toward this end. Ninety-five percent \nof the tax cuts in the President's plan occur after 2003. By the time \nthe tax cut takes full effect, the economy will have changed \ndramatically. These back-loaded tax cuts would do little to boost \nfamilies' spending power immediately, and therefore do little to spur \nthe economy in the months ahead. And in fact, even the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan, has said tax initiatives \nhistorically have proved difficult to implement in a time frame in \nwhich recessions have developed and ended.\n  This tax cut doesn't even go proportionally to every American. Forty-\nthree percent of the benefits of the President's tax plan are targeted \nto the wealthiest one percent of families--those with an average annual \nincome over $915,000. Surprisingly, 25 percent of Washington's working \nfamilies and almost 400,000 of the children in Washington State would \nnot get any benefit from the Bush tax plan.\n  Unfortunately, while relying on surpluses that may or may not appear, \nand funding a tax cut that goes disproportionately to the wealthiest \nfamilies and is not interested in areas that will be stimulated in \nlong-term growth, the President's budget eliminates funding to \nmodernize aging schools, cuts maternal and child health programs, \neliminates grants to hospitals and community health centers that serve \nuninsured and under-insured people, and cuts job training and \nemployment services.\n  Responsible budgeting is a give-and-take. The country is at a \ncritical juncture in setting our fiscal priorities: our choices are \nmaintaining our fiscal discipline and investing in long-term growth, \nthe nation's future education, job training and health care needs, or \ncutting the very services used daily by our citizens. I believe our \nbudget must fund these critical priorities as well as allow for \nresponsible tax relief. Unfortunately, however, the budget before us \ntoday does not do this.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, over the last 8 years, we learned what a \ndifference a responsible budget can make. We learned it starts with the \nbasics, like using real numbers and not ``betting the farm'' on rosy \nprojections. We learned that if we invest in the American people and \ntheir needs, our country and our economy will benefit. We learned that \nwe need to be fiscally responsible. That means making tough choices and \nholding the line on deficit spending. And we learned that we have to \nwork together to get things done.\n  The last eight years have shown us that if we follow those lessons: \nusing real numbers, investing in our people, meeting our needs, being \nfiscally responsible, and working together, we CAN turn deficits into \nsurpluses, and we can transform the American economy into a job-\ncreating machine.\n  Today, there is a new President in office. There is a new Congress. \nAnd there are new economic challenges as our economy slows and an \nenergy crisis grows.\n  The times are different, but the lessons are the same. This isn't the \ntime to throw away the handbook we've used for the past eight years. \nIt's time to follow the lessons it offers. Unfortunately, the \nAdministration and the Republican leadership are running in the \nopposite direction. And I fear that they will repeat the same mistakes \nof the past, mistakes that we are just now getting over.\n  The Republican budget ignores the lessons of the past eight years. \nInstead of focusing on real numbers and realistic estimates, the \nRepublican budget puts all its faith in projected surpluses that may \nnever materialize. What's more, the Republican budget hides some of the \nmost important numbers, the cuts that many Americans will feel, in \norder to pay for a huge tax cut. Instead of investing in our people, \nthe Republican budget shortchanges America's needs. In a few minutes, \nI'll detail some of the budget's shortcomings in areas like education, \nhealth care and environment. Instead of being fiscally responsible, the \nRepublican budget asks us to commit to a $1.7 trillion tax cut, which \nis paid for out of the Medicare trust fund. There's nothing fiscally \nresponsible about taking money that pays for seniors' medical care and \ngiving it away to a handful of Americans. Finally, instead of working \ntogether, the Republican budget offers an example of partisanship at \nits worse. The Republican leadership has skipped the committee process \nentirely, something that is almost unheard of: to avoid having to work \nout these differences in a responsible, bipartisan way.\n  As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I find it completely \nunacceptable that we would rush to the floor a $1.9 trillion FY 2002 \nbudget with no Committee consideration. Worst of all, because this \npartisan maneuvering is coming at the beginning of the budget process, \nit could set the tone for a bitter session ahead. Our country learned a \nlot about responsible budgeting in the past eight years. Unfortunately \ntoday, the Republican leadership is ignoring those lessons so they can \nram through an irresponsible tax cut. I don't want the American people \nto pay the price for such irresponsible budgeting. That's why, together \nwith my Democratic colleagues, we are offering this alternative budget. \nThe Democratic alternative budget takes the lessons of the past few \nyears and applies them to the benefit of the American people.\n  Now I would like to turn to some of the specific issues addressed in \nthe budget, starting with a tax relief. I want to be clear that I \nstrongly support tax relief. In fact, we should be debating immediate, \nreal tax relief for all Americans that can stimulate the economy and \nhelp my constituents pay their growing utility bills. We should be \nacting on a $60 billion tax rebate that would be available this year, \nnot in three years or five years. This type\n\n[[Page S3687]]\n\nof immediate tax relief will give American families the added boost and \nconfidence they need to held off a real recession. Instead, this Senate \nis acting on a budget that calls for $1.7 trillion in tax cuts based on \na surplus that has yet to materialize. And we are acting before we even \nknow the true impact of the budget. We won't know that until the \nPresident releases his detailed budget on April 9. The leadership would \nrather have us vote now and learn the consequences later.\n  Now I would like to turn to a few issues that the Republican budget \nunderfunds, which the Democratic Alternative funds at the right level. \nLet's begin with prescription drugs. The lack of affordable drug \ncoverage is not just a problem for those with very low incomes. All \nseniors and the disabled face the escalating cost of prescription drugs \nand the lack of affordable coverage. One or two chronic conditions can \nwipe out a couple's life savings in a few short months. Originally a \nprescription drug benefit was estimated to cost $153 billion. But new, \nrecent estimates show that it will take about twice that amount to \nprovide a real benefit. We know that seniors need an affordable drug \nbenefit that's part of Medicare. The Republican budget does not set \naside enough money to provide this benefit. This Democratic amendment \ndoes. The Republican budget not only short changes the prescription \ndrug benefit: it also robs the Medicare Part A Trust Fund surplus to \npay for a scaled-back benefit.\n  It takes money from hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and home \nhealth agencies to provide a limited prescription drug benefit. The \nsurplus in the Part A Trust Fund should be used to strengthen Medicare \nand stabilize providers. I believe we can invest more of the surplus \ninto a prescription drug benefit that all Medicare beneficiaries can \naccess--instead of the limited benefit the Republicans offer.\n  There is another health care issue that the Republican budget \nshortchanges. Today, 44 million Americans don't have health insurance. \nWhen they need care, they go to the emergency room. ER's in this \ncountry are overwhelmed and on the verge of collapsing. It is getting \nharder for them to treat real emergencies. I know we can do better. We \ncan expand programs that help working families secure affordable \ncoverage. The Democratic alternative also reserves as much as $80 \nbillion to address the growing uninsured population. We need to expand \ncoverage for working families to provide a true health care safety net. \nCongress cannot ignore the uninsured any longer. In fact, as the \neconomy slows down the number of uninsured will only increase. We need \na real safety net for working families. The Democratic alternative \nprovides the resources to meet this challenge. The Republican budget \ndoes not.\n  We also need to provide health care to families with severely \ndisabled children. These families are often forced to impoverish \nthemselves to provide care for their children. Some families must make \nthe impossible choice between the welfare of their disabled child and \nthe economic stability of their family. That's a choice that no family \nshould be forced to make. The Democratic alternative invests in health \ncare for those who lack coverage.\n  Next I'd like to turn to an environmental issue. In the Pacific \nNorthwest, several species of salmon are threatened with extinction. \nThis isn't just a symbolic issue. The people of Washington state have a \nlegal, and a moral, responsibility to save these threatened species. \nThe Pacific Northwest needs approximately $400 million through various \nfederal agencies to meet the biological opinion on salmon recovery. As \nmy colleagues may know, the National Marine Fisheries Service recently \nfinalized a biological opinion. That opinion outlines the steps we need \nto take to save salmon and keep removal of the Snake River's four dams \noff the table and out of the courts. The Republican budget does not \nprovide the resources we need. The Democratic alternative does.\n  In Washington state, we also face the challenge of cleaning up the \nHanford Nuclear Reservation. Hanford Cleanup has always been a non-\npartisan issue, and I want to keep it that way. There were some press \nreports in February that the Bush budget would cut clean up funds. I \ntalked to the White House budget director, Mitch Daniels, and he \nassured me that there would actually be an increase in funding for \nHanford clean-up. However, the President's proposed cut of the nuclear \ncleanup program makes it difficult to meet the federal government's \nlegal obligations in this area. Any retreat from our clean-up \ncommitment would certainly result in legal action by the state of \nWashington. To avoid that and meet our legal obligations to clean up \nthe Hanford Nuclear Reservation, we need an increase of approximately \n$330 million. The price of America's victory in World War II and the \nCold War is buried in underground storage tanks and in facilities. And \nwe've got to clean them up.\n  Next I'd like to turn to the energy crisis. In Washington state, \nhigher energy prices have already cost us thousands of jobs. One report \nsuggests that Washington state could lose 43,000 jobs if we fail to \ntake any action to stem higher energy costs. The short term solution to \nthe energy crisis in the Pacific Northwest will not be found in the \nbudget resolution. However, the framework for a national energy policy \nshould be. The President is proposing dramatic budget cuts in renewable \nenergy research and development. This is taking us in the wrong \ndirection. As the Democratic alternative promotes, we should be \nreducing our reliance on fossil fuels by promoting renewable energy, \nconservation, and efficiency programs.\n  Finally, the Republican budget shortchanges America's students. \nEducation is a national priority, but this budget doesn't treat it like \none. This budget would abandon the commitment made by Congress to \neducation over the past three years to hire additional teachers \nthroughout the country to lower class size. Across the country, there \nare almost 2 million students learning in classrooms that are less \ncrowded than they were a few short years ago. This budget would also \nabandon the commitment we made last year to help crumbling schools with \nemergency repairs and renovations. The GAO estimated that our country \nneeds to invest more than $112 billion to get our schools in decent \nshape, and we were just beginning to help communities do that. This \nbudget would abandon the commitment we had made to students and \ncommunities to provide extra support for disabled students and \ndisadvantaged students. Broken promises to these students means we are \noffering false hope rather than real support. For years, there was \ndebate about what would improve education. Today, we know the answer: \nsmaller classes, individual attention, good teachers and high \nstandards. For years, there was no funding for these efforts. Today \nthere is. Under the Republican budget, we would abandon those \ninvestments. In the Democratic alternative, we meet the need in \nAmerica's classrooms.\n  Mr. President, as I have pointed out the Republican budget takes us \nin the wrong direction.\n  The Demoractic alternative we are offering today will provide tax \nrelief for the American people, and keep our commitment to national \npriorities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this Democratic alternative.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at the heart of the budget dispute \nbetween Republicans and Democrats is the size of President Bush's \nproposed tax cut. Republicans claim the surplus is so large that we can \nhave it all, that their massive tax cut will not interfere with efforts \nto address the country's most serious concerns. Democrats respond that \nthe Bush tax cut is so large that it will consume virtually all of the \navailable surplus, leaving no resources to meet the Nation's basic \nneeds. Under the Bush budget, the numbers just do not add up.\n  The vote on the budget resolution is the vote which will determine \nthe size of the tax cut. Once that vote is cast, more than $2 trillion, \nthe real price tag on the tax cut, will effectively be gone. Those \ndollars will no longer be available for any other purpose--not for \neducation, not for healthcare, not for defense, not for debt reduction, \nnot for Social Security, not for Medicare. That money will be gone.\n  The impact of the Republican tax cut on the Federal Government's \nability to address the most pressing concerns of the American people \nwould be devastating. It is too large to fit into any responsible \nbudget. The available surplus over the next ten years is, at\n\n[[Page S3688]]\n\nmost, $2.7 trillion. Whatever we do over the next decade to address \nthis country's unmet needs must be paid for from that amount. Whatever \nwe want to do to financially strengthen Social Security and Medicare \nfor future retirees must be funded from that amount. Whatever funds we \nwant to hold in reserve for unanticipated problems must also come from \nthat amount.\n  President Bush tells us his tax cut will only cost $1.6 trillion. But \nthe Administration's own budget documents acknowledge that the tax cut \nwill consume more than $2 trillion of the surplus. Independent analysts \nhave shown that the real cost of the tax cuts which the Republicans \nsupport will be close to $2.5 trillion over the next ten years, \nconsuming 90 percent of the available surplus. There will be less than \n$200 billion, just $20 billion a year, left to finance everything we \nhope to accomplish in the decade ahead. The Republican budget does not \nadd up.\n  What would this mean for working families? There will simply be no \nmoney left to address the problems that concern them most: An elderly \ngrandmother will not be able to afford the cost of the prescription \ndrugs she needs to avoid serious illness; Her young grandchildren will \ngo to overcrowded schools where the classroom may be in a trailer and \nwhere the teachers are too busy to give them the individual attention \nthey need; Their older brother and sister will have difficulty \naffording college because the grant and loan assistance available to \nthem will not have kept pace with the cost of tuition; Their parents \nwill not have access to the technology training needed to move up the \ncareer ladder at work, so they may be stuck in a dead end job; If the \nfamily in among the 44 million Americans who do not receive health \ncoverage at work and who cannot afford to purchase it, they will get no \nsignificant new help with their medical costs; And if they live in a \nhigh crime neighborhood, there will be fewer cops on the street to \nensure their safety.\n  But what about the tax cut? What will the Bush tax plan do for \nfamilies like this? Unfortunately, it will not do much. The Republican \ntax cut is heavily slanted toward the wealthy. Over 40 percent of the \nentire tax cut nearly one trillion dollars in tax breaks will go to the \nrichest 1 percent of taxpayers. They would get an average of $54,000 \neach year in tax benefits. This is more than most workers earn in a \nyear.\n  Under the Bush plan, 60 percent of working families will save $500 or \nless a year in taxes. Twelve million low income working families would \nnot get any tax cut under the Bush plan, even though they pay federal \ntaxes every year. The Republican tax cut is just not fair. It does the \nleast for people who need help the most, the same people who depend on \nthe programs which the Republicans want to cut.\n  The Democratic budget plan stands in stark contrast to the Republican \nplan. Budgets are a reflection of our real values, and these two \nbudgets clearly demonstrate how different the values of the two parties \nare. In political speeches, it is easy to be all things to all people. \nBut the budget we vote for shows who we really are and what we really \nstand for. Our budget is geared to the needs of working families. It \nwill provide them with tax relief, but it will also address their \neducation and health care needs. And it will protect Social Security \nand Medicare, on which they depend for secure retirement.\n  There are four criteria by which we should evaluate a budget plan: 1. \nis it a fiscally responsible, balanced program? 2. does it protect \nSocial Security and Medicare for future generations?, 3. does it \nadequately address America's urgent national needs?, and 4. does it \ndistribute the benefits of the surplus fairly amongst all Americans? By \neach yardstick, the Republican budget fails to measure up. The \nDemocratic budget is a far sounder blueprint for building America's \nfuture.\n  Once the Social Security and Medicare surpluses are reserved for the \npayment of future benefits, the available surplus is projected to be \n$2.7 trillion over the next ten years. The heart of the difference \nbetween the Democratic and Republican budgets is how each would use \nthis surplus. The Democratic proposal would divide the surplus into \nthirds; allocating $900 billion for tax cuts, $900 billion for priority \nprograms, and $900 billion for debt reduction. This contrasts sharply \nwith the Republican plan, in which tax cuts would consume 90 percent of \nthe surplus.\n\n  When President Bush cites $1.6 trillion as the cost of his tax cut, \nhe neglects the increased cost--more than $400 billion--of interest on \nthe larger national debt caused by the tax cut. He ignores the $240 \nbillion cost already added to elements of the Bush plan by House \nRepublicans. His plan also ignores the $200 billion cost of revising \nthe Alternative Minimum Tax to prevent an unintended increase in taxes \non middle income families, and the $100 billion cost of extending \nexisting tax credits through the decade. In reality, the Bush tax cut \nwill consume $2.5 trillion over the decade.\n  By consuming $2.5 trillion of the $2.7 trillion available surplus on \ntax cuts, the Republican budget would leave virtually nothing over the \nnext ten years:\n  to strengthen Social Security and Medicare before the baby boomers \nretire,\n  to begin the quality prescription drug benefit that seniors \ndesperately need,\n  to provide the education increases that the nation's children \ndeserve,\n  to train and protect the American workers whose increased \nproductivity has proved essential to our strong economy,\n  to advance scientific research,\n  to improve the nation's military readiness,\n  to improve the security of family farmers, and\n  to avoid burdening our children with the debt that we have \naccumulated.\n  After the Bush tax cut, we will not have the resources to meet these \nurgent challenges. There will simply be no money left.\n  The Democratic plan strikes a balance between tax cuts and addressing \nthese important national priorities. It provides $900 billion to \nfinance tax relief for the American people. This amount would allow a \ntax rate cut for all taxpayers, marriage penalty relief, and a doubling \nof the child tax credit. It would also enable us to implement several \nof the most widely supported targeted tax cuts such as making college \ntuition tax deductible and providing a tax credit for long-term care \ncosts.\n  I support a substantial tax cut, such as the one I just outlined, but \nnot one that is so large that it crowds out investment in national \npriorities like education, health care, worker training and scientific \nresearch. Not one that is so large that it jeopardizes Medicare and \nSocial Security. Not one that is so large that it threatens to return \nus to the era of large deficits.\n  By authorizing a third of the surplus for spending on the nation's \nmost important priorities, the Democratic plan would enable us to \nimprove education by reducing class size and enhancing teacher quality, \nto provide senior citizens with meaningful assistance with the cost of \nprescription drug coverage, to extend health care coverage to many \nuninsured families, and to expand worker training opportunities and \nscientific research that will strengthen our economy. These are \nimportant initiatives that have overwhelming public support. The \nDemocratic budget allows us to pursue these goals. Unfortunately, the \nRepublican budget does not.\n  By reserving one third of the surplus for debt reduction, the \nDemocratic plan provides a safety value should the full amount of the \nprojected surplus not materialize. We are not spending every last \ndollar of the $2.7 trillion, we propose to hold $900 billion in \nreserve. If the full surplus materializes, it will be used to pay down \nthe debt. If projections fall short, we will have a cushion.\n  The $2.7 trillion is only a projected surplus. The Congressional \nBudget Office itself recognizes that a small reduction in the growth \nrate of the economy would reduce its surplus estimates by trillions of \ndollars. Its projection for the next decade is based on a growth rate \nwhich the economy has only achieved in 5 of the last 35 years. \nForecasting a budget surplus ten years in advance is no more reliable \nthan forecasting the weather ten years in advance. Recent events should \nvividly remind us how difficult it is to predict the economy even one \nyear ahead. CBO acknowledges that there is a 35 percent chance that the \non-budget surplus will be less than half the size it has projected . . \n. less than half! Without a\n\n[[Page S3689]]\n\nlarge reserve, Social Security is vulnerable to a new raid if the \nprojected level of surplus fails to materialize.\n  In order to truly protect Social Security and Medicare, the budget we \nadopt must 1. reserve the entire Social Security surplus and the \nMedicare surplus to pay for future retirement and medical benefits; and \n2. devote a substantial portion of the available surplus to strengthen \nSocial Security and Medicare by reducing long-term debt. The Democratic \nbudget does both, and the Republican budget does neither.\n  The Social Security and Medicare surpluses are comprised of payroll \ntaxes that workers deposit with the Government to pay for their future \nSocial Security and Medicare benefits. Just because the Government does \nnot pay all those dollars out this year does not make us free to spend \nthem. Over the next ten years, Social Security will take in $2.5 \ntrillion more dollars than it will pay out and Medicare will take in \n$400 billion more dollars than it will pay out. But every penny of this \nwill be needed to provide Social Security and Medicare benefits when \nthe baby boomers retire.\n  The Republican budget fails to set the entire $2.9 trillion aside to \ncover the cost of future Social Security and Medicare benefits. It only \nprotects $2 trillion of that amount. The remaining $900 billion is used \nfor other purposes. This threatens the retirement benefits of current \nworkers. While the Bush budget is vague on just how this money will be \nused, it appears that more than $500 billion of it will be used to \nfinance the Administration's scheme to create private retirement \naccounts. I believe it would be terribly wrong to take money out of \nSocial Security to finance risky private accounts.\n  The Republican budget is even more reckless in its treatment of the \n$400 billion Medicare surplus. The Bush Administration would give the \nMedicare dollars no special protection. It would co-mingle them in a \ncontingency fund available to pay for their tax cuts and new spending.\n  The threat posed by the Republican budget to Social Security and \nMedicare is very real. It removes $900 billion that already belong to \nthese essential programs.\n  Democrats are committed to keeping Social Security and Medicare \nstrong. We do this by reserving all payroll taxes for the retirement \nand medical benefits that are now promised to seniors under current \nlaw. No qualifications, no exceptions. This commitment means that \nworkers' payroll taxes are not available to fund income tax and estate \ntax cuts, private retirement accounts, or new spending.\n  The contrast between the Democratic and Republican budgets on Social \nSecurity and Medicare could not be greater. The Democrats would use \n$900 billion of the available surplus to strengthen Social Security and \nMedicare by paying down the debt. Republicans would remove $900 billion \nfrom Social Security and Medicare, and they would spend these dollars \nfor other purposes.\n  Many of America's most critical unmet needs are in the areas of \nhealth care and education. The surplus affords us an unprecedented \nopportunity to address these national concerns. Unfortunately, the \nRepublican budget seriously short-changes them both.\n  One of our highest health care priorities should be assisting seniors \nwith the cost of prescription drugs. America's seniors desperately need \naccess to prescription drugs, and President Bush only provides a \nplacebo. He says the right things about how important it is to provide \nprescription drugs, but the numbers in the Republican budget prove that \nhis words can not pass the truth in advertising test.\n  There can be no question about the urgent need for a Medicare \nprescription drug benefit. A third of senior citizens, 12 million \npeople have no prescription drug coverage at all. Only half of all \nsenior citizens have prescription drug coverage throughout the year. \nMeanwhile, last year alone prescription drug costs increased an average \n17 percent.\n  The Republican budget provides only $153 billion over 10 years to \nfinance prescription drug assistance for seniors. That amount is \nwoefully inadequate. A real drug benefit available to all seniors would \ncost more than twice that amount. Yet even the $153 billion which the \nRepublican budget purports to provide is illusory. These are not new \ndollars. They come out of the $400 billion Medicare surplus which was \nimproperly removed from the Medicare Trust Fund.\n  Unlike Republican proposals, the Democratic plan would provide drug \ncoverage to all seniors through Medicare. The Democratic budget \nprovides $311 billion to make prescription drugs affordable for \nseniors. It is the only real way to solve the problem.\n  The Republican budget also fails to address the needs of the Nation's \nuninsured. An uninsured family is exposed to financial disaster in the \nevent of serious illness. The health consequences of being uninsured \nare even more devastating. In any given year, one-third of people \nwithout insurance go without needed medical care. The chilling bottom \nline is that 83,000 Americans die every year because they have no \ninsurance. Being uninsured is the seventh leading cause of death in \nAmerica. Our failure to provide health insurance for every citizen \nkills more people than kidney disease, liver disease, and AIDS \ncombined.\n  Candidate Bush severely criticized the Clinton-Gore Administration \nfor what he described as an inadequate response to this crisis. But the \nbudget resolution that his Republican colleagues have presented does \nnothing meaningful to expand health coverage. In this time of \nunprecedented budget surpluses, isn't it more important to assure that \nchildren and their parents can see a doctor when they fall ill than it \nis to provide new tax breaks for multi-millionaires?\n  The Democratic budget provides 80 billion new dollars over the decade \nto extend health care coverage to uninsured families. Over the last few \nyears, we have made great strides providing health coverage for \nchildren. However, there are many more children who still lack basic \nhealth coverage. These children, and their entire families, desperately \nneed access to health care. The most effective way to provide health \ncoverage is to insure the entire family. We are committed to taking \nthis next step.\n  Given how much President Bush has talked about education, it may come \nas a surprise to hear that education is one of the national priorities \nhe has seriously shortchanged. But, sadly that is what the facts of the \nRepublican budget show. The claim that President Bush increases funding \nfor the U.S. Department of Education by $4.6 billion or 11.5 percent \nthis year is the purest fantasy. Smoke and mirrors produced these \nnumbers.\n  President Bush counts $2.1 billion that President Clinton and the \n106th Congress approved last year as part of this year's increase. If \nPresident Bush did nothing on education, almost half of ``his \nincrease'' would happen anyway. The real increase that he proposes is \n$2.4 billion--only 5.7 percent above a freeze. And $600 million of the \n$2.4 billion increase is needed just to keep up with inflation. In \nreality, President Bush proposes only $1.8 billion in new money for \neducation next year, a mere 4 percent above inflation.\n  President Bush's education budget is a step backwards. It does not \nkeep up with the average 13 percent annual increase Congress has \nprovided for education over the last 5 years, and it will not enable \ncommunities and families across the country to meet their education \nneeds.\n  This year, schools confront record enrollments of 53 million \nelementary and secondary school students, and that number will continue \nto rise steadily, reaching an average six percent increase in student \nenrollment each year. President Bush's budget fails to keep pace with \npopulation growth in schools, and under the budget he proposes, Federal \neducation support per student may well decrease over the decade.\n  I applaud President Bush for making reauthorization of the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act a top priority. I applaud him for \nchallenging the nation to ``leave no child behind.'' But I am \ndisappointed that he has not backed his words with the resources needed \nto produce the action that we all agree is necessary. The Republican \nbudget will leave many children behind.\n\n  In sharp contrast, the Democratic budget would increase investment in \neducation by $150 billion over the decade. It is the second largest \nspending commitment in the Democratic plan.\n\n[[Page S3690]]\n\n  This will provide the resources which will enable us to keep pace \nwith the needs of the steadily expanding number of students in our \npublic schools. It will allow us to significantly reduce class size, so \nthat teachers can give individual students the attention they need. It \nwill provide for better professional development for teachers and \ngreater access to information technology in the classroom. It will make \nafter school programs available for children who currently have no \nwhere constructive to go. And, it will make college financially \nattainable for many of the students who simply cannot afford it today. \nIt would be extraordinarily shortsighted to turn our back on these \nnational responsibilities.\n  All these program cuts are made to finance the Republican tax cut, \nand the tax cut they would enact is grossly unfair. In reality, the \nwealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers, who pay 20 percent of all federal \ntaxes, would receive over 40 percent of the tax benefits under their \nplan. Their average annual tax cut would be more than $54,000, more \nthan a majority of American workers earn in a year.\n  The contrast is stark. Eighty percent of American families have \nannual incomes below $65,000. They would receive less than 30 percent \nof the tax benefits under Bush's plan. The average tax cut those \nfamilies would receive each year is less than $500. Twelve million low-\nincome families who work and pay taxes would get no tax cut at all \nunder Bush's plan. If we are going to return a share of the surplus to \nthe people, that certainly is not a fair way to do it.\n  Because the Bush tax cut is slanted so heavily to the wealthy, it is \npossible to enact a tax cut that costs less than half of President \nBush's proposal, yet actually provides more tax relief for working \nfamilies. That is what the Democratic tax cut would do.\n  The Democratic tax cut proposal incorporated in our budget would cost \n$900 billion. It would provide a tax cut for everyone who pays income \ntax. In addition, it would provide tax relief for the 12 million \nworking families that the Bush plan ignored. These low income families \npay substantial payroll taxes, and they too deserve relief. The \nDemocratic plan also provides help to couples currently hurt by the \nmarriage penalty. A tax cut of this size would also allow us to help \nfamilies by doubling in the child tax credit, making college tuition \ntax deductible, and providing a tax credit for long term care costs. \nSuch a program would provide greater tax relief for a substantial \nmajority of taxpayers than the far more expensive Bush plan. That is \nbecause the tax benefits are distributed fairly.\n  A close look at President Bush's budget only confirms that indeed we \ncan not have it all. There is no way to provide massive tax cuts, \neliminate the national debt, and meet the Nation's priority needs. This \nRepublican budget is a fantasy.\n  In essence, President Bush is asking working families to sacrifice \nwhile the wealthiest families in America collect far more than their \nfair share. This Republican budget threatens our prosperity and ignores \nthe most fundamental national needs. It does not have the support of \nthe American people, and it does not deserve their support.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the budget \nresolution currently pending before the Senate. In my view, this budget \nsquanders the extraordinary opportunities before us and moves the \ncountry in the wrong direction.\n  As we work to craft a budgetary plan to carry us through the first \ndecade of the 21st century, we would do well not to repeat the mistakes \nof the last century, mistakes which could send us back into the deficit \nditch from which we so recently emerged. In the early days of the \nReagan administration, Congress complied with the President's request \nfor a large tax cut. The Nation felt the negative effects of that tax \ncut for more than a decade, as Federal deficits grew and the national \ndebt exploded. These were not good economic times for the country.\n  I am proud to have been a part of the effort in 1993 that helped to \nturn things around. Working together, the President and Congressional \nDemocrats crafted a package that finally brought the Federal deficit \nunder control. By making difficult but critical decisions to cut \nFederal programs and raise revenues, we tamed the deficits that plagued \nthe Nation throughout the 1980s. Most Republicans argued at the time \nthat this responsible package would ruin the economy and send markets \ntumbling. They were dead wrong.\n  Thanks to the approach we adopted in 1993, the Nation enjoyed a \nremarkable period of economic prosperity. This disciplined fiscal \npolicy gave the Federal Reserve room to run an accommodating monetary \npolicy that allowed the economy to sustain the longest expansion in \nU.S. history. The economic expansion brought unemployment down to 4 \npercent, helped turn budget deficits into surpluses, and produced an \nexpansion in investment that led to rising levels of productivity, \nwhich in turn kept inflation at very low levels. It was a remarkable \nachievement.\n  Although the economy is now slowing somewhat, I do not believe we \nshould embark on a dramatic shift in our fiscal policy. Doing so would \nonly jeopardize the gains we have made thus far. Instead, we must \ncontinue to pursue a balanced approach that combines debt reduction, a \nshort-term tax cut benefitting working people, and spending on urgent \nnational needs.\n  The budget resolution before us takes exactly the opposite approach. \nIt is unbalanced, proposing to cut taxes by more than $1.6 trillion--or \nclose to $2.2 trillion when associated interest costs are included. I \nam deeply concerned that if we pass this resolution, we will be \nrepeating the mistake we made in 1981 and squandering the fiscal \nsecurity we have worked so hard to achieve.\n  Before I consider the substance of the budget resolution in detail, I \nwould like to take a moment to comment on the process. Our \nconsideration of this budget resolution is unusual even unprecedented--\nin two important ways. First, we have not had a mark-up in the Budget \nCommittee; instead, we are debating the budget for the first time here \non the Senate floor. Second, we are debating the budget resolution \nwithout the President's detailed budget submission.\n  I am proud to be a member of the Senate Budget Committee, the only \nCommittee in the Senate that is uniquely focused on the Federal budget. \nThis year, the Budget Committee has held a series of informative \nhearings on issues such as tax policy, debt management, Medicare \nreform, defense, and the impact of future demographic changes on our \neconomic outlook. However, the task before the Committee is not simply \nto hold hearings, but rather to use the perspective and knowledge \ngained from those hearings to develop a responsible Federal budget. \nChairman Domenici's unprecedented failure to hold a markup has \nprevented us from fulfilling the committee's primary duty.\n  Even more troubling is the fact that we have not yet received the \nPresident's detailed budget submission. We have only the vague \noutlines, and will not receive the specifics until next week. It defies \nlogic to vote on a budget resolution before we have seen the budget. It \nis impossible to debate the merits of the President's proposed spending \ncuts when we have not been told which programs will be cut. Nor can we \nhave an informed debate on the President's tax cut proposals, because \nthe Joint Tax Committee has not been given enough detail about those \nproposals to estimate their true cost. Nonetheless, the Republican \nleadership has chosen to move forward with their budget resolution.\n  Let me turn now to the substance of their proposals. First, I think \nit is important to understand that this budget resolution is based on \nvery uncertain long-term projections. The limitations inherent in \neconomic projections are clearly illustrated by recent experience: just \n6 years ago, in January 1995, the Congressional Budget Office projected \nthat we would finish the year 2000 with a $342 billion deficit. \nInstead, we saw a surplus of $236 billion--a swing of $578 billion.\n  In fact, most of the projected surplus over the next 10 years is \nexpected to occur in the outyears, when projections are the most \nuncertain: almost 65 percent of the unified surplus and almost 70 \npercent of the non-Social Security surplus are projected to occur in \n2007-2011, the last 5 years of the projection period. I believe it \nwould be unwise to commit these uncertain surpluses to large, permanent \ntax cuts, as the Republican budget does.\n\n[[Page S3691]]\n\n  Moreover, the tax cuts proposed by the Republicans disproportionately \nbenefit the wealthiest among us, and leave few resources for meeting \nimportant national priorities. I strongly believe that any surplus \nrealized in the near future should be seen as an opportunity to pay \ndown the Nation's debt, invest in our Nation's future, and shore up \nvital programs. I am deeply concerned that the budget resolution before \nus fails to take advantage of an unprecedented opportunity to ensure \nthat the Federal Government will meet its obligations after the baby \nboomers retire and beyond. This budget would endanger our hard-won \nprogress and shortchange national priorities that the American people \nwant to see addressed. The budget does not ensure that Social Security \nand Medicare funds will be safeguarded to pay current obligations, but \ninstead allows these funds to be diverted for other purposes. The \nbudget devotes insufficient funds for a Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit. Deep cuts would be required in a variety of crucial programs.\n\n  Let me highlight some of the ways in which this budget fails to meet \nAmerica's urgent priorities. We are facing a number of critical \ninfrastructure needs. For example, EPA estimates that some 218 million \nAmericans still live within 10 miles of a polluted body of water--a \nriver, lake, beach or estuary. Nearly 300,000 miles of rivers and \nstreams and approximately 5 million acres of lakes still do not meet \nstate water quality goals. National treasures like the Chesapeake Bay \nand Great Lakes still face significant water quality problems from \nmunicipal discharges of nutrients and other pollutants. Thousands of \ncommunities across the country have separate sanitary sewers or \ncombined sewers which experience overflows under certain conditions, \nsending raw sewage into nearby waters, posing significant public health \nand environmental risks. Published studies have estimated that \ncontaminated drinking water is responsible for nearly 7 million cases \nof waterborne diseases and approximately 1,200 deaths in the U.S. each \nyear.\n  In February, the Water Infrastructure Network (WIN), a coalition of \nlocal elected officials, drinking and wastewater service providers, \ncontractors, unions, and environmental groups, released a report which \nidentified a need for a $57 billion Federal investment to replace aging \nand failing drinking water, sewer, and stormwater infrastructure over \nthe next 5 years. The report found a gap of $23 billion per year \nbetween infrastructure needs and current spending. Similar assessments \nby EPA and others have also estimated water treatment and drinking \nwater needs in the hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  If we are to provide clean and safe water for everyone in America, we \nneed to invest in upgrading and maintaining our wastewater and drinking \nwater systems. The budget resolution fails to address these needs.\n  The budget resolution also fails to address what I consider one of \nAmerica's most vital priorities--ensuring that all Americans live in \ndecent, safe, and affordable housing. Even as the Nation has achieved \nrecord levels of homeownership, we are facing a shortfall of affordable \nrental housing that is reaching crisis proportions. According to HUD, \nnearly 5 million American families, despite years of economic growth, \njob growth, and income growth, continue to suffer from what are called \n``worst case'' housing needs. This means that they pay over half their \nincome in rent.\n  Take a minute to imagine that. If you were paying half your income in \nrent, what would you do if your child fell ill and you had an \nunexpected medical bill? What would you do if your car broke down and \nneeded to be repaired? What would you do if energy prices skyrocketed, \nforcing you to pay more to heat your home? You'd be forced into a \nhobson's choice that could result in your losing your job or your home.\n  A more expansive study by the Center for Housing Policy shows that \nmillions more American families, including 3 million working \nhouseholds, suffer from the same critical housing need. Yet, the budget \nresolution follows the proposals made by the President to cut the \nfederal housing budget by a total of $1.3 billion, or 5 percent below \nthe freeze level. When you take inflation into account, the cut is \nreally about 8 percent, or $2.2 billion. Specifically, the President \nproposed that 25 percent of the public housing capital fund be \neliminated. This proposal is made in the face of documented capital \nneeds in excess of $20 billion, a backlog that has been confirmed by \nindependent studies.\n  In 1998, we worked on a bipartisan basis to reform the public housing \nprogram. We passed a strong bill that greatly increased local \nflexibility, and asked housing authorities to be more creative in \nseeking out new sources of capital to meet their capital needs. Many \nhousing authorities have done just this, working with Wall Street to \nsell bonds backed by capital account appropriations. The success of \nthis whole endeavor is now put in doubt because of the proposed cuts.\n  The Republican budget also cuts CDBG by over $400 million, eliminates \nHUD's small, but important rural housing program, and unnecessarily \nconstrains state and local governments in their use of HOME funds. In \naddition, the budget inexplicably terminates the Public Housing Drug \nElimination Program (PHDEP), arguing that, somehow, evictions solve the \nproblem. PHDEP funds are used to provide tutoring to children; they \nhelp provide effective alternatives to keeping kids off the streets, \nout of gangs, and away from trouble. These funds pay for increased \nsecurity and increased police presence. They are an integral part of \nthe effort to keep drugs out of public housing. It is preventive \nmedicine, and it is an investment that pays back well in excess of its \ncost.\n  These are only a few of the many examples one could cite to show that \nthe budget resolution we are considering today does not invest in \nAmerica's future, but instead turns us back toward the past.\n  The Democrats have proposed a responsible budget alternative which \nbalances the need for debt reduction, targeted tax cuts, and investment \nin critical national needs. The Democratic alternative fully protects \nthe Social Security and Medicare surpluses to ensure that we will be \nable to meet our obligations to America's seniors, now and in the \nfuture. The alternative provides for a meaningful, affordable, and \nuniversal prescription drug benefit, and devotes real resources to \nmeeting pressing needs in education, defense, and our national \ninfrastructure. For example, the alternative restores the cuts proposed \nby the President for the Corps of Engineers civil works program. A \nsafe, reliable, and economically efficient water infrastructure system \nis vital to our Nation's economic well being and quality of life, and I \nam proud to say that the Democratic alternative recognizes the \nimportance of the Corps' civil works program.\n  The alternative recognizes the importance of funding our \ninternational affairs account, which includes both State Department \noperating expenses and foreign operations. At a time when the need for \nU.S. global leadership is greater than ever, I am pleased to say that \nthe Democratic alternative does not shrink from funding these \nresponsibilities.\n  In the area of housing, the Democratic alternative makes sure that \npublic housing authorities can continue to maintain and upgrade their \ndevelopments. In fact, not only does it maintain capital levels, but it \nadds $200 million per year to the operating subsidy, so that public \nhousing agencies, who house our poorest, most vulnerable citizens, can \npay their rising energy bills. In fact, the Democratic alternative \nrestores all the cuts in housing included in the President's blueprint, \nincluding restoring the PHDEP program, and all the activities it \nsupports. In addition, it adds another $2 billion over 10 years to get \nthe federal government back in the business of financing the \nconstruction of affordable housing through the HOME program, which is a \nproven, effective delivery system.\n  In addition, the Democratic alternative ensures funding for some less \nvisible, but no less vital programs. We would fund the Assistance to \nFirefighters Grant Program, run by the Federal Emergency Management \nAgency, at the full authorized level, ensuring that our nation's first \nresponders have the resources they need to safeguard America's citizens \nfrom the dangers of fire. The Democratic alternative supports liveable \ncommunities by funding mass transit programs, environmental protection \nefforts, and law\n\n[[Page S3692]]\n\nenforcement programs. These may not be high-profile issues, but they \naddress very real needs felt by many Americans--needs which are not \naddressed by the Republican budget before us.\n  We have come far economically and must be very careful as we move \nforward so as not to return to the deficits which hampered our economic \ngrowth for so long. In my view, we must emphasize paying down the \nnational debt, protecting Social Security and Medicare, increasing \nspending for programs important to our Nation's future, and providing \nshort-term tax cuts for working Americans. The Republican budget falls \nfar short of the mark in almost every respect. I strongly oppose this \nresolution, and I urge my colleagues to reject it.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today marks an historic occasion for the \nSenate. At the end of this fiscal year, not only will the federal \ngovernment have run a balanced budget without the use of the Social \nSecurity surplus for a third consecutive year, the first time that has \nhappened since 1947 to 1949--but the budget resolution we are now \nconsidering would reduce the publicly-held debt to its lowest level \nsince World War I.\n  No longer is business in Washington defined by the terms ``deficit'' \nand ``debt''. ``Fiscal responsibility'' has been reintroduced into the \npolitical lexicon and the result should prove a welcome relief not only \nto this generation but to those yet unborn generations that will be \nspared the mountain of debt we would otherwise bequeath in a legacy of \nlavish spending and fiscal recklessness.\n  In light of these on-budget surpluses we now enjoy and the era of \nsurpluses we are projected to see over the coming ten years, I would \nespecially like to thank the Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \nSenator Pete Domenici, for his unwavering commitment to balanced \nbudgets and responsible decision-making.\n  Thanks in large part to his leadership and his tireless efforts, the \nturbulent waves of annual deficits and mounting debt that have rocked \nthis place for decades have been calmed. And, if we are willing to \nadhere to the kind of sound principles expounded for years by my \ncolleague from New Mexico, in this year's budget resolution and others \nto come, we may be able to maintain the current budgetary calm for many \nyears into the future.\n  The budget resolution we are now considering not only maintains \nfiscal discipline, but it does so within a framework that ensures \nAmerica's priorities are protected and addressed in fiscal year 2002 \nand beyond. If the budget is a roadmap, this budget will point us \ntoward four critical goals:\n  First, it protects every penny of the Social Security and Medicare \nsurpluses in upcoming years.\n  Second, over the coming ten years, it pays down as much of the \npublicly-held debt as is considered possible, reducing it to its lowest \nlevel since 1916.\n  Third, it provides a substantial funding increase for discretionary \nspending programs, including education and defense, and, thanks to the \nadoption of the Grassley-Snowe amendment yesterday, it includes \nsignificant funding for a new prescription drug benefit.\n  And, fourth, from the non-Social Security surplus that remains, it \nprovides tax relief for Americans during a time of rising economic \nuncertainty, and a time when the typical family's tax burden exceeds \nthe cost of food, clothing, and shelter combined.\n  Collectively, I believe these principles and priorities reflect those \nof most Americans, especially the commitment to protecting Social \nSecurity and Medicare surpluses and buying-down publicly-held debt. \nAccordingly, I believe this resolution deserves broad bipartisan \nsupport in the Senate and, ultimately, by the entire Congress.\n  To truly appreciate how momentous the principles and policies \nreflected in this budget really are, one need only compare it to where \nwe have been, and where we currently stand, on both tax and spending \npolicies.\n  As many of my colleagues are all too aware, it was not that long ago \nthat the notion of buying-down federal debt would have been considered \nakin to a winter without snow in my home state of Maine, or maybe the \nBoston Red Sox winning the World Series. Except that, when it came to \nactually reducing the debt, it wasn't even a case of ``wait 'till next \nyear''. It was more like ``Waiting for Godot.''\n  Yet, unlike Godot, the days of paying down our debt are real and have \nactually arrived. Through a growing economy and fiscal austerity, the \nfederal government has not only paid down more federal debt over the \npast three years than at any time in history, $363 billion overall, but \nwe now stand poised to buy-down as much of the debt as is considered \nfinancially feasible within the next ten years.\n  While there are understandable differences of opinion on the precise \namount of federal debt that can be retired over this time frame, the \nsimple fact is that this budget resolution calls for the retirement of \n2.4 trillion dollars of debt over the coming ten years, leaving the \npublicly-held debt at just over $800 billion in the year 2011. Of note, \nthis level of publicly-held debt, which is the so-called \n``irreducible'' level of debt according to CBO, is even lower than the \n$1.2 trillion ``irreducible'' debt level that was identified by both \nthe current administration and the Clinton Administration in its \nJanuary 2001 report.\n  By the same token, the spending increases contained in this budget \nare not only significant--especially when compared to recent history--\nbut targeted toward specific and demonstrated needs.\n  As my colleagues are aware, it was not that long ago that \ndiscretionary spending rarely, if ever, saw an annual increase. In \nfact, discretionary spending was essentially frozen between 1991 and \n1996, with total outlays only $1 billion higher in 1996 than in 1991. \nFurthermore, from 1996 through the end of the decade, discretionary \nspending grew at an annual rate of 3.7 percent.\n  In contrast, this budget resolution provides for an increase in \ndiscretionary spending of four percent, a rate even higher than \ninflation. And although such an increase may not placate those who \nwould prefer that the discretionary spending jumps of the past two \nyears become the norm, the bottom line is that anyone who would have \nproposed a four percent increase during the past decade would have been \nconsidered a ``profligate spender''!\n  In addition to providing a substantial increase in discretionary \nspending, this budget also provides much-needed funding for a new \nMedicare prescription drug benefit.\n  As my colleagues are aware, the need for a new Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit could not be more clear. When Medicare was created in \n1965, it followed the private health insurance model of the time--in-\npatient health care. Today, thirty-six years later, the expiration date \non this prescription for health care--treating patients in hospitals \nrather than treating them at home, has long since come and gone. \nCorrespondingly, the lack of a prescription drug coverage benefit has \nbecome the biggest hole, a black hole really, in the Medicare system.\n  With tremendous leaps in drug therapies occurring almost daily, it is \ntime to bring Medicare ``back to the future''. It is time to provide \nour seniors with prescription drug coverage.\n  In my view, a solution to this pressing problem can't come soon \nenough. Drug coverage should be part and parcel of the Medicare system, \nnot a patchwork system where some get coverage and some don't. \nPrescription drug coverage shouldn't be a ``fringe benefit'' available \nonly to those wealthy enough or poor enough to obtain coverage. It \nshould be part and parcel of the Medicare system that will see today's \nseniors, and tomorrow's into the 21st Century.\n  Accordingly, I made the funding of a new prescription drug benefit my \nhighest priority over the past three years on the Budget Committee. And \nI'm gratified that those efforts--which led to $20 billion being set \naside for this purpose in the FY00 budget resolution, and $40 billion \nin the FY01 budget resolution, have helped pave the way for $153 \nbillion being set aside for prescription drugs in this year's budget \nresolution, and an additional $147 billion being added for this purpose \ndue to yesterday's adoption of the Grassley-Snowe amendment.\n  As the Chair of the Finance Subcommittee on Health, I will be doing \neverything I can to help craft and enact a strong, reliable Medicare \nprescription drug benefit this year, and in that light I'd especially \nlike to thank\n\n[[Page S3693]]\n\nthe Chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Grassley, for committing \nhimself and our Committee to developing such a benefit by the August \nrecess. And with the additional monies the Grassley-Snowe amendment \nprovided for this purpose, I am confident that we will not only meet \nthis goal, but also ensure that the benefit we create will be \nmeaningful and secure for years to come.\n  After we have set aside the Social Security and Medicare surpluses . \n. . after we have paid down as much debt as possible over the coming 10 \nyears . . . and after we have provided for substantial but responsible \nand necessary increases in discretionary spending and resources for a \nnew Medicare prescription drug benefit, only then, from the remaining \non-budget surpluses, do we provide for a tax cut.\n  And there should be no mistake, this is much-needed tax relief for \nthe American people. As outlined earlier, I believe that, given growing \neconomic uncertainty, a tax cut is not only warranted in terms of \nreturning some of the surplus to those who created it in the first \nplace, the American people, but also in terms of the well-being of our \neconomy. As for the need, the numbers speak for themselves.\n  Economic growth has slowed considerably over the past two quarters. \nConsumer confidence has fallen precipitously since November and only \nstabilized this past month. The NASDAQ dropped 26 percent during the \nlast quarter and is down 66 percent from its high of 13 months ago. The \nDow has dropped nine percent over the past two months alone, with the \nS 500 dropping 16 percent over the same period of time. And reports \nof layoffs are coming with increased frequency, even as more and more \n``dot-coms'' continue to close their doors and ``virtual reality'' has \nturned into harsh reality for countless investors.\n  While a tax cut may not actually prevent a recession if one is in the \noffing, it would--as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan stated \nbefore the Senate Finance Committee--act as ``insurance'' should our \nrecent downturn prove to be more than an inventory correction. Given \nthe warning signs in the economy, I believe that's an insurance plan \nthat Congress can't afford to forgo, lest we later be justifiably \naccused of ``fiddling while Rome burns.''\n  But it's not just the economy that could use a break, it's also the \nAmerican taxpayer, especially when you consider that a typical family \nnow pays more in taxes than for the cost of food, clothing, and shelter \ncombined. And, as a percent of GDP, federal taxes are at their highest \nlevel, 20.6 percent, since 1944, and all previous record levels \noccurred during time of war, 1944, 1952, and 1969, or during the \ndevastating recession of the early-1980s in which interest rates \nexceeded 20 percent and the highest marginal tax rate was 70 percent.\n  Given this confluence of circumstances, both economic uncertainty and \nan historically high level of federal taxes, I believe a portion of the \nremaining on-budget surplus should be utilized for a tax cut. And by \nproviding the blueprint for a tax cut of up to $1.6 trillion over the \ncoming 10 years, Congress will have the ability to make a determination \non both the appropriate size and content of such a package in the weeks \nahead.\n  At the same time, I understand the concerns that have been raised \nabout the certainty of long-term economic and budget projections. \nAccordingly, I found Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's recent \ntestimony before the Budget Committee very compelling, especially his \nsuggestion that we create some type of trigger mechanism linking tax \nand spending policies to actual budgetary performance in the future.\n  Specifically, Chairman Greenspan stated that long-term tax and \nspending initiatives should ``be phased-in'' and should include ``. . . \nprovisions that, in some way, would limit surplus-reducing actions if \nspecified targets for the budget surplus and federal debt were not \nsatisfied.''\n  Because the surplus is projected to grow successively larger over the \ncoming 10 years, with two-thirds of the $3.1 trillion surplus accruing \nin the final five years, any new tax cuts or spending proposals will be \nforced to be phased-in if we are to preserve the Social Security and \nMedicare surpluses. Indeed, key provisions of the recent Bush tax \nproposal, including the marginal rate reductions, are phased-in.\n  Accordingly, given Chairman Greenspan's suggestion, I believe it \nwould be prudent for the Congress to enact a trigger that links future \ntax cuts and spending increases to specific targets for debt reduction. \nSuch a proposal would ensure that all ``surplus reducing actions'', \nboth tax cuts and spending increases, are contingent on actual fiscal \nperformance.\n  Consistent with Chairman Greenspan's proposal, I worked with Senator \nBayh in developing a set of principles underlying a trigger mechanism, \nand joined in introducing these principles in a bipartisan, bicameral \nmanner last month. The three-point principles we developed, and that \nwere introduced with a total of 11 bipartisan cosponsors in the Senate, \nwere as follows:\n\n       First, long-term, surplus-reducing actions adopted during \n     the 107th Congress should include a ``trigger'' or ``safety\" \n     mechanism that links the phase-in of such proposals to actual \n     budgetary outcomes over the coming ten years;\n       Second, the trigger will outline specific legislative or \n     automatic actions that shall be taken if specific levels of \n     public debt reduction are not achieved;\n       Third, the trigger will only be applied prospectively and \n     not repeal or cancel any previously implemented portion of a \n     surplus-reducing action. In addition, enactment of the \n     trigger will not prevent Congress from passing other \n     legislation affecting the level of federal revenues or \n     spending should future circumstances dictate such action.\n\n  Ultimately, we believe the adoption of such a trigger mechanism will \nensure that fiscal discipline and debt reduction remain our top \npriorities as the projected surplus is designated for various purposes \nduring the months ahead. Ultimately, if the surpluses materialize as \nprojected, the trigger would have absolutely no impact on any tax or \nspending proposals enacted during the 107th Congress. But if they do \nnot, the trigger will provide an added level of fiscal discipline that \nwill prevent a return to annual budget deficits and increased federal \ndebt.\n  Given the fact that, only a few weeks ago, some argued that a trigger \nwas essentially ``dead,'' I would like to thank Chairman Domenici for \nagreeing to include these principles in the budget resolution that he \nplanned to offer on the floor. Unfortunately, due to a ruling by the \nParliamentarian, I understand that these and other provisions--\nincluding the Medicare Lock-box and the tax cut reconciliation \ninstructions--were subsequently removed.\n  While the removal of the trigger principles from the Senate budget \nresolution is a disappointment, I am pleased that momentum for this \nidea is clearly growing. Not only were these principles nearly part-\nand-parcel of this year's budget resolution, but Senator Bayh and I are \nnow in the process of converting these principles into an actual \nlegislative mechanism--and I know that other members are seeking to \ncraft their own mechanisms.\n  By protecting Social Security and Medicare surpluses, buying down \ndebt, providing substantial funds for a new Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit, enhancing funding for shared priorities such as education and \ndefense, and only then cutting taxes, I believe the Senate budget \nresolution deserves strong support.\n  Ultimately, while members from either side of the aisle may disagree \nwith specific provisions in this resolution, the amendment process we \nare now undertaking provides each of us with the opportunity to offer \nor support changes that better reflect our priorities. Furthermore, the \nsimple fact is that this is a budget framework, or ``blueprint'', that \nestablishes parameters and priorities, but is not the final word on \nthese individual decisions. Rather, specific spending and tax decisions \nwill initially be made in the Appropriations and Finance Committees, \nand ultimately by members on the floor.\n  Therefore, I am hopeful that amendments offered to this framework do \nnot harm the broad and reasoned parameters that have been set, and \ncommend the Chairman Domenici, again, for his efforts in crafting this \nbalanced resolution.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, earlier today I filed an amendment to \nthe Budget Resolution to increase funding for the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation by $39 million a year, adjusted for inflation. As a new \nmember of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and as a Senator \nrepresenting a rural state that has encountered FBI staffing shortfalls \nfor\n\n[[Page S3694]]\n\nmany years, I believe it is imperative that among our national budget \npriorities we include adequate funding to address the threat of \ninternational terrorism and the spread of urban crime to our rural \ntowns and counties.\n  In the past few years, Congress has increased the number and scope of \nfederal criminal laws, thereby increasing the responsibilities of the \nFBI, as well as other federal law enforcement agencies. Because of \nthese changes, and the assistance and technical expertise these \nagencies give to local law enforcement agencies throughout the country, \nfederal law enforcement resources have been stretched thin. In the \nFiscal Year 2001 Commerce-State-Justice Appropriations process, we \nrecognized the need to keep the FBI fully staffed, and we required the \nBureau to fully fund salaries and benefits for all authorized \n``workyears'' for special agents and support staff. In order to do \nthis, Director Freeh and his staff were required to reprogram $42 \nmillion from the agency's equipment and infrastructure accounts to \nsatisfy this need.\n  Given the expanded responsibilities of the Bureau, this type of \n``robbing Peter to pay Paul'' would be troubling enough. However, the \nbudgetary gymnastics required of the FBI to get through this fiscal \nyear is just a small example of a much more dangerous trend in our \nfunding of federal law enforcement agencies.\n  Unless we address this funding issue, by the end of the current \nfiscal year the FBI will have suffered the net loss of 521 special \nagents since the beginning of Fiscal Year 2000. In preparation of its \nbudget request for Fiscal Year 2002, Director Freeh determined that in \norder to maintain salary and benefit levels, the Bureau would need to \nreduce its staffing by 336 agents and 521 support staff. This force \nreduction will require the cancellation of almost all of the New Agent \ntraining classes for the remainder of this year, and may put in \njeopardy another 182 special agent positions and 248 support positions \nplanned for Fiscal Year 2002.\n  This situation is simply untenable for rural states like my home \nstate of West Virginia. After discussions with our U.S. Attorneys over \nthe past few years, I have come to share their frustration over \ndifficulties in carrying out law enforcement activities in West \nVirginia because of a shortage of resident agents in all of the federal \nagencies operating in the state. Having too few federal agents in West \nVirginia has affected numerous federal criminal investigations and \nprosecutions. Joint state-federal drug interdiction operations in West \nVirginia, although successful, require a level of participation by \nfederal law enforcement agencies that current staffing levels sometimes \nprevent.\n  Perhaps in the past, it made sense to concentrate our federal agents \nin big cities. Today, unfortunately, many of the crime problems of our \ncities have infected rural America. Sadly, West Virginia is not immune \nfrom this contagion. I believe the funding increase I have outlined \nhere is absolutely necessary to provide West Virginia and other rural \nstates with the federal law enforcement resources they will need to \ninvestigate, fight, and hopefully, prevent crime.\n  Mr. President, as the Ranking Member of the Committee on Veterans \nAffairs, I must voice my concern about the level of funding for \nveterans' health care and benefits proposed in the Senate Concurrent \nResolution on the FY 2002 Budget.\n  If the Department of Veterans Affairs is funded at the level that the \nBudget Resolution provides, a $1 billion increase over the FY 2001 \nappropriation, which might appear generous at first glance, we can \nexpect VA to eliminate staff, delay providing health care and benefits, \nand slash vital programs.\n  Much, if not all, of this proposed increase would be consumed in \nmerely overcoming inflation in the costs of providing medical care. It \nsimply will not meet VA's needs in the next fiscal year. As we strive \nto cut taxes in a responsible manner, we must also anticipate and \naddress the concerns of the men and women who served this Nation.\n  The alliance of veterans service organizations that authors the \nIndependent Budget for Fiscal Year 2002, AMVETS, the Disabled American \nVeterans, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, rightly concluded that ``more must be done to meet the \nincreasing needs of an aging veteran population, adapt to the rising \ncost of health care, enhance and facilitate benefits delivery, and \nmaintain the continuity of funding for VA programs as a whole.''\n  The Budget Resolution before us would not allow us to fulfill those \nobligations. We must ensure VA a level of funding that will minimize \nthe impact of inflation, fund existing initiatives, and allow the \nsystem to move forward in the ways we all expect.\n  Urgent demands on the VA health care system make increased funding \nessential. The landmark Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits \nAct of 1999 significantly expanded VA noninstitutional long-term care, \nwhich for the first time is available to all veterans enrolled with the \nVA health care system. As we contend with the dilemma of developing \nlong-term care for all Americans, VA will begin this effort with our \nNation's veterans. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the \nVA noninstitutional extended care program will cost more than $400 \nmillion a year. We must supply adequate funds to fulfill this \nlegislative mandate.\n  The Millennium Act also ensures emergency care coverage for veterans \nwith no other health insurance options. Necessity demands this costly \nprovision: nearly 1 million veterans enrolled with the VA are uninsured \nand in poorer health than the general population. Although this new \nbenefit has not yet been either implemented or publicized, claims are \nalready mounting.\n  Medical inflation and wage increases, factors beyond VA's control, \nhave been estimated to devour nearly $1 billion of VA's budget \nannually. At the same time, more and more veterans are turning to the \nVA for health care. In my own state of West Virginia, the number of \nveterans seeking care from VA has increased, despite a declining total \nnumber of veterans statewide. As an example, the Martinsburg VAMC saw \nits new enrollees increase by 24.7 percent over the last 2 years. \nRapidly expanding enrollment at all four West Virginia VA medical \ncenters has jeopardized their ability to provide high quality care in a \ntimely fashion. Unfortunately, similar examples can be found throughout \nthe Nation.\n  Between new initiatives, long-term care and emergency care coverage, \nand simply maintaining current services, we must secure an increase of \n$1.8 billion for health care alone.\n  Unfortunately, maintaining current services may not be enough to \nensure that VA can meet veterans' health care needs. The aging veterans \npopulation faces chronic illnesses and newly recognized challenges, \nsuch as the disproportionate burden of hepatitis C, that will further \nstrain VA facilities. We must anticipate the difficulties of treating \ncomplex diseases and ensure that we do not neglect the needs of \nveterans with multiple, coincident medical problems.\n  If we simply maintain current services, can we expect VA to restore \nthe capacity for PTSD and spinal cord injury treatment to the 1996 \nlegislatively mandated level? In West Virginia, many veterans not only \nwait months for specialty care, they have to travel hundreds of miles \nto get it. We can depend on community outpatient clinics to increase \nveterans' access to primary health care, but we must also ensure that \nthe many veterans who require more intensive, specialized services can \nturn to adequately funded inpatient programs.\n  VA research not only contributes to our national battle against \ndisease, but enhances the quality of care for veterans by attracting \nthe best and brightest physicians. The Budget Resolution allows, at \nbest, for a stagnant research budget. Not only will this slow the \nsearch for new and better medical treatments, but it could weaken \nefforts to protect human subjects in VA-sponsored studies. As increase \nof $47.1 million will be required merely to offset the costs of \ninflation and to monitor compliance with increasingly stringent \nresearch guidelines.\n  Savings may be gained through more resourceful management of VA \nhospitals and clinics, a possibility that VA is pursuing through its \nCapital Asset Realignment and Enhancement Studies, CARES. In the \nmeantime, efficiencies should not come at the expense of veterans who \nturn to the VA\n\n[[Page S3695]]\n\nhealth care system for needed treatment, nor should VA neglect \nessential repairs and maintenance of its infrastructure while awaiting \nthe outcome of the CARES process. Accommodating the backlog of urgently \nneeded construction projects will require an increase of $280 million. \nA shortsighted focus on immediate gains, by delaying essential projects \nor neglecting existing facilities, may compromise patient safety and \nprove even more costly to VA and veterans in the long run.\n\n  The Veterans Benefits Administration also faces challenges that \nrequire additional funding for staffing. One of these challenges \nresults from an aging workforce. Projections suggest that 25 percent of \ncurrent VBA decisionmakers will retire by 2004. These losses would be \nin addition to the staff that has already left service. It takes 2-3 \nyears to fully train a new decisionmaker. Therefore, it is critical \nthat VBA hire new employees now to fully train them before the \nexperienced trainers and mentors have retired.\n  In addition to this looming succession crisis, extensive new \nlegislation enacted in 2000 will severely affect VBA's workload. \nSweeping enhancements to the Montgomery GI Bill are expected to double \nVA's education claims work. New legislation reestablishing the ``duty \nto assist'' veterans in developing their claims, regulations \npresumptively connecting diabetes to Agent Orange exposure in Vietnam \nveterans, and new software systems intended to improve the quality of \ndecisionmaking have severely affected VBA's workload and slowed output. \nWest Virginia veterans are already receiving letters from the VA \nregional office warning them to expect a 9-12 month delay for even \ninitial consideration of their new claims.\n  If VBA is unable to hire new staff, the increasing backlog of claims, \nwhich is already unacceptable, would reach abominable levels. Without \nan increase in staffing, the backlog of claims is expected to grow from \nthe current 400,000 claims, up from 309,000 in September 2000, to \n600,000 by March 2002. VBA will need a minimum increase of $132 million \nto acquire the tools, staffing and technology, to avert this escalating \ndisaster.\n  The mission of the National Cemetery Administration, NCA, providing \nan honorable resting place for our Nation's veterans, is becoming more \ndifficult as we face the solemn task of memorializing an increasing \nnumber of World War II and Korean War veterans. It is estimated that \n574,000 veterans died last year. The aging of the veterans population \nis placing additional demands on NCA in interments, maintenance, and \nother operations. VA has attempted to meet this demand by opening four \ncemeteries over the last 2 years and planning construction of the six \nnew cemeteries authorized by Congress in 1999. It is estimated that an \nincrease of $21 million will be required to develop these cemeteries.\n  Increases are also required to maintain the VA's National Shrine \nCommitment. We must preserve our national cemeteries so that they do \nnot dishonor those who died serving their country. Sunken graves, \ndamaged headstones, and even structural deficiencies cannot be \ntolerated. We applaud VA's commitment to this initiative and encourage \nVA to continue the project. In order to rise to this task and operate \nits current facilities, NCA will require an increase of at least $13 \nmillion for a total appropriation of $123 million.\n  While we consider the best way to cut taxes responsibly, we mustn't \nlose sight of our obligations. We all need to agree on how much should \ngo to tax cuts and how much should be saved to strengthen Medicare, \ninvest in education, and fully address the needs of the men and women \nwho have served our country. I anticipate that during the debate on the \nbudget resolution, the Senate will be asked to increase the funding for \nVA. I urge you all to remember our nation's promise to our veterans and \ntheir families as we deliberate on the critical priorities that will \nshape their future.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am very pleased that by adopting the \nbudget resolution today, the United States Senate has endorsed the \nPresident's recent proposal that would provide mandatory funding for \nthe now-bankrupt Radiation Exposure Compensation trust fund.\n  We passed the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act in 1990 to provide \nfair and swift compensation for those uranium miners, Federal workers, \nand downwinders who had contracted certain debilitating and too often \ndeadly radiation-related illnesses. These individuals helped build our \nnation's nuclear arsenal and it is unconscionable that there is no \nfunding to indemnify them for their sacrifice and suffering.\n  Since last May, those who have had their claims approved are \nreceiving only an IOU from the Justice Department. Today we have taken \nthe first step in rectifying this injustice.\n  The Bush proposal is within the defense function of the budget and \nwould be a declining expenditure from about $100 million in 2002 to \nless than $5 million at the end of the decade. Total mandatory \nexpenditures budgeted for this program is assumed to be $710 million \nover the next 10 years. In addition, to our positive actions today, I \nhave introduced, along with Senator Hatch, legislation that would \nprovide the appropriate funding for the Radiation Exposure Compensation \ntrust fund. We are seeking our colleagues support in moving this \nlegislation expeditiously through the Senate.\n  It is vital that we act quickly to ensure that these victims who gave \nso much for our nation are never again left holding nothing more than a \ngovernment IOU.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to express my sincere gratitude \nthat the Senate agreed to and accepted my amendment late last evening \nwhich is of vital importance to our Nation's veterans.\n  This amendment will address a resource requirement for a bill that I \nintroduced on January 24, 2001, S. 170, the Retired Pay Restoration Act \nof 2001, which incidently has over 45 cosponsors and bipartisan \nsupport.\n  The list of cosponsors on S. 170 include the distinguished majority \nand minority leaders, the chairman and ranking member of the Armed \nServices Committee. I also would like to recognize Senator Hutchinson \nfor his assistance on this legislation.\n  This amendment will provide funding to correct a 110-year-old \ninjustice against more than 450 thousand of our nation's veterans.\n  We have repeatedly forced the bravest men and women in our Nation--\nretired, career veterans--to essentially forgo receipt of a portion of \ntheir retirement pay if they happen to also receive disability pay for \nan injury that occurred in the line of duty.\n  This requirement discriminates unfairly against disabled career \nsoldiers by fundamentally requiring them to pay their own disability \ncompensation.\n  S. 170 will permit retired members of the Armed Forces who have a \nservice connected disability to receive military retirement pay while \nalso receiving veterans' disability compensation.\n  We are currently losing over one thousand WWII veterans each day. \nEvery day we delay acting on this legislation means that we have denied \nfundamental fairness to thousands of men and women. They will never \nhave the ability to enjoy their two well-deserved entitlements.\n  This amendment will ensure that we have the resources necessary to \nproperly fund this legislation and honor those who served our Nation--\nour veterans.\n  Recently, President Bush stated that he would support senior \nveterans.\n  I urge President Bush to do just that and not to leave our veterans \nbehind. Our veterans have earned both of these entitlements--now is our \nchance to honor their service to our Nation.\n  We need to be fiscally responsible and protect social security, \nprovide a prescription drug benefit, fund education, ensure a strong \nand stable military, continue to pay down the debt, and to ensure the \nfunding is available for our Nation's veterans.\n  The current prosperity of this nation can partially be attributed to \nthe success of past wars and our Nation's veterans. I am unwilling to \njeopardize the domestic dividends that will materialize over the next \ngeneration for the health and welfare of our veterans and their \nfamilies.\n  We have made a commitment to these great Americans. We must ensure \nthat our Nation's veterans receive the dividends of our current \nsurplus.\n  Accepting the amendment I offered last evening is simply righting the\n\n[[Page S3696]]\n\nwrong. Our veterans waited silently when there was no money to pay for \nthis legislation, but today there is a budget surplus which provides \nthe perfect opportunity to honor their service to this great Nation.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we can go to final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, we are finished. We are ready to vote on \nfinal passage. I do not believe after all these long hours that anyone \nwants to hear a speech from anyone, regardless of how eloquent the \nspeaker.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I really would like to hear Senator \nDomenici for a while.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He is just one of the few, Mr. President. In any event, \nwe have nothing further. The next vote is final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are the yeas and nays requested?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate has just completed a \nlong week debating a budget that I believe will help the American \npeople in many ways, and I am proud of that work. But there are \nthousands of people in southern Oregon who are today getting some very \nbad news: the water on which the future of their farms and families \ndepend will not be delivered this year.\n  As I speak, my state is currently experiencing its worst drought in \nseventy-seven years. And while the lack of irrigation water is not \ncompletely the fault of the federal government, the situation has been \nexacerbated by the actions of federal agencies, primarily the Fish and \nWildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service, that have \nauthority over the quantity of water provided to the farmers and \nranchers of the Klamath Basin. In the midst of this natural disaster, \nthese two agencies have issued new requirements that increase lake \nlevels in the Upper Klamath Lake as well as streamflows down the \nKlamath River. These edicts were issued in spite of admissions by \nBureau of Reclamation officials that the proposed water levels are not \nattainable this year, even if there are no agricultural deliveries.\n  For eight years, the Clinton Administration waged war on hard-working \npeople who depend on natural resources to sustain their families and \ntheir communities. Sharp reductions in timber sales and the growth of \nonerous regulations has already weakened the economy of the Klamath \nBasin. Now, without irrigation water the economy stands to lose almost \n$144 million. This cannot be allowed to happen.\n  When President Bush was elected, the people of Southern Oregon \nbreathed a collective sigh of relief, believing that help was on the \nway. And although this decision was set in motion by the prior \nadministration, my constituents cannot help but wonder if better days \nare yet to come. Unfortunately, one thing they do know for sure is that \nworse times are coming this year. I do not doubt the President's \ndedication to farmers, ranchers, and others in the wide rural expanses \nthroughout this land. But I do understand that many of the people in \nthe Klamath Basin cannot help but question this administration's \ncommitment to their needs.\n  While I appreciate the intermediate assistance the administration has \noffered, I have to again ask the President to reexamine the draconian \norders that have turned a difficult drought into a crisis of immense \nproportions. In the meantime, I promise the people of the Klamath Basin \nthat I will continue to fight for their needs and for the needs of \ntheir families until this dire mistake is rectified.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3696-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3696-S3697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SUPPORT FOR THE HOPE FOR CHILDREN ACT\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, adoption is a rewarding, but often \nexpensive and frustrating option for many South Dakota families. As a \nmember of the bipartisan ``adoption caucus'' in the Senate I have tried \nto make adoption a more viable option for loving parents. During the \npast couple of years, we have made major improvements in adoption \npolicy including legislation: giving parents of adopted children the \nsame time-off rights as those who give birth; outlawing racial or \nethnic discrimination in adoption; automatically giving foreign-born \nadoptees American citizenship; and implementing international \nagreements to outlaw trafficking in children and promoting \ninternational adoption.\n  These laws have resulted in an increase of adoptions nationwide by \ncutting much of the paperwork and bureaucracy of the adoption process. \nYet there are still almost half a million kids in foster care \nnationwide, and a large number of those are minorities and kids with \nspecial needs. There are even more families who want to adopt, but \nsimply can't afford to. More needs to be done. For too many South \nDakotans, adoption is not an option because of the high costs \nassociated with it. By some estimates, an adoption can cost upwards of \n$25,000 in fees, paperwork, and legal assistance.\n  I am pleased to be an original co-sponsor of bipartisan legislation \ncalled the Hope for Children Act. This bill will help South Dakotans \nchoose adoption by increasing the current tax credits for non-special \nneeds children and special needs children to $10,000. This\n\n[[Page S3697]]\n\nbill will also make the tax credit permanent, adjust the credit for \ninflation, and increase the income cap for families to be eligible for \nthe tax credit.\n  I have talked with a number of South Dakotans who have adopted \nchildren with special needs, and I discovered that changes needed to \nalso be made to the types of adoption expenses that can be credited. \nFor example, families adopting a special needs child may have to buy a \nwheelchair or special van for the adopted child with a physical \ndisability. Counseling may also be needed for the family to cope with \nthe extraordinary challenges of a child with special needs. Instead of \nbeing limited to the adoption expenses that the Internal Revenue \nService decides are allowable, these families would be entitled to the \nfull credit and exclusion under the Hope for Children Act.\n  South Dakota families will receive tax relief by the end of this \nyear. The amount that each family gets will be the result of a \nspirited, yet constructive debate that will take place here in \nCongress. Throughout this discussion, I will continue to emphasize the \nneed to make changes in our tax code that encourage new and growing \nSouth Dakota families through adoption.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3697-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3697]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       SINKING OF THE F/V ``ARCTIC ROSE'' OFF THE COAST OF ALASKA\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to make note \nof the 15 people who have lost their lives in the waters off the coast \nof Alaska. On Tuesday, April 2 the U.S. Coast Guard received a distress \nsignal from the vessel Arctic Rose. The Arctic Rose sank with all hands \non board in the Bering sea, some 200 miles northwest of St. Paul \nIsland. I would like to join my colleagues from the home states of \nthese people to recognize those whose lives were lost in this tragic \nevent, and would ask that their names be entered into the record.\n  Aaron Brocker, Jimmy Conrad, Robert Foreman, Edward Haynes, G.W. \nKandris, Kenneth Kivlin, Jeff Meinche, and Mike Olney, all from \nWashington. Kerry Egan from Minnesota. Angel Mendez from Texas. Michael \nNeureiter from California. Dave Rundall from Hawaii. Shawn Bouchard and \nJames Mills from Montana. I am sure I join with all members of Congress \nand express our sincerest condolences to the families of these men.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep \ncondolences to the family and friends of the 15 men who were aboard the \nArctic Rose, which was lost at sea on April 2, 2001. On March 31, 2001, \nthe trawl vessel left St. Paul Island, AK to fish for flathead sole in \nthe Bering Sea. The boat was supposed to be at sea for about two weeks.\n  Sometime during the early morning of April 2, however, something \nhappened that caused the Arctic Rose to go down. We still don't know \nwhy the fishing vessel sank, but we know that 15 men lost their lives \nin pursuit of their livelihoods. Nine of these men were from Washington \nstate, and all of them leave behind families, friends and coworkers. My \nthoughts are with the crewmen's loved ones, who are only beginning to \ncope with this tragedy. I also extend my condolences to the owner of \nthe vessel, Mr. David Olney, to the employees of Arctic Sole Seafood, \nInc., and to everyone who is part of this important industry.\n  Most people are aware that fishing in the seas off Alaska is a \ndangerous occupation, but it still is a major shock when lives are lost \nat sea. We must continue our efforts to improve the safety of crews \nfishing in the Bering Sea and the Gulf of Alaska. One of the ways to \nimprove safety is to allow the creation of individual fishing quotas, \nwhich guarantee catch to fishermen. This allows fishermen to wait for \nbetter weather before going out to sea. I have consistently supported \nusing quotas as one tool to manage fisheries.\n  Many of the Alaskan fishing seasons take place during the fall, \nwinter and spring, when the weather is often severe. This business is \ninherently dangerous. The Arctic Rose had survival suits on board, but \nit seems the ship went down too quickly for most crewmen to even put \nthem on. Nor were they able to get to the life raft. We should continue \nour efforts to improve the safety of commercial fishing in Alaska, and \nthroughout the country, but I doubt we will ever be able to completely \neliminate the hazards.\n  The loss of the Arctic Rose reminds us of the risks commercial \nfishermen take every day to provide seafood enjoyed by so many people \nthroughout the Northwest and world. Let's not take their work for \ngranted. While we mourn the loss of the Arctic Rose, we should also \nthank the men and women who face these dangers every day to bring food \nto families across our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3697-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3697-S3698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IMPROVED UNITED STATES-INDIA RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to welcome to our \nnation's capital the Honorable Jaswant Singh, Minister of External \nAffairs and Defense for the Republic of India. Minister Singh's visit \nwill be an opportunity to reaffirm the warm relations between our \ncountries as a new Administration gets established in Washington. The \nMinister's visit to Washington will include meetings with the Secretary \nof State and the Secretary of Defense, as well as the National Security \nAdvisor.\n  Minister Singh's visit comes at a time of major transition in U.S.-\nIndia relations. Last month, Washington welcomed the arrival of the new \nIndian Ambassador to Washington, Mr. Lalit Mansingh. Ambassador \nMansingh succeeds Ambassador Naresh Chandra, who was well known and \nadmired by many in Congress during his tenure. Ambassador Mansingh \npresented his credentials to Secretary of State Powell on March 23, and \nthe two discussed a wide range of issues concerning the future of U.S.-\nIndia relations. Secretary Powell reiterated President Bush's intention \nto ``build on the good work done in the past.''\n  I hope that the message from the new Administration to Mr. Singh will \nbe one of support for building on the progress in U.S.-India relations \nthat we have seen for much of the past decade. After years of being \ntreated as a relatively low priority, the U.S.-India relationship has, \nsince the early 1990s, steadily moved to a higher priority on the \nAmerican foreign policy agenda.\n  President Clinton's Administration recognized the importance of \nIndia, as a trading partner, as a force for stability in Asia, and as a \nleader for democracy and prosperity in the developing world. The \nClinton Administration also recognized the wonderful resource that the \nIndian-American community, over a million strong, represents in \nbuilding closer ties between the world's two largest democracies.\n  I hope that the Bush Administration will continue this progress. The \nearly signs are that the Administration recognizes the significance of \nIndia to the United States. In announcing the nomination of Robert D. \nBlackwill as his choice to be the next Ambassador to India, President \nBush spoke of ``the important place India holds in my foreign policy \nagenda.''\n  I look forward to reviewing Mr. Blackwill's nomination in my role as \na member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. If Mr. Blackwill is \nconfirmed, he would succeed U.S. Ambassador Richard Celeste, the former \nGovernor of Ohio. Ambassador Celeste, who presented his credentials in \nNovember 1997, has served during an eventful time in U.S.-India \nrelations. In the past two months, as India recovers from the \ndevastating earthquake that struck the state of Gujarat on January 26, \nAmbassador Celeste has done an excellent job of helping to coordinate \nthe American aid effort. As he prepares to leave New Delhi, I want to \ncongratulate Ambassador Celeste for a job well done.\n  In the past year, with President Clinton visiting India in March and \nPrime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee visiting the United States in \nSeptember, the level of friendship and partnership between India and \nthe United States is perhaps the highest it has ever been. During last \nyear's summits between President Clinton and Prime Minister Vajpayee, \nthe United States and India signed a series of agreements to accelerate \nbilateral cooperation in a wide range of areas. The U.S.-India Vision \nStatement of March 2000, signed in New Delhi, pledged cooperation on \ncounter-terrorism. The two countries also pledged to cooperate on \nissues of nuclear non-proliferation. That agreement also established \nthe U.S.-India\n\n[[Page S3698]]\n\nFinancial and Economic Forum, the U.S.-India Commercial Dialogue, and \nthe U.S.-India Working Group on Trade. Minister Singh and then \nSecretary of State Madeleine Albright signed a joint statement on \ncooperation in energy and environment in a ceremony at the Taj Mahal in \nMarch 2000.\n  This week, President Clinton has returned to India to visit the State \nof Gujarat, scene of January's devastating earthquake that left an \nestimated 18,000 people dead, and thousands of people homeless.\n  While the trend in relations between the United States and India has \nbeen positive, there is still a great deal of work to be done. The \nvisit to Washington by External Affairs and Defense Minister Singh, \njust a few months into the new Administration, offers an opportunity to \nbuild in the work of the past few years, while charting a new course \nfor even closer ties between our two countries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3698-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ADDRESSING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IN SOUTH DAKOTA AND AROUND THE COUNTRY\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, domestic violence is often the crime that \nvictims don't want to admit and communities don't want to discuss. \nHowever, almost 15,000 domestic violence victims in South Dakota last \nyear secured help from the Department of Social Services. This \nrepresents a low estimate of the number of South Dakotans who are \nvictims of domestic violence, as many victims fail to seek help.\n  Since enactment of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994, the number \nof forcible rapes of women have declined, and the number of sexual \nassaults nationwide have gone down as well. Despite the success of the \nViolence Against Women Act, domestic abuse and violence against women \ncontinue to plague our communities. Consider the fact that a woman is \nraped every 5 minutes in this country, and that nearly one in every \nthree adult women experiences at least one physical assault by a \npartner during adulthood. In fact, more women are injured by domestic \nviolence each year than by automobile accidents and cancer deaths \ncombined. These facts illustrate that there is a need in Congress to \nhelp States and communities address this problem that impacts all of \nour communities.\n  Last year, I was pleased to join the successful effort to reauthorize \nthe 1994 Violence Against Women Act. In addition to reauthorizing the \nprovisions of the original Violence Against Women Act, the legislation \nimproves our overall efforts to reduce violence against women by \nstrengthening law enforcement's role in reducing violence against \nwomen. The legislation also expands legal services and assistance to \nvictims of violence, while also addressing the effects of domestic \nviolence on children. Finally, programs are funded to strengthen \neducation and training to combat violence against women.\n  This year, I am cosponsoring legislation, S. 540, that would \nestablish a permanent Violence Against Women Office in the Department \nof Justice. This bill would guarantee that the office will continue its \nwork into future administrations and ensure that the Congress' goals \nregarding domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking will be \ncarried out.\n  As a State lawmaker in 1983, I wrote one of the first domestic \nviolence laws in South Dakota which dedicated a portion of marriage \nlicense fees to help build shelters for battered women. I was also a \ncosponsor of the original Violence Against Women Act in 1990 in the \nHouse of Representatives. Even at that time, many people denied that \ndomestic violence existed in our state. Finally, in 1995, the President \nsigned legislation to strengthen federal criminal law relating to \nviolence against women and fund programs to help women who have been \nassaulted.\n  Since the Violence Against Women Act became law, South Dakota \norganizations have received over $6.7 million in federal funding for \ndomestic abuse programs. In addition, the Violence Against Women Act \ndoubled prison time for repeat sex offenders; established mandatory \nrestitution to victims of violence against women; codified much of our \nexisting laws on rape; and strengthened interstate enforcement of \nviolent crimes against women.\n  The law also created a national toll-free hotline to provide women \nwith crisis intervention help, information about violence against \nwomen, and free referrals to local services. Last year, the hotline \ntook its 300,000th call. The number for women to call for help is: 1-\n800-799-SAFE.\n  I am hopeful that, with my support, the Senate will approve S. 540 \nthis year so that we can continue fighting domestic abuse and violence \nagainst women in our state and communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3698-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING THE DOOLITTLE RAIDERS\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the Doolittle \nRaiders on the 60th anniversary of their memorable flights.\n  The surprise Japanese raid of Pearl Harbor was just the beginning of \na series of bad news for Americans at the beginning of World War II. In \na period of months, the Japanese had invaded and conquered land \nstretching from Burma to Polynesia. The United States badly needed a \nboost in morale. The answer was the Doolittle Raid.\n  The concept was simple: A Navy task force would take 15 B-25s to a \npoint about 450 miles off of Japan where they would be launched from a \ncarrier to attack military targets at low altitude in five major \nJapanese cities, including the capital city of Tokyo. The planes would \nthen fly to a base in China where they would join the China-Burma-India \ntheater. It was the implementation of the plan that made the men \ninvolved in the raid heroes.\n  On April 18, 1941, sixteen flights of B-25s, one captained by South \nDakota native son Capt. Donald Smith, left the deck of the U.S.S. \nHornet, bound for Tokyo. But the Japanese had seen the Americans \ncoming, and the planes were forced to take off from the Hornet at least \n650 miles from the Japanese coast. The planes would not have enough \nfuel to make it to China.\n  All of the planes made their bombing runs on their respective cities, \nand then turned westward toward China. One crew, with not enough fuel \nto make it to China, landed in Russia and were prisoners of war for \nover a year. Eleven of the other planes that reached China faced \nterrible weather and empty tanks. They proceeded inland on instruments \nand bailed out once their fuel tanks reached zero. The remaining four \npilots crash-landed their aircraft. Chinese aided the Americans in \nreaching their base, and more than a quarter-million of the Chinese \nwere subsequently killed by the Japanese for their suspected help. \nSixty-four of the ``Raiders'' eventually made it to the base in China. \nOthers were captured and tortured, or died while ejecting their planes.\n  The Doolittle mission was the first good news from the Pacific front, \nand was a huge boost to American morale. It also devastated the \nJapanese people, who had been told by their leaders that their homeland \ncould never be attacked.\n  In Belle Fourche, SD, on April 18, South Dakotans will be remembering \nthe 60th anniversary of this daring raid. I commend the Doolittle \nRaiders, and all American veterans, for they are truly America's \nheroes. Our country must honor its commitments to veterans, not only \nbecause it is the right thing to do, but because it is the smart thing \nto do.\n  I will continue to lead efforts to ensure that our nation's military \nretirees and veterans receive the benefits they were promised years \nago. While I am pleased with some improvements in military health care \nfunding passed into law last year, I am concerned that more needs to be \ndone. Assuredly, I will continue to fight for military retirees and \nveterans programs throughout this session of Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3698-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3698-S3699]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 170, the \nRetired Pay Restoration Act of 2001.\n  S. 170 permits retired members of the Armed Forces who have a \nservice-connected disability to receive both military retired pay by \nreasons of their years of military service and disability compensation \nfrom the Department of Veterans Affairs for their disability.\n  Currently, a retired military member will have his or her retirement \npay offset dollar for dollar when they receive disability compensation \nfrom the Veterans Administration. This law is 110 years old and it is \nlong overdue for change.\n  The military retirement pay is earned over one's career for \nlongevity, while the VA disability compensation is for a different \nreason altogether--sustaining an injury while in the service. These are \ntwo completely separate issues and military members have suffered over \nthe years by having their retirement pay reduced. The Retired Pay \nRestoration Act of 2001 will correct this deficiency.\n  We owe our freedom to those who wore our country's military uniforms. \nWe must honor our commitment to those who served in the military. This \nyear is the time to overturn the provision in the 110 year-old law that \nprohibits military retirees from receiving concurrent receipt of full \nmilitary retirement pay along with VA disability compensation. \nEntitling these people to receive both retirement pay and disability \ncompensation without any deduction is the right thing to do It is not a \nhand out; it is something they deserve and earned for serving our \ncountry honorably.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support S. 170.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3699-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3699-S3700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    DEATH OF JOHN C. HOYT OF MONTANA\n\n Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nmake note of the recent death of a great man and fellow Montanan.\n  Montana lost one of its proudest native sons on Monday, March 26, \n2001. John Hoyt died at the Benefis Hospital in Great Falls, during a \nheart attack catheterization procedure. He was 78.\n  In Shelby, June 28, 1922, a fascinating and adventurous and truly \nincredible life began. John's parents had come to Shelby from Iowa. The \nfamily's background was in farming and ranching. John's father, a \nlawyer, raised his family in Shelby during the Great Depression. John \nspent summers back in Iowa, during the hard times, without modern \nequipment, without air-conditioning and using a real pitchfork to \ngather hay in the field and pitch it into the hay mow for the winter. \nAll who knew John, knew those thick hands and fingers of his proved he \nwas no stranger to hard physical work.\n  John began his college career, on scholarship, at Drake University in \nIowa. But, by his own admission, ``too much fun'' brought that \neducational experience to an end. Perhaps that was meant to be, because \nleaving Drake brought John home to Montana, and the University in \nMissoula, a place where his heart and his loyalty and his support never \nagain left. A true Grizzly is now at rest. But his presence will be \nforever felt on that campus and in the stadium in Box 102B down on the \nnorth end. John will still be cheering on his beloved Grizzlies. He \nmight even give Coach Glenn ``a great play'' from wherever John is \nwatching!\n  World War II broke out while John was in undergraduate school at the \nU of M. The day after Pearl Harbor he joined the Air Force. His \neyesight was not good enough to allow him to be the fighter pilot he \naspired to be. He proudly became a navigator on a B-24 as a Second \nLieutenant. In August of 1944, on a mission between Italy and Vienna, \nin a fierce air battle involving hundreds of airplanes, John's was shot \ndown by German fighters. The bomber, named the Jolly Roger, spiraled to \nthe ground and only John and one other were able to escape. The spiral \ncarried the other crew to their deaths, and John was captured and was \nin a P.O.W. camp for most of a year before the army of General George \nPatton liberated him and many of his comrades.\n  John finished his education after the war. He graduated from the \nUniversity of Montana Law School in 1948. For the past fifty-three \nyears John Hoyt stamped Montana legal history, beginning in Shelby, \ntyping his own oil field title reports with five sheets of carbon \npaper, and then centering his practice out of Great Falls and becoming \none of the most creative and innovative and persuasive trial lawyers in \nMontana's history.\n  John was so proud of the many talented lawyers he practiced with. It \nwas recently stated by legal pundits that while it was not required to \nhave practiced with John Hoyt to sit on the Montana Supreme Court, it \ndid not hurt.\n  John's current firm, Hoyt and Blewett, is one of the most prominent \nin Montana. He and his partner, Zander Blewett, have represented \nMontanans with pride and dignity, and his clashes with the Burlington \nNorthern led to a memento in his office portraying the Burlington \nNorthern logo and inscribed, for John, with the words, ``Any Time is \nTrain Time''!\n\n  John had a lifelong passion for agriculture, and established one of \nthe most noted Black Angus ranches in America, the Jolly Roger. He \nnamed it after his former comrades in World War II. In the 1990's two \nbulls that he developed and raised, Juice and Uncle Jim, became \nimportant leaders in carcass quality traits throughout the beef \nindustry. Ironically, John's last yearling bull sale was just last \nWednesday, March 21. His bull sold to all areas of Montana, several \nstates, and into Canada.\n  John Hoyt was a gentleman. He had acquaintances that ranged from the \nmost humble to the most powerful of his fellow citizens. All were \nequally valued by John as friends. He was an outdoorsman who trained \nhunting dogs and loved bird hunting. His fishing trips that he led \nfriends on in Alaska were, at the very least, memorable. His wit and \nenthusiasm and his energy\n\n[[Page S3700]]\n\nmade him the center of any gathering he was ever part of.\n  John belonged to the Cascade County Bar Association, the Montana Bar \nAssociation, the Montana and the American Trial Lawyers Association. \nJohn was also an active member of the Montana and American Angus \nAssociations. He was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Citation by the \nMontana Trial Lawyers, in recognition of his fifty years of \ndistinguished trial practice in Montana.\n  John is survived by his wife, Vickie, of the Jolly Roger Ranch in \nBelt; his son, John Richard (Rosemary) of Washington state; his \ndaughter, Mary Lou (Dennis) Sandretto, and his grandchildren, Rachel, \nAriel and David Sandretto, all of Georgia; and his sister, Lois \nMatsler, of Bloomington, Illinois. He is also survived by countless \nfriends and colleagues and acquaintances throughout his beloved \nMontana. Montana may never know the likes of John Hoyt again. He left \nMontana for a better place. His generous financial gifts to the \nUniversity of Montana, both the Athletic Department and the Law School \nwill sustain his legacy for generations that come afterwards. As John \nwould say: Up with Montana--Go Griz!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3700-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DON C. NICKERSON\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I'd like to take a few minutes to \nhonor Don C. Nickerson for his outstanding work as United States \nAttorney for the Southern District of Iowa.\n  Don Nickerson has been a leader in the state of Iowa for thirty \nyears, starting back when he served as Student Body Vice President and \nPresident of the Senior Men's Honorary at Iowa State, and as President \nof the Black Law Students Association at Drake Law School. After \ngraduating from law school, he distinguished himself in community \nservice, private practice, and as an Assistant United States Attorney \nin the Southern District before being appointed as U.S. Attorney for \nthe district in 1993.\n  During his years in the U.S. Attorney's Office, Don became known as a \npassionate and innovative leader. He established the Quad Cities Branch \nOffice of the U.S. Attorney's office--the first ever interagency branch \noffice established in the United States. He also served as Chair of the \nHealth Care Fraud Subcommittee of the Attorney General's Advisory \nCommittee and worked closely with Attorney General Reno to combat \nhealth care fraud.\n  And Don was a personal mentor to Iowa's youth because he knew that \nreaching out to children early in life goes a long way in preventing \nthem from straying in the future. In fact, Don was instrumental in \nestablishing Camp DEFY--a camp and mentorship program to help kids stay \naway from drugs, alcohol and tobacco in Iowa.\n  But Don has never been content to confine his service to the official \nduties of the U.S. Attorney. He's brought his passion for service to \nthe classroom, serving as an Instructor with Drake University Legal \nClinic and Des Moines Area Community College. He's brought it to civic \norganizations like Partnership for a Drug Free Iowa, the United Way of \nCentral Iowa and the Iowa Commission on the Aging. And he's brought it \nto professional organizations like the Midwest High Intensity Drug \nTrafficking Area Demand Reduction Subcommittee of which he was chair \nand the Iowa State and National Bar Associations.\n  When I think of the work that Don Nickerson has done for our state \nand our country, I'm reminded of a phrase from the Old Testament: ``The \nLaw is a light.'' Don Nickerson has worked tirelessly to keep that \nlight shining bright in Iowa and to make our state a safer, more just \nplace to raise our children and live our lives.\n  Don has served our state with honor and loyalty, and it is my \npleasure to offer my deepest gratitude for his contributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3700-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3700-S3701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MR. ARNOLD SPIELBERG\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I share with you and my \ncolleagues an extraordinary story about an extraordinary American \npatriot. The gentleman's name is Arnold Spielberg. Yes, he is the \nfather; but his own fame was earned, long before his son's, as a combat \nairman of the ``Greatest Generation.''\n  Like many of us during World War II, Mr. Spielberg heard the call of \nour great Nation and enlisted in the U.S. Army Signal Corps, just after \nPearl Harbor, in January 1942. After several weeks of training at Fort \nThomas and in Louisville, KY, he was transferred to the 422nd Signal \nCompany at the New Orleans Army Air Corps Base near Lake Pontchartrain. \nPrivate Spielberg then spent the next 3 months doing close order drill \nand teaching Morse code to unwilling recruits. He recalled that in an \neffort to get the attention of these unwilling recruits, he would send \nthem ``colorful'' jokes and stories to keep their attention. It worked.\n  In May 1942, he boarded a troop ship in Charleston, SC and 2 months \nlater, disembarked in Karachi, India. Once in India, he was stationed \nat the Leslie Wilson Muslim Hostel working at the Karachi \nClassification Depot. His job was to essentially open up shipments of \nwar materiel, aircraft parts mostly, check them against the technical \nmanuals to figure out which aircraft they went to and label them. While \nthis was important work, Mr. Spielberg wanted to be closer to the \naction and asked his Commanding Officer for a transfer to the 490th \nBombardment Squadron, Medium. He got it and was on his way.\n  Corporal Spielberg tackled his new assignment with enthusiasm and \nvigor. He set up the communications system that serviced the control \ntower for planes practicing strafing and bombing missions on an island \nin the Indian Ocean. He also started to train as a radio gunner and \nlearned all about the B-25's, the famous Mitchell bomber, communication \nequipment, inside and out.\n  Because of his hard work and diligence, Corporal Spielberg quickly \nearned the rank of Master Sergeant and the reputation as an expert \nsignalman. He designed a high gain, bi-directional rhombic antenna, \nusing giant bamboo poles for support. Their signal was as clear as \n``Ma' Bell.'' He also tackled the somewhat menacing problem of electric \npower. The base power was supplied by a large British diesel generator \nthat produced 250 volts at 50 cycles. The radio equipment ran on 115 \nvolts at 60 cycles. In order to use the British generator, the voltage \noutput needed to be reduced. Master Sergeant Spielberg requisitioned a \nstep down transformer however, he knew that would take six months or so \nto secure. In the meantime, by the use of a little ``horse trading,'' \nhe enlisted the help of some squadron mates to refurbish the unit's old \ngenerator which was then turned in as a spare and a new generator was \nissued.\n\n  The world over, U.S. soldiers, sailors and airmen used their common \nsense ``to make do'' when faced with challenging situations of all \nkinds. We didn't always do it ``by the book,'' but we succeeded.\n  Master Sergeant Spielberg also redesigned some electrical circuitry \nbecause of a critical safety flaw that he discovered at great risk to \nhimself. While performing maintenance on the squadron's large \ntransmitter one morning, Master Sergeant Spielberg turned off the main \npower source so as to change the bands. Noting the red power light \n``out,'' he reached in to pull out the transmitter-turning coil. As he \ngrabbed it, 2600-volts DC current went through his hand and sent him \nflying in the air. When he returned from seeing the medics, he \ninspected the transmitter and noticed the relay that controlled the \npower to the main transformer was ``hot wired'' to the power side so \nthat the unit continually received power and could not be shut off. He \nimmediately rewired the unit and drafted a correction notice to be \ndistributed to the entire transmitter-user community.\n  Master Sergeant Spielberg also had the opportunity to fly combat \nmissions. As the Japanese began their invasion of India with a focus on \nImphal, his squadron was pressed to fly more missions. They supplied \nthe British and Indian troops with food and ammo, and carried out the \nwounded. The aircrew soon became exhausted and ``over-flown'' so the \nCommunications Officer looked to the ground crew. When asked if he \nwould volunteer to fly, Master Sergeant Spielberg said, ``Yeah, I'll go \nfirst!''--and he did. He flew missions as the radio gunner, at night, \ninto\n\n[[Page S3701]]\n\nImphal, to resupply the troops and bring out the wounded.\n  Because of his extraordinary initiatives and many other forward-\nthinking actions, Master Sergeant Spielberg was awarded the Bronze Star \nmedal with a citation that read:\n\n       Pursuant to the authority contained in Army Regulations \n     600-45, War Department, Washington, DC, 22 September 1943, \n     the Bronze Star Medal is hereby awarded to Master Sergeant \n     Arnold M. Spielberg, 15088831:\n       For meritorious service from 24 July 1942 to 16 October \n     1944 as communications technician. M/Sgt Spielberg originated \n     numerous modifications and suggestions concerning radio \n     equipment and procedures which were later put in use \n     throughout the Army Air Forces. His untiring efforts and \n     initiative have rendered substantial aid to the operations of \n     his squadron.\n\n  By command of Major General Davidson, Headquarters, Tenth Air Force, \nU.S. Army.\n  Upon the termination of hostilities in World War II, in the year \n1945, all services made an effort to allow those who experienced the \nbattlefields beyond our shores to return, as soon as possible, to their \nfamilies and homes.\n  Often the records of their valorous service and the decorations they \nreceived had to follow. Given there were over 16 million who proudly \nwore the uniform of a service, this was a remarkable feat that was \naccomplished by a war-weary, but joyous nation.\n  Now, some 56 years later, I was honored to join the present Chief of \nStaff of the U.S. Air Force, General Michael Ryan, in reviewing the \nrecords and expediting the conveyance of the Bronze Star Medal to \nMaster Sergeant Spielberg.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3701-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3701]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL BANK 2000 MALCOLM BALDRIGE NATIONAL QUALITY AWARD \n                               RECIPIENT\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud one of \nthe many outstanding businesses in New Mexico and one that has \ndistinguished itself remarkably today.\n  Today the Los Alamos National Bank was one of four recipients of the \nMalcolm Baldrige National Quality Award for the year 2000. Bill Enloe, \nChief Executive Officer and Chairman of Los Alamos National Bank, and \nSteve Wells, President of the bank, were on hand to receive this \ndistinguished award from President George Bush and former Commerce \nSecretary Norman Mineta.\n  While I was unable to attend the ceremony, I understand that the \nemployees attending the ceremony from Los Alamos National Bank gave \nBill and Steve a rousing reception that matched the magnitude of the \naward and the weight of the crystal presented to Bill and Steve.\n  Los Alamos National Bank (LANB) is an independent community bank in \nnorthern New Mexico that employs 167 employees and serves the \ncommunities of Los Alamos, White Rock and Santa Fe. LANB received the \nBaldrige award in the small business category.\n  While the Baldrige examiners and judges recognized LANB for its \nquality and business achievements, I would like to recognize LANB for \nits outstanding response in the wake of the Cerro Grande fire that \nstruck in May 1999. LANB's decision to provide zero interest loans to \nthose who lost their homes in the fire was not something mandated by \nthe government, it was something they felt was the right thing to do. \nLANB's decision to postpone mortgage payments for residents was also \nthe right thing to do. This type of service is rare in today's business \nmarket, but truly reflective of what it means to be a community bank \nand one that provides exceptional service to its customers in times of \nprosperity and in times of need.\n  Years ago LANB recognized that if it wanted to remain an \nindependently owned bank, it would have to rise above all other banks \nand strive for excellence. It's ability to accomplish that goal was \nrecognized today. LANB now stands with only 39 previous Malcolm \nBaldrige Award recipients. I congratulate Bill, Steve and their fine \nstaff on their accomplishments and commitment to the people of northern \nNew Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3701-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3701-S3702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO EDDIE FROST\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, during my four years as a member \nof the United States Senate, I have traveled across the State of \nAlabama meeting with local community leaders. I am proud to say that I \nhave developed close, personal friendships with many of these folks. \nHowever, in all of my travels around the state, and meetings with \npublic officials, I have enjoyed none more than getting to know Eddie \nFrost, the Mayor of Florence, Alabama, who died on March 15 after a \nbattle with leukemia.\n  Florence, AL is a wonderful city with a population of 36,000 people. \nIt is located on the banks of the Tennessee River in northwest Alabama, \nand it is the largest city in the Shoals area. Eddie Frost was raised \nin the Shoals, graduated from Sheffield High School, and then he \ngraduated from Florence State University in 1961, which is now the \nUniversity of North Alabama. Before becoming mayor of Florence, Eddie \nFrost was a teacher and coach at Bradshaw High School in Florence. In \n1976, he coached the Bradshaw basketball team to a 6A state \nchampionship, and was recognized as the Alabama Coach of the Year.\n  He was first elected Mayor of Florence in 1984 when the city moved to \na mayor-council form of government. He inherited a city with a bleak \neconomic forecast and a high unemployment rate. Throughout his life, \nhowever, Eddie Frost always had a vision for bigger and better things. \nHe immediately put to work his positive spirit, his high energy level, \nand his unsurpassed dedication to Florence. He helped the city \nrevitalize downtown Florence, and today, the downtown area is booming.\n  He also worked tirelessly to see the Patton Island Bridge completed \nacross the Tennessee River. I remember vividly during my campaign for \nthe Senate, he took me up in the Florence Renaissance Tower and pointed \nout some lonesome concrete supports standing out in the middle of the \nriver. There was no doubt how strongly he felt about completing that \nbridge project. He understood the economic importance this bridge would \nhave for the Shoals area, and he worked side by side with us here in \nWashington to find funding for this worthy project. Thanks to his \nleadership, the bridge is nearly complete.\n  I also remember Eddie Frost proudly taking me on a tour of his city's \nrecycling center. I admired greatly his use of city prisoners to \nseparate garbage. It provided work for the prisoners, relieved landfill \ncosts, and produced revenue. I have long advocated such projects and \nhave never seen one better run.\n  Eddie Frost was also instrumental in helping the City of Florence \nland the NCAA Division II National Football Championship game in 1986. \nThis is a world-class event, and the game has been very successful in \nFlorence. The game has been a success because of the hospitality shown \nto the players, coaches, and fans by Eddie Frost, the championship \ncommittee, and the great people of Florence, Alabama. In December, the \ncity will celebrate the 16th consecutive Division II Championship game \nin Florence. In addition to football, Eddie Frost brought his love of \nbasketball to Florence. The city is now the home of the annual Alabama-\nMississippi high school all-star basketball game.\n  He was involved in many civic and volunteer organizations, and his \nlife was full of many achievements. He served as President of the \nAlabama League of Municipalities, Chairman of the American Public Gas \nAssociation, Chairman of the Board of Eliza Coffee Memorial Hospital, \nthe hospital in which my eldest daughter was born, and he was Past \nPresident of the North Alabama Industrial Development Association. He \nwas a Deacon at Highland Baptist Church in Florence, active in the \nNorthwest Alabama Boys and Girls Club, the United Way, the Lauderdale \nCounty Cancer Society, the Lauderdale County Heart Association, and the \nLeukemia Society of America.\n  In 1993 he was named the Florence Civitan Citizen of the Year. He was \nthe University of North Alabama's Alumnus of the Year in 1998, a member \nof the University of North Alabama Athletic Hall of Fame. Last month he \nwas inducted into the Lauderdale County Sports Hall of Fame and the \nAlabama High School Sports Hall of Fame.\n  Eddie Frost not only left his mark on the city of Florence, the \nShoals area, and the State of Alabama, he left an impression on our \nhearts. He was honest, out-going, and he was genuine. But\n\n[[Page S3702]]\n\nmost importantly, he loved people, and he cared deeply for them. He \nloved his wife Bonnie, and their three children. I want to offer my \nsincerest condolences to them. I know the last few months since he was \ndiagnosed with leukemia have been especially difficult for them. They \nwill always miss Eddie, but they can take great pride in he life he \nled, and the hearts he touched along the way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3702-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NDSU WRESTLING TEAM FLOOR STATEMENT\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, last month the North Dakota State \nUniversity wrestling team once again showed the strength, grit and \ndetermination of North Dakotans by winning the NCAA Division II \nwrestling championship. Not only was this the second consecutive \nchampionship for the Bison, it was the fourth national title in school \nhistory.\n  As a native North Dakotan, I am exceptionally proud of this \naccomplishment. Defending their NCAA Division II Championship, the \nBison finished 7\\1/2\\ points ahead of second place South Dakota State \nUniversity in the NCAA Division II finals on March 10. This year's \ndramatic victory came down to the wire needing a victory by Bison \nheavyweight Nick Severson to secure the victory over second place rival \nSouth Dakota State. Severson rose to the occasion by pinning an \nopponent he has never previously beaten. The stage for the upset \nheavyweight finale was set when each of the other Bison finalists, Todd \nFuller and Steve Saxlund, did their part by becoming national champs at \n174 and 184 pounds. For Saxlund, this was an impressive third straight \nnational championship.\n  I congratulate the Bison wrestling program. Exceptional coaching, \ndetermined wrestlers, and remarkable teamwork led the Bison to their \nfourth national championship. They qualified all 10 members of their \nwrestling squad for the NCAA tournament. With all but one returning for \nnext season, I expect to have the opportunity to make a similar \nannouncement next year regarding the Bison's success in the world's \noldest sport. Again, on behalf of all North Dakotans, I extend \ncongratulations to the Bison on yet another successful season and wish \nthe best of luck to the entire team.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3702-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. THOMAS E. STARZL\n\n Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I wish to recognize and honor Dr. \nThomas E. Starzl on the 20th anniversary of the first liver transplant \nperformed in Pittsburgh.\n  On February 26, 1981, Dr. Starzl made history upon his performance of \nthe first liver transplant at Presbyterian University Hospital (now \nUPMC Presbyterian). In the two decades since that remarkable \naccomplishment, Dr. Starzl has led the University of Pittsburgh \ntransplant program to national and international prominence. UPMC, now \nthe largest and most successful transplant center in the world, has \nperformed more than 5,700 liver transplants; 3,500 kidney transplants; \n1,000 heart transplants; and 500 lung transplants--largely attributed \nto Dr. Starzl's trailblazing vision.\n  Dr. Starzl's influence reaches well beyond western Pennsylvania. He \nhas been a pioneer in the field of organ transplantation for more than \n40 years, and has compiled a distinguished career that spans the \ncountry and medical technology. Dr. Starzl performed the world's first \nliver transplant in 1963 at the University of Colorado, and helped to \ndevelop the truly revolutionary surgical techniques and anti-rejection \ndrugs which have brought organ transplantation to the mainstream of \nAmerican medicine. Dr. Starzl has authored or co-authored more than \n2,000 scientific articles and four books, received 21 honorary \ndoctorates, and has been honored with more than 175 awards. Most \nrecently, he was a co-winner of the King Faisal International Prize in \nMedicine for the year 2000, sharing the award with two other transplant \npioneers. Although retired from clinical practice since 1991, Dr. \nStarzl continues to actively contribute to biomedical research as the \ndirector emeritus of the transplant institute in Pittsburgh, renamed in \nhis honor in 1996. The Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute and \nthe University of Pittsburgh will pay tribute to Dr. Starzl this month \nwith a ``Festschrift,'' a collection of articles by colleagues, former \nstudents and others published in his honor. This special event will \ninaugurate the Starzl Prize in Surgery and Immunology and unveil a \nportrait of Dr. Starzl that will be displayed in the University of \nPittsburgh School of Medicine.\n  With more than 20 years of landmark advancements in science and \nmedicine to his credit, I salute Dr. Thomas E. Starzl for his \nremarkable dedication and honor his contribution to the lifesaving \nfield of organ transplantation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3702-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3702]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MARY WALTERS\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I learned this morning that Mary \nWalters, one of New Mexico's most outstanding citizens has died at age \n79. She was a pioneering spirit if there ever was one, and many of us \nwho knew and admired her feel this loss keenly.\n  Not yet twenty-one, she served as a WASP, Women's Auxiliary Service \nPilots transport pilot during World War II. In a move that would shape \nher later career, she used her soon-to-expire GI benefits to go to \ncollege and then went on to earn a law degree at age forty. For the \nnext half of her life, she went places no woman had gone before in New \nMexico. She was President of the New Mexico Women's Political Caucus \nand served in a leadership position in the Constitutional Convention. \nShe was the first woman named to the district court. Her service on the \nNew Mexico Court of Appeals, 1978-1984, led to the New Mexico Supreme \nCourt where she became the first woman to sit on that bench.\n  During a critical period for women's rights, Mary Walters took the \nlead in our state and in our profession. She had many admirers. My \nwife, Anne, and I, were among them. She was a marvelous person whose \nlife was a blessing to all who appreciated her strength and spirit, and \nwhose death reminds us all what a force for good she was.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3702-4", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3702-S3703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CELEBRATION OF CHAUL CHHNAM, CAMBODIAN NEW YEAR\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to join Cambodian-\nAmericans in celebration of the traditional Cambodian New Year, Chaul \nChhnam, one of the major celebrations of the Cambodian culture. For \nthree days this month, there will be gatherings across the United \nStates to celebrate the beginning of the year. I take this opportunity \nto wish all Cambodian Americans a very happy New Year.\n  New Year celebrations are about the passing of time and the \nrejuvenation of optimism for the future. The Cambodian New Year is this \nand more. It represents a traditional end of the harvest and a \ncelebration of faith. Traditionally, it was a time for farmers to enjoy \nthe fruits of their harvest and relax before the rainy season began. \nThe start of the New Year is marked by the sounding of a bell. With the \nsounding, it is believed that the New Angel arrives. Throughout the day \npeople participate in ceremonies and bring food to the Buddhist monks \nand religious leaders. The second day of celebration, or Vana Bat, is a \ntime to show consideration for others. Gifts are given to parents, \ngrandparents and teachers as a show of respect and charity is offered \nto the less fortunate. The third day, or Loeng Sak, includes more \nreligious ceremonies and rituals to bring good luck and happiness to \nfamilies.\n  In my home state of Rhode Island there are numerous businesses owned \nby Cambodian-American families, most of them in the capital city \nProvidence. These families enrich Rhode Island with their diversity and \nculture, and their hard work contributes much to the local economy. I \nwould like to wish each one of them a happy New Year.\n  The Cambodian New Year is an appropriate time to remind all Americans \nwhy we must support the political and economic stabilization of \nCambodia. As Cambodia continues to recover from three decades of civil \nconflict, including the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge, it is \ncritical that the United States and international community aid the \nCambodian people in their efforts to build a lasting democracy.\n  As we approach the beginning of Chaul Chhnam, I encourage all U.S.\n\n[[Page S3703]]\n\ncitizens to join in the spirit of this special holiday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3703-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL PECAN MONTH\n\n Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, April is ``National Pecan Month.'' \nOne of the nation's important agricultural products, pecans are the \nonly major tree nut that can be considered a true American nut. Pecans \nwere first discovered growing in North America and parts of Mexico in \nthe 1600's and were given the name ``pecan'' based on the Native \nAmerican word of Algonquin origin, meaning ``all nuts requiring a stone \nto crack.'' Pecans were favored by pre-colonial residents and served as \na major source of food because they were accessible to waterways and \neasier to shell than other North American nut species.\n  Today, pecans are grown in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, \nFlorida, Georgia, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, New Mexico, North \nCarolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas and are enjoyed around the \nworld as the perfect nut. According to U.S. Department of Agriculture \nstatistics, over 346 million pounds of pecans were produced in the U.S. \nin 1999. In fact, the majority of the world's pecan production, 80 \npercent, comes from the U.S.\n  While valued for their wonderful aroma and flavor, scientific \nresearch has begun to recently reveal an even more important reason to \nmake pecans part of an everyday, healthy diet. According to researchers \nat leading academic institutions in this country, pecans have many of \nthe important nutritional attributes that health professionals \nrecommend. Not only are nutrition researchers finding that pecans can \nlower blood cholesterol levels when incorporated into the diet, food \nscientists have also found that pecans are a concentrated source of \nplant sterols, which are widely touted for their cholesterol-lowering \nability. Numerous studies have also shown that phytochemicals like \nthose found in pecans act as antioxidants, which can have a protective \neffect against many diseases.\n  Since 90 percent of the fat in pecans are of the heart-healthy \nunsaturated variety, they fit right into the government's latest U.S. \nDietary Guidelines for Americans issued in May 2000. The latest dietary \nguidelines from the American Heart Association, AHA, also bode well for \npecan lovers. The new AHA guidelines specifically advise Americans to \nlimit their intake of saturated fat and to ``substitute grains and \nunsaturated fatty acids from fish, vegetables, legumes and nuts'' in \nits place.\n  In addition to their cholesterol-lowering properties and heart-\nhealthy fats, pecans contain more than 19 important vitamins and \nminerals, including vitamins A and E, folic acid, calcium, magnesium, \nphosphorus, potassium, zinc and several B vitamins, and are a good \nsource of fiber. Pecans are part of the protein group in the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture's Food Guide Pyramid, making them a \nnutritious alternative for Americans who are vegetarians or striving to \neat a more plant-based diet. Pecans, which are naturally sodium-free, \nare also ideal for anyone who wishes to restrict their sodium intake.\n  Pecans, a true all-American nut, deserve to be recognized. Not only \nfor their long history of providing sustenance and enjoyment, but for \nthe health benefits they can provide to Americans--especially those \nstriving to eat a healthier diet. I hope my colleagues will join me in \ncelebrating ``National Pecan Month.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3703-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3703-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3703-4", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       H.R. 8.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Wyoming relative to wildlife management; to the \n     Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                    Enrolled Joint Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, the United States government has adopted and is \n     implementing a plan for the recovery of the grizzly bear and \n     gray wolf in the Northern Rocky Mountain region; and\n       Whereas, the federal policy to restore the grizzly bear and \n     gray wolf in the Northern Rocky Mountain region has a \n     continuing financial obligation which should be borne by the \n     same broad segment of the United States population which \n     imposed the policy in order to continue the effective \n     management of these species; and\n       Whereas, significant portions of the range of the grizzly \n     bear and gray wolf are located within the Northern Rocky \n     Mountain region on lands managed by the United States \n     Department of the Interior and the United States Department \n     of Agriculture; and\n       Whereas, the management of resident wildlife species not \n     listed under the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973, as \n     amended, is the responsibility of the states; and\n       Whereas, grizzly bear and gray wolf populations are \n     increasing and should therefore be removed from the federal \n     list of endangered species, thereby shifting a substantial \n     responsibility from management of these wildlife species to \n     the state of Wyoming; and\n       Whereas, the state of Wyoming acknowledges its \n     responsibility and authority for the management of the \n     grizzly bear and gray wolf in the Northern Rocky Mountain \n     region after those species have been removed from the list of \n     endangered species; and\n       Whereas, providing a substantial permanent and stable \n     source of funding to help pay for the continuing costs of \n     managing these unique species is essential for the successful \n     management of the grizzly bear and gray wolf in the Northern \n     Rocky Mountain region; and\n       Whereas, the costs to manage these wildlife species in the \n     Northern Rocky Mountain region will be significantly greater \n     than can be sustained through the existing budgets of the \n     responsible state and federal agencies; and\n       Whereas, a national trust should be established for the \n     management of these wildlife species with the understanding \n     that the responsible state and federal agencies will continue \n     to seek necessary appropriations from their respective \n     legislative bodies for the continuing management of these \n     wildlife species, consistent with their respective statutory \n     mandates. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the legislature of the State of \n     Wyoming, a majority of all the members of each house, voting \n     separately, concurring therein:\n       Section 1. That the Wyoming State Legislature endorses the \n     establishment of the Northern Rocky Mountain Grizzly Bear and \n     Gray Wolf Management Trust as a special fund within the \n     National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, to provide funding for \n     the management and compensation payments for losses incurred \n     by individuals and entities, made by state and federal \n     entities arising out of the continuing management of grizzly \n     bear and gray wolf populations in the Northern Rocky Mountain \n     region.\n       Section 2. That the Wyoming State Legislature requests that \n     the United States Congress fund the corpus of the Management \n     Trust with a minimum of forty million dollars \n     ($40,000,000.00) by January 1, 2003, which is the minimum \n     amount presently anticipated to be required to fund the \n     obligations resulting from the continuing management of these \n     unique species.\n       Section 3. That the Wyoming State Legislature encourages \n     individuals, businesses, corporations and organizations \n     across the United States to contribute to the corpus of the \n     Management Trust to ensure the continuing management of the \n     grizzly bear and gray wolf in the Northern Rocky Mountain \n     region of the United States.\n       Section 4. The Secretary of State of Wyoming is directed to \n     transmit copies of this resolution and a copy of the list of \n     members voting for this proposal to the President of the \n     United States, to the President of the Senate and the Speaker \n     of the House of Representatives of the United States \n     Congress, to the United States Secretary of Interior and the \n     United States Secretary of Agriculture and to the Wyoming \n     Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-6. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Wyoming relative to wildlife management; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n       Whereas, separation of powers is fundamental to the United \n     States Constitution and the power of the federal government \n     is limited; and\n       Whereas, the state of Wyoming has certain rights guaranteed \n     to the states by the Constitution of the United States; and\n       Whereas, under the United States constitution, the states \n     are to determine public policy; and\n       Whereas, traditionally the state of Wyoming has \n     participated in issues regarding the introduction or \n     reintroduction of threatened or endangered species into \n     boundaries of the state; and\n       Whereas, the costs of managing and conserving the \n     threatened or endangered species is significantly greater \n     than can be sustained through the annual operating budgets of \n     state agencies; and\n       Whereas, the introduction or reintroduction of threatened \n     or endangered species may have a negative impact on the state \n     of Wyoming's industries and economy; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress should not make \n     decisions for the introduction or reintroduction of \n     threatened or endangered species into the state of Wyoming \n     without the consent and approval of the state; and\n       Whereas, the United States Congress should not make \n     decisions for the introduction or reintroduction of \n     threatened or endangered species into the state of Wyoming \n     without providing necessary funding for the management and \n     conservation of these species.\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the members of the legislature of the State of \n     Wyoming, a majority of all the members of each house, voting \n     separately, concurring therein:\n       Section 1. That the Wyoming State Legislature does not \n     condone the introduction of threatened or endangered species \n     pursuant to the federal ``Endangered Species Act of 1973'' 16 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 1531, et seq., as amended, into the state of \n     Wyoming without the approval and consent of the state of \n     Wyoming.\n       Section 2. That the Wyoming State Legislature strongly \n     encourages the United States Congress to appropriate monies \n     for the management and conservation of threatened or \n     endangered species prior to their introduction or \n     reintroduction into the state of Wyoming, and to establish \n     federal funding sources to provide for state management of \n     the species following delisting.\n       Section 3. That the Secretary of State of Wyoming transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the President of the United \n     States, to the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives of the United States Congress, to \n     the United States Secretary of Interior and the United States \n     Secretary of Agriculture and to the Wyoming Congressional \n     Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-7. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of North Dakota relative to amending the \n     Constitution of the United States; to the Committee on the \n     Judiciary.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 3031\n\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States reserves to \n     the states a broad range of powers and the power of the \n     federal government is strictly limited with regard to powers \n     reserved to the states; and\n\n[[Page S3705]]\n\n       Whereas, under the Constitution of the United States, the \n     states are given full authority over state and local \n     government tax policy; and\n       Whereas, it is the duty of the judiciary to interpret the \n     law, not to create law; and\n       Whereas, our present federal government has strayed from \n     the intent of our founding fathers and the Constitution of \n     the United States through inappropriate federal mandates; and\n       Whereas, federal district courts, with the acquiescence of \n     the United States Supreme Court, continue to order states to \n     levy or increase taxes to comply with federal mandates; and\n       Whereas, these court actions violate the Constitution of \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas, the time has come for the people of this great \n     nation and their duly elected representatives in state \n     government to reaffirm, in no uncertain terms, that the \n     authority to tax under the Constitution of the United States \n     is retained by the people who, by their consent alone, do \n     delegate such power to tax explicitly to those duly elected \n     representatives in the legislative branch of government whom \n     they choose, such representatives being directly responsible \n     and accountable to those who have elected them; Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of North Dakota, \n     the Senate Concurring therein:\n       1. That the United States Congress prepare and submit to \n     the several states an amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States to add a new article providing as follows:\n       ``Neither the Supreme Court nor any inferior court of the \n     United States shall have the power to instruct or order a \n     state or political subdivision thereof, or an official of \n     such a state or political subdivision, to levy or increase \n     taxes.''\n       2. That this application constitutes a continuing \n     application in accordance with Article V of the Constitution \n     of the United States.\n       3. That the Fifty-seventh Legislative Assembly also \n     proposes that the legislatures of each of the several states \n     comprising the United States that have not yet made a similar \n     request apply to the United States Congress requesting \n     enactment of an appropriate amendment to the Constitution of \n     the United States, and apply to the United States Congress to \n     propose such an amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States.\n       4. That the Secretary of State transmit copies of this \n     resolution to the President and Vice President of the United \n     States, the presiding officer in each house of the \n     legislature in each of the states in the Union, the Speaker \n     of the United States House of Representatives, the President \n     of the United States Senate, and to each member of the North \n     Dakota Congressional Delegation.\n       POM-8. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Wyoming relative to the rescinding of a \n     convention; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                 Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4028\n\n       Whereas, the Legislative Assembly, acting with the best of \n     intentions, has, at various times, applied to the Congress of \n     the United States to call a convention to propose amendments \n     to the United States Constitution, pursuant to the provisions \n     of Article V of the United States Constitution; and\n       Whereas, former Justice of the United States Supreme Court \n     Warren E. Burger, former Associate Justice of the United \n     States Supreme Court Arthur J. Goldberg, and other leading \n     constitutional scholars agree that such a convention may \n     propose sweeping changes to the Constitution, any limitations \n     or restrictions purportedly imposed by the states in applying \n     for such a convention or conventions to the contrary \n     notwithstanding, thereby creating an imminent peril to the \n     well-established rights of the citizens and the duties of \n     various levels of government; and\n       Whereas, the Constitution of the United States has been \n     amended many times in the history of this nation and may be \n     amended many more times, without the need to resort to a \n     constitutional convention, and has been interpreted for more \n     than 200 years and has been found to be a sound document that \n     protects the lives and liberties of the citizens; and\n       Whereas, there is great danger in a new constitution or in \n     opening the Constitution to sweeping changes, the adoption of \n     which would only create legal chaos in this nation and only \n     begin the process of another two centuries of litigation over \n     its meaning and interpretation; Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of North Dakota, the House of \n     Representatives concurring therein:\n       That the Legislative Assembly rescinds the following \n     applications made by the Legislative Assembly to the Congress \n     of the United States to call a convention pursuant to Article \n     V of the United States Constitution:\n       1967 House Concurrent Resolution ``I-1'', calling for a \n     convention to amend the Constitution of the United States, \n     relating to apportionment;\n       1971 Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4013, calling for a \n     convention to amend the Constitution of the United States to \n     provide revenue sharing;\n       1975 Senate Concurrent Resolution 4018, calling for a \n     convention to amend the Constitution of the United States to \n     require a balanced cash budget for each session of Congress \n     except in time of war or national emergency;\n       1979 Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 4033, calling for a \n     convention to amend the Constitution of the United States to \n     prohibit federal estate taxes; and\n       Be it further resolved, That the Legislative Assembly urges \n     the legislative bodies of each state that have applied to \n     Congress to call a convention to rescind; and\n       Be it further resolved, That the Secretary of State forward \n     copies of this resolution to the presiding officer of each \n     legislative body in each state, to the President of the \n     United States Senate, to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, to the members of the North Dakota \n     Congressional Delegation, and to the administrator of General \n     Services, Washington, D.C.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3705-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXECUTIVE REPORT OF COMMITTEE\n\n  The following executive report of committee was submitted:\n\n       By Mr. SPECTER for the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n       Tim S.

A bill to provide the citizens of the United States and \nCongress with a report on coordinated actions by Federal agencies to \nprevent the introduction of foot and mouth disease and bovine \nspongiform encephalopathy into the United States and other information \nto assess the economic and public health impacts associated with the \npotential threats presented by those diseases; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Animal \ndisease Risk Assessment, Prevention, and Control Act of 2001. I want to \nthank my friend and colleague, Senator Tom Harkin, for his partnership \nin developing this bipartisan bill. I also want to recognize Senator \nCampbell's exceptional leadership in bringing to the forefront of \npublic discussion the issue of the health of our domestic cattle herds. \nWe are joined in cosponsorship by Senators Durbin, Lugar, Daschle, and \nLeahy, as well as over one-third of the Senate in this bipartisan \neffort.\n  Our bill makes clear the Congress' commitment to our livestock \nindustry and to ensuring our public health. Our goal is to make certain \nthat the Congress and the American public are fully informed as to the \nreliability of our nation's animal health inspection system, its \nability to protect our domestic herds and the American public from the \npotential introduction into the United States of foot and mouth disease \nand bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), commonly referred to as mad \ncow disease. The presence of either of these diseases would have \nstaggering economic consequences for our country.\n  In addition, it is imperative, as this bill directs, that we learn \nmore about the possible public health consequences of BSE so that we \ncan be confident that our nation continues to successfully prevent any \npotentially negative impacts on human or animal health. Americans from \nSalt Lake city, Iowa City and across the country need to maintain \nconfidence that the beef products they purchase and consume are safe.\n  The public has no doubt heard the media reports on the recent cases \nin Europe of BSE and the outbreak of FMD, and they have heard about the \ndevastating effect these outbreaks have had on the livestock industries \nin that part of the world. With all this media coverage, misconceptions \nhave arisen which could make matters worse than the situation merits.\n  The public deserves to know the facts surrounding these animal \ndiseases, their threat to public health, and their potential means of \ntransmission. This is one of the basic goals of our legislation--to \nhelp overcome the lack of information associated with these diseases. \nHowever, in the unfortunate event that it becomes necessary to fight \nthis disease at home, we must ensure that the government and other \nofficials have the necessary tools to move swiftly and completely to \ncontrol these diseases in the United States.\n  We have been successful so far in preventing the return of FMD to the \nUnited States. No case of BSE has ever been identified in the United \nStates. This bill is intended to continue that success into the future.\n  Here is what the bill does in a nutshell. The legislation lays out a \nseries of detailed findings that set forth the current state of \nknowledge with respect to these two diseases. A key provision of the \nbill requires the Secretary of Agriculture to submit two reports to \nCongress. The first report, to be submitted in 30 days of enactment, \nrequires the Administration to identify any immediate needs for \nadditional legislative authority or funding. The second report, to be \nsubmitted within 180 days of adoption, requires the submission of a \ncomprehensive analysis of the risks of FMD and BSE to American \nlivestock and beef products, the potential economic consequences if FMD \nor BSE are found in the United States, and information concerning the \npotential linkage between BSE and variant Cruetzfeldt-Jacab Disease \n(vCJD), a condition affection humans.\n  The legislation requires the Secretary of Agriculture to consult with \nthe Secretaries of State, Treasury, Defense, Commerce, Health and Human \nServices, the United States Trade Representative, the Director of the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, and other appropriate federal \npersonnel when she develops both the reports mandated by this bill. In \naddition, in issuing the comprehensive 180 day report, the Secretary of \nAgriculture must consult with international, State, and local \ngovernment animal health officials, experts in infectious disease \nresearch, prevention and control, livestock experts, representatives of \nblood collection and distribution entities, and representatives of \nconsumer and patient organizations. A chief goal of that report is to \nhelp devise a coordinated plan to prevent the introduction of FMD and \nBSE into the United States and to help identify the proper corrective \nsteps if FMD and BSE find their way into our country.\n\n[[Page S3710]]\n\n  Mr. President, let me take this opportunity to comment upon some \ncommon myths on this issue. First, the public should know that there is \nno known etiologic relationship between BSE and FMD. While it is true \nthat these diseases have occurred in the same region within a shared \ntime-frame, the fact is that the two diseases are quite distinct and \nhave occurred independently from one another.\n  BSE is a transmissible, neuro-degenerative disease in cattle. The \ndisease is believed to have an incubation period of years, but once \nactive in cattle it can quickly become fatal in a matter of a few \nweeks. It is carried in the brain and spinal cord of the animal, not in \nthe meat products normally consumed by humans.\n  In a practice banned in the U.S., cattle in Great Britain were fed \nprotein products derived from other animal products, which may have \ncarried BSE. Scientists believe that this practice led to the spread of \nBSE in Great Britain and Europe. I want to emphasize that the \nimportation into the U.S. of grazing animals from BSE-prevalent \ncountries has been forbidden since 1997. I also want to point our that \nU.S. law also prohibits the feeding of most animal proteins to grazing \nanimals.\n  As for foot and mouth disease, it is a highly contagious virus \naffecting cloven hoofed animals, including cattle, swine, sheep, goats, \ndeer, and others. Although this disease was eradicated in the U.S. in \n1929, it could be reintroduced by a single infected animal or animal \nproduct form another country, or by a person or conveyance that carries \nthe virus from another country. It can then spread quickly among our \ndomestic herds by animal contact or through the aerosol transmission. \nWe cannot afford to allow that to happen.\n  The disease can be carried by the wind from one animal to another. \nAnimals infected by FMD can be cured by injections, however, the \ninfected animal will continue to spread the disease during recovery. \nFor that reason, the preferred remedy is to slaughter the animal before \nit can spread the disease further. To be safe, the entire herd will \noften be killed even if only one or two animals are found to be \ninfected. This is why our bill also contains a provision to determine \nwhether adequate compensation would be available under existing \nprograms for producers suffering losses from destruction of affected \nherds.\n  Mr. President, another concern held by some is that there is a strong \nrisk of humans being infected by these diseases, either by eating meat \nor through some other means of transmission.\n  Let me first discuss BSE. There are, in fact, human spongiform \nencephalopathies. An example of such a disease is the recently \ndiscovered variant of Cruetzfeldt-Jacab Disease. Scientists have not \ndetermined that a definitive causal link exists between BSE and variant \nCruetzfeldt-Jacob Disease or other spongiform encephalopathies found in \nhumans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has \nstated: ``Although there is strong evidence that the agent responsible \nfor these human cases is the same agent responsible for the BSE \noutbreaks in cattle, the specific foods that may be associated with the \ntransmission of this agent from cattle to humans are unknown.'' \nScientists are currently studying the issue further and the Animal \nHealth Risk Assessment, Prevention, and Control Act of 2001 encourages \nsuch research.\n  While these studies are ongoing, the Food and Drug Administration \n(FDA) has acted to minimize the spread of human spongiform \nencephalopathies in the United States by disqualifying any individual \nwho lived in the United Kingdom for more than six months since 1980 \nfrom donating blood while in the U.S.\n  With respect to foot and mouth disease, it is principally an animal \ndisease and is not thought to be threatening to human health. Humans \ncan, however, spread the disease to animals.\n  I am concerned that based on the outbreak of these diseases in Europe \nand the potential for spread into the U.S., consumers might question \nthe safety and wholesomeness of animal products sold in this country. \nBecause of our vigilance in the past our nation has a very safe and \nwholesome meat supply, and we should be proud of that. In fact, other \nnations have been seeking out American meat products, because they know \nthat our animals health system is strong and has successfully kept \nthese diseases out of our domestic livestock herds.\n\n  Mr. President, the Animal Health Risk Assessment, Prevention, and \nControl Act of 2001, will help the United States to maintain the safety \nof our food supply and will help our nation to evaluate the sufficiency \nof the steps taken, or planned, to protect our citizens from any \npotential untoward impacts if these animal diseases enter into the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join Senator Hatch \nand thirty-seven other Senators in introducing the Animal Disease Risk \nAssessment, Prevention, and Control Act of 2001. This legislation helps \nmake sure that our country is on a solid footing to protect our \ncountry's public and economy from the astounding losses that could come \nfrom an animal disease such as Food and Mouth Disease, FMD, or Bovine \nSpongiform Encephalopathy, BSE, arriving on our shores.\n  As we know all too well from observing the experience of the EU, \neither of these diseases could potentially wreak tens of billions of \ndollars in lost livestock and markets if they were ever found in the \nU.S. BSE, with its suspected linkages to New Variant Creutzfeld-Jacob \nDisease, could cause some Americans to suffer its cruel, fatal effects.\n  Fortunately, we have an animal and public health system that has \nsuccessfully prevented either of these diseases from entering our \ncountry. This is testimony to the men and women who work each day to \nprotect our nation from foreign animal diseases. But the price of this \nsuccess is unremitting vigilance. We must ensure there are no gaps in \nour defenses. The sheer volume of travel and commerce between the \nUnited States and the European Union is placing unprecedented strain on \nour animals health system.\n  This legislation will give Congress a clearer picture of where the \npotential risks to animal and human health may lie, and what must be \ndone to prevent them. It will provide Congress and the public with a \nblueprint for what is currently being done, and what must be done in \nthe future.\n  The health of our animals is inextricably linked with the health of \nour populace and economy. It is crucial to continuing to provide a \nsafe, abundant supply of food. I hope this legislation will be passed \nquickly, to send a clear message that Congress stands ready to do what \nit takes to ensure that our success in protecting our shores from FMD \nand BSE remains unbroken.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease, \nFMD, and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy, BSE, among some of our \nclosest trading partners is cause for heightened attention to our \nability to prevent the spread of these diseases to the United States. \nAlthough the U.S. has not had an outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease \nsince 1929, and has had no known cases of BSE, their recent spread in \nEurope and other countries has raised serious concerns domestically. \nGiven the extremely contagious nature of FMD, an outbreak in the U.S. \ncould be catastrophic to the domestic farm economy, and would have \nserious ramifications for other economic sectors as well. BSE is not as \ncontagious as FMD, but it causes a disease in humans that is fatal. \nOverall, BSE is much less well understood than FMD, which is itself a \nrisk factor.\n  I appreciate the significant work of USDA and other agencies to \ncontrol the threat that FMD and BSE may pose to human health, in the \ncase of BSE, and the health of domestic livestock and wildlife. \nHowever, we must do more, and we must do it quickly. I believe that the \nAdministration's efforts would benefit from greater coordination among \nfederal agencies, and increased attention to the availability of public \ninformation. Additionally, Congress needs data relevant to the \ndevelopment of longer-term disease prevention and management \nstrategies, and guidance as to whether the Administration will require \nincreased statutory or funding to respond to this situation \nappropriately and expeditiously.\n  In an effort to contain the spread of FMD, South Dakota has \ninstituted restrictions on individuals traveling from\n\n[[Page S3711]]\n\ncountries with confirmed cases. However, American embassies in the \nEuropean Union, and possibly other countries, are not aware of these \nrestrictions related to its containment. Additionally, airport and \nairline personnel appear to be inadequately informed about the need for \ntravelers re-entering this country to take appropriate measures to \navoid introducing the disease to U.S. livestock or wildlife.\n  A constituent of mine recently reported that a visitor coming to \nSouth Dakota from France contacted the American Embassy there to \ninquire about potential restrictions prior to his trip, but was told \nthey knew of none. In fact, the state of South Dakota has banned visits \nto farms, sale barns and a list of other facilities for five days prior \nto travel, and contact with livestock or wildlife for five days after \narrival in the U.S. In another incident, two producers who were part of \na tour group returning from Ireland through Chicago O'Hare \nInternational Airport independently sought out disinfectant for their \nshoes and other belongs before returning to the state, after realizing \nthat no airport or airline personnel were requiring travelers to take \nany such precautions.\n  This week I have worked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto draft a bill to address these needs. Today, I join Senators Harkin \nand Hatch, and over 40 of our colleagues, to introduce The Animal \nDisease Risk Assessment Prevention and Control Act of 2001. The bill \nwould require USDA, in consultation with other relevant federal \nagencies, to submit what I think will be very valuable information to \nCongress, in the shortest time feasible.\n  First, the bill would require USDA to provide information about the \nAdministration's FMD and BSE prevention and control plan, including: 1. \nhow federal agencies are coordinating their activities on FMD and BSE; \n2. how federal agencies are communicating information on FMD and BSE to \nthe public; and 3. whether the Administration needs additional \nlegislative authority or funding to most appropriately manage the \nthreat that FMD, BSE, or related diseases may pose to human health, \nlivestock, or wildlife.\n  Second, the bill would require USDA to provide information relevant \nto a longer-term disease prevention and management strategy for \nreducing risks in the future, including: 1. The economic impacts \nassociated with the potential introduction of FMD, BSE, or related \ndiseases into the United States; 2. The potential risks to public and \nanimal health from FMD, BSE, and related diseases; and 3. \nrecommendations to protect the health of our animal herds and our \ncitizens from these risks, including, if necessary, recommendation for \nadditional legislative authority or funding.\n  One of the most important steps we can take to prevent the \nintroduction of FMD and BSE to the U.S. is also one of the simplest: \nimproved access to information. In addition to the actions USDA, FDA \nand other agencies are taking to control the diseases, it is imperative \nthat the State Department, the Department of Treasury, the Department \nof Transportation, the Department of Defense, and other agencies act \nimmediately to provide the best possible information to travelers, the \nmilitary, and others, including news of sanitation, travel \nrestrictions, and other precautions.\n  Again, I commend the actions USDA and other agencies to prevent the \nincidence of these diseases abroad from creating a crisis in the U.S. I \nthink we all appreciate the sensitivity of this issue, and that no one \ngains from exaggerating or misrepresenting potential risks in a \nsituation such as this. Neither would the U.S. benefit in the long run \nby limiting trade with other countries for reasons other than those \nthat are purely health and safety-related, and can be scientifically \nsubstantiated. At the same time, we have every right to protect the \nhealth of our domestic livestock industry in a pro-active and \ncomprehensive manner. To that end, I look forward to passing this \nlegislation quickly, so we can ensure that the Administration has the \ninformation and resources it needs to respond to this situation and to \nensure that the public is fully aware of the steps being taken on their \nbehalf.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3711-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3711-S3761]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS--APRIL 6, 2001\n\n      By Mr. BOND (for himself and Mr. Breaux):\n  S. 724. A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for coverage of pregnancy-related assistance for targeted low-\nincome pregnant women; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that I \nbelieve is vitally important to the health care of children and \npregnancy women in America. The goal of this legislation is simply, to \nmake sure more pregnancy women and more children are covered by health \ninsurance so they have access to the health care services they6 need to \nbe healthy.\n  The need is great, on any given day, approximately 11 million \nchildren and close to half a million pregnant women do not have health \ninsurance coverage. For many of these women and children, they or their \nfamily simply can't afford insurance, and lack of insurance often means \ninability to pay for care. The further tragedy is that quite a few are \nactually eligible for a public program like Medicaid or the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, but many of those don't know they \nare eligible and are not signed up.\n  Lack of health insurance can lead to numerous health problems, both \nfor children and for pregnant women. A child without health coverage is \nmuch less likely to receive the health care services that are needed to \nensure the child is healthy, happy, and fully able to learn and grow. \nAn uninsured pregnant woman is much less likely to get critical \nprenatal care that reduces the risk of health problems for both the \nwoman and the child. Babies whose mothers receive no prenatal care or \nlate prenatal care are at-risk for many health problems. including \nbirth defects, premature births, and low birth-weight.\n  The bill I am introducing deals with this insurance problem in two \nways.\n  First, it allows states to provide prenatal care for low-income \npregnant women under the State Children's Health Insurance Program--\nalso known as SCHIP--if the state chooses.\n  Through the joint federal-state SCHIP program, states are currently \nexpanding the availability of health insurance for low-income children. \nHowever, federal law prevents states from using SCHIP funds to provide \nprenatal care to low-income pregnant women over age 19, even though \nbabies born to many low-income women become eligible for SCHIP as soon \nas they are born.\n  Approximately 41,000 additional women could be covered for prenatal \ncare. There are literally billions of dollars of SCHIP funds that \nstates have not used yet, so I would hope that most states would choose \nthis option. This provision will not impact federal SCHIP expenditures \nbecause it does not change the existing federal spending caps for \nSCHIP. Babies born to pregnant women covered by a state's SCHIP program \nwould be automatically enrolled and receive immediate coverage under \nSCHIP themselves.\n\n  It is foolish to deny prenatal care to a pregnant mother and then, \nonly after the baby is born, provide the child with coverage under \nSCHIP. Prenatal care can be just as important to a newborn baby as \npostnatal care, and the prenatal care is of course important for the \nmother as well.\n  We know that states will be interested. Two states have already gone \nthrough the difficult Health Care Financing Administration waiver \nprocess to get permission to cover pregnant women through their SCHIP \nprograms. But you shouldn't have to get a waiver to do something that \nmakes so much sense. This bill will make it an automatic option that \nany state can do without the need of a waiver.\n  Second, the bill will help states reach out to women and children who \nare eligible for, but are not enrolled in, Medicaid or SCHIP. \nApproximately 340,000 pregnant women and several million children are \nestimated to be eligible for but not enrolled in Medicaid. Millions of \nadditional children are eligible for but not yet enrolled in SCHIP. We \nmust reach out to these people to make sure they know they have options \nwhich they are not using.\n  When Congress passed the welfare reform bill back in 1996, we created \na $500 million fund that states could tap into to make sure that all \nMedicaid-eligible\n\n[[Page S3712]]\n\npeople stayed in Medicaid. The problem is that only half of that fund \nhas been used. My bill would give states more flexibility to use this \nfund to reach out to both Medicaid and SCHIP-eligible women and \nchildren.\n  In addition, my bill tries to make greater use of what is known as \npresumptive eligibility. Under presumptive eligibility, states are \nallowed to temporarily enroll children whose family income appears to \nbe below Medicaid or SCHIP income standards, until a final \ndetermination of eligibility is made. This is useful because it allows \npeople to get health care services at the same time that they are \nwaiting, sometimes for as much as a month or two, for a final \neligibility determination.\n  Without presumptive eligibility, experience has shown that fewer \npeople will fill out the applications forms, and fewer people will be \nwilling to wait until a final decision is made. When it comes to trying \nto ensure that people get health care, we need to remove as many \nbarriers as possible. That is why presumptive eligibility is useful, it \nremoves a barrier.\n  Right now, states may grant presumptive eligibility for both pregnant \nwomen in Medicaid and for children in Medicaid and in SCHIP. Because my \nlegislation would allow pregnant women to be covered through SCHIP for \nthe first time, my bill also extends presumptive eligibility for \npregnant women into the SCHIP program. In addition, in legislation \npassed last December, Congress expanded the types of sites states can \nuse to grant presumptive eligibility for children to also include \nschools and other entities that states think will be able to identify \npeople eligible for these programs. However, we failed to give states \nthe ability to use these additional entities as sites to enroll \npregnant women. My bill would correct that omission.\n  The bottom line is that this bill will help provide health care to \nmore pregnant women. With hundreds of thousands of pregnant women \nlacking insurance, and with hundreds of thousands lacking adequate \nprenatal care, we are compelled to focus on this issue.\n  I believe this is crucial legislation, and urge my colleagues to join \nme in support of it so that we can pass this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 725. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to codify \nthe authority of the Secretary of the Treasury, to issue regulations \ncovering the practices of enrolled agents before the Internal Revenue \nService; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Enrolled \nAgent Credentials Protection Act. This legislation would make it clear \nthat Enrolled Agents have the right to use their federally granted \ncredentials, by making it clear that states shall not restrict enrolled \nagents from using the words ``Enrolled Agent'' or the abbreviations \n``EA'' and ``E.A.''\n  A number of states have enacted laws that restrict the right of \nEnrolled Agents to use their credentials or designations as Enrolled \nAgents. The Supreme Court has held in similar situations that because \nthe Federal Government grants the license, restricting its use is an \nunmerited exercise of state powers. This legislation is consistent with \nthe Uniform Accountancy Act, Third Edition, as drafted by the American \nInstitute of Certified Public Accountants and National Association of \nState Accountancy Boards.\n  Enrolled Agents have been providing valuable services to taxpayers \nsince 1884. Since that time, the profession has evolved and now \nincludes preparing and advising on tax returns for individuals, \npartnerships, corporations, estates, trusts and any entity with tax-\nreporting requirements. They also provide affordable representation to \nindividuals and small businesses with disputes before the Internal \nRevenue Service. At present, there are approximately 35,000 Enrolled \nAgents in the country providing practical and affordable tax service to \ntaxpayers.\n  Enrolled Agents are highly qualified tax professionals. While \ncertified public accountants and licensed attorneys also represent \ntaxpayers before the Internal Revenue Service, only Enrolled Agents are \nrequired to demonstrate to the IRS their technical competence in the \nfield of taxation. In order to maintain their status as Enrolled \nAgents, they must take 72 hours of continuing professional education, \nreported every three years to the IRS. Because Enrolled Agents focus on \nfederal taxes and tax administration, they are able to keep on the \nforefront of current changes in the law and regulations.\n  The Enrolled Agent designation dates to the Enabling Act of 1884 and \nthe profession is regulated by Treasury Circular 230, the same body of \nregulations that governs the practice of attorneys and certified public \naccountants before the Internal Revenue.\n  This bill would restate the statutory validation that Enrolled Agents \nhold and allow them the right to use their credentials as Enrolled \nAgents. In doing so, this bill does not add to the powers that Enrolled \nAgents currently maintain, nor would it affect the rules and \nregulations provided for in Treasury Circular 230.\n  Section 10.30 of Circular 230 authorizes Enrolled Agents to advertise \nand display their ability to practice before the IRS provided the \ndesignation is not misleading or deceptive to the public. Neither \nCongress nor the Treasury Department ever intended for states to \ninterfere with the right of Enrolled Agents to inform taxpayers that \nthey hold a license to practice before the Internal Revenue Service.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself, Mr. Thompson, Mr. Miller, Mr. \n        Cleland, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Bunning, and Mr. Frist):\n  S. 726. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the treatment of prepayments for natural gas; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today to \naddress a problem that has prevented municipal gas systems from using \ntheir tax exempt borrowing authority to obtain an assured, long-term \nsupply of competitively-priced natural gas. I am joined today by my \ncolleagues, Senators Thompson, Miller, Cleland, Landrieu, Shelby, \nBunning and Frist.\n  There are approximately 1,000 publicly owned gas distribution systems \nin the United States, the vast majority of which are located in small \ntowns and rural communities across my home state of Louisiana and \nacross the country. In 1993, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, \nFERC, restructured the natural gas industry so that municipal gas \nsystems could no longer purchase natural gas supplies on a reliable and \nregulated basis from interstate natural gas pipelines. This fundamental \nchange in the marketplace meant that for the first time municipal gas \nsystems had to acquire reliable gas supplies and transport on their own \nin a deregulated marketplace. In response, many formed joint action \nagencies--as contemplated in the FERC restructuring, to acquire and \nmanage the delivery of gas.\n  In today's turbulent natural gas markets, long-term prepaid supply \narrangements are the most reliable means of obtaining an assured supply \nof natural gas. To fund prepaid supply contracts, a municipality or a \njoint action agency issues tax-exempt bonds. These contracts contain \nstiff penalties if the supplier fails to fulfill its contract--making \nthis the most reliable gas supply that municipal gas agencies can \npurchase. The seller discounts the price for several reasons including \nthe fact that a prepaid contract eliminates the normal credit risk \nassociated with selling gas to non-rated governmental entities. \nMunicipal gas systems are able to obtain these firm gas supplies at \nmore competitive prices. Until August of 1999, joint action agencies \nentered into prepayment supply contracts with gas suppliers to obtain a \nlong-term, e.g., 10-year, supply of gas.\n  In August 1999, the IRS effectively prevented municipal gas systems \nfrom using their tax-exempt borrowing authority to fund the purchase of \nlong-term, prepaid supplies of natural gas for their citizens. In a \nstatement on an unrelated matter, the IRS questioned whether the \npurchase of a commodity, such as natural gas, under a prepaid contract \nfinanced by tax-exempt bonds has a principal purpose of earning an \ninvestment return. In this scenario, the bonds would run afoul of the \narbitrage rules of the Internal Revenue Code.\n  Confusion over the IRS' statement and fear of impending regulations \nhas\n\n[[Page S3713]]\n\nled to the effective elimination of an extremely effective method of \nsecuring natural gas for local communities. The IRS has yet to issue \nany clarification or guidance on this issue.\n  Under current law, tax-exempt bonds may not be used to raise proceeds \nthat are then used to acquire ``investment-type property'' having a \nhigher yield than the bonds. Governmental bonds that violate this \narbitrage restriction do not qualify for tax-exempt status. Treasury \nregulations provide that investment-type property includes certain \nprepayments for property or services ``if a principal purpose for \nprepaying is to receive an investment return.'' But, ``a prepayment \ndoes not give rise to investment-type property if . . . the prepayment \nis made for a substantial business purpose other than investment return \nand the issuer has no commercially reasonable alternative to the \nprepayment. . . .'' A nearly identical standard is used to determine \nwhether a prepayment transaction is treated as a loan for purposes of \nthe private loan-financing test. If a transaction is considered a \nprivate loan financing, the bonds are treated as private activity \nbonds. Although municipal gas systems clearly have a ``substantial \nbusiness purpose'' for entering into prepayment transactions and ``no \ncommercially reasonable alternative,'' the lack of clarification on \nthis IRS language has hampered the most efficient tool available to \npublic gas systems to secure long-term supplies of natural gas.\n  The bill does not overturn current law or any IRS regulations. It \nsimply clarifies the law, both with respect to the arbitrage rules and \nthe private loan financing rules, to allow an effective and reasonably-\npriced energy delivery system to continue unimpeded.\n  The United States is in the midst of an energy crisis. Natural gas \ndistribution systems are scrambling to obtain an assured supply of \nnatural gas, even while prices have skyrocketed in the last few months. \nThe ability of small communities to use their tax-exempt borrowing \nauthority to obtain a long-term, assured supply of competitively-priced \nnatural gas is essential. By clarifying current law, we provide a low-\ncost natural gas option for millions of Americans across the country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 726\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide grants for cardiopulmonary resuscitation \n(CPR) training in public schools; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining with my \ncolleague from Wisconsin, Senator Russ Feingold, in introducing the \nTeaching Children to Save Lives Act which will help train a generation \nof potential lifesavers by providing funding for programs to teach \nchildren the basic lifesaving skill of cardiopulmonary resuscitation, \nor CPR.\n  Approximately 220,000 Americans die each year of sudden cardiac \narrest. The American Heart Association estimates that about 50,000 of \nthese lives could be saved each year if more people implemented what it \ncalls the ``Chain of Survival,'' which includes an immediate call to \n911, early CPR and defibrillation, and early advanced life support. The \nTeaching Children to Save Lives Act, which we are introducing today, \nwill help strengthen the second link in this chain by providing grants \nto schools to implement CPR training programs. Schools could use these \nfunds to work in conjunction with community organizations such as local \nfire and police departments, hospitals, parent-teacher associations and \nothers to provide CPR training. The legislation authorizes $30 million \nover three years for the Department of Health and Human Services to \naward grants to States to support these community partnerships and to \nhelp schools train teachers and purchase materials such as mannequins. \nThose schools that are fortunate enough to have CPR programs will be \nable to apply for funding to help train students in the use of \nautomated external defibrillators, a life-saving device that shocks a \nheart back to its normal rhythm when it stops beating.\n  We have all heard stories about situations where a school age child \nor teenager has been the witness, perhaps the only witness, to a heart \nattack or other health emergency. Many kids, and adults for that \nmatter, simply don't know what to do in the face of such an emergency. \nGiven the proper training, however, our young people are perfectly \ncapable of responding to calmly and appropriately to a life-threatening \nsituation.\n  For example, the Red Cross in Maine recently honored Sara Boyorak, a \nstudent at Bangor High School, for her quick response when her 22-month \nold nephew Blake, suddenly stopped breathing. Sara was riding in the \ncar with Blake and her parents to a family get-together. It was a \nmiserably hot day and Blake was suffering from a terrible ear \ninfection. Sara was entertaining Blake in his car seat when he suddenly \nstopped responding to her. She then noticed that his face was turning a \nbluish color. Evidently, the heat of the day combined with the fever \nfrom his ear infection had caused Blake to stop breathing.\n  Sara had taken CPR in a Red Cross class at her school so she was \nprepared and knew just what to do. She immediately leaped into action \nand initiated the ``Chain of Survival.'' She directed her father to \nstop the car and her mother to call 911 on the cell phone. She then \nplaced Blake on the back seat of the car, and, when she had determined \nthat he was not breathing and had no pulse, she started performing CPR, \njust as she had learned in her class. As a consequence of her quick \naction, Blake regained consciousness before the ambulance arrived, and \nwill soon be celebrating his third birthday, thanks to his Aunt Sara.\n  The Teaching Children to Save Lives Act will enable more school \nchildren like Sara to learn the CPR skills they may need to save the \nlife of a family member or loved one. Moreover, teaching CPR to our \nchildren and teens will not only improve their confidence in responding \nto emergencies, but it will also encourage them to update and maintain \nthese skills into adulthood.\n  The Teaching Children to Save Lives Act is supported by coalition of \ngroups including the American Heart Association, the Red Cross, the \nNational Education Association, and the School Nurses Association, and \nI urge all of my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the legislation.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend and \ncolleague from Maine to introduce the ``Teaching Children to Save Lives \nAct.'' This legislation will help schools in their efforts to provide \nstudents with chain of survival training, including training in \ncardiopulmonary resuscitation, CPR, and in the use of Automated \nExternal Defibrillators, AEDs. It is vital that we support local and \ncommunity based efforts to equip younger generations\n\n[[Page S3714]]\n\nwith the necessary skills to deal with life-threatening cardiac \nemergencies.\n  Over two hundred twenty thousand Americans die each year of sudden \ncardiac arrest. About 50,000 of these victims lives could be saved each \nyear if more people implemented the ``Chain of Survival,'' which \nincludes an immediate call to 911, early CPR and defibrillation, and \nearly advanced life support. The Teaching Children to Save Lives Act \nwill help strengthen the second link in the Chain by providing grants \nto schools to implement CPR training programs and help some schools \ntrain their students in AED use.\n  In Wisconsin, we've seen many examples where a school age child or \nteenager is the first witness to a heart attack. Unfortunately, most \nkids would not know what to do in the face of such an emergency. As a \nmatter of fact, many adults wouldn't know what to do either. In \nresponse to this break in the chain of survival, a number of localities \nhave pushed for increased CPR training and public access to \ndefibrillation in schools.\n  In my home state of Wisconsin, a broad coalition including the \nChildren's Hospital of Wisconsin, the American Red Cross, the American \nHeart Association and the Children's Hospital Foundation created \nProject Adam in memory of a student who tragically collapsed and passed \naway while playing competitive sports. This legislation follows the \nlead of Project Adam, which fosters awareness of the potential for \nsudden cardiac arrest in the adolescent population and facilitates \ntraining of high school staff and students in CPR and in the use of \nAEDs.\n  The Teaching Children to Save Lives Act builds on these efforts by \nproviding funding to teach the basics of the chain of survival and \nprovide funding for AED training devices. This legislation also has \nsufficient flexibility to allow States and communities the ability to \naddress their local needs. For example, schools could either begin \ntheir efforts to teach the Chain of Survival by starting a CPR training \nprogram or build on existing efforts by applying for grants to train \nstudents to use automatic external defibrillators. As a result of \nProject Adam, at least one life has been saved so far and three other \nchildren have survived episodes because of early defibrillation.\n  Many of our schools lack the resources they need for basic health \neducational programs. This legislation would follow the lead of local \nefforts such as Project Adam and demonstrate that the Federal \ngovernment wants to be a partner in these lifesaving efforts.\n  I want to especially thank my friend from Maine, Senator Collins, who \nhas worked with me to improve the chain of survival across the United \nStates. Without her leadership last year on our legislation to improve \naccess to defibrillators in rural areas, we would not have been able to \nmove forward with legislation that will improve cardiac survival rates \nacross rural communities.\n  I hope my colleagues will join us in our continued efforts to improve \ncardiac arrest rates by working with us to pass this important \nlegislation to provide communities the support they need to effectively \nteach CPR in the schools.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KOHL (for himself, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 728. A bill to establish a demonstration project to waive certain \nnurse aide training requirements for specially trained individuals who \nperform certain specific tasks in nursing facilities participating in \nthe medicare or medicaid programs, and to conditionally authorize the \nuse of resident assistants in such nursing facilities; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare and \nMedicaid Nursing Services Quality Improvement Act. I am pleased to work \nwith Senators Dorgan and Conrad in this important effort to improve the \nquality of care in our nation's nursing homes.\n  This legislation serves two purposes. First, as part of an 8-State \ndemonstration project, it allows Wisconsin nursing homes to continue \nutilizing Resident Assistants, or ``single task employees'' as they are \nreferred to in Wisconsin, to help provide care to residents. Second, it \nprovides for a thorough evaluation of Resident Assistants to assess \ntheir impact on quality of care, as well as their impact on the \nrecruitment, retention, and salaries of other nursing staff.\n  For the past seven years, many nursing facilities in Wisconsin have \nbeen utilizing single task employees to help provide care to residents. \nSingle task employees have helped primarily with feeding and hydration \nservices and have provided often-needed extra assistance during the \nbusier mealtime hours. All single task employees must go through a \ntraining program. In many cases, those who perform these single tasks \nare already on staff serving in other non-nursing capacities.\n  Last year, the Health Care Financing Administration, HCFA, notified \nthe State of Wisconsin that the use of single task employees in nursing \nhomes was not permissible under Federal law. In particular, HCFA noted \nthat only staff who have undergone the required training to become a \nCertified Nurse Aide, CNA, may perform nursing-related tasks in \nMedicaid facilities. Therefore, faced with no other recourse, Wisconsin \nsubmitted and HCFA approved a plan to phase out the use of single task \nemployees by the end of 2001.\n  I am deeply concerned that the immediate removal of all single task \nemployees could worsen staffing shortages that many Wisconsin nursing \nhomes already face. A December, 2000 survey of 247 Wisconsin nursing \nhomes found that nearly 32 percent were currently suspending or \nrestricting admissions or had done so in the prior six months due to \ninadequate staffing.\n  I recognize that there are many factors that have contributed to \nstaffing shortages in Wisconsin and across the nation. I believe that \nwe need to look for long-term solutions to strengthen training and \nimprove staffing in nursing homes, and I am committed to working in \nthat effort. We must all work together to find ways to attract greater \nnumbers of qualified people to become CNAs, and ensure they receive the \nsupport, training and compensation they deserve for their hard work and \ndedication.\n  In the meantime, this legislation provides a short-term solution to \naddress the staffing shortages Wisconsin nursing homes face today. \nUnder the bill, Wisconsin would be one of 8 demonstration States and \ncould continue to use single task workers, referred to in the \nlegislation as ``Resident Assistants'' to account for differences in \nterminology between States. The information we obtain from these \nDemonstration States will help us evaluate the impact of Resident \nAssistants and provide us with valuable insight to improve the quality \nof nursing home care.\n  Because this is a Demonstration Project, this bill provides \nsafeguards to closely monitor the use of Resident Assistants. Under the \nbill, Resident Assistants would be limited to providing assistance with \nfeeding and hydration. All Resident Assistants would be required to go \nthrough a training program approved by the State. They must be trained \nin feeding and hydration skills, recognizing and alerting licensed \nstaff to the signs of malnutrition and dehydration, understanding the \naging and disease processes of the elderly, responding to choking \nemergencies and alerting licensed staff to other emergencies, taking \nprecautions to prevent the spread of disease, and residents' rights. In \naddition, all Resident Assistants must be supervised at all times by a \nlicensed health professional.\n  I also want to stress that this bill strictly prohibits nursing homes \nfrom replacing certified nursing staff with Resident Assistants, and \nResident Assistants may not be counted toward any minimum staffing \nrequirements that nursing homes are or could be required to meet. Let \nme be clear: Resident Assistants are not intended to serve as a \nsubstitute for the specialized care that nurse aides provide. They are \nintended to be utilized as supplemental help with feeding and hydration \nservices for residents, to provide an extra pair of hands at busier \nmealtimes, and to provide some assistance to nurse aides who are \nstretched so thin so they can focus on other critical nursing tasks.\n  Most importantly, let me reiterate that this is a time-limited \ndemonstration project. This legislation ensures that we collect \nreliable data on the use of Resident Assistants, which will be\n\n[[Page S3715]]\n\nanalyzed by an advisory panel made up of nursing home representatives, \nLong-Term Ombudsmen, State and Federal officials, consumer groups, and \nlabor representatives.\n  The advisory panel will look at a variety of factors to determine the \nimpact of the project, including: the effect on quality of care \ncompared to non-demonstration States, the effect on staffing levels and \nratios in nursing homes, the effect on recruitment, retention and \nsalaries of nursing aides, and resident satisfaction with feeding and \nhydration services.\n  The advisory panel will evaluate this data and submit recommendations \nto the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The \nSecretary will then submit a final report to Congress on the \ndemonstration. If the Secretary finds that the Demonstration project \nresulted in diminished quality of feeding and hydration services, or if \nrecruitment, retention, or salaries of nursing staff decreased as a \ndirect result of the use of Resident Assistants, then the demonstration \nproject would end and all nursing homes must cease using Resident \nAssistants. However, if the Secretary finds that the demonstration \nprojects were successful, only then may the Secretary expand the use of \nResident Assistants nationwide, but with the same safeguards as the \ndemonstration project. They would be limited to feeding and hydration \nservices, required to undergo comprehensive training and be supervised \nby licensed health professionals, and be subject to the same \nrequirement that they may only augment, not replace nursing staff.\n  This legislation will not only help stave off an even greater \nstaffing problem in Wisconsin today. It will also give us the \nopportunity to take a closer look at Resident Assistants so we can make \nan informed determination as to whether they can help improve the \nquality of care in our nation's nursing homes. Our nursing homes in \nWisconsin believe that Resident Assistants can be a valuable addition, \nand this bill will allow us to keep an open mind and look at all of the \nevidence in a thorough evaluation.\n  This legislation helps address the challenges we face today. At the \nsame time, let me reiterate that I am committed to working with my \ncolleagues to look for longer-term solutions to address staffing \nshortages in order to ensure quality nursing home care far into the \nfuture.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 728\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Foreign Service Buildings Act, 1926, to \nexpand eligibility for the award of construction contracts under that \nAct to persons that have performed similar construction work at United \nStates diplomatic or consular establishments abroad under contracts \nlimited to $5,000,000; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to improve \naccess for certain small businesses in competing for overseas \nconstruction contracts for the Department of State. Small businesses \nthat have been able to participate in smaller construction projects \noverseas, through one of the small business programs, would be able to \ncompete for larger construction contracts.\n  The effect of these changes is to enhance competition for these \ncontracts. Moreover, greater competition usually means reduced costs to \nthe taxpayer. Finally, these changes allow us to recoup the benefits \nfrom the Government programs directed at small business. We ensure \nthat, after helping businesses grow and develop in our small business \nprograms, they are then able to compete in the open market for \nGovernment construction contracts.\n  This is certainly the goal of these small business programs, but \nunfortunately a technical glitch currently prevents this goal from \nbeing realized in overseas State Department construction contracts. \nThis bill would correct that.\n  Specifically, these provisions would make a minor change to both the \nForeign Service Buildings Act, 1926, and the Omnibus Diplomatic \nSecurity and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, both of which impose related \nrestrictions on the firms that may do construction of overseas State \nDepartment facilities. Most of the restrictions are security-related \nand have to do with ensuring the firms are American in their ownership, \ncontrol, and workforce. Some other provisions seek to ensure they have \nthe technical capacity actually to perform the work.\n  One provision directed at the ``technical capacity'' issue says the \nfirms must have performed work, comparable to the work they are \nseeking, in the United States. The legislative history makes clear that \nthis particular restriction is in the law solely as an issue of past \nperformance, not as a security matter. Since these measures passed, a \nsmall number of firms participating in small business programs have \ndone work exclusively overseas, including work on State Department \ndiplomatic and consular establishments. They therefore have a \ndemonstrated past performance ability to do the work, but the two laws \nabove currently exclude them from doing so in State Department \ncontracts over $5 million. (They were previously able to participate \nbecause the sole source contracts under a couple of small business \nprograms are limited to $3 million, so the restrictions in these two \nlaws did not come into play.)\n  The bottom line here is that we have small business programs intended \nto give firms the opportunity to show what they can do and to help \nexpand the Government's vendor base. However, once these firms move \nbeyond the small business program or seek to compete for larger \ncontracts, we have these two laws that exclude firms who have \ndemonstrated the ability to do overseas construction, simply because \nthey have not done work domestically. This is a waste of the \nGovernment's investment in their business development. This bill would \nallow overseas work done specifically at State Department installations \nto count in showing their capacity to perform subsequent contracts.\n  This is a relatively simple change that will increase opportunity and \nhelp the State Department maintain a strong contractor base to do this \nimportant construction work. It should be noncontroversial, and I look \nforward to working with the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Foreign \nRelations Committee to make these changes happen.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 734\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 811 South Main Street in Yerington, Nevada, as the \n``Joseph E. Dini, Jr. Post Office''; to the Committee on Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today along with my colleague from \nNevada, Senator Ensign, as well as the Nevada delegation in the House \nof Representatives, to introduce legislation designating the United \nStates Post Office facility located at 811 Main Street in Yerington, \nNV, as the ``Joseph E. Dini, Jr. Post Office.''\n  When the Nevada State Legislature opened its 71st session earlier \nthis year, something was very different. For the first time in more \nthan sixteen years, Joe Dini was not the Speaker of the Assembly. For \nan unparalleled eight times, Joe Dini was elected Speaker by his peers \nin the Nevada State Assembly. Now the Speaker Emeritus, Joe Dini is in \nhis eighteenth term representing his beloved home town of Yerington, \nNV, and is the longest serving Member in the history of the Nevada \nState Assembly.\n  Joe Dini was born and raised in the small town of Yerington, NV. Many \nof my colleagues in the Senate have heard me talk about my hometown of \nSearchlight at the southern tip of the State of Nevada. As much as I \nlove Searchlight, Joe Dini adores his beloved hometown of Yerington. A \nnative Nevada, Joe attended the University of Nevada in Reno and was \nfirst elected to the Nevada State Assembly in 1966. As a freshman \nelected to the Assembly in 1969, I had the pleasure to work with Joe \nDini, and I looked to him as a mentor and a friend. In 1973, he became \nSpeaker pro tempore of the Chamber, and in 1975 he was elected majority \nleader. During his tenure, Joe became the leading authority in the \nlegislature on western water issues, a subject that is vitally \nimportant to our state, especially in the many rural communities \nthroughout Nevada.\n  Joe is also an active participant with many community service \norganizations in Yerington and throughout Nevada. He is a member of the \nYerington Rotary Club and the Yerington Volunteer Fire Department, and \nhas been recognized by a variety of groups such as the Nevada State \nFirefighters Association, the Nevada Wildlife Federation, the Nevada \nState Education Association and the Nevada Judges Association. The \nKiwanis Club in Yerington has also recognized Joe Dini as its Man of \nthe Year.\n  It is a pleasure and honor to join my colleagues from Nevada in \nintroducing this bill naming the post office on Main Street in his \nbeloved hometown of Yerington, Nevada, after Joseph E. Dini, Jr. By \nrecognizing his dedication to a career in public service, we are also \nthanking Joe for a life-long commitment to the people and the State of \nNevada.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 737\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. JOSEPH E. DINI, JR. POST OFFICE.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal \n     Service located at 811 South Main Street in Yerington, \n     Nevada, shall be known and designated as the ``Joseph E. \n     Dini, Jr. Post Office''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be \n     a reference to the Joseph E. Dini, Jr. Post Office.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today in order to join my colleague \nSenator Reid and other members of the Nevada Delegation in introducing \na bill that would designate the U.S. Post Office facility located at \n811 Main Street in Yerington, as the ``Joseph E. Dini, Jr. Post \nOffice.''\n  Jospeh Deni was born and raised in Yerington, Nevada. As a native \nNevadan, Joe has passionately served the interests of Western Nevadans \nin the State Assembly for over thirty years. His tenure as the longest-\nserving assemblyman in Nevada's history includes a record eight terms \nas Speaker. In 1995, Joe was a co-Speaker over an evenly divided State \nAssembly, and it was his effective leadership that allowed the \nLegislature to maintain its productivity and pass sweeping reforms to \nNevada's criminal justice system.\n  In addition to his service to Nevada as a legislator, Joe has been \nextremely active in a number of community service organizations. \nSpecifically, he serves as a member of the Yerington Rotary Club and \nhas been involved with the Yerington Volunteer Fire Department. Joe has \nalso received special recognition awards from such groups as the Nevada \nState Firefighters Association, Nevada Farm Bureau, Nevada Judges \nAssociation, Nevada Education Association and the Yerington Kiwanis \nClub.\n  Joe embodies the best in public service and bipartisanship, and is \nadmired throughout Nevada as a valuable mentor and leader. Joe spent \nthe last three decades working tirelessly and behind the scenes for our \nState. All Nevadans will be proud to have a post office named after a \nman who has committed his life to public service.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire:\n  S. 738. A bill to amend the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to protect the \nvoting rights of members of the Armed Forces; to the Committee on Rules \nand Administration.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise to offer the Armed \nForces Voting Rights Act of 2001. There is a problem with federal law \nthat allowed members of the armed forces to be disenfranchised in \nFlorida in the most recent presidential election. My bill would stop \nthe discrimination.\n  Over time, federal law has recognized more and more rights for our \nmilitary personnel that serve overseas. Several federal laws have been \nenacted since 1942 to enable those in the military and U.S. citizens \nwho live abroad to vote in federal elections. The Soldier Voting Act of \n1942 was the first attempt to guarantee federal voting rights for \nmembers of the armed forces and that law only applied during wartime. \nMembers of the armed forces were provided the use of a postage free, \nfederal post card application to request an absentee ballot. This law \nexpired once World War II ended and the law never actually was in \neffect.\n  In 1955, Congress passed the Federal Voting Assistance Act which \nrecommended, but did not guarantee, absentee registration and voting \nfor members of the military, federal employees who lived outside the \nU.S. and members of civilian service organization affiliated with the \narmed forces.\n  Federal law was again amended in 1968 to include a more general \nprovision for U.S. citizens temporarily residing outside the U.S. Seven \nyears later,\n\n[[Page S3719]]\n\nthe Overseas Citizens Voting Rights Act of 1975 guaranteed absentee \nregistration and voting rights for citizens outside the U.S., whether \nor not they maintained a U.S. residence.\n  In 1986, President Reagan signed the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens \nVoting Act which required States to permit absent uniformed services \nvoters, their spouses and dependents, and overseas voters who no longer \nmaintain a residence in the U.S. to register absentee and vote by \nabsentee ballot in all elections for federal office.\n  Federal law failed our military men and women in the last election, \nbecause many of these military voters were disenfranchised by \ncanvassing boards throughout the State of Florida. My bill fixes \nfederal law to prevent discrimination against military voters stationed \noverseas.\n  It was a disgrace to our military men and women the events in Florida \nlast fall. 1,500 overseas ballots were thrown out by Florida election \nofficials initially--1,500 ballots were challenged--that is disturbing.\n  Brave members of our armed forces spoke out in favor of having their \nvote counted. In Tallahassee, FL, in November of 2000, Robert Ingram, \nwho was awarded a medal for heroism as a Navy corpsman serving with the \nMarines in Vietnam, said about Florida elections boards, ``They need to \ncount the votes for service people abroad.'' It truly is an outrage \nthat the state of Florida allowed military ballots to be disqualified.\n\n  Morale is traditionally low for our servicemen and women stationed \noverseas during the Christmas season. Gary Littrell a Medal of Honor \nwinner said, ``Can you imagine how low their moral will go when we tell \nthem their vote didn't count?'' According to the Miami Herald of \nNovember 26, 2000, ``Many canvassing boards have said, however they \nfollowed state law to the letter in disqualifying overseas ballots with \nno signature, no witness, incorrect address, no postmark or date and a \nvariety of other problems.''\n  Note that the Miami Herald does not cite actual fraud to disqualify \n1,500 votes, mere technicalities in state law. My bill will fix this \nproblem and not allow a ballot to be disqualified without ``evidence of \nfraud.''\n  There were allegations that the Democrat party had a coordinated \neffort to disenfranchise our military voters. Former Montana Governor \nMark Racicot said last fall, ``In an effort to win at any cost, the \nvice president's lawyers launched a statewide effort to throw out as \nmany military ballots as they can.'' 40 percent of the 3,500 overseas \nballots in Florida were thrown out in November of 2000 for technical \nreasons--that is 40 percent too much.\n  According to the Miami Herald, 39 felons illegally cast absentee \nballots in Broward and Miami Dade counties during the election, yet \n1,500 military men and women had their votes challenged. These felons \nconvictions ranged from murder to rape and drunk driving. What crime \ndid our military personnel commit? Is it a crime for the members of the \nmilitary who chose to vote Republican? Is it a crime to volunteer to \nserve in the military? I guess every vote must count except for our \nmilitary votes.\n  Military ballots in Florida were disqualified for two reasons--the \nrequirement that ballots must be postmarked by election day and failure \nto either have a proper signature or date on the actual ballot. Neither \nof these issues are currently addressed in the federal law. Federal law \nleaves such details to the state, such as postmark requirements and \nauthentication of ballots.\n  I have a bill to amend the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to include \nmembers of the armed forces who were targeted as a result of their \npropensity to vote for Republicans.\n  My bill establishes voting rights for members of the armed forces to \ninsure that every military vote is counted. My bill makes it a \nviolation of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 for any person ``to \ndisqualify, refuse to count, or otherwise negate the absentee or \noverseas vote of a member of the Armed Forces of the United States.''\n  A person could not disqualify a ballot because of ``circumstances \nbeyond the control of the serviceman,'' this definition includes a post \nmark that may not be present on a military person's ballot. The \nmilitary frequently mail without postage and there is no necessity for \na post mark on military mail, therefore there is no evidence on the \nface of an envelope to prove when a letter, or ballot in this case, is \nmailed.\n  My bill further forbids the disqualification of any ballot without \n``clear and convincing evidence of fraud in the preparation or casting \nof the ballot by the voter'' deadlines for returning ballots vary by \nstate.\n  If you violate or conspire to violate the Armed Forces Voting Rights \nAct of 2001, then you are treated similarly to individuals who violate \nthe Voting Rights Act of 1965--you are subject to fines and other \ncriminal penalties. My bill also empowers the Attorney General to make \nrules consistent with this legislation.\n  I ask that voting rights be restored to our military voters--it is \nthe least that we can do for those who put their lives on the line so \nwe may live free, to allow our military men and women to have every \nvote counted.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Dayton, Ms. \n        Stabenow, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Durbin, Ms. Landrieu, \n        Mr. Daschle, Mr. Reid, and Mr. Johnson):\n  S. 739. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve \nprograms for homeless veterans, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Heather \nFrench Henry Homeless Veterans Assistance Act.'' It is a companion bill \nto H.R. 936, introduced in the House of Representatives by \nRepresentative Evans. I am pleased to have the support of the following \noriginal cosponsors: Senators Murray, Dayton, Stabenow, Dorgan, \nKennedy, Durbin, Landrieu, Daschle, Reid, and Johnson.\n  The legislation is named to recognize and honor the outstanding \ncontributions of Heather French Henry, Miss America 2000. She has \nhelped lead the struggle to end homelessness affecting more than \n300,000 of our nation's veterans. For more than a year, she has given \nher time, talents and energy to call on Americans to do more to free \nthose who have served our country from homelessness. She has traveled \nfrom coast-to-coast with the message that we as a nation are duty-bound \nto assist homeless veterans again to become productive and contributing \nmembers of society.\n  I recently met Ms. French Henry. I appreciate her work, as well as \nher support for this bill. She has called it, ``a comprehensive package \nof proposals that will lead to ending homelessness among our nation's \nveterans so that they can once again be proud citizens.''\n  The bill establishes a national goal of ending homelessness among \nveterans within a decade. We can and must meet this goal, but achieving \nit will not be easy. According to the ``Independent Budget'' for Fiscal \nYear 2002, more than 275,000 veterans are homeless on any given night. \nThe Independent Budget is a highly regarded analysis issued by four \nrespected veterans organizations, AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, \nParalyzed Veterans of America, and Veterans of Foreign Wars. The \nIndependent Budget also found that, ``one out of three homeless males . \n. . sleeping in a doorway, alley or box in our cities and rural \ncommunities has put on a uniform and served our nation.'' Finally, it \nstressed that two-thirds of homeless veterans served our nation for at \nleast three years. The vast majority of homeless veterans fully honored \ntheir oath to defend and protect the United States. Unfortunately, we \nhaven't fully honored our obligation to rescue them from the \ndegradation and privations of life on the streets.\n  The causes of homelessness are complex. But the primary reason so \nmany veterans are homeless is simple. We have not done enough. Since \n1987, the VA has run some worthwhile and effective programs for \nhomeless veterans, but they are too few, and they are too poorly \nfunded. In FY 2000, the VA spent about $150 million for homeless \nprograms, just $1.31 per homeless veteran per day. According to the \nIndependent Budget, federal funding for homeless veterans serves just \none in 10 of those in need.\n  The VA has reported that there were about 345,000 homeless veterans \nduring 1999. That is 34 percent higher than in\n\n[[Page S3720]]\n\n1998, a national scandal during a time of prosperity. If we fail to \npass this bill, imagine how many more homeless veterans will be \nsleeping in doorways, in boxes and on grates in the cold? Who will care \nfor these veterans if we have a prolonged economic downturn?\n\n  Three ideas should be kept in mind regarding the bill. First, it does \nnot give homeless veterans a handout. It gives them a hand-up, a hand-\nup they need to help restore dignity and self-worth. Second, ending \nveterans homelessness is first and foremost a moral issue. What kind of \nnation can fail to use the full arsenal of programs and tools available \nto end pain and suffering among men and women who have served so much \nand so well? Finally, homelessness among veterans is often tied to \nthose veterans' military service. It is frequently no less service-\nconnected than the loss of limb in battle. Post-Traumatic Stress \nDisorder, PTSD, can afflict any combat veteran. It not only can cause \nsevere mental health problems, but is also linked to job loss, family \nbreakdown, substance abuse and, of course, homelessness.\n  The VA can't solve the problem of homelessness among veterans by \nitself. That is why the bill creates a coordinated and cooperative \neffort among the VA and other federal, state and local agencies, as \nwell as by community-based organizations.\n  The legislation includes both proven programs and innovations. It \nexpands programs that have superior track records in assisting homeless \nveterans. It will increase to $50 million the annual authorization for \nthe Department of Labor's Homeless Veterans Reintegration Project \n(HVRP). HVRP funds state or local governments, as well as nonprofit \norganizations, which run highly effective job training and placement \nprograms. It is an exceptional program that has gone under-funded for \nyears. In FY 1999, HVRP placed almost 2,200 homeless veterans in jobs, \nwith an average cost per placement of only about $1,300.\n  Mental health professionals agree that placement in the community can \nwork, but only with careful monitoring and support of vulnerable \npopulations. The bill therefore also creates incentives for VA to make \nsuch services, Mental Health Community Management programs, more widely \navailable.\n  Supportive, therapeutic housing is an essential component of a \nhomeless veteran's recovery from substance abuse. ``Safe havens'' \nprovide an environment that facilitates the transition from \nhomelessness. Under the bill, many more veterans could receive \nintensive medical and psychological treatment, as well as \nrehabilitation, in such residential settings.\n  More VA Comprehensive Homeless Centers must be made available in the \ncountry's major metropolitan areas. These unique centers provide a \ncontinuum of care that includes outreach, medical care, compensated \nwork therapy, job counseling and other social services. Homeless \nveterans not only can gain access to VA services, but also to services \nprovided by other federal agencies, state and local government \nentities, and community-based organizations. The centers provide badly \nneeded ``one-stop shopping'' for services to homeless veterans.\n  The legislation will increase availability of residential treatment \nfacilities by requiring the VA to develop new domiciliary programs in \nthe 10 largest metropolitan areas without existing programs. At the \nsame time, it will remove the cap on VA Comprehensive Homeless Centers. \nToday there are only eight, and the bill will require that centers be \navailable in no fewer than 20 metropolitan areas. Veterans in \nWashington, D.C., for example, currently have neither a VA domiciliary \nnor a Comprehensive Homeless Center. Both such facilities are needed \nhere in the Nation's Capital.\n  Community-based organizations play a pivotal role in addressing \nveterans' homelessness. The bill authorizes additional funding for \ntheir work through the VA's Homeless Grant and Per Diem Providers \nprogram. That program provides critical support to community-based \norganizations who furnish transitional services to homeless veterans \nthrough grants that supplement local, state and private funding.\n  The bill also requires that the VA provide mental health services \nwherever it provides primary care. Approximately 45 percent of homeless \nveterans suffer from mental illness. More than 70 percent suffer from \nalcohol or other substance abuse problems. It is vital that VA expand \naccess to mental health services.\n  Finally, the bill seeks to help some of the most vulnerable homeless \nveterans and those most at risk of homelessness. Under the bill, VA and \ncommunity-based providers will be eligible for a new grant program that \naddresses the special needs of homeless veterans who are women, \nsubstance abusers, 50 years of age or older, persons with PTSD, \nterminally ill, chronically mentally ill or who have dependents. It \nwill require VA to coordinate a multi-agency outreach plan and a \nprogram for veterans at risk of homelessness, particularly veterans \nbeing discharged from institutions. This includes people discharged \nfrom inpatient psychiatric care, substance abuse treatment programs and \npenal institutions.\n  It is a familiar principle among veterans of our armed forces not to \n``leave our wounded behind.'' Yet, homeless veterans are in a sense our \nwounded, and we are leaving them behind. It is past time to end this \nneglect.\n  The bill is supported by the country's major veterans organizations. \nIt is endorsed by the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans and its \nhundreds of affiliated organizations throughout the country who daily \nfurnish essential services to homeless veterans. I ask consent that \nletters of support from the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the Veterans \nof Foreign Wars, the Disabled American Veterans, and the National \nCoalition for Homeless Veterans be printed in the Record.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 739\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Although veterans constitute only 13 \n     percent of the general male population, 23 percent of the \n     homeless male population are veterans.\n       (4) Homelessness among veterans is persistent despite \n     unprecedented economic growth and job creation and general \n     prosperity.\n       (5) While there are many effective programs that assist \n     homeless veterans to again become productive and self-\n     sufficient members of society, current resources provided to \n     such programs and other activities that assist homeless \n     veterans are inadequate to provide all needed essential \n     services, assistance, and support to homeless veterans.\n\n[[Page S3721]]\n\n       (6) If current programs to assist homeless veterans are \n     fully maintained but not expanded, veterans will experience \n     as many as a billion nights of homelessness during the next \n     decade.\n       (7) The CHALENG assessment referred to in paragraph (2) \n     reports--\n       (A) that Department of Veterans Affairs and community \n     providers were responsible for establishing almost 500 beds \n     for homeless veterans during 2000, including emergency, \n     transitional, and permanent beds; and\n       (B) that there is a need for about 45,724 additional beds \n     to meet current needs of homeless veterans.\n       (8) As of February 28, 2001, the Congressional Budget \n     Office forecasts a Federal budget surplus of $313,000,000,000 \n     for fiscal year 2002 and budget surpluses totaling more than \n     $5,610,000,000,000 over the next 10 years.\n       (9) At least $750,000,000 will be required to establish the \n     45,724 additional new beds now needed by homeless veterans, \n     according to an informal Department of Veterans Affairs cost \n     estimate.\n       (10) Even if the Department of Veterans Affairs and its \n     partners created 2,000 additional beds per year for homeless \n     veterans (roughly quadrupling the number of such beds they \n     currently plan to open annually), it would still take more \n     than two decades to provide the necessary additional beds to \n     meet the current needs of homeless veterans.\n       (11) Nearly four decades ago, the Nation established a goal \n     of sending a man to the moon and returning him safely to \n     earth within a decade and accomplished that goal, and the \n     Nation can do no less to end homelessness among the Nation's \n     veterans.\n       (b) Definitions.--For purposes of this Act:\n       (1) The term ``homeless veteran'' means a veteran who--\n       (A) lacks a fixed, regular, and adequate nighttime \n     residence; or\n       (B) has a primary nighttime residence that is--\n       (i) a supervised publicly or privately operated shelter \n     designed to provide temporary living accommodations \n     (including welfare hotels, congregate shelters, grant per \n     diem shelters and transitional housing for the mentally ill);\n       (ii) an institution that provides a temporary residence for \n     individuals intended to be institutionalized; or\n       (iii) a public or private place not designed for, or \n     ordinarily used as, a regular sleeping accommodation for \n     human beings.\n       (2) The term ``grant and per diem provider'' means an \n     entity in receipt of a grant under section 3 or 4 of the \n     Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Service Programs Act of 1992 \n     (38 U.S.C. 7721 note).\n\n     SEC. 3. NATIONAL GOAL TO END HOMELESSNESS AMONG VETERANS.\n\n       (a) National Goal.--Congress hereby declares it to be a \n     national goal to end homelessness among veterans within a \n     decade.\n       (b) Cooperative Efforts Encouraged.--Congress hereby \n     encourages all departments and agencies of Federal, State, \n     and local governments, quasi-governmental organizations, \n     private and public sector entities, including community-based \n     organizations, and individuals to work cooperatively to end \n     homelessness among veterans within a decade.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Paul D. Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: On behalf of the more than one \n     million members of the Disabled American Veterans (DAV), I \n     urge you to co-sponsor and actively support the Heather \n     French Henry Homeless Veterans Assistance Act soon to be \n     introduced by Senator Paul Wellstone (D-MN).\n       This important legislation is aimed at ending homelessness \n     among veterans by encouraging alliances between federal, \n     state, and local governments, and private and public sector \n     entities to address the homeless issue and by providing \n     necessary resources to combat homelessness. Veterans who are \n     homeless deserve a better deal than they are currently \n     receiving from our government. This bill is an important key \n     to ending this national shame.\n       As an organization committed to service, one of the DAV's \n     top priorities is to help America's homeless veterans break \n     the cycle of poverty and isolation, and move from the streets \n     to self-sufficiency. Like any other problem, we can choose \n     whether we will allow former defenders of our nation to be \n     defeated by the tragedy of homelessness. Or we can decide to \n     do something about it, to combine our efforts and strengthen \n     our ability to assist these veterans. ``We Don't Leave our \n     Wounded Behind'' is more than a clever slogan. It is a \n     principle, a rule, and a promise we need to keep. This is the \n     time to tap our hidden resources and strengths.\n       I encourage you to co-sponsor and support this important \n     legislation. I appreciate your prompt attention to this \n     matter when Senator Wellstone calls upon you to co-sponsor \n     this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Armando C. Albarran,\n     National Commander.\n                                  ____\n\n                                            National Coalition for\n\n\n                                            Homeless Veterans,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2001.\n\n                           Support Statement\n\n       As the first Miss America of the new millennium Heather \n     French Henry chose to do so as a bold spokesperson and \n     advocate for our nation's homeless veterans. She dedicated, \n     not just a year of service, but also her life to creating \n     unprecedented awareness surrounding this issue.\n       No single individual or group of individuals has been able \n     to bring the homeless veteran issue to the national forefront \n     like Heather French Henry. From the halls of Congress, to \n     homeless shelters, and to communities across America, Heather \n     has mobilized individuals to become involved on a single \n     goal, ending homelessness among America's veterans.\n       Her sincere dedication and can do attitude has touched \n     hundreds of lives literally and figuratively, as she has \n     spoken out to advocate for our nation's veterans.\n       The National Coalition for Homeless Veterans sincerely \n     appreciates Heather French Henry's continued commitment to \n     this issue, after the glow of the crown has started to fade.\n       We also commend the commitment Senator Paul Wellstone has \n     made for many years on the homeless veteran issue. He has \n     been a consistent, outspoken leader in developing and \n     implementing public laws that have brought more Federal \n     resources into community organizations serving homeless \n     veterans.\n       Senator Wellstone's introduction of the ``Heather French \n     Henry Homeless Veteran Assistance Act'', a companion to the \n     (H.R. 936) bill introduced in the House by representative \n     Lane Evans (D-IL), is timely because it takes advantage of \n     the unique information collection that was done by Ms. Henry \n     during her travels and visits with veterans and communities, \n     and applies it in the solutions outlined in the bill.\n       Our expectation is this bill will become the platform to \n     address homeless veteran issues in the 107th Congress and we \n     look forward to a continued active relationship with Ms. \n     Henry and Senator Wellstone towards the goal of ending \n     homelessness among our nation's veterans.\n                                  ____\n\n                                          Veterans of Foreign Wars\n\n\n                                         of the United States,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 7, 2001.\n     Hon. Paul Wellstone,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: On behalf of the Veterans of \n     Foreign Wars of the United States, I would like to take this \n     opportunity to express our enthusiastic support of the \n     Heather French Henry Homeless Veterans Assistance Act.\n       With at least 275,000 veterans homeless on any given night \n     and more than 500,000 veterans homeless at some point during \n     the year, the obvious need for assistance and community-based \n     intervention is of paramount importance. Your bill recognizes \n     the need to expand existing programs, incorporate new \n     partnerships, and provide short-term assistance to the men \n     and women who have served our nation in uniform. It genuinely \n     embraces our shared goal of ending homelessness among our \n     nation's veterans.\n       Through your legislative efforts we can work together to \n     remedy this American tragedy.\n       Thank you for your service to America's veterans and please \n     do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of further \n     assistance.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Robert E.

Paul Wellstone,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wellstone: On behalf of the members of the \n     Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA) I am writing to thank you \n     for your support of the many veterans who face the trauma of \n     homelessness. We applaud your planned introduction of the \n     ``Heather French Henry Homeless Veterans Assistance Act'' to \n     help correct this horrible testament to one of the ongoing \n     ravages of war.\n       As you are aware, on any given night, an estimated 250,000 \n     homeless veterans sleep in cardboard boxes, in alleys or on \n     subway grates. Many of these individuals suffer from Post-\n     Traumatic Stress Disorder and other illnesses that prevent \n     them from getting and keeping employment, often a precursor \n     to homelessness. We thank former Miss America Heather French \n     Henry for making ``help for homeless veterans'' her platform \n     and committing herself to insuring these veterans are not \n     forgotten.\n       Homelessness does not have an easy fix. Only through \n     dedicated efforts can it be reduced. Our veterans deserve \n     those efforts. PVA wholeheartedly supports your proposed \n     legislation. From sensible calculations of per diems to an \n     increased focus on women and special needs veterans, this \n     legislation will apply new approaches to caring for our \n     veterans.\n       We all have a moral obligation to provide care to those \n     veterans who are most vulnerable. Homelessness can be \n     reduced, and Senator Wellstone, your legislation will mark a \n     big step in the right direction.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Joseph L. Fox, Sr.,\n                                               National President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Graham, Mr. Hatch, \n        Mr. Breaux, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Torricelli, Mr. Kyl, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Johnson, \n        Mr. Hagel, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Hutchison, \n        Mr. Bayh, Mr. Chafee, and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 742. A bill to provide for pension reform, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senators Baucus, \nGraham, Hatch, Breaux, Murkowski, Kerry, Jeffords, Torricelli, Kyl, \nLincoln, Hutchinson, Johnson, Hagel, Durbin, Gregg, Schumer, Hutchison, \nBayh, Chafee, and Reid to introduce bipartisan legislation intended to \nhelp Americans build a more secure retirement. Many of these members, \nsuch as Senator Graham, Hatch, Breaux, and Jeffords have been engaged \nin pension reform issues for many years. Others bring new energy to the \npension reform debate. I want to take a moment to thank them all for \ntheir hard work and enthusiasm in this bipartisan effort.\n  For five years now, Senate Finance Committee has worked on this \ncomprehensive pension reform legislation. In the last Congress, we came \nvery close to enacting it into law. For example, the Finance Committee \nunanimously reported out the bill in early September 2000. While our \nbill was not considered on the floor, my colleagues and I are not \ndiscouraged. We have built on the work from the last five years in \ncrafting the Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2001.\n  Many baby boomers will enter retirement ill prepared for the \npotentially high costs of supporting themselves. Inflation alone can \nsiphon money from a fixed income, reducing a retiree's standard of \nliving. So it is important to have a considerable sum saved for one's \npostemployment years. A fixed income for a worker who retires today \nwill have half the purchasing power 20 years from now, assuming the \nhistorical average rate of inflation of 3.25 percent. Having adequate \nretirement savings can protect against inflation and other unexpected \ncosts. Savings rates are at an historical low, but this bill will \nprovide the incentives individuals need to boost their savings rates.\n  The Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2001 has six titles: \nindividual retirement arrangements; expanding coverage; enhancing \nfairness for women and families; increasing portability for \nparticipants; strengthening pension security and enforcement; and \nreducing regulatory burdens. Let me highlight a few provisions from \neach title.\n  The limit on annual contributions to an IRA has not increased in \ntwenty years. If the contribution limit kept up with inflation, \nindividuals would now be able to contribute around $5000 to an IRA each \nyear. Our bill would increase the maximum contribution limit from $2000 \nto $5000 and adjust that limit for inflation.\n  The Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2001 would also eliminate \nthe marriage penalty applicable to contributions to a Roth IRA. The \nincome limits for contributing would now be increased so that the \napplicable limit for married couples is twice the limit for single \ntaxpayers.\n  The Small Business Administration reports that, small businesses \nemploy 52 percent of the private sector labor force. An amazing 75 \npercent of new jobs are created by small businesses. Yet less than 20 \npercent of small business employees are covered by a retirement plan of \nany kind. By contrast, approximately 70 percent of employees who work \nfor larger firms are offered a retirement plan. We work to address this \ndisparity in the bill by making pension plans more attractive to \nbusiness owners. The limitations on annual contributions to 401(k) \nplans would increase from $10,500 to $15,000. The SIMPLE limit would \nincrease to $10,000. We know that pension plans are bought and not \nsold. In a voluntary system such as ours, retirement plans must be \nattractive to the business owner in order for him or her to establish a \nplan in the first place and maintain it over many years. These higher \nlimits help to make qualified plans more attractive, relative to non-\nqualified plans. When a business establishes a qualified plan, workers \nbenefit, as well as business owners.\n  The bill would also help defray the administrative costs of setting \nup a retirement plan by offering a partial tax credit of the costs \nassociated with starting a plan. Furthermore, the bill would provide an \nadditional credit for small business employers who make an employer \ncontribution to the new retirement plan for the benefit of non-highly \ncompensated employees. These credits have the potential to expand \ncoverage among small businesses and we hope they will help us to \naccomplish that objective.\n  This bill also encourages lower or middle income individuals, to save \nfor their retirement by establishing a retirement savings tax credit. \nThis non-refundable credit will be equal to 50 percent of up to $2000 \nin contributions for a married couple with an income up to $30,000, and \n$15,000 for an individual taxpayer. Our goal with this provision is get \npeople, especially young people, in the habit of saving.\n  The Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2001 would encourage small \nbusinesses to start a retirement plan for their employees by \neliminating unnecessary administrative complexity in the top heavy \nrules. Top heavy rules that apply only to small businesses and, \naccording to an Employee Benefits Research Institute, EBRI, survey, are \nthe number one regulatory reason why small business owners do not start \na pension. While the language in this bill may not go as far as many \nwould like, the changes we have made are a step in the right direction.\n  Women tend to be somewhat more at risk of living in poverty as they \nage. There are many causes for this trend. For example, women may have \nbreaks in service to care for young children or for elderly family \nmembers. Consequently, we hope this legislation will help women workers \nmore saving options despite periodic departures from the paid \nworkforce.\n  The Retirement Security and Savings Act partially restores the \nartificial limits on how much people can save in their employer's \npension plan. One of the most burdensome provisions in the Internal \nRevenue Code is that 25 percent of compensation limitation contained \nwithin section 451(c). Under section 415(c), total contributions by \nemployer and employee into a defined contribution plan are limited to \n25 percent of compensation or $35,000, whichever is less.\n  But the retirement savings vehicle available for most private sector \nworkers is the 401(k) plan where the maximum amount a worker can save \nis currently $10,500. Thus, a workers who makes $40,000 annually could \nonly save $10,000, but not the additional $500 allowed by the rules in \nthe Code. My colleagues and I see section 415(c) as an artificial \nbarrier to saving of ordinary Americans and believe the 415(c) limit \nshould be removed.\n  Our bill also allows catch-up contributions for contributions to \ndefined contribution plans and IRAs. The provision is applicable only \nto individuals\n\n[[Page S3726]]\n\nage 50 and older--aiding many who may have started saving late in life \nor after other major financial obligations were out of the way such as \npaying down mortgages or sending children to college. It may also help \nthose who were not in the paid labor force while they took time off to \ncare for young children or ailing family members.\n  This provision is also important for those who save for retirement \nonly through an IRA. As I said a moment ago, the limits on IRAs have \nnot escalated for twenty years. IRA savers have lost out on twenty \nyears of contributions and earnings on those contributions that \npresumably would have been made had the limits increased with inflation \nas they do in other plans. Under current law, certain workers who save \nin section 403(b) plans or 457 (or in some cases a 401(k)) deferred \ncompensation plans for state and local government employees are allowed \nto make catch-up contributions for a period of time prior to their \nretirement dates.\n  I know of no justification why catch-up contributions should not be \nallowed for all types of defined contribution plans. One complaint that \nplan administrators in the 403(b) and governmental (both 457 and \n401(k)) plans have made is that the rules concerning when such catch-up \ncontributions can be and how they must be made are cumbersome. Those \nplan experts advocate a greatly simplified framework for allowing \ncatch-up contributions such as the one in our bill.\n  Under current law, an employer may require up to five years of \nservice before an employee is entitled to employer's matching \ncontributions to its retirement savings plan. The legislation would \nreduce the maximum number of years of service required to vest the \nemployer's matching contributions to only three years. A shorter \nvesting requirement would ensure that more short-service workers will \nhave a vested right to their employers' matching contributions. Thus, \nlarger accounts will be available to be saved for retirement despite \nfrequent job changes.\n  The legislation also contains proposals which promote retirement \nsavings plan portability. The lack of portability among plans is one of \nthe weak links in our current retirement saving system. This is an \nespecially difficult problem for our public employees for whom current \nlaw does not permit rollovers. A police officer or firefighter who \nleaves public service at age 50 or 55 and begins another career in the \nprivate sector, may not transfer savings to his or her new plan even if \nthe new employer's plan would accept them. Our bill would change this. \nIt removes unnecessary obstacles to portability for all types of plans \nin the governmental, not-for-profit and the for-profit sectors of our \neconomy.\n\n  In addition, this bill allows public sector workers to take benefits \nfrom a defined contribution plan and by service credit in their defined \nbenefit plan. For example, many school teachers who move from one \nschool district to another may not accrue sufficient years of service \nin their defined benefit plan to obtain the maximum benefit they need \nto retire. Yet many school teachers are good savers. They discipline \nthemselves and save regularly in their defined contribution plans. Our \nbill will permit those employees who choose to do so, to ``purchase \nservice credit'' in the defined benefit plan offered by their employing \nagency.\n  It is said that knowledge is power. Knowledge about an individual's \npension benefits gives him or her the power to plan for retirement and \ncorrect errors before they enter retirement. The legislation would \nrequire that plan sponsors provide benefit statements to their \nparticipants on a periodic basis. For defined contribution plans, the \nstatement would be required annually. For defined benefits plans, a \nstatement would be required every three years. However, employers who \nprovide an annual notice to employees of the availability of a benefit \nstatement would not be required to provide automatic benefit statements \nto all employees.\n  The bill also simplifies and repeals some of the legal requirements \nthat burden plans and increase costs for employers who sponsor pension \nplans. For example, the legislation seeks to repeal the full-funding \nlimit that is imposed on defined benefit plans. This limit prevents \nemployers from funding their defined benefit plans based on the current \nliability. This depressed funding level threatens the ability of \nemployers to pay benefits, especially as the Baby Boom begins to \nretire.\n  This bill will also adjust the section 415 limits that have harmed \nmany participants in multiemployer pension plans over the years. It \nwill also provide a default option for a rollover to an IRA for certain \ninvoluntary cash outs. This is our first look at ways to reduce plan \nleakage.\n  In the case of a significant restructuring of a pension plan benefit \nformula, the Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2001 would require \nthat affected recipients be given a benefit estimation tool kit. This \nwould allow pension plan participants to easily determine how their \nindividual benefits would be altered. The bill also directs the \nTreasury Department to study on the long-term effects of the trend of \nrestructuring retirement plans.\n  To reduce the burdens of plan compliance, and to encourage voluntary \ncompliance, the legislation includes a number of proposals intended to \npeel away at the layers of laws and regulations that add costs to plan \nadministration, but don't add many benefits. The legislation would \nrepeal unnecessary rules bogging down pension administration, such as \nthe multiple use test and the same desk rule. Moreover, mistakes made \nin administering a pension plan are often inadvertent. The IRS would be \ndirected to simplify and expand its voluntary compliance resolution \nsystem.\n  The Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2001 has considerable \nbipartisan support. Furthermore, over the years that it has been \npending, this legislation has received the support of over 100 \norganizations. These organization include business groups and labor \nunions; large companies and small companies; private sector \norganizations and organizations representing government employees and \nmany individuals. Few bills in the Senate can claim the diversity of \nsupport from organizations that traditionally don't agree on policy \nthat the Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2001 enjoys. I am proud \nof this fact. I think it is the clearest signal that we need to enact \ncomprehensive pension reform this session.\n  I am happy to add one more organization to the list of organizations \nsupporting the Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2001. Horace \nDeets, Executive Director of AARP sent a letter to me this week \nexpressing AARP's support for the legislation.\n  I will work to pass this critical piece of pension reform legislation \nthis Congress. I urge my colleagues who have not already done so, to \nsupport the Retirement Security and Savings Act of 2001 and help \nAmericans build a more secure retirement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Retirement Security and \nSavings Act of 2001 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill S. 742 was ordered to be printed \nin the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 742\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I also want \nto express my particular appreciation to Senator Bob Graham and Senator \nJeffords, without whose tireless work on pension issues this bill would \nnot have been possible.\n  We all know that our nation is facing a demographic shift of \ntremendous proportions in the coming decades. There are over 35 million \npeople over the age of 65 today. By 2050, the number of people aged 65 \nand older is estimated to rise above 81 million.\n  Yet we have watched the oncoming wave of retirements without \nadequately preparing for them, either as a nation, or as individuals.\n  About three in every four workers say they have personally begun \nsaving for retirement outside the Social Security system. But the \namounts accumulated by workers as a whole are unimpressive. Most have \naccumulated less than $50,000 in their retirement accounts. One-half of \nall 401(k) accounts have balances of less than $10,000. Now some of \nthese small amounts, not surprisingly, belong to younger workers who \nhave more time for those assets to grow. But only one-fourth of those \naged 35 and older have saved more than $100,000.\n  Americans can already expect to live about a quarter of their lives \nin retirement. As advances in medicine conquer more and more life \nthreatening diseases such as cancer and stroke, more of us will live to \nsee our second century--spending a full one-third of our lives in \nretirement. Every dollar we save will need to be stretched further as \nwe live longer. Our ability and willingness to save now will define \nwhether those retirement years are spent in comfort or poverty.\n  The American people have many wonderful qualities. But, these days, \nunfortunately, thrift isn't one of them.\n  During the last twenty years, personal savings rates have \nconsistently declined, from a peak of just under 11 percent of GDP in \nthe 1970's and 1980's to today's absymal numbers. Personal saving as a \npercentage of disposable income have been in negative territory since \nlast July, and the preliminary estimate for February is a negative 1.3 \npercent, the same as in January.\n  What does this matter? A low savings rate means that people aren't \nputting their own money away for retirement. That makes them more \ndependent on Social Security.\n  Sixteen percent of today's retirees rely exclusively on Social \nSecurity benefits for their retirement income, and two-thirds of all \nretirees rely on Social Security for over one-half of their retirement \nincome. Yet Social Security only replaces an average of 40 percent of a \nworker's income, because the program was never designed to be a \nretiree's sole source of support. If retirees continue to rely so \nheavily on Social Security, there will still be far too many Americans \nspending their retirement years one step away from poverty.\n  On top of that, a low savings rate means that less capital is \navailable for\n\n[[Page S3747]]\n\nnew investments today. Increased capital for investment is an essential \nelement to our international competitiveness, and critical in a time of \nslow economic growth such as we have now. Helping more Americans save \nfor their retirement will be a long-term economic stimulus for our \ncountry.\n  The bill we are introducing here today represents a bi-partisan \neffort to reverse this trend. It will expand savings opportunities for \nthose who are not saving enough, and provide incentives for those who \nare not saving at all. It is endorsed by a broad cross-section of \ngroups representing the pension community, from the Retirement Savings \nNetwork to the AARP.\n  The bill reforms the tax rules for pension plans. It makes pensions \nmore portable, to make it easier for workers to take their pensions \nwith them when they change jobs. It strengthens pensions security and \nenforcement. It expands coverage for small businesses. It enhances \npension fairness of women. And it encourages retirement education.\n  The bill also increases the contribution limits for Individual \nRetirement Accounts. IRAs have proven to be a very popular way for \nmillions of workers to save for retirement, particularly for those who \ndon't have pension plans available through their employers. The IRA \nlimits haven't been increased since they were created almost two \ndecades ago. They are long overdue for an increase. In addition to the \nIRA provisions, the bill increases contribution limits for employer-\nsponsored pension plans such as 401(k) plans.\n  These are positive changes. However, by and large, they reinforce the \nconventional approach to retirement incentives. That approach can best \nbe described as a ``top down'' approach. We create incentives for \npeople with higher incomes, hoping that the so-called nondiscrimination \nrules will give the higher paid folks an incentive to encourage more \nparticipation by others, such as through employer matching programs.\n  I don't have a problem with this approach, as far as it goes. But it \ndoesn't do enough to reach out to middle and lower income workers.\n  That's why I am particularly pleased that the bill goes further, by \ncreating two new savings incentives. One creates new incentives to \nencourage small businesses to establish pension plans for their \nemployees. The other creates a new matching program to help workers \nsave their own money for retirement.\n  Let me discuss each in turn.\n  First, the incentives for small businesses. Unlike larger companies, \nmost small business owners don't offer pension plans. While three out \nof every four workers at large companies are participating in some form \nof pension plan, only one out of every three employees of small \nbusinesses have pensions. This leaves over 30 million workers without a \npension plan.\n  It's not that small businesses don't want to provide pension plans. \nThey simply can't afford to. In a recent survey of small employers by \nthe Employee Benefit Research Institute, 65 percent of all small \nbusiness owners said tax credits for start-up costs would be strong \nincentives for starting retirement plans. They said tax credits are \nsecond only to an increase in business profits as a motivation to small \nemployers to offer a pension plan to their employees.\n  The Grassley-Baucus bill provides this motivation by creating two new \ntax credits.\n  The first is a tax credit of up to $500 to help defray the \nadministrative costs of starting a new plan.\n  The second is a tax credit to help employers contribute to a new plan \non behalf of their lower paid employees. In effect, it is a match of \namounts employers in small firms put into new retirement plans for \ntheir employees, up to a limit of 3% of the salaries of these workers.\n  Taken together, these new incentives will make it easier for small \nbusinesses to reach out to their employees and provide them with a \npension.\n  In addition, the bill creates a new tax credit that's aimed primarily \nat workers who do not have a pension plan available to them, to \nencourage them to save for themselves.\n  Only one-third of families with incomes under $25,000 are saving for \nretirement either through a pension plan or in an IRA. This compares \nwith 85 percent of families with incomes over $50,000 who are saving \nfor retirement.\n  We clearly need to provide an incentive for those families who aren't \nsaving right now, and the individual savings credit included in the \nGrassley-Baucus bill will provide that incentive.\n  Here's how it works. A couple with a joint income of $30,000 is \neligible for a 50% tax credit for the amount that they save each year, \nfor savings of up to $2000. People with higher incomes get a smaller \nmatch, up to a joint income of $50,000.\n  According to the Joint Tax Committee, over 8 million families will be \neligible for the individual savings credit. This will provide a strong \nincentive for these families to begin setting aside money for their \nretirement.\n  I understand pension incentives are not currently part of the \nPresident's tax plan. But I strongly believe this period of surpluses \ngives us a unique opportunity to help millions of individual Americans \nsave for the future--an opportunity that we shouldn't pass up. Enacting \nthe Grassley-Baucus bill also will help our economy grow by reducing \nthe cost of capital, providing a long-term stimulus to economic growth.\n  This bill will help those who are already thrifty and need the \ngovernment to loosen limits on saving. But it will also help the many \npeople who have been left behind. Good people, who are working hard to \nmake ends meet, but having trouble also saving for a rainy day.\n  This bill reaches out to all of them. It is a bipartisan effort to \ngive every working person in this country a real stake in the American \nDream.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us as cosponsors.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senators Grassley \nand Baucus to introduce the Retirement Security and Savings Act of \n2001. I am honored to be here today, in a bipartisan group, and \nespecially with my colleague Senator Grassley, who has put a tremendous \neffort into crafting many parts of this bill. He and I recognize that \nfor our nation to solve what will be one of this generation's greatest \nchallenges, building retirement security for today's workers, we need \nto move in a common sense, bipartisan fashion.\n  Many of the original cosponsors have dedicated their years in the \nSenate to crafting key sections of this legislation. Senator Grassley's \nefforts have expanded fairness for women and families, and highlighted \nthe benefits of retirement education. Senator Baucus has also been a \nprime contributor to this legislation, fostering the proposals to \nexpand pension coverage and ease the administrative burdens on \nAmerica's small businesses.\n  We have come here today, from both sides of the aisle, to ensure that \nfuture generations have a strong and viable retirement security system.\n  Retirement today is a much different prospect than it was a \ngeneration ago. Retirees can expect to live much longer. Their health \ncare needs are different and they are much more likely to need long-\nterm care.\n  Planning for retirement has also changed. Thirty years ago retirement \nplanning consisted of picking an employer with a good pension plan and \nsticking with that company for 30 years.\n  Traditional pensions, with their clockwork monthly checks in return \nfor a defined term of service, are becoming nostalgic memories. \nIncreasingly, employers are turning to defined contribution plans--\n401(k)s and the like.\n  For example, twenty-five years ago nearly 31 million American workers \nwere covered by a pension plan. Of those, 87 percent had a defined \nbenefit plan, according to the Department of Labor. Today, less than \none-half of workers covered by a retirement plan have a defined benefit \nplan, while 54 percent are covered by a defined contribution plan.\n  An employee with a 401(k) account can count on getting only one thing \neach month--a statement tracking account investments that rise and fall \nwith financial markets. The burden of ensuring that there are \nsufficient assets in their 401(k) plans falls upon them.\n  And these are the lucky workers. Many employers--small businesses in\n\n[[Page S3748]]\n\nparticular--do not offer any kind of employer-sponsored retirement \nplan. Workers at these businesses are left to fend for themselves.\n  Recent statistics from the Social Security Administration illustrate \nthe importance of each component of retirement income. 38 percent of \nretirees' income came from Social Security, 19 percent from employer-\nsponsored savings plans or pensions, and 19 percent from savings. The \nrest was unidentified income or earnings from work.\n  Clearly, Social Security alone is not sufficient basis for a solid \nretirement plan. Adequate retirement security these days involves \nplanning and coordinating three principal sources of income: Social \nSecurity, employer-based pensions and personal savings.\n  Pensions and personal savings will make up an ever-increasing part of \nretirement security. Today, if a worker retires with no savings and no \npension, nearly 40 percent of his/her retirement income is lost. Even \nas retirees are becoming more heavily reliant on pensions, statistics \nshow that 45 million working Americans are still not covered by any \ntype of retirement plan.\n  There are a number of reasons why fewer and fewer working Americans \nare earning retirement benefits. First, job tenure has fallen. Today's \nworkers no longer dedicate their entire working life to one company. \nNow, the average worker will have had 7 employers in a 40-year work \ncareer. The mobility of working Americans, and the necessity of \nbusinesses to restructure their workforce, can create tremendous \nobstacles in ever being able to fully vest, and obtain retirement \nbenefits.\n  Second, small businesses, the most dynamic part of our economy, are \nthe least able to offer their workers retirement benefits. Studies \nindicate that small businesses are responsible for a large portion of \nthe country's job growth, and that this trend will accelerate in the \nfuture.\n  Third, our economy has shifted away from manufacturing jobs, which \ntend to offer pensions, to service and retail jobs, which tend to have \nshorter job tenure, more part-time workers, and less likelihood of \nproviding pension and retirement benefits.\n  And finally, there are fewer union workers. Collective bargaining \nagreements are the most likely to contain retirement benefits. There \nare fewer union workers than 20 years ago, and the number is still \ndeclining. Therefore, less people will have important lifetime \nretirement security.\n  It is imperative that Congress take action to improve the private \nside of retirement security and encourage personal savings. Our bill, \nthe Retirement Security and Savings Act, will help hard-working \nAmericans build personal retirement savings through 401(k)s and IRAs.\n\n  To achieve this goal, we focused on six areas: simplification, \nportability, expanded coverage for small business, pension security and \nenforcement, women's equity issues, and expanding retirement planning \nand education opportunities.\n  This legislation benefits both employers and workers. Employers get \nsimpler pension systems with less administrative burden, and more loyal \nemployees. And workers build secure retirement and watch their savings \naccumulate over years of work.\n  A large section of this legislation deals with expanded coverage for \nsmall businesses. It's such an important component of this bill because \nsmall businesses have the greatest difficulty achieving retirement \nsecurity.\n  The problem: statistics indicate that only a small percentage of \nworkers in firms of less than 100 employees have access to a retirement \nplan. We take a step forward in eliminating one of the first hurdles \nthat a small business faces when it establishes a pension plan. On one \nhand, the federal government encourages these businesses to establish \npension plans. Yet on the other hand, we turn around and charge the \nsmall business, at times, up to one thousand dollars to register their \nplan with the Internal Revenue Service.\n  The solution: our bill eliminates this fee for small businesses. We \nneed to encourage small businesses to start plans, not discourage them \nwith high registration fees.\n  This legislation also addresses the inadequacy of retirement security \nfor women and families. Generally speaking, women live longer than men, \nand therefore, need greater savings for retirement. Yet our pension and \nretirement laws do not reflect this. Women are more mobile than men, \nmoving in and out of the workforce due to family responsibilities; \nthus, they have less of a chance to become vested. Our legislation \noffers a solution--shrinking the five-year vesting cycle to a three-\nyear cycle.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the current U.S. worker will have seven \ndifferent employers over their lifetime. We have the possibility of \ncreating a generation of American workers who will retire with many \nsmall accounts--creating a complex maze of statements and features, \ndifferent for each account. This is a problem--pensions should be \nportable from job to job.\n  Unfortunately, our tax laws contain barriers to retirement-account \nportability and so the major benefit of defined-contribution plans are \noften rendered unusable. Workers changing jobs are often given their \nsavings back in a lump sum that doesn't always make it back into an \nIndividual Retirement Account or their new employer's 401(k). The \nresult is that retirement savings get spent before retirement.\n  Our bill provides a solution to this problem. It allows employees to \nroll one retirement account into another as they move from job to job \nso that when they retire, they will have one retirement account. It's \neasier to monitor, less complicated to keep track of, and builds a more \nsecure retirement for the worker.\n  Portability is important, but we must also reduce the red tape. The \nmain obstacle that companies face in establishing retirement programs \nis the administrative burden. For example: for small plans, it costs \n$228 per person per year just to comply with all the forms, tests and \nregulations.\n  We have a common sense remedy to one of the most vexing problems in \npension administration: figuring out how much money to contribute to \nthe company's plan. It's a complex formula of facts, statistics and \nassumptions. We want to be able to say to plans that have no problem \nwith underfunding: to help make these calculations, you can use the \nprior year's data to help make the proper contribution. You don't have \nto re-sort through the numbers each and every year. Companies will be \nable to calculate, and then budget accordingly--and not wait until \nfigures and rates out of their control are released by outside sources.\n  I have said time and time again that Americans are not saving. But \nthose who are oftentimes hit limits on the amounts they can save. The \nproblem is that most of these limits were established more than 20 \nyears ago. Currently, for example, in a 401(k) plan the IRS limits the \namount an employee can contribute to $10,500 a year.\n  Our solution is to raise that limit to $15,000, along with raising \nmany other limits that affect savings in order to build a more secure \nretirement for working Americans.\n  Building retirement security will also take some education. One of \nthe principal reasons Americans do not prepare for retirement is that \nthey don't understand the benefits that are available to them.\n  One solution to this dilemma is regular and easy to read benefit \nstatements from employers reminding workers early in their career of \nthe importance of retirement savings. These statements would clarify \nwhat benefits workers are accruing. With this information each American \nwill more easily be able to determine the personal savings they need in \norder to build a sound retirement.\n  The new retirement paradigm requires Congress and individual workers \nto rededicate themselves to the goal of retirement security. If we \nfail, the consequences will be harsh. That's particularly true in \nFlorida, a popular retirement destination that could be devastated by \nan influx of seniors inadequately prepared for their retirement.\n  While Florida would be hit first, the nation as a whole will \neventually feel the pain as the population ages faster than the \nworkforce. To those who would suggest this is the distant future, \nremember how far high school seemed when you were in the sixth grade, \nhow 30 once loomed eons from 25, and how we once thought our parents \nwould be young and healthy forever.\n  With the introduction of this legislation today it is my goal to \nensure that\n\n[[Page S3749]]\n\neach American who works hard for thirty or forty years has gotten every \nopportunity for a secure and comfortable retirement.\n  I thank my colleagues who have worked so hard with me on this \nmeasure, and ask for the support of those in this Chamber on this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nRetirement Security and Savings Act of 2001, and I am pleased to once \nagain join my colleagues as an original cosponsor of this important \nlegislation. Enactment of this bill would encourage more businesses to \noffer pension plans to their employees by simplifying the complex and \nburdensome pension rules they face and would also make it easier for \nemployees to save for their own retirement.\n  I want to congratulate my colleague, the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Grassley, for his effective and persistent \nleadership on this issue. Senators Grassley, Baucus, Graham, and \nJeffords, along with myself and several other Senators, have been \nworking on enactment of a bipartisan pension simplification and \nretirement savings enhancement bill for several years now. These \nefforts led to the successful passage of a bipartisan package of such \nprovisions in the Taxpayer Refund and Reform Act of 1999, which was \nunfortunately vetoed by President Clinton. We again came close to the \ngoal line last year when the Finance Committee reported out a bill \ncontaining similar provisions. The ultimate objective of enactment has \nbeen elusive, however. Introduction of this legislation today is the \nfirst step of what I hope will be the successful completion to this \nlong quest.\n  However, I have some serious concerns with some changes that were \nmade to the bill being introduced today, compared with earlier \nversions. Specifically, important changes to the top-heavy rules that \naffect small businesses have been left out. Let me explain.\n  Today's pension laws are complicated and cumbersome and a deterrent \nto small businesses wanting to establish a retirement plan. In 1996, \nCongress began the job of pension simplification when it passed the \nSmall Business Job Protection Act. This Act contained important changes \nto our pension laws, including two simplification provisions important \nto small and family-owned businesses--an exemption from costly \nnondiscrimination testing for 401(k) plans that meet certain safe \nharbors, such as providing a minimum level of benefits to non-highly \npaid employees, and the elimination of complex and duplicative family \naggregation rules.\n  Unfortunately, these changes did not apply to the top-heavy rules. \nThe top-heavy rules are additional testing and minimum benefit \nrequirements aimed at ensuring that owner-dominated plans do not \ndiscriminate against lower-paid workers. Due to their design, top-heavy \nrules generally only affect business with fewer than 100 employees.\n  I recognize the need to protect lower-paid employees from \ndiscrimination in the design of retirement plans. However, the top-\nheavy rules can be duplicative and especially harmful in that they \ndiscourage small employers from establishing pension plans because they \nadd to the cost and administrative burden of sponsoring a plan. In the \nend, rules like these that were designed to protect employees can end \nup harming them by leaving them with no employer-provided retirement \ncoverage. Moreover, the general nondiscrimination rules have been \nstrengthened over the years since the enactment of the top-heavy rules, \nand are further strengthened by the provisions of the bill being \nintroduced today. Therefore, eliminating these duplicative top-heavy \nrules would not leave workers unprotected. It would, however, remove a \ndisincentive for small employers to sponsor a retirement plan.\n  H.R. 1102, the pension simplification bill that passed the House of \nRepresentatives and the Finance Committee last year with broad \nbipartisan support, as well as H.R. 10, this year's version of the so-\ncalled Portman-Cardin bill recently introduced in the House, contain \ntwo important provisions that were left out of the bill being \nintroduced today. These two omitted provisions would exempt safe-harbor \n401(k) plans from the top-heavy rules and remove the family aggregation \nrequirement from the top-heavy rules.\n  First, the 401(k) safe harbor provides exactly what the top-heavy \nrules attempt to do--guarantee that non-highly paid workers get a \nminimum level of benefits and are not discriminated against. In return, \nemployers can avoid costly nondiscrimination testing. Congress provided \nthe safe-harbors to encourage small employers to create new pension \nplans and provide more generous benefits to employees. However, because \nqualification for the safe harbor does not exclude a plan from the top-\nheavy rules, the fear of costly testing can be a serious deterrent to \nbusinesses wishing to take advantage of the safe harbor, even if the \nplan satisfies the minimum benefit requirements. Thus, in order to \nprovide certainty and encouragement to small businesses, 401(k) plans \nthat meet the safe harbor rules should also be exempt from top-heavy \ntesting.\n  Second, as was noted by Congress in 1996, the family aggregation \nrules are complex and unnecessary in light of the numerous other \nprovisions that protect against pension plans disproportionately \nfavoring high-paid workers. Moreover, requiring the aggregation of \nfamily members when testing pension plans imposes undue restrictions on \nthe ability of a family-owned business to provide adequate retirement \nbenefits for all members of the family working for the business. \nTherefore, Congress should complete the task of easing this burden on \nfamily-owned businesses by removing the family aggregation requirement \nfrom the top-heavy rules.\n  On the whole I support the legislation we are introducing today. It \nwould go a long way toward increasing the retirement security for \nmillions of Americans. However, I am disappointed that these two \nprovisions, along with several others, were dropped from the bill. \nThese two provisions are particularly important tools in our effort to \nexpand employee retirement coverage by encouraging small businesses to \nestablish pension plans. As pension reform legislation makes its way \nthrough the legislative process, I will work to try to restore these \nprovisions so that small family-owned businesses will have more \ncertainty and confidence and fewer unnecessary burdens and costs when \nestablishing pension plans for their workers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mrs. Clinton, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 743. A bill to establish a medical education trust fund, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation along \nwith my colleague Senator Clinton, that establishes a Medical Education \nTrust Fund to support America's 144 medical schools and 1,250 graduate \nmedical education, GME, teaching institutions. These institutions are \nnational treasures, they are the very best in the world and deserve \nexplicit and dedicated funding to guarantee that the United States \ncontinues to lead the world in the quality of its medical education and \nits health care delivery system.\n  The Medical Education Trust Fund Act, METFA, of 2001 recognizes the \nneed to begin moving away from existing medical education payment \npolicies. The primary and immediate purpose of the legislation is to \nestablish as Federal policy that medical education is a public good \nthat all sectors of the health care system must support. This bill \nensures that public and private insurers share the burden of financing \nmedical education equitably. As such, METFA will be funded through \nthree sources: a 1.5 percent assessment on health insurance premiums, \nMedicare, and Medicaid. The relative contribution from each of these \nsources is in rough proportion to the medical education costs \nattributable to their respective covered populations.\n  GME is increasingly becoming hostage to fights over larger questions \nabout the solvency and design of the Medicare system. The very \ncommission entrusted to protect the integrity of the Medicare program, \nMedPAC, itself has succumbed to political and idelogical pressures by \nrecommending that the GME program be removed from the Health Insurance \nTrust Fund and thrown into the appropriations process. I cannot stress \nstrongly\n\n[[Page S3750]]\n\nenough how important it is to reject this recommendation. To subject \nGME to the annual appropriations process does nothing more than to put \na vital program in direct competition with many other important federal \npriorities in a budget that the Bush Administration is already severely \nconstraining. We have seen this first hand in working through the 2002 \nbudget, where the current Administration has proposed to cut a large \nportion of the Pediatric GME program to fund other programs. Leaving \nthis program unprotected, will incite the same type of particularized \nspecial interest advocacy that we see emerging in other areas of health \ncare. I urge my colleagues to reject this dangerous notion and instead \ncall on all of you to support the concept embodied in this bill.\n  This legislation, METFA, is not my innovation. It is an idea, \npioneered by our former colleague, Senator Moynihan. This bill \nrecognizes that medical education is the responsibility of all who \nbenefit from it and must therefore share in the responsibility to \nsupport it. As Senator Moynihan once said ``medical education is one of \nAmerica's most precious public resources.'' He understood that despite \nthe increasingly competitive health care system of our time, that \nmedical education was a public good, that is, ``a good from which \neveryone benefits but for which no one is willing to pay.''\n  Some health reformers argue that in fact, GME does not meet the \nrequirements of a public good and that therefore, an all-payer system \nis nothing more than a form of taxation. I beg to differ. Health care \nis not a commodity. While we can and should rely on competition to hold \ndown costs in much of the health system, we must not allow it to bring \na premature end to this great age of medical discovery, an age made \npossible by this country's exceptionally well trained health \nprofessionals and superior medical schools and teaching hospitals. \nIndeed, through the NIH and the tax code we have successfully and \nrobustly, subsidized the development of new wonder drugs, and I \ncertainly don't think anyone is suggesting that we change this policy, \nmy legislation complements a competitive health market by providing \ntax-supported funding for the public services provided by teaching \nhospitals and medical schools.\n  The legislation we introduce today is only the beginning. It \nestablishes the principle that, as a public good, medical education \nshould be supported by a stable, dedicated, long-term source of \nfunding. To ensure that the United States continues to lead the world \nin the quality of its medical education and its health system as a \nwhole, the legislation would also create a Medical Education Advisory \nCommission to conduct a thorough study and make recommendations, \nincluding the potential use of demonstration projects, regarding the \nfollowing: alternative and additional sources of medical education \nfinancing; alternative methodologies for financing medical education; \npolicies designed to maintain superior research and educational \ncapacities in an increasingly competitive health system; the \nappropriate role of medical schools in graduate medical education; \npolices designed to expand eligibility for graduate medical education \npayments to institutions other than teaching hospitals, including \nchildren's hospital.\n  The services provided by our nation's teaching hospitals and medical \nschools, groundbreaking research, highly skilled medical care, and the \ntraining of tomorrow's physicians, are vitally important and must be \nprotected in this time of intense economic competition in the health \nsystem.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 743\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to ask my colleagues to \njoin me in ensuring that we maintain a steady stream of funding for the \ncrown jewels of our health care system, out Nation's teaching \nhospitals. I deeply appreciate Senator Reed's leadership on this issue \nand I am proud to join him and other colleagues as an original \ncosponsor of this important legislation.\n  Teaching hospitals play a vital role in our Nation's health care \nsystem, both in treatment and research, helping to make our system one \nof the finest in the world. New York City, for example, leads the world \nin the number and quality of academic health centers, teaching \nhospitals, and related medical institutions.\n  I have long supported academic health center and teaching hospitals, \nbecause their work is so essential to our communities. We rely on them \nto train physicians and nurses, care for the sickest of the sick and \nthe poorest of the poor, and engage in research and clinical trials. \nThanks to the research, for example, at Memorial Sloan-Kettering, \ncancer patients will suffer less while receiving chemotherapy because \nof a drug that was developed there. And a drug that allows balloon \nangiplasty to save lives was developed at SUNY Stony Brook.\n  As my predecessor and friend, Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who I \nam so honored to be following in the footsteps of, put it so well a few \nyears ago, ``We are in the midst of a great era of discovery in the \nmedical science. It is certainly not a time to close medical schools. \nThis great era of medical discovery is occurring right here in the \nUnited States, not in Europe like past ages in scientific discovery. \nAnd it is centered in New York City.''\n  But our Nation's teaching hospitals are at risk. Cuts to Medicare \nhave lowered reimbursements for teaching hospitals and another \nreduction, which I will work with my colleagues to prevent, is \nscheduled to take place next year. Teaching hospitals have higher costs \nnot only because of the training functions they perform, but also \nbecause they treat patients who require some of the most costly \nprocedures and require longer hospital stays. In addition, the use of \nadvanced technology and presence of experts in various fields also add \nto teaching hospitals' expenses.\n  All of us, who rely on the expertise of our doctors, and have access \nto new technologies, as well as the state-of-the-art services academic \nmedical centers and teaching hospitals offer, benefit from the creation \nof a trust fund to ensure a steady stream of funds dedicated for these \npurposes. Some states, including mine, have sought to address these \nfunding needs themselves. However, as Senator Moynihan also pointed \nout, New York State's GME fund was created as a temporary solution \nuntil a Federal fund could be created.\n  I urge my colleagues in joining me with their support for this \ncritical investment in our teaching hospitals so that they can continue \nto lead the world in training highly-qualified medical professionals, \nand generating the state-of-the-art research and treatment that enables \nour Nation's health care system to flourish.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 744. A bill to amend section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to eliminate notification and return requirements for State and \nlocal candidate committees and avoid duplicate reporting by certain \nState and local political committees of information required to be \nreported and made publicly available under State law; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today a bill \nwith Senators Lieberman and Feingold that would address a concern that \nhas been raised by state legislators in Texas and across the country.\n  Last year Congress enacted the Full and Fair Political Activities \nDisclosure Act of 2000, Public Law 106-230, a law that imposed new IRS \nreporting requirements on political organizations claiming tax-exempt \nstatus under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code. The purpose of \nthis law was to uncover so-called ``stealth PACs,'' tax-exempt groups \nwhich, prior to the enactment of this law, did not have to disclose any \ncontributions or expenditures and were free to influence elections in \nvirtual anonymity.\n  While Public Law 106-230 was intended to target ``stealth PACs,'' it \nhas had the unintended consequence of imposing burdensome and \nduplicative reporting requirements on state and local candidates who \nare not involved in any Federal election activities. In many states \nlike Texas, State and local candidates already file detailed reports \nwith their state election officials.\n  To correct this problem, I am introducing legislation that would \nexempt state and local candidates from the IRS reporting requirements \nof Public Law 106-230. This bill is the product of an agreement that \nwas worked out among Senator Lieberman, Senator Feingold, Senator Dodd, \nSenator McCain, Senator McConnell, and myself.\n  I originally intended to offer this legislation as an amendment to S. \n27, the McCain-Feingold campaign finance bill. Unfortunately, since \nthis particular legislation impacts the Internal Revenue Code, I was \nunable to offer it at that time without the possibility of invoking a \nblue slip from the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Last week, I spoke with the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee\n\n[[Page S3755]]\n\nabout this issue, and he assured me that he would seek to address this \nissue in his committee. In this vein, I would like to ask the Senator \nfrom Iowa, the chairman of the Finance Committee, if he also will work \nwith me to address this problem in the context of the tax bill this \nyear.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes, I would be pleased to work with the Senator from \nTexas on this matter, and pledge my good faith to give serious \nconsideration to including language that meets her concerns in an \nappropriate tax bill in the near future.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I'd like to thank the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee, and I look forward to working with him.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this bill, \nand I thank my colleague, the Senator from Texas, for working with me \nto draft this bill in a manner that achieves its purpose, but does not \nopen any loopholes in the original section 527 reform law.\n  Last year, Congress passed the first significant campaign finance \nreform measure in a quarter of a century. The so-called section 527 \nreform bill dealt with a truly troubling development, one whereby \norganizations that received tax-exempt status by telling the IRS that \nthey existed to influence elections denied the very same thing to the \nFEC. As a result, these self-proclaimed election organizations engaged \nin election activity without complying with any aspect of the election \nlaws, influencing our elections without the American public having any \nidea who, or what, was behind them.\n  Our law put a stop to that, by requiring organizations claiming tax-\nexempt status under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code to do \nthree things: 1. give notice of their intent to claim that status; 2. \ndisclose information about their large contributors and their big \nexpenditures; and 3. file annual informational returns along the lines \nof those filed by virtually all other tax-exempt organizations.\n  During the nine months or so that the 527 reform law has been in \neffect, that law has blasted sunshine onto the previously shadowy \noperations of a multitude of election-related organizations. Through \nthe filings mandated by that law, the American public has learned a \ngreat deal about who is financing many of these organizations and how \nthese organizations are spending their money.\n  But the law has had another impact, and that is to impose new \nreporting requirements on a group of organizations that already fully \ndisclose to the public all of the activities covered by the 527 reform \nlaw. This bill gives relief to those organizations. In particular it \ngrants relief from the 527 reform law to two categories of \norganizations that are involved exclusively in State and local \nelections and that already fully disclose their activities. I thank my \ncolleague from Texas for working with me to ensure that we accomplish \nthat goal without opening up any loopholes in the 527 reform law that \nwill allow undisclosed money to reenter our election system.\n  First, the bill provides new exemptions for State and local candidate \ncommittees. Under the reform law, committees of candidates for State or \nlocal office have to notify the IRS of their intent to claim section \n527 status, and they have to file annual informational returns if they \nhave over $25,000 in gross receipts. Since the reform law went into \neffect, we have become convinced that the burden these requirements \nimpose on State and local candidate committees outweigh the public \npurpose served by requiring them to comply with these mandates.\n  In contrast to other types of political committees, State and local \ncandidate committees often are not permanent organizations. They often \ncrop up a few months before an election and then cease to exist shortly \nafter the election. They are often staffed by volunteers and run on a \nshoe string budget. Any new paperwork requirement--regardless of how \nreasonable it may be in other contexts--can put a significant burden on \nthese minimally staffed and often short-lived committees.\n  At the same time, State and local candidate committees do not pose \nthe threats the 527 law intended to address. In contrast to other \npolitical committees, there is never any doubt as to who is running the \ncandidate committee and as to whose agenda the candidate committee aims \nto promote. Just as importantly, State laws regulate and require \ndisclosure from all candidate committees.\n  We therefore have concluded that even though we do not believe the \n527 reform law's mandates to be particularly burdensome in general, \nState and local candidate committees present a special case, one that \nwarrants exempting them from the reform law's requirements to file a \nnotice of intent to claim section 527 status and to file an annual \nreturn even if the organization does not have taxable income. I note, \nthough, that these organizations still will have to file and make \npublic annual returns if they have taxable income.\n  The second group to which we are granting a lesser degree of relief \nis a very carefully defined group of so-called State and local PACs. In \ngranting this relief, we have walked a very fine line. On one hand, we \nwant to recognize the fact that every State requires disclosure from \npolitical committees involved in that State's elections and that many \nState and local PACs covered by the 527 reform law therefore are \nalready disclosing the information the 527 law seeks to State agencies. \nOn the other hand, we still believe that there is a strong public \ninterest in knowing how the federal tax-exemption under section 527 is \nbeing used by these organizations, and we most decidedly do not want to \nexempt from the law's disclosure requirements any State or local PAC \nthat does not otherwise publicly disclose all of its activities.\n\n  To exempt a State or local PAC merely because it claims that it is \ninvolved only in State elections and files information about some of \nits activities with a State agency would risk creating a massive \nloophole that could undermine the 527 reform law. That is because just \nas prior to the passage of the 527 reform law, some 527 groups were \nclaiming that they were trying to influence elections for the purposes \nof the tax code, but not for the purposes of the election laws, a broad \nexemption for State or local PACs could lead some groups to claim that \nthey are influencing State elections for the purposes of section 527 \nbut not for the purposes of the State disclosure laws.\n  So, we have reached the following compromise. First, we are not \nexempting any of these organizations from the section 527(i) notice \nrequirements. Unlike candidate committees, PACs generally are not \ntransient, volunteer-staffed organizations, and it is not always clear \nto the public who is behind these groups. Moreover, because we are not \ncompletely exempting these groups from the law's other disclosure \nrequirements, the notice requirement will be critical in helping the \nIRS and outside groups monitor compliance with the law's other \nmandates. In light of that, we believe the minimal effort required to \nfile the 527(i) notice is worth the tremendous value of giving the \npublic some basic information about these groups.\n  Second, we are granting an exemption from the section 527(j) \ncontribution and expenditure reporting requirements to some of these \norganizations, but only if they can meet certain strict requirements. \nThe group's so-called exempt function activity must focus exclusively \non State or local elections. The group must file with a State agency \ninformation on every contribution and expenditure it would otherwise be \nrequired to disclose to the IRS. In addition, these State filings must \nbe pursuant to a State law that requires these groups to file the State \nreports; this requirement seeks to prevent organizations from hiding \ntruly federal activity by voluntarily reporting to a State where \nreports may not be as readily accessible as are federal reports. \nMoreover, no group will be able to take advantage of this exemption if \nthe State reports its files are not publicly available both from the \nState agency with which the report is filed and from the group itself. \nFinally, this exemption also is not available to any organization in \nwhich a candidate for federal office or someone who holds elected \nfederal office plays a role--whether through helping to run the \norganization, soliciting money for the organization or deciding how the \norganization spends its money. In short, this bill exempts from 527(j) \nreporting obligations only those groups that truly and legitimately \nengage in exclusively State and\n\n[[Page S3756]]\n\nlocal activity and only when they already report publicly on all of the \ninformation the 527 law seeks.\n  Finally, the bill makes a small change to these State and local \ngroups' obligation to file an annual information return when they do \nnot have taxable income. Under the current law, they must file such \nreturns when they have $25,000 in annual receipts; the bill increases \nthat trigger to $100,000. Like all other 527 organizations, though, \nthey still will have to file such returns if they have taxable income.\n  Again, let me thank Senator Hutchison for her efforts on this bill. I \nbelieve we have worked out a good compromise, one that grants relief \nwhere it is warranted, but does not in any way threaten to open up a \nloophole in the law. I thank her for that, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators Hutchinson \nand Lieberman in cosponsoring this bill.\n  Our enactment of the 527 disclosure legislation last year was an \nimportant step toward breaking the logjam on campaign finance reform. \nIt showed that we could come together to pass commonsense reforms that \ngive the public more information about and more confidence in the \npolitical process. Since that law went into effect, we have heard \nlegitimate complaints from state and local candidates and PACs, which \nare in fact exempt from taxation under section 527 of the Internal \nRevenue Code, about the burden of complying with the notification and \nreporting requirements of the law.\n  Senator Hutchinson brought this issue to the fore by offering an \namendment to the campaign finance bill that we passed on Monday. I very \nmuch appreciate her willingness to withdraw that amendment so we could \nwork out the details together and avoid creating a blue-slip problem \nwith the House that might delay the overall campaign finance bill.\n  The challenge was to address the legitimate concerns raised by state \ncandidates and PACs without opening new loopholes in the law so soon \nafter its enactment. Particularly as we stand poised to enact even more \nfar reaching reforms in the McCain-Feingold bill, it is extremely \nimportant that we not weaken existing law in a way that might be \nexploited by groups wanting to avoid the sunshine that the 527 \ndisclosure law provided. I believe that the Senator from Texas and the \nSenator from Connecticut have successfully negotiated this difficult \nterrain. I am proud to support this bill, and I hope it will be quickly \nenacted.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \n        Bingaman, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 745. A bill to amend the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 to promote \nbetter nutrition among school children participating in the school \nbreakfast and lunch programs; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am today introducing a simple, yet \nforceful, bill designed to address a growing problem among school \nchildren. I am tired of major soft drink companies trying to take \nschool lunch money away from children.\n  It is one thing for the school bully to take lunch money from school \nkids, it is another for Coca-Cola or Pepsi to take it. In some areas, \nschool scoreboards and school uniforms are now plastered with soda ads \nunder exclusive contracts with vending machines all over the place.\n  According to a report issued by the Center for Science in the Public \nInterest, 20 years ago boys consumed more than twice as much milk as \nsoda, and girls 50 percent more; now boys and girls consume twice as \nmuch soft drink as they do milk.\n  I had a huge battle with Coca-Cola in 1994 when they tried to derail \nmy child nutrition bill--``The Better Nutrition and Health for Children \nAct'' because I wanted schools to know they had the right to ban soda \nvending machines if they chose.\n  That 1994 controversy began when Coca-Cola sent out letters to school \nauthorities around the country misrepresenting my bill. They were \nresorting to scare tactics instead of honest debate. The letter sent by \nCoca-Cola made numerous false allegations including that soft drinks \nare USDA-approved. That was not, and is still not true.\n  The controversy now is over exclusive contracts with soda \nmanufacturers so they get to blanket schools with soda vending machines \nand signs advertising their products. Also, in some schools sodas are \nactually being given away to children during lunch.\n  For schools participating in the national school lunch program I want \nthe vending machines turned off during lunch on all school grounds--it \nis that simple. During lunch, I do not want sodas sold to school \nchildren by the school. And the Secretary of Agriculture should \ncarefully consider, based on sound nutritional science, whether to turn \noff the soda vending machines and stop soft drink sales before lunch.\n  You don't have to be a scientist to know that eating habits learned \nin childhood translate into a longer and healthier life. Leaving the \nvending machines on during lunch sets a bad example, and tempts \nchildren to spend their lunch money.\n  Soft drinks are a $60 billion a year industry. The fancy commercials \nand big-time advertising rake in huge profits for the soda \nmanufacturers.\n  Children don't vote, children don't hand out large sums of PAC money, \nchildren don't hire expensive lobbyists. But I have always put the \nwelfare of children ahead of corporate profits, and I always will.\n  Coca-Cola recently announced that they will encourage other soda \nmanufacturers to stop the practice of negotiating exclusive soda \ncontracts with schools. That does not solve the program. The issue is \nnot which company is selling the sodas, but whether the sodas should be \nsold at all, before and during lunch. Doing away with exclusive \ncontracts could just mean more soda vending machines in schools.\n  This is not the way for schools to raise money.\n  My bill would ban the sale of soda and ``pure-sugar'' candies such as \ncotton candy, gum balls, licorice, and the like, to school children in \nschool during the lunch period and during breakfast. It would also \nprohibit the practice in some schools of giving away soda during lunch.\n  For the period after breakfast and before lunch, the bill would \nmandate that the Secretary of Agriculture take into account the \nnutritional health of children and design a rule based on ``sound \nnutritional science'' that could ban the sale (or donation) of sodas \nand similar high-sugar foods, throughout school property or on some \nportions of school property. The bill would permit the Secretary to \nleave the current approach intact--which would allow such sales if the \nschool wanted.\n  In this nutritional health analysis, the Secretary would have to \nconsider what foods, such as milk or juices, are most likely to be \ndisplaced by the consumption of sodas before and during lunch. The \nSecretary would also have to weigh the low nutritional value of sodas \nas compared to soda substitutes such as juice or milk.\n  A recent study published in The Lancet concluded that for each glass \nof sugar-sweetened drink consumed by a child, their risk of becoming \nobese increased 1.6 times. It was also recently reported that soda \nconsumption negatively impacts the ability of a child to meet their \ndaily requirements for calcium, vitamin A, and magnesium. Variations in \nthe amount of calcium consumed during childhood can result in decreased \nbone mass which may lead to a 50 percent greater risk of hip fracture \nin later years.\n  I recently heard from one of my constituents on this issue while \nJenny Dorman is only in 6th grade, she has a great deal of wisdom for \nher age. Her letter gets right to the point on this important issue of \nhow soda consumption impacts health. I ask unanimous consent that her \nletter be included in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  Dear Senator Leahy, I was getting ready for school when my mom told \nme to look at your article. I want to tell you that I'm with you 100 \npercent. I used to be a soda addict, and would drink nothing else. Last \nyear in health class the teacher taught us what soda does to your \nbones. There is 2 percent of calcium in your bones, 1 percent in your \nteeth, the other 1 percent is in your blood. Soda robs your bones of \ncalcium. If there isn't enough calcium in your blood, your body goes to \nyour bones, where\n\n[[Page S3757]]\n\nlots of calcium is found. If the soda and your body keeps taking \ncalcium, your bones will get really brittle and easy to break. When \nyou're old you can be very liable to have osteoporosis. Once I learned \nthat, I stopped drinking soda altogether. Now I only drink water, milk, \nand once in a while juice. I'm in 6th grade now and I haven't had soda \nfor over a year! I haven't had it in so long that even if I get a tiny \nbit of soda I get a sick feeling inside. Now I'm desperately trying to \nget the rest of my family off it by switching Sprite with water. Ha Ha!\n                                                     Jenny Dorman,\n                                               Stockbridge School.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Inouye):\n  S. 746. A bill to express the policy of the United States regarding \nthe United States relationship with Native Hawaiians and to provide a \nprocess for the recognition by the United States of the Native Hawaiian \ngoverning entity, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill with my \nfriend and colleague, the senior Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Inouye which \nwould clarify the political relationship between Native Hawaiians and \nthe United States. This measure would extend the federal policy of \nself-determination and self-governance to Hawaii's indigenous, native \npeoples, Native Hawaiians, thereby establishing parity in federal \npolicies towards Native Hawaiians, Alaska Natives and American Indians.\n  The bill we introduce today is a modified version of legislation we \nintroduced on January 22, 2001. This modified version improves upon our \nefforts to clarify the political relationship between Native Hawaiians \nand the United States. Federal policy towards Native Hawaiians has \nclosely paralleled that of our indigenous brothers and sisters, the \nAlaska Natives and American Indians. This bill provides a process for \nfederal recognition of the Native Hawaiian governing entity for a \ngovernment-to-government relationship with the United States.\n  This bill does three things. First it provides a process for federal \nrecognition of the Native Hawaiian governing entity. Second, it \nestablishes an office within the Department of the Interior to focus on \nNative Hawaiian issues and to serve as a liaison between Native \nHawaiians and the Federal government. Finally, it establishes an \ninteragency coordinating group to be composed of representatives of \nfederal agencies which administer programs and implement policies \nimpacting Native Hawaiians.\n  This measure does not establish entitlements or special treatment for \nNative Hawaiians based on race. This measure focuses on the political \nrelationship afforded to Native Hawaiians based on the United States' \nrecognition of Native Hawaiians as the aboriginal, indigenous peoples \nof Hawaii. As we all know, the United States' history with its \nindigenous peoples has been dismal. In recent decades, however, the \nUnited States has engaged in a policy of self-determination and self-\ngovernance with its indigenous peoples. Government-to-government \nrelationships provide indigenous peoples with the opportunity to work \ndirectly with the federal government on policies affecting their lands, \nnatural resources and many other aspects of their well-being. While \nfederal policies towards Native Hawaiians have paralleled that of \nNative American Indians and Alaska Natives, the federal policy of self-\ndetermination and self-governance, has not yet been extended to Native \nHawaiians. This measure extends this policy to Native Hawaiians, thus \nfurthering the process of reconciliation between Native Hawaiians and \nthe United States.\n  This measure does not impact program funding for American Indians and \nAlaska Natives. Federal programs for Native Hawaiian health, education \nand housing are already administered by the Departments of Health and \nHuman Services, Education, and Housing the Urban Development. The bill \nI introduce today contains a provision which makes clear that this \nbill does not authorize eligibility for participation in any programs \nand services provided by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n\n  This bill does not authorize gaming in Hawaii. In fact, it clearly \nstates that the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, IGRA, does not apply to \nthe Native Hawaiian governing entity. Hawaii is one of two states in \nthe Union which criminally prohibits all forms of gaming. Therefore, I \nwant to make clear that this bill would not authorize the Native \nHawaiian governing entity to conduct any type of gaming in Hawaii.\n  Finally, this measure does not preclude Native Hawaiians from seeking \nalternatives in the international arena. This measure focuses on self-\ndetermination within the framework of federal law and seeks to \nestablish equality in the federal policies extended towards American \nIndians, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians.\n  We introduced similar legislation during the 106th Congress. While \nthe bill was passed by the House of Representatives, the Senate failed \nto consider it prior to the adjournment of the 106th Congress. The \nlegislation was widely supported by our indigenous brethren, American \nIndians and Alaska Natives. It was also supported by the Hawaii State \nLegislature which passed a resolution supporting a government-to-\ngovernment relationship between Native Hawaiians and the United States. \nSimilar resolutions were passed by the Japanese American Citizens' \nLeague and the National Education Association.\n  Mr. President, when most people think of Hawaii, they think of \nparadise. I agree, it is paradise. However, the essence of Hawaii is \ncaptured not by the physical beauty of its islands, but by the beauty \nof its people. Those who have lived in Hawaii have a unique demeanor \nand attitude which is appropriately described as the ``Aloha'' spirit. \nThe people of Hawaii demonstrate the Aloha spirit through their \nactions--through their generosity, through their appreciation of the \nenvironment and natural resources, through their willingness to care \nfor each other, through their genuine friendliness.\n  The people of Hawaii share many ethnic backgrounds and cultures. This \nmix of culture and tradition is based on the unique history of Hawaii. \nThe Aloha spirit is generated from the pride we all share in the \nculture and tradition of Hawaii's indigenous, native peoples, the \nNative Hawaiians. Hawaii's state motto, ``Ua mau ke'ea `o ka `aina i ka \npono,'' which means ``the life of the land is perpetuated in \nrighteousness,'' captures the culture of Native Hawaiians. Prior to \nwestern contact, Native Hawaiians lived in an advanced society, in \ndistinct and structured communities steeped in science. The Native \nHawaiians honored their aina, land, and environment, and therefore \ndeveloped methods of irrigation, agriculture, aquaculture, navigation, \nmedicine, fishing and other forms of subsistence whereby the land and \nsea were efficiently used without waste or damage. Respect for the \nenvironment formed the basis of their culture and tradition. It is from \nthis culture and tradition that the Aloha spirit, which is demonstrated \nthroughout Hawaii, by all of its people, has endured and flourished.\n  In 1978, the people of Hawaii acted to preserve Native Hawaiian \nculture and tradition by amending Hawaii's state constitution to \nestablish the Office of Hawaiian Affairs to give expression to the \nright of self-determination and self-governance at the state level for \nHawaii's indigenous peoples, Native Hawaiians. Starting with statehood, \nHawaii endeavored to address and protect the rights and concerns of \nHawaii's indigenous peoples in accordance with authority delegated \nunder federal policy. The constraints of this approach are evident. \nThis bill extends the federal policy of self-determination and self-\ngovernance to Native Hawaiians at the federal level through a \ngovernment-to-government relationship with the Native Hawaiian \ngoverning entity.\n\n  This measure is not being introduced to circumvent the 1999 United \nStates Supreme Court decision in the case of Rice v. Cayetano. The Rice \ncase was a voting rights case whereby the Supreme Court held that the \nState of Hawaii must allow all citizens of Hawaii to vote for the Board \nof Trustees of a quasi-state agency, the Office of Hawaiian Affairs.\n  The Office of Hawaiian Affairs was established by citizens of the \nState of Hawaii as part of the 1978 State of Hawaii Constitutional \nConvention. The Office of Hawaiian Affairs administers\n\n[[Page S3758]]\n\nprograms and services for Native Hawaiians. The State constitution \nprovided for nine trustees who were Native Hawaiian to be elected by \nNative Hawaiians. Following the Supreme Court's ruling in Rice v. \nCayetano, the elections were not only open to all citizens in the State \nof Hawaii, but non-Hawaiians were deemed eligible to serve on the Board \nof Trustees. Whereas the Rice case dealt with voting rights and the \nState of Hawaii, the measure we introduce today addresses the federal \npolicy of self-determination and self-governance and does not involve \nthe Office of Hawaiian Affairs.\n  This measure is critical to the people of Hawaii as it begins a \nprocess to address many longstanding issues facing Hawaii's indigenous \npeoples and the State of Hawaii. By addressing and resolving these \nmatters, we begin a process of healing, a process of reconciliation not \nonly within the United States, but within the State of Hawaii. The time \nhas come for us to be able to address these deeply rooted issues in \norder for us to be able to move forward as one.\n  I cannot emphasize how important this measure is for the people of \nHawaii. While Hawaii will always be known for its physical beauty, its \ntrue essence is in its people. The time has come to provide Hawaii's \nindigenous peoples with the opportunity to engage in a government-to-\ngovernment relationship with the United States. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to enact this critical measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 747. A bill to authorize the Attorney General to make grants to \nlocal educational agencies to carry out school violence prevention and \nschool safety activities in secondary schools; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we have seen three shootings and watched \nthree young children lose their lives in the past four weeks. Two of \nthese were in my state of California; the latest shooting was in my \ncolleagues' state of Indiana. These shootings have been terrifying for \nall of us, children, parents, community members, and the nation as a \nwhole. We must stop these acts of violence, now. We cannot wait for \nanother young life to slip through our hands.\n  These incidents have reminded us that no place is safe from gun \nviolence. Principals think about the safety of their schools every day; \nparents worry about the safety of their children's classrooms every \nday; and children walk to school unsure of their own safety every day. \nThis is sad, but this is the reality.\n  Today I am proposing to change this reality. My bill reaffirms our \ncommitment to school safety by creating a permanent School Safety Fund. \nThis Fund will allow the Attorney General to provide grants to school \ndistricts so that they can create their own comprehensive school safety \nstrategies, incorporating both violence prevention and school safety \nactivities.\n  What might be included in these safety strategies?\n  Schools could establish hotlines and tiplines, so that students could \nanonymously report potentially dangerous situations. They could hire \nmore community police officers and purchase security equipment. I would \nargue that all schools could use more counselors, psychologists, and \nschool social workers, these funds will help hire them. Schools could \nuse the funds to train teachers and administrators to identify the \nearly warning signs of troubled youth. They could also use the funds to \nteach our students conflict resolution programs, and to set up a \nmentoring program for students.\n  The bottom line is clear: each school needs to decide the extent of \nits problem, and decide what solution would be best for its community. \nMy bill gives school districts the leeway they need to deal with school \nsafety, providing federal funds to attack school violence where it \nhappens: in the schools.\n  This approach, in and of itself, is not a novel idea. Since 1999, the \nfederal government has funded a program called ``Safe Schools \nInitiative.'' A collaboration between the Department of Justice, the \nDepartment of Education, and the Department of Health and Human \nServices, Safe Schools provides grants to school districts to do the \nactivities I outlined above. In fact, 77 school districts have already \nbeen awarded funds. Why, then, is my bill necessary?\n  My bill does two important things. One, it writes this program into \nlaw. Currently, the Appropriations Committee decides year-to-year \nwhether to fund this initiative. This program is important--important \nenough to warrant an authorization. My amendment codifies these grants \nthrough fiscal year 2006.\n  Second, and perhaps most important, my bill speaks to how these \ngrants are funded. All funding would come directly from the Violent \nCrime Reduction Trust Fund. And rather than set a specific \nauthorization level--rather than pull a number out of thin air and \ndeclare that number the ``need'', my bill would give discretion to the \nAttorney General to decide how many grants should be awarded, and how \nmuch money each grantee should receive.\n  For example, if a crisis arises, the Attorney General has the \nflexibility to distribute grants as he sees fit. He does not have to \nwait for Congress to act, or watch as Congress fails to act. He can \nidentify the need, and address it immediately. On the flip side, if \nschool safety problems improve, as all of us hope, then the Attorney \nGeneral can spend less on school safety. Again, it is up to his \ndiscretion.\n  You know as well as I do that school safety is a serious problem. We \ncannot simply stand by the wayside and allow violence to continue \ndisrupting the lives of students and communities. My bill recognizes \nthe widespread reach of these violent outbreaks, and tells communities \nthat the federal government will not fail them. Communities are eager \nto protect their schoolchildren, and this bill will give them an \nopportunity to do so.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 748. A bill to make schools safer by waiving the local matching \nrequirement under the Community Policing program for the placement of \nlaw enforcement officers in local schools; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, last month there were two school shootings \nin my state. A mere seventeen days and six miles away from each other, \nthey claimed the lives of two students and wounded eighteen others. \nThese shootings were terrible tragedies for their communities, and a \npainful reminder of the fragile security of our nation's schools.\n  To combat these tragic acts of violence, many schools employ safety \nstrategies that protect the millions of children, teenagers and adults \nthat attend them every single day. The federal government plays a role \nin many of these programs. My amendment speaks to one of them: COPS In \nSchools.\n  Although we passed the COPS program in 1994, it was not until 1998 \nthat the Department of Justice created a specific COPS In Schools \nprogram. Since then, nearly 3,800 police officers have been placed in \n1,800 school districts across the nation. California alone has put 270 \nnew police officers in schools across the state.\n  Unfortunately, not all schools are so lucky. At the time of last \nmonth's shooting at Santana High School in Santee, California, the \nschool happened by pure luck to have two law enforcement officials near \ncampus. The shooting spree at Santana High School lasted a mere six \nminutes. In this time, more than 30 rounds were shot, two teenagers \nwere killed, and 13 people were wounded. It is dreadful to imagine what \nmight have happened if the police had not responded so quickly.\n  An even more poignant situation, which underscored the absolutely \nvital role police officers play in our nation's schools, was the school \nshooting in El Cajon, California. This time, there were no deaths. A \npolice officer--who had been stationed at Granite Hills High School \nafter the Santana High School shooting occurred--responded immediately \nafter hearing gunshots and managed to stop the shooter from claiming \ninnocent lives. Had a police officer not been on campus, we may have \nbeen counting fatalities instead of injuries.\n  Make no mistake, the police officers put in schools by the COPS In \nSchools program are not there to simply patrol the hallways, nor are \nthey there to make schools feel like prisons. Police officers in \nschools serve an important purpose: they work with school staff to \ndevelop anti-crime policies on campus,\n\n[[Page S3759]]\n\nimplement procedures to ensure a safer school environment, and reassure \nparents that a police officer is there to deal with those students that \nmight cause problems.\n  Local governments are required to provide 25 percent of the funding \nto hire these police officers, unless the Attorney General grants them \na waiver. Under Attorney General Janet Reno, communities routinely \nreceived federal funding to hire police officers for schools without \nhaving to contribute matching funds. This was extremely generous, and I \nam hopeful that this policy will continue.\n  To ensure that it does, my bill permanently waives the local matching \nfund requirement for placing a police officer in a school. No child, \nteenager or adult attending one of America's public schools should be \nput in danger simply because of a lack of funding. Communities should \nbe able to put police officers in their schools, period. My bill will \nallow them to do just that.\n  We know that having police officers in schools works. They help \nensure the safety of our schools, our schoolchildren and our faculty \nevery single day. I encourage my colleagues to show their commitment to \nour students by supporting this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FITZGERALD (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. DeWine, Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Collins, Mr. Lieberman, \n        Mr. McCain, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Feinstein, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mr. Smith of Oregon, and Mr. Torricelli):\n  S. 749. A bill to provide that no Federal income tax shall be imposed \non amounts received by victims of the Nazi regime or their heirs or \nestates, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Holocaust \nSurvivors Tax Fairness Act of 2001. This important legislation would \nprevent the federal government from imposing the federal income tax on \nHolocaust restitution or compensation payments that victims of their \nheirs may receive.\n  More than 50 years after the end of World War II, many banks and \ncompanies in Europe are beginning to return stolen assets to survivors \nof the Holocaust and their heirs. In August of 1998, two of the largest \nbanks in Switzerland agreed to distribute $1.25 billion as restitution \nfor assets wrongfully withheld during the Nazi reign. And in February \nof 1999, the German government agreed to establish a fund to compensate \nvictims of the Holocaust. The legislation I am introducing ensures that \nthe beneficiaries of these settlements and other Holocaust restitution \nor compensation arrangements can exclude the proceeds from taxable \nincome on their federal income tax forms.\n  Holocast survivors and their families have lived through unspeakable \ntragedies. While the restitution settlements pale in comparison to what \nthey have lost, this measure ensures that survivors can keep all of \nwhat was returned to them without being unnecessarily burdened by \ntaxes.\n  The Congress must send a clear message that to allow the federal \ngovernment to tax away any reparations obtained by Holocaust survivors \nor their families because of their persecution by the Nazis or their \nsympathizers is simply unacceptable. Given that the average age of \nHolocaust survivors now exceeds 80 years of age, we believe it is \nimperative that the Congress act now to prevent the federal government \nfrom attempting to tax this money.\n  Similar legislation was agreed to by the Senate as an amendment to \nthe Taxpayer Refund Act of 1999. The provision was retained in \nconference and included in the Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act of 1999. \nThe final bill was vetoed, however, preventing this important provision \nregarding Holocaust reparations from becoming law.\n  After over 50 years of injustice, Holocaust survivors and their \nfamilies are reclaiming what is rightfully theirs. Even as we support \nthese efforts to reclaim stolen property, we must do our part in \nprotecting the proceeds.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN:\n  S. 750. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthe same tax treatment for danger pay allowance as for combat pay; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, today I introduce a bill which would right \na wrong, a small wrong, but a wrong nevertheless. It affects a handful \nof our nation's diplomats who serve in the world's most dangerous \nplaces: places like Bosnia and Lebanon. Our diplomats serve in some \npretty difficult places, often in harm's way, just as our soldiers do.\n  These diplomats who serve in the most dangerous places receive a \nspecial allowance, which is aptly called ``danger pay.'' This allowance \nis not unlike that paid to our military when they are in combat. In \nfact, in some places where our military and diplomatic personnel serve \nside by side, both receive a special allowance for their sacrifices.\n  The military justifiably receives this benefit tax-free. But our \ndiplomatic personnel do not. Through an oversight in the Internal \nRevenue code, diplomats are taxed on their danger pay, even though they \noften face similar hardships and dangers. I think that's wrong.\n  The bill I introduce today, I have a bill which would right this \nwrong. It affects just a handful of people. But to them it will serve \nas recognition of the sacrifice they make when they represent the \nAmerican people in dangerous places overseas.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 750\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TREATMENT OF DANGER PAY ALLOWANCE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subchapter C of chapter 80 of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to provisions affecting more \n     than one subtitle) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 7874.

A bill to express the sense of the Senate concerning a new \ndrinking water standard for arsenic; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, when Americans turn on their taps, they \nexpect the water that comes out to be clean and safe. Unfortunately, \nthat is not always the case.\n  I rise today to ask my colleagues to join me in expressing our \nsupport for the new health and science-based standard for arsenic in \ndrinking water. The stronger standard can protect millions of Americans \nfrom a known carcinogen. A 1999 National Academy of Sciences report \nconcluded that chronic ingestion of arsenic causes bladder, lung, and \nskin cancer. The Administration's proposal to withdraw this new \nstandard puts the public health at risk.\n  The science is clear. The National Academy of Sciences has concluded\n\n[[Page S3760]]\n\nthat the current standard, which has not been revised in nearly 60 \nyears, does not meet EPA's goal of public-health protection and has \nurged that it be revised as quickly as possible.\n  The new, more protective arsenic standard of 10 parts per billion \nwould put our national drinking water standard for arsenic in line with \ndrinking water standards set at the state level, as well as \ninternational standards. The World Health Organization has established \na guideline for arsenic in drinking water of 10 parts per billion, \nindicating that the value would be even lower if it were based on \nhealth concerns alone, without consideration for the technological and \nfinancial capabilities of certain countries.\n  Withdrawing this important new drinking water standard for arsenic \nalso creates uncertainty for communities across the country that will \nultimately need to construct or upgrade water treatment facilities to \nmeet the new standard. These communities need and deserve as much time \nas is possible to come into compliance with the new standard.\n  This bill that I am introducing today expresses the Sense of the \nSenate that to provide maximum protection for public health and a \nmaximum amount of time for communities to accommodate a new drinking \nwater standard for arsenic, the new standard for arsenic in drinking \nwater should be set no later than the statutory deadline of June 22, \n2001.\n  Rather than rolling back science-based, public health standards for \nour nation's drinking water, we should be rolling up our sleeves and \ninvesting in our water infrastructure so that America's families can \nrest assured that their drinking water is clean and safe.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BURNS:\n  S. 752. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nreclassify computer equipment as 3-year property for purposes of \ndepreciation; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today, to introduce the Technology \nDepreciation Reform Act of 2001. This bill will update the U.S. Tax \nCode to reflect the evolution of the computer and other high-tech \nindustries.\n  High-tech hardware is subjected to an outdated tax code. Currently, \nbusinesses must depreciate their computer equipment over a five year \nperiod. I believe this five year depreciation life for tax purposes is \nclearly outdated. Many companies today must update their computers as \nquickly as every 14 months in order to stay current technologically.\n  Depreciation schedules for technology assets have not been reformed \nsince 1986. This legislation will amend the U.S. Tax Code by reducing \nthe depreciation schedule for high-tech equipment from five years to \nthree years.\n  I believe it is time to update an outdated tax code to reflect the \nrealities of today's technology-based workplace. A five year \ndepreciation schedule for business computers is no longer realistic.\n  The Computer Depreciation Reform Act allows every company, from the \nneighborhood real estate office, to the local hospital, to the local \nbank to depreciate their computer equipment on a three year schedule. \nAs a result, these companies will no longer be forced to pay for their \nhigh-tech equipment long after its useful life has become obsolete.\n  In short, the tax code is outdated for high-tech hardware. The five \nyear schedule for technology assets is particularly outdated. In fact, \nthis is an ice age for computer technologies. As the chairman of the \nCommunications Subcommittee, I am very award of the impact this is \nhaving on small businesses. Congress has not addressed this issue since \n1986. However, the industry has evolved dramatically since that time.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to update the tax code to reflect the realities of today's \ntechnological workplace.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Burns, Mr. \n        Conrad, Mr. Enzi, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n        Crapo, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Dayton, Mr. \n        Inouye, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Allard, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 753. A bill to amend the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \nStates to prevent circumvention of the sugar tariff-rate quotas; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BREAUX, Mr. President, unfair trade practices cannot and will not \nbe tolerated. American jobs are hurt, industry suffers, and the economy \nloses.\n  Importing stuffed molasses into the United States is a classic \nexample of an unfair trade practice being conducted in this country. \nIts importation circumvents the United States' GATT-legal sugar import \ntariff rate quota. It's time to end this scheme because our domestic \nsugar industry is being hurt by it.\n  As a trade practice, importing stuffed molasses is a crafty, refined \nscheme.\n  Stuffed molasses, as a product, consists of refined sugar being mixed \nwith water and molasses for the purpose of disguising the refined sugar \nso it can evade the United States' GATT-legal tariff rate quota.\n  In its disguised state, stuffed molasses has no legitimate commercial \nuse. It does, however, circumvent our legitimate sugar import tariff \nrate quota.\n  Once stuffed molasses is brought into the United States, the refined \nsugar is extracted from the water and molasses and sold in the United \nStates' refined liquid sugar market. Once imported and extracted, it \ndisplaces legitimately-produced United States' sugar and legitimately-\nimported sugar from the 40 countries which export sugar to this country \nunder the tariff rate quota.\n  The United States company which imports stuffed molasses into this \ncountry, a subsidiary of an international conglomerate, brings it in \nthrough a tariff category for certain molasses products for which there \nis little or no tariff.\n  Senator Larry Craig and I, as Co-Chairmen of the Senate Sweetener \nCaucus, are introducing today a bipartisan bill which would require the \nsame tariff to be applied to stuffed molasses as is applicable \ncurrently to refined sugar imports.\n  We are pleased that 15 other senators have joined us in introducing \nthe bill. We deeply appreciate their interest and support.\n  In January of this year, USDA issued a sugar and sweetener report \nwhich included the department's analysis of the stuffed molasses \nsituation. For the period 1995/1996 to 1999/2000, USDA's report says \nstuffed molasses imports escalated from 8,056 short tons raw value to \n118,105 short tons raw value, an increase approaching 1400 percent.\n  USDA's report also says stuffed molasses imports for 1999/2000 were \nthe equivalent of 10.5 percent of imports under the raw and refined \nsugar tariff rate quotas for that period.\n  The USDA report forecasts Fiscal Year 2001 imports of stuffed \nmolasses to increase to 125,000 short tons raw value. It also says the \nsugar used to make this disguised product originates in such countries \nas Australia and Brazil and is processed into stuffed molasses in \nCanada, from where it enters the United States.\n  Our bipartisan legislation makes it clear that its purpose is to stop \nan unfair trade practice by applying a legitimate tariff to a concocted \nproduct which is circumventing our GATT-legal tariff rate quota. It \ndoes not affect any other legitimately-traded molasses or molasses \nproduct which has been traded historically and has legitimate \ncommercial uses.\n  This unfair trade practice, is completely unacceptable. It is a total \nrejection of all that is fair in trade. It must be stopped. Our \nlegislation is designed to do just that. I join with Senator Craig and \nall of the bill's original cosponsors to invite all other Senators who \noppose unfair trade practices to join us in cosponsoring the bill and \nvoting for its passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. \n        Durbin):\n  S. 754. A bill to enhance competition for prescription drugs by \nincreasing the ability of the Department of Justice and Federal Trade \nCommission to enforce existing antitrust laws regarding brand name \ndrugs and generic drugs; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in the last Congress I introduced a bill, \nS.\n\n[[Page S3761]]\n\n2993, with Senator Kohl to give the Federal Trade Commission, FTC, and \nthe Department of Justice, DOJ, the ability to effectively enforce \nantitrust laws concerning contract and payment arrangements between \ndrug companies which could hurt consumers.\n  Unfortunately, no action was taken on that Leahy-Kohl bill, and the \nnewspapers are now full of articles about allegations that Shering-\nPlough paid $90 million to generic drug manufacturers to delay sales of \na low-cost generic drug taken by heart patients.\n  While these allegations have yet to be resolved for those particular \ncompanies, this story highlights the need to pass legislation to \nprevent this type of problem from happening in the future.\n  If Dante were writing The Inferno today, he might well have reserved \na special place for those who engage in these anti-consumer \nconspiracies.\n  The Federal Trade Commission deserves credit for exposing this \nproblem, during last Congress and this Congress. Under the bill we are \nintroducing today, companies are required to give the FTC and the \nJustice Department the information they need to prevent manufacturers \nof patented drugs--often brand-name drugs--from simply paying generic \ndrug companies to keep lower-cost products off the market.\n  These deals which prevent competition hurt senior citizens, hurt \nfamilies, and cheat healthcare providers.\n  These pharmaceutical giants and their generic partners then share the \nprofits gained from cheating American families.\n  The companies have been able to get away with this by signing secret \ndeals with each other not to compete. Our bill, the ``Drug Competition \nAct of 2001'', will expose these deals and subject them to immediate \ninvestigation and appropriate action by the Federal Trade Commission or \nthe Justice Department.\n  This solves the most difficult problem faced by federal \ninvestigators: finding out about the improper deals. This bill does not \nchange the so-called Hatch-Waxman Act, it does not amend FDA law, and \nit does not slow down the drug approval process. It allows existing \nantitrust laws to be enforced by ensuring that the enforcement agencies \nhave information about no-compete deals. The same confidentiality \nrequirements will still apply to the FTC and to DOJ, as under current \nlaw.\n  The issue of making deals which prevent competition was addressed in \na New York Times editorial titled, ``Driving Up Drug Prices,'' \npublished on July 26, 2000. The editorial noted that even though the \nFTC ``is taking aggressive action to curb the practice. It needs help \nfrom Congress to close loopholes in federal law.''\n  This bill is that help, and the bill slams the door shut on would-be \nviolators by exposing the deals to our competition enforcement \nagencies.\n  Under current law, manufacturers of generic drugs are encouraged to \nchallenge weak or invalid patents on brand-name drugs so that consumers \ncan enjoy lower generic drug prices.\n  Current law grants these generic companies a temporary protection \nfrom competition to the first manufacturer that gets permission to sell \na generic drug before the patent on the brand-name drug expires.\n  This approach then gives the generic drug manufacturer a 180-day head \nstart on other generic companies.\n  That was a good idea. The unfortunate loophole that has been open to \nexploitation is the fact that secret deals can be made that allow the \nmanufacturer of the generic drug to claim the 180-day grace period, to \nblock other generic drugs from entering the market, while, at the same \ntime, getting paid by the brand-name manufacturer for not selling the \nlower-cost generic drug.\n  The bill we are introducing today will shut this loophole down for \ncompanies who want to cheat the public, but keeps the system the same \nfor companies engaged in true competition with each other. This bill \nwould give the FTC or the Justice Department the information they need \nto take quick and decisive action against companies driven more by \ngreed than by good sense.\n  It is important for Congress not to overreact to these outrages by \nthrowing out the good with the bad. Most generic companies want to take \nadvantage of this 180-day provision and deliver quality generic drugs \nat much lower costs for consumers. We should not eliminate the \nincentive for them to do that.\n  Instead, we should let the FTC and DOJ look at every single deal that \ncould lead to abuse so that only the deals that are consistent with the \nintent of that law will be allowed to stand.\n  We look forward to suggestions from other Members on this matter and \nfrom brand-name and generic manufacturers who will work with us to make \nsure this loophole is closed. .\n  We are pleased that Congressman Waxman will introduce a companion \nbill in the House of Representatives. I look forward to working with \nhim and with the other cosponsors in this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a brief summary of the Drug Competition \nAct be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Summary of the Drug Competition Act of 2001\n\n       The bill facilitates Federal Trade Commission and \n     Department of Justice confidential review of agreements \n     between brand-name drug manufacturers and potential generic \n     competitors so that they can more efficiently enforce \n     existing antitrust laws.\n       The bill covers brand-name drug manufacturers and generic \n     manufacturers that enter into agreements regarding the sale \n     or manufacture of a potentially competing generic equivalent \n     (of any particular brand-name drug).\n       In cases where those agreements could have the effect of \n     limiting sales of that generic-equivalent drug, or could \n     limit the research or development of that competing generic, \n     both (or all) companies are required to file the texts of \n     those agreements with the Federal Trade Commission and with \n     the Attorney General within 10 business days after the \n     agreement is executed.\n       Failure to file may result in a civil penalty of not more \n     that $20,000, per day. The Act would take effect 90 days \n     after enactment.\n       No existing time limits, requirements, or patent or drug \n     approval systems are affected by this limited filing \n     requirement. The bill does not amend the Sherman Act, other \n     antitrust laws, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Hatch-\n     Waxman Act or other generic drug laws, the Federal Food, Drug \n     and Cosmetic Act, or any patent or drug safety law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3761-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3761-S3762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS--APRIL 5, 2001\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 66--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \nRELEASE OF TWENTY-FOUR UNITED STATES MILITARY PERSONNEL CURRENTLY BEING \n               DETAINED BY THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n  Mr. THOMAS (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Warner, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \nMurkowski, Mr. Biden, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \nBrownback, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. \nLieberman, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Corzine, Mr. \nMcConnell, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \nRockefeller, Mrs. Carnahan, Mr. Conrad, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. \nCrapo, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Campbell, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Collins, \nMr. Edwards, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \nJohnson, and Ms. Snowe) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n  Mrs. CLINTON.

He was killed when he \nwas only 34 years of age, September 6, 1877. He was stabbed in the back \nby a soldier at Fort Robinson, Nebraska, while he was under U.S. Army \nprotection. During his life he was a great leader of his people. Crazy \nHorse was warrior and a military genius. His battle strategies are \nstudied to this day at West Point.\n  Crazy Horse was bestowed with the honor of becoming a Shirt Wearer. \nThis honor is comparable to duties like that of the Secretary of State.\n  Crazy Horse defended his people and their way of life in the only \nmanner he knew, but only after he saw the treaty of 1868 broken. He \ntook to the warpath only after he saw his friend Conquering Bear \nkilled; only after he saw the failure of the government agents to bring \nrequired treaty guarantees such as food, clothing, shelter and \nnecessities for existence. In battle the Sioux war leader would rally \nhis warriors with the cry, ``It is a good day to fight, it is a good \nday to die.''\n  Throughout recent history, a memorial commemorating the life of this \ngreat warrior is under construction in my state of South Dakota. I \nwould like to take these efforts one step further and designate \nSeptember 6, 2001, the 124th anniversary of Crazy Horse's death, as \n``National Crazy Horse Day.''\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in the commemoration of this great \nhero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3762-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 69--RESOLUTION CONGRATULATING THE FIGHTING IRISH OF \n THE UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME FOR WINNING THE 2001 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL \n                              CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. BAYH (for himself and Mr. Lugar) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Res. 71\n\n       Whereas the Postal Service has announced it may consider \n     reducing its six-day mail delivery service to five days, \n     ending Saturday home delivery to offset a projected budget \n     shortfall;\n       Whereas the six-day mail delivery is an essential service \n     that U.S. citizens have relied on since 1912, particularly \n     those working families who depend on their paychecks to \n     arrive in the mail on time;\n       Whereas many senior citizens only have one source of income \n     through their Social Security checks, which arrive in the \n     mail and any delays would make it difficult for them to \n     purchase items such as food and medicine; and\n       Whereas ending Saturday home mail delivery will result in \n     inevitable delays in mail delivery and an increase in costs \n     for employee overtime to control the back-up of mail: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the Sense of the Senate that it is \n     strongly opposed to the elimination of Saturday home and \n     business mail delivery and calls on the United States Postal \n     Service to take all of the necessary steps to assure that \n     six-day home and business mail delivery not be reduced.\n\n\n[[Page S3763]]\n\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a resolution \nregarding recent reports coming out of the U.S. Postal Service.\n  On Tuesday, the United States Postal Service in an effort to cut \ncosts announced that it may eliminate Saturday mail delivery, thus \nreducing home delivery to five days a week.\n  I believe this would be a terrible mistake. Saturday delivery is an \nessential service, and we should make sure it continues. Eliminating \nthe sixth day will lead to inevitable delays for mail delivery as well \nas higher costs to pay overtime to our postal workers.\n  So my resolution would put the Senate on record as strongly opposed \nto a cut in service. The amendment will also call on the governing body \nof the Postal Service to take the necessary steps to ensure the \nessential service goes uninterrupted.\n  Cutting out the Saturday delivery would represent a major change for \nthe service, a service that many Americans, especially our seniors who \ndon't use e-mail, have depended on for decades.\n  People across America depend on the services of the Postal system. \nMillions of working families depend on the mail for their pay checks, \nmillions of seniors depend on the mail for their Social Security \nchecks, and millions of poor Americans can't afford computers and don't \nhave access to things like e-mail which many of us take for granted. We \nshould not let them down.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3763-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 351.

Mr. President, if I could take a moment while Senator \nDaschle is present, I thank the managers of this legislation on behalf \nof all the Senate. Being chairman of a committee and ranking member of \na committee always has its challenges. And when you manage a bill on \nthe floor, any of them can present difficulties and take quite some \ntime. But probably no bill is any more difficult than the budget \nresolution because you have so many different parts. You are dealing \nwith mandatory programs, appropriated accounts, the aggregate numbers, \nand those categories, as well as what you are going to do with regard \nto tax policy. It is not an easy job.\n  I must say that Senator Domenici, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, and Senator Kent Conrad, the ranking Democrat on the \ncommittee, have done an excellent job. We really appreciate it. It has \nbeen long hours. But I watched you working last night and again this \nmorning, and I am sure there are many Senators who would not have \nbelieved we would be where we are at this moment--20 minutes to 3--\nhaving completed a bipartisan budget resolution.\n\n  I am sure many of us would make changes and say it is not perfect, \nbut in the years I have watched votes on budget resolutions--and they \nnow go back over some 25 or 26 years since we first started the budget \nresolution--I only remember two or three times where it was really a \nbipartisan budget resolution. This vote of 65-35 was, I think, a good \nvote, a positive vote, and a good step toward completing our work this \nyear on all the different components of this bill. So I congratulate \nyou and thank you for your work.\n  I say to Senator Daschle, would you like to comment?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the majority leader will yield, I only add my voice \nto the majority leader's. He has spoken for both of us again in \ncomplimenting our chair as well as our ranking member.\n  This is the first managerial responsibility, under our Budget \nCommittee, that our ranking member has had. I must say, he has made us \nall proud and very grateful. He has done an extraordinary job. And his \nstaff has been very helpful, as we worked through many of the \nlegislative landmines we faced over the course of the last several \ndays.\n  I would also like to thank our Democratic whip, Senator Reid of \nNevada, for the outstanding job he did in helping our ranking member \nand working through the many challenges we faced. He, as he always \ndoes, has been just a tremendous workhorse. Senator Reid deserves our \nthanks and our debt of gratitude as well.\n  I thank the majority leader for yielding.\n  Mr. LOTT. In conclusion, Mr. President, I would like to join in \nexpressing appreciation for Senator Reid. We consider him the utility \nplayer for both sides. He does wonderful work. We do appreciate it.\n  Also, I want to take note that Senator Domenici, as chairman of the \ncommittee or ranking member, has been involved in every budget \nresolution we have worked on since the law went into effect back in the \n1970s; and he has been the manager on our side 14 times.\n  So we have the old pro here, and we have the new ranking member, and \nthey both did a great job and worked together quite well. We do \nappreciate it.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I say to my good friend, Senator Kent \nConrad, it is a pleasure working with you. I extend my congratulations \nfor a superb job. It was a very difficult budget from the standpoint of \nboth of us. In the last 36 hours, you and Harry Reid have been miracle \nworkers. We very much appreciate your willingness to help us get \nthrough this, and get through quickly, so that our Senators can get on \nwith their Easter recess and so that we could do something significant \nbefore we leave.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the majority leader \nand the Democratic leader for their kind comments. It has been terrific \nworking with them. I also want to highlight the work of the chairman of \nthe committee who has done a very fair-handed job of managing the \nBudget Committee. We thank him for his fairness, and we appreciate very \nmuch the working relationship we have established throughout the year.\n  I think our committee was one of the first to reach agreement in this \npower-sharing arrangement. And certainly here on the floor, Senator \nDomenici worked in such a constructive and gracious way. We appreciate \nit very much.\n\n[[Page S3764]]\n\n  If I might talk, for just a moment, on the reasons I voted in \nopposition to this budget resolution after these long hours of work. I \nwould sum it up in the following ways.\n  No. 1, I wanted to do more debt reduction than we ultimately did \nhere. I wanted to reserve 70 percent of the forecasted surpluses for \ndebt reduction. Unfortunately, we fell well short of that. So my first \nconcern with what we passed is there is not sufficient debt reduction.\n  My second concern is that after a detailed analysis of all the \namendments that have passed, we are into the Medicare trust funds in \nthe years 2002, 2005, 2006, and 2007, to the tune of $54 billion. As I \nenunciated when I laid down a budget alternative, I do not think we \nshould use any of the trust funds of Social Security or Medicare for \nany year. So that would be the second reason I voted in opposition.\n  The third reason was that the tax cut we are left with of $1.2 \ntrillion over the 10 years is simply too large to accommodate the kind \nof additional debt paydown that I believe is in the best interest of \nthe country. Instead of paying down the publicly held debt to about \n$500 billion, this budget resolution pays down the publicly held debt \nto about $1.1 trillion. So I would have liked to have seen us pay down \nthe publicly held debt by another $600 billion.\n\n  Finally, Mr. President, in the option that I offered our colleagues, \nwe reserved $800 billion to strengthen Social Security for the long \nterm. This budget will fall far short of that at about $160 billion \nthat is available to strengthen Social Security for the long term.\n  So for those reasons, I voted in opposition.\n  In saying that, I do want to indicate that we improved this budget \nsubstantially. From what we started with--from what we started with; \nnot from my plan, but from what we started with--we reduced the tax \ncut, we increased the amount of publicly held debt paydown, and we \nreserved additional resources for improving education, for a \nprescription drug benefit, for our national defense, and for \nagriculture.\n  So those were important improvements. I just would have liked to have \nseen us do somewhat better. I would have liked to have seen us put more \nof an emphasis on debt reduction. But we will have other opportunities \nto make those points and other opportunities to vote on those \npriorities.\n  I conclude by thanking all of our colleagues for their patience and \ntheir graciousness during this period.\n  I also want to take this moment to thank the staffs who worked so \nhard during this period because these have been long nights and \ndifficult days.\n  I want to start with Mary Naylor, my staff director on the Senate \nBudget Committee, who did a superb job under difficult circumstances; \nand Jim Horney, who is also a top staffer, the deputy staff director \nfor the Senate Budget Committee; Sue Nelson, who produced chart after \nchart that showed us where we stood at every juncture so we knew \nprecisely where we were, which I think helped us make wise decisions; \nLisa Konwinski, our counsel, who Lisa drafted amendment after \namendment, not only for me but for our colleagues, and did a superb \njob; Sarah Kuehl, who has primary responsibility in the Social Security \narea; Steve Bailey, our tax counsel; Dakota Rudesill, who handles \nnational security issues and national defense; Scott Carlson and Tim \nGalvin, who handle agriculture for the committee; Shelley Amdur, who is \nour education specialist; Jim Esquea and Bonnie Galvin; Chad Stone, our \neconomist; Rock Cheung, who helped produce those charts, and I think \nhelped us be more successful than we would have otherwise been; and \ncertainly Karin Kullman, who joined the staff to help us do outreach to \ngroups who were interested in the budget; and, finally, my terrific \npress team, Stu Nagurka and Steve Posner, who had their hands full.\n  Goodness knows, I appreciate the work all of you have done. I \nappreciate very much the long hours you have put in and your real \ndedication. You have made me proud. I think you have helped us improve \nthe budget for our country.\n  I thank the staff on the other side, especially the staff director \nfor Senator Domenici, Bill Hoagland, who is a class act. He deserves \nall of our thanks for the professionalism with which he conducts \nhimself.\n  Mr. President, again, I thank everyone who has made this an \ninteresting first experience for me in my position on the Budget \nCommittee.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3764-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3764-S3765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO ROBERT HOFFMAN\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today to say thank you--thank you \nto my legislative director for the past four years, Mr. Robert Hoffman. \nRobert--my right-hand man--will be leaving Capitol Hill shortly for a \npromising career in the private sector.\n  But I speak for a lot of people on the Hill--Members and staffers, \nalike--when I say that although we are very happy for Robert and we \nwish him well, we are saddened by his upcoming departure and will miss \nhim dearly.\n  We will miss Robert's dedication to this institution.\n  We will miss his optimism and his sense of humor.\n  We will miss his unstoppable work ethic.\n  But most of all, we will just miss him.\n  Robert Hoffman has, himself, become somewhat of an institution here \non Capitol Hill. Almost exactly twelve years ago today--April 3, 1989--\nRobert started working in Washington for former California Senator, \nPete Wilson.\n  Robert, a California native, didn't start off as Senator Wilson's \nlegislative director. Oh no. He started in the mail room. His dogged \ndetermination and his amazing ability to absorb issues quickly \npropelled him upward within the Wilson operation. In less than a year, \nRobert had become a legislative correspondent and within another year, \nhe was working in Sacramento as deputy speech writer after Senator \nWilson became Governor of California.\n  Robert, though, missed Capitol Hill--and Capitol Hill missed him. By \nMay 1991, he was back in Washington, this time working as a legislative \nassistant for another former California Senator, John Seymour. Robert \nthrived as a legislative assistant, handling complex issues ranging \nfrom crime to immigration.\n  In practically no time, Robert was ready for a managerial role. In \nDecember 1992, he started a long tenure with our former colleague from \nSouth Dakota, Senator Larry Pressler.\n  By the young age of only 27, Robert was serving as Senator Pressler's \nlegislative director. Though Robert's loyalty to Governor Wilson called \nhim back for slightly over a year to work as the Governor's Deputy \nDirector of his Washington office, Robert stayed with the Pressler \norganization until January 1997. To this day, Senator Pressler is \nthankful for having had Robert at the helm of his legislative \noperation.\n  The Senator has described Robert as one of the ``all time finest \nlegislative assistants and legislative directors on Capitol Hill. He is \na man of great personal values and decency--a decency that is \ncontagious.''\n  Senator Pressler said it well.\n  I know, too, that Senator Pressler greatly valued--and still values, \nas I do--Robert's deep grasp and understanding of foreign policy and \nnational security matters. Robert accompanied Senator Pressler and \nSenator Specter on a trip to Africa. Senator Pressler speaks fondly of \nthat trip and of Robert's ``superb job of managing it.'' According to \nSenator Pressler: ``Robert made that trip. He got us there and back in \none piece, which was no easy feat! He managed the whole thing, dealt \nwith heads of state, and knew all the issues--forward and back.''\n  Robert came to my office in February 1997. He's been my legislative \ndirector for over four years now. And, during that time, I have learned \na great deal about this fine man.\n  I have learned that he is loyal to a fault.\n  I have learned that he is a workhorse.\n  I have learned that he is an incredible strategist, manager, teacher, \nthinker, leader, and friend.\n  I have also learned that there is nothing Robert Hoffman can't do. To \nuse one of Robert's favorite phrases: ``He just gets it. He just gets \nthe joke.''\n  Robert is one of the best ``big picture'' thinkers I have ever \nencountered. He gets the whole scene; he understands it. He can put \nthings in their\n\n[[Page S3765]]\n\nproper perspective. No one does a better job in taking complex issues, \nsimplifying them and explaining them. He understands how all the pieces \nin a legislative operation fit together.\n  He understands politics.\n  He understands policy.\n  He understands press.\n  That combination of skills--that kind of raw talent and intuitive \nintelligence--is a true rarity here in Washington or anywhere, for that \nmatter.\n  As anyone who has worked with Robert knows, he always gets the job \ndone. No ifs. No buts. No excuses. He just gets the job done. He is a \nfair and tempered negotiator. Certainly, I have seen that. I have seen \nhim in situations where I didn't think we would be successful, and he \nwent into negotiation and came out with a lot better deal than I \nimagined we could achieve. He gets it done in a quiet, thoughtful, \nprofessional way. Robert Hoffman knows how to get bills passed into \nlaw. He knows the ins and outs of the legislative process. And, he has \nthe ability to bring sides together to reach consensus and build \nbipartisan relationships.\n  While Robert's professionalism and work ethic are second to none, I \nwould be remiss to not mention Robert's strength of character and \npersonal integrity.\n  He is a gentleman--a kind man, a sincere man, and a man who cares \nabout people. He cares about every single person in my office.\n  He cares about them on a professional level, and he cares about them \non a personal level. He cares about them as people.\n  Robert Hoffman is a good man, and I am privileged to have had the \nextraordinary opportunity to work with him and call him my friend.\n  As he departs Capitol Hill after twelve fruitful, fearless, and fun \nyears, I wish him and his lovely new wife, Andrea, all the best in the \nworld. Thank you, Robert.\n  Mr. President, those in the Chamber and on Capitol Hill who will miss \nRobert Hoffman will still be able to see him. One of the easiest ways \nto do that is to watch the reruns of ``Little House on the Prairie.'' \nRobert started his professional career actually before he came to \nCapitol Hill. He started as one of the stars on the original version of \n``Little House on the Prairie.'' Those of you who are up late at night \nand who have the opportunity to see a rerun, if you see someone who \nlooks like Robert Hoffman, it is. You will have the opportunity to see \na much younger version of Robert on that show.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 69, submitted earlier today by \nSenators Bayh and Lugar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 69) congratulating the Fighting Irish \n     of the University of Notre Dame for winning the 2001 women's \n     basketball championship.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nIndiana as a cosponsor of this resolution congratulating the women's \nbasketball team of the University of Notre Dame for winning the 2001 \nwomen's basketball championship.\n  This remarkable achievement by the Fighting Irish women's basketball \nteam culminates a season in which Coach Muffet McGraw and her team \nachieved an outstanding 34-2 record. Player Ruth Riley, an Indiana \nnative, earned the titles Big East Player of the Year and Outstanding \nPlayer of the Final Four. Her teammate, Niele Ivey, suffered a sprained \nankle during the semifinal game but persevered to help the Fighting \nIrish win their 68-66 final game victory over the determined Purdue \nUniversity Lady Boilermakers.\n  The women basketball players of Notre Dame offer an example of \ndedication, skill, and sportsmanship as they bring Notre Dame its first \nnational basketball title.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I rise today \nwith my colleague Senator Richard Lugar to introduce a bipartisan \nresolution honoring the University of Notre Dame women's basketball \nteam for winning the school's first ever National Collegiate Athletic \nAssociation, NCAA, Division I basketball championship.\n  On April 1, 2001, this remarkable group of young women--led by senior \nAll-American and native Hoosier Ruth Riley, have taken their place in \nNotre Dame's long and storied tradition of academic and athletic \nexcellence with a victory over the Purdue University Boilermakers.\n  This match-up made NCAA history, as it was the first time two teams \nfrom the same state appeared in the NCAA women's basketball \nchampionship game. I cannot think of a more fitting place from which \nthese two special teams could hail than from Indiana, basketball's \nheartland. It is a wonderful tribute to these two teams and their fine \nuniversities, and an honor for the state of Indiana to gain that \ndistinction.\n  As Hoosiers across our state and basketball fans around the nation \nwatched with excitement and anticipation, both teams put forth a \ntremendous effort that made for a spectacular game. These true \ncompetitors displayed immense talent and ability as they engaged each \nother relentlessly throughout the forty minute championship game. The \ndetermination and commitment of both the Fighting Irish and the \nBoilermakers exemplifies our Hoosier values and serves as a tremendous \nsource of pride for the state of Indiana.\n  Behind every great team is a great coach, and Notre Dame's Muffet \nMcGraw is no exception. Coach McGraw provided the Fighting Irish with \nthe stewardship needed for an outstanding record of thirty-four wins \nand only two losses during the 2000-2001 season, en route to the \nnational championship. The Notre Dame community should be very proud of \nboth Coach McGraw's leadership and her team's outstanding \naccomplishments as student athletes.\n  In dramatic fashion, the Fighting Irish turned around a twelve point \ndeficit and tied the game with one minute remaining. With 5.8 seconds \nremaining, Ms. Riley made two free throws to complete the comeback and \nsecure a 68-66 victory for the Fighting Irish. Ms. Riley, who earned \nthe tournament's Most Outstanding Player honors, was also named \nnational Player of the Year and was a unanimous selection as first team \nAll-American. Through hard work and determination, Ruth Riley and her \nteammates advanced the sport of women's basketball and provided \ninspiration for future generations of young female athletes.\n\n[[Page S3766]]\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 29, S. Con. Res. 23.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 23) expressing the \n     sense of Congress with respect to the involvement of the \n     Government of Libya in the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight \n     103, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to support this resolution \ncondemning Libya for its involvement with the Pan Am 103 Lockerbie \nbombing and reiterating conditions under which sanctions will be \nlifted.\n  The conviction of Abdel Basset al-Megrahi by the Scottish court in \nthe Netherlands for the December 21, 1988 terrorist bombing of Pan Am \nFlight 103 is a victory for the families of the 270 victims, who have \nbeen seeking justice for more than 12 years, a victory for our country, \nwhich was the real target of the terrorist attack, and a victory for \nthe world community in the ongoing battle against international \nterrorism.\n  Now that a Scottish court has concluded that Libya was responsible \nfor the bombing, the hand of the United States has been strengthened in \nour effort to convince the international community that it is premature \nto welcome Libya back into the family of nations. The task will not be \neasy. Oil companies want to invest in the Libyan petroleum sector, and \neven many of our closest allies are anxious to close the book on the \nbombing.\n  Following the verdict, President George Bush wisely stated that the \nUnited States will continue to press Libya to accept responsibility and \ncompensate the families. We must demand full disclosure of what Libya \nknows. The United States must make it clear that we will use our veto \nin the UN Security Council to block any effort to permanently lift \nsanctions before Libya accepts responsibility for the actions of its \nintelligence officer, provides appropriate compensation to the \nfamilies, accounts for its involvement in the bombing, and fully \nrenounces terrorism. These are the conditions demanded by the \ninternational community--not just the United States--and they must be \nenforced before the sanctions are lifted. We must also be prepared to \nimpose stronger sanctions if Qadhafi refuses to cooperate. This \nresolution makes clear that this should be American policy.\n  U.S. sanctions against Libya which prevent trade and investment and \nbar the import of Libyan oil must also remain in place. Although there \nis strong interest by the U.S. oil industry in investing in Libya, the \nAdministration must make clear that profits cannot take priority over \njustice.\n  It is vital to the ongoing battle against international terrorism \nthat all those responsible for this horrible act are brought to \njustice.\n  I am pleased to work with Senator Feinstein on this resolution, and I \nurge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 23) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The concurrent resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 23\n\n       Whereas 270 people, including 189 Americans, were killed in \n     the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, \n     Scotland, on December 21, 1988;\n       Whereas, on January 31, 2001, the 3 judges of the Scottish \n     court meeting in the Netherlands to try the 2 Libyan suspects \n     in the bombing of Pan Am 103 found that ``the conception, \n     planning, and execution of the plot which led to the planting \n     of the explosive device was of Libyan origin'';\n       Whereas the Court found conclusively that Abdel Basset al \n     Megrahi ``caused an explosive device to detonate on board Pan \n     Am 103'' and sentenced him to a life term in prison;\n       Whereas the Court accepted the evidence that Abdel Basset \n     al Megrahi was a member of the Jamahiriyah Security \n     Organization, one of the main Libyan intelligence services;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council Resolutions \n     731, 748, 883, and 1192 demanded that the Government of Libya \n     provide appropriate compensation to the families of the \n     victims, accept responsibility for the actions of Libyan \n     officials in the bombing of Pan Am 103, provide a full \n     accounting of its involvement in this terrorist act, and \n     cease all support for terrorism; and\n       Whereas, contrary to previous declarations by the \n     Government of Libya and its representatives, in the wake of \n     the conviction of Abdel Basset al Megrahi, Colonel Muammar \n     Qadhafi refuses to accept the judgment of the Scottish court \n     or to comply with the requirements of the Security Council \n     under existing resolutions: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n[[Page S3768]]\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This concurrent resolution may be cited as the ``Justice \n     for the Victims of Pan Am 103 Resolution of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the entire international community should condemn, in \n     the strongest possible terms, the Government of Libya and its \n     leader, Colonel Muammar Qadhafi, for support of international \n     terrorism, including the bombing of Pan Am 103;\n       (2) the Government of Libya should immediately--\n       (A) make a full and complete accounting of its involvement \n     in the bombing of Pan Am 103;\n       (B) accept responsibility for the actions of Libyan \n     officials;\n       (C) provide appropriate compensation to the families of the \n     victims of Pan Am 103; and\n       (D) demonstrate in word and deed a full renunciation of \n     support for international terrorism;\n       (3) the President should instruct the United States \n     Permanent Representative to the United Nations to use the \n     voice, and, if necessary, the vote of the United States, to \n     maintain United Nations sanctions against Libya until all \n     conditions laid out or referred to in the applicable Security \n     Council resolutions are met; and\n       (4) the President should instruct the United States \n     Permanent Representative to the United Nations to seek the \n     reimposition of sanctions against Libya currently suspended \n     in the event that Libya fails to comply with those United \n     Nations Security Council resolutions.\n\n     SEC. 3. POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES TOWARD LIBYA.\n\n       It should be the policy of the United States to--\n       (1) oppose the removal of United Nations sanctions until \n     the Government of Libya has--\n       (A) made a full and complete accounting of its involvement \n     in the bombing of Pan Am 103;\n       (B) accepted responsibility for the actions of Libyan \n     officials;\n       (C) provided appropriate compensation to the families of \n     the victims of Pan Am 103; and\n       (D) demonstrated in word and deed a full renunciation of \n     support for international terrorism; and\n       (2) maintain United States sanctions on Libya, including \n     those sanctions on all forms of assistance and all other \n     United States restrictions on trade and travel to Libya, \n     until--\n       (A) the Government of Libya has fulfilled the requirements \n     of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 731, 748, 883, \n     and 1192;\n       (B) the President--\n       (i) certifies under section 620A(c) of the Foreign \n     Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2371(c)) that Libya no \n     longer provides support for international terrorism; and\n       (ii) has provided to Congress an explanation of the steps \n     taken by the Government of Libya to resolve any outstanding \n     claims against that government by United States persons \n     relating to international terrorism; and\n       (C) the Government of Libya is not pursuing weapons of mass \n     destruction or the means to deliver them in contravention of \n     United States law.\n\n     SEC. 4. TRANSMITTAL OF CONCURRENT RESOLUTION.\n\n       The Secretary of the Senate shall transmit a copy of this \n     concurrent resolution to the President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/06/senate-section/article/S3768-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3768-S3769]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n EXPRESSING SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING ESTABLISHMENT OF INTERNATIONAL \n                            EDUCATION POLICY\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 30, S. Con. Res. 7.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 7) expressing the \n     sense of Congress that the United States should establish an \n     international education policy to enhance national security \n     and significantly further United States foreign policy and \n     global competitiveness, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution which had been reported by the Committee on \nForeign Relations with an amendment, an amendment to the preamble, and \nan amendment to the title, as follows:\n\n                             S. Con. Res. 7\n\n       Whereas promoting international education for United States \n     citizens and ensuring access to high level international \n     experts are important to meet national security, foreign \n     policy, economic, and other global challenges facing the \n     United States;\n       Whereas international education entails the imparting of \n     effective global competence to United States students and \n     other citizens as an integral part of their education at all \n     levels;\n       Whereas research indicates that the United States is \n     failing to graduate enough students with expertise in foreign \n     languages, cultures, and policies to fill the demands of \n     business, government, and universities;\n       Whereas, according to the Institute for International \n     Education, less than 10 percent of United States students \n     graduating from college have studied abroad;\n       Whereas, according to the American Council on Education, \n     foreign language enrollments in United States higher \n     education fell from 16 percent in 1960 to just 8 percent \n     today, and the number of 4-year colleges with foreign \n     language entrance and graduation requirements also declined;\n       Whereas educating international students is an important \n     way to impart cross-cultural understanding, to spread United \n     States values and influence, and to create goodwill for the \n     United States throughout the world;\n       Whereas, based on studies by the College Board, the \n     Institute for International Education, and Indiana \n     University, more than 500,000 international students and \n     their dependents contributed an estimated $12,300,000,000 to \n     the United States economy in the academic year 1999-2000;\n       Whereas, according to the Departments of State and \n     Education, the proportion of international students choosing \n     to study in the United States has declined from 40 to 30 \n     percent since 1982;\n       Whereas international exchange programs, which in the past \n     have done much to extend United States influence in the world \n     by educating the world's leaders, as well as educating United \n     States citizens about other nations and their cultures, are \n     suffering from decline; and\n       Whereas American educational institutions chartered in the \n     United States but operating abroad are important resources \n     both for deepening the international knowledge of United \n     States citizens and for nurturing United States ideals in \n     other countries: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring),\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF AN \n                   INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION POLICY FOR THE UNITED \n                   STATES.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the United States should \n     establish an international education policy to enhance \n     national security, significantly further United States \n     foreign policy and economic competitiveness, and promote \n     mutual understanding and cooperation among nations.\n\n     SEC. 2. OBJECTIVES OF AN INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION POLICY FOR \n                   THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       An international education policy for the United States \n     should strive to achieve the following:\n       (1) Enhance the educational infrastructure through which \n     the United States produces citizens with a high level of \n     international expertise, and builds a broad knowledge base \n     that serves the United States.\n       (2) Promote greater diversity of locations, languages, and \n     subjects involved in teaching, research, and study abroad to \n     ensure that the United States maintains a broad international \n     knowledge base.\n       (3) Significantly increase participation in study and \n     internships abroad by United States students.\n       (4) Invigorate citizen and professional international \n     exchange programs and promote the international exchange of \n     scholars.\n       (5) Support visas and employment policies that promote \n     increased numbers of international students.\n       (6) Ensure that a United States college graduate has \n     knowledge of a second language and of a foreign area, as well \n     as a broader understanding of the world.\n       (7) Encourage programs that begin foreign language learning \n     in the United States at an early age.\n       (8) Promote educational exchanges and research \n     collaboration with American educational institutions abroad \n     that can strengthen the foreign language skills and a better \n     understanding of the world by United States citizens.\n       (9) Promote partnerships among government, business, and \n     educational institutions and organizations to provide \n     adequate resources for implementing this policy.\n  Amend the title so as to read: ``Expressing the sense of Congress \nthat the United States should establish an international education \npolicy to further national security, foreign policy, and economic \ncompetitiveness, promote mutual understanding and cooperation among \nnations, and for other purposes.''.\n\n  Mr. DeWINE.

Mr. President, some years ago I read a story by Tolstoy \ntitled, ``How Much Land Does A Man Need?'' Inasmuch as a considerable \ntime has gone by since I last read this story, perhaps I shall say at \nthe beginning that I am largely summarizing the story.\n  The story told of a man who had land hunger. He had orchards and vast \nother properties, but he could never get enough land. One day there \nstood in his presence a stranger who promised him all the land that he \ncould cover in a day for 1,000 rubles. The conditions were that he \nwould have to start at sunrise and that he could travel all day and buy \nas much land as he could cover in a day for 1,000 rubles. He would be \nrequired to return to the starting point by sundown; otherwise he would \nlose both the land that he had covered and the 1,000 rubles.\n  So the man started out at last to get enough land. He took off his \njacket, and as he surveyed the land before him, he thought that this \nwas certainly the richest soil that he had ever seen and the land was \nso level that he felt that never before had he seen such land. He \ntightened his belt, and with the flask of water that his wife had \nprovided to him, he began his journey.\n  At first he walked fast. His plan was to cover a plot of ground 3 \nmiles square. After he covered the first 3 miles, he decided he would \nwalk 3 more miles, and then he walked 3 more miles until at last he had \ncovered 9 miles before he started upon the second side. As he went \nalong, the land seemed to be ever, ever more level, and the soil ever \nmore rich.\n  He completed the second side just as the Sun crossed the meridian. He \nsat down and ate the bread and the cheese that had been prepared by his \nwife. He drank most of the water from the flask, and then turned upon \nthe third side. He completed the third side when the Sun was fairly \nhigh still in the heavens, but he was becoming quite tired. He took off \nhis boots, which were becoming heavy, and he pressed on. He turned upon \nthe fourth side. But strangely enough, the land became less level and \nmore hilly. His arms and legs were scratched by the briars, and his \nfeet had been cut by the stones. The whole landscape had changed to the \nextent that it was very adverse to his being able to continue at the \nsame pace as in the beginning.\n  The Sun kept dropping closer and closer to the horizon. He kept his \neye on the goal. He could see the stranger, waiting at the starting \npoint. His servant had accompanied him and had placed a stake at each \ncorner as a marker for the ground that had been covered.\n  As the Sun was sinking low, the man had become very tired and no \nlonger could he walk upright. He had to crawl on his hands and knees. \nHe could see the dim face of the stranger waiting at the starting \npoint, and upon that stranger's face was a cruel smile. The man reached \nthe starting point just as the Sun went down, but he had overtaxed his \nstrength and he fell dead on the spot.\n  The stranger, who was called Death, said: ``I promised him all the \nland he could cover. You see how much it is: 6 feet long, 2 feet wide. \nI have kept my pledge.'' The servant dug the grave for him.\n  The moral of the story is this: that the love of material things and \nthe greed for gain shrivel the soul and leave the life a miserable \nfailure at last.\n\n[[Page S3770]]\n\n  As we approach the blessed season of Easter, it seems to me to be \nappropriate to reflect a bit about these things which are pretty \nmundane when compared with discussions concerning budget resolutions, \ntaxes, projected surpluses, and so on. But once in a while I think it \nis good to return to the mundane--to the things that perhaps really \ncount most in our lives.\n  Easter is a promise. Easter reminds each of us of the promise that we \ncan live again, and that we can join our loved ones who have gone on \nbefore. To me it is the greatest of all religious days.\n  I suppose that having attained the age of 83, it becomes even more \nmeaningful. I didn't used to think about these things quite as much as \nI do now. But at the age of 83, one doesn't have much to look forward \nto in this life. But there is the hope and the promise that I can see \nmy grandson again, whom I lost 19 years ago.\n  My grandson was killed in a truck crash, and he died on the Monday \nmorning after Easter Sunday in 1982. So the day itself has a particular \nsignificance to me.\n  I remembered that Mary and Martha in the Scriptures went to the tomb \nsubsequent to the crucifixion of Our Lord. When the tomb was opened, \nthey saw an angel who said to them: ``He is risen.''\n  So, if we didn't have that promise to which we can look forward, life \nwould be pretty bleak.\n  I want to think that there will be another life. I believe it. That \nis what I was taught. As I say, if I didn't believe that, certainly at \nthis late period in this earthly life the future would be pretty bleak \nindeed.\n  We live now in a very materialistic age. Things are quite different \nthan they were when I was a lad walking in the hills of Mercer County \nand Raleigh County, WV. Times have changed immensely.\n  But there are some things that don't change. And one of the things \nthat hasn't changed in my life is the belief, as I was taught in the \nbeginning, that there is a Creator, and that there will come a time \nwhen each of us will have to meet the eternal judge and give an \naccounting for our stewardship during this earthly journey.\n  I believe that.\n  I find myself quite out of step from time to time in this \nmaterialistic age and this increasingly materialistic society, for to \nexpress one's belief in a Supreme Being who created the heavens and the \nEarth, who made man in his own image, and made provision for a life \nbeyond the grave, is looked upon by some as a lack of cultural \nsophistication.\n  One who adheres to traditional religious beliefs these days will \nquite often find himself the possessor of views that are incompatible \nwith a modern outlook.\n  Traditional religious beliefs are a thing of the past in some \nquarters. Our intellectual culture in this country, as we stand at the \nbeginning of a new century, and at the beginning of a new millennium, \nappears to be dominated by skepticism, cynicism, agnosticism, and, \nalas, to some degree atheism.\n  Not too long ago, a majority of the Kansas State Board of Education \nacted to ban the teachings of Darwin--Charles Robert Darwin, a great \nBritish naturalist, concerning evolution in the classroom. There was an \naroused interest in the subject. A new Board of Education recently \nrestored evolution to the state science curriculum.\n  Several years ago, I read Charles Darwin's ``Origin of the Species.'' \nI also read his book ``The Descent of Man.'' I wanted to know what \nDarwin was saying. My intellectual curiosities were piqued. I wanted to \nread firsthand his theory about natural selection.\n  But reading Darwin did not shake my faith in a Creator. Reading \nDarwin only strengthened my belief in God's word, and strengthened my \nbelief in the Creator, strengthened my belief in the Bible as a book \nthat was written by man, but written through the inspiration from God.\n\n  Now, let me say, I do not claim to be good. My Bible says that no man \nis good. But I do claim to have been reared by two wonderful persons. \nThey were not very well educated. They did not have much by way of this \nworld's possessions. They could not give me much of anything. But they \ngave me their love, and they taught me to believe in the Scriptures.\n  And so the chronological account of the Creation--and I hold it right \nhere in this book--as related in the Book of Genesis, seems to confirm \nmy understanding of the chronology of Creation as outlined by science. \nI have done considerable reading of both--these Scriptures, and books \nand theses and materials on science.\n  I have three wonderful grandsons and two granddaughters remaining \nafter the death of the oldest grandson. Two of those grandsons are \nphysicists. They have their Ph.D.s in physics, not political science, \nwhich would be much easier, I suppose.\n  I have two fine sons-in-law, one of whom came to this country from \nIran, the old Biblical country of Persia, and who, by the way, is also \na physicist.\n  So my family is well equipped to help maintain this country's cutting \nedge in physics.\n  I am not a physicist, and I am not a scientist, and I am not a \nminister. I do not consider myself to be worthy of standing behind any \naltar in a church. But I do steadfastly believe in the Bible. I believe \nin its teachings. And I believe that the account in Genesis is, in my \nway of looking at it, the greatest scientific essay that was ever \nwritten. That Book of Genesis seems to confirm my understanding, as \nlimited as it may be, of the chronology of Creation, as outlined by the \nscientific articles that I have read.\n  And, after all, how God made man is not so important; but what is \nimportant is that God, a superior intelligence, did make man. The \ndoubters, the skeptics, the non-believers, all of these go out of their \nway to dispute the account of the Creation as presented in Genesis, but \nto the doubters and the skeptics and the cynics, I would refer them to \nthat ancient man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job. And, there, we \nfind the question: ``Canst thou by searching find out God?''\n  So, let the cynics, the doubters, and the skeptics answer God's \nchallenge: ``Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? \nDeclare, if thou hast understanding.\n  ``Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? Or who hath \nstretched the line upon it?\n  ``Whereupon are the foundations thereof? Or who laid the cornerstone \nthereof;\n  ``When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God \nshouted for joy?''\n  My reading of the theory promulgated by that great English \nnaturalist, Darwin, leads me to conclude that there is something to \nwhat Darwin is saying, but let us not carry it too far. I have no \nproblem in putting God's word as revealed in the Holy Bible right up \nagainst the teachings of evolution. I have no problem with that. So I \nhave no problem with teaching the theory of natural selection, as \nsuggested by Darwin, Huxley, and others. But I believe that if the \nDarwinian theory of evolution is to be taught in the classrooms of the \nNation, the biblical account of Creation and other teachings of the \nBible should likewise be presented so that the inquiring young man or \nwoman may have a better understanding of both. Now, I understand the \nconstitutional problem that might arise from such.\n  True it is, that ``Congress shall make no law respecting an \nestablishment of religion,'' but I take this first amendment \nprohibition also to mean that Congress shall make no law respecting an \nestablishment of ``anti-religion''. If high school students are to be \ntaught a theory, such as evolution--I have no problem with that--which \nmay result in non belief concerning God, non belief in religion, it \nseems to me that if we are really interested in the search for truth, \nthe search for knowledge, the search for wisdom, then the student \nshould have equal access to the account of Creation as set forth in the \nBook of Genesis.\n  I believe that, just as children should be taught the difference \nbetween right and wrong, they should also be exposed to the teachings \nof Holy Writ as well as the claims made by proponents of Darwin's \ntheory of evolution.\n  Now, I am not here today suggesting that anybody else needs to be a \nBaptist just because I am a Baptist, or be a Methodist or be a \nPresbyterian or be an Episcopalian or be a Catholic or be of the Jewish \nreligion, or of the religion of Islam. I have already stated\n\n[[Page S3771]]\n\nthat one of my sons-in-law is an Iranian. His father was a devout--a \ndevout--worshiper in the religion of Islam.\n  I am like Samuel Adams. I am not a bigot. I can listen to anybody's \nprayer and will listen to anybody's prayer. But now, back to the \nsubject.\n  I personally find the theory of evolution as set forth in Darwin's \nbook ``The Origin of Species'' to be an enormous piece of work, a \nmarvelous, marvelous display of knowledge on the part of that great \nnaturalist. It reflects great scholarship. It also contains--I am not \nhesitant about saying it at all--but it also contains a great, a huge \nnumber of guesses, hypotheses, conjectures, presumptions, assumptions, \nmere opinions, and considerable guesswork.\n  For example, such phrases as the following are sprinkled throughout \nDarwin's Origin: ``We may infer,'' ``has probably played a more \nimportant part,'' ``it is extremely difficult to come to any \nconclusion,'' ``seems probable,'' ``this change may be safely \nattributed to the domestic duck flying much less and walking more, than \nits wild parents,'' ``I am fully convinced that the common opinion of \nnaturalists is correct,'' ``hence, it must be assumed,'' ``appears to \nhave played an important part,'' ``seems to have been the predominant \npower,'' ``something, but how much we do not know, may be attributed to \nthe definite action of the conditions of life.'' ``Some, perhaps a \ngreat, effect may be attributed to the increased use or disuse of \nparts.''\n  Additional examples are these: ``It is probable that they were once \nthus connected;'' ``that certainly at first appears a highly remarkable \nfact,'' ``it may be suspected,'' ``we have good reason to believe,'' \n``it may be believed,'' ``these facts alone incline me to believe that \nit is a general law of nature,'' ``I conclude that,'' ``we must \ninfer,'' ``we may suppose,'' ``I do not suppose that the process ever \ngoes on so regularly,'' ``it is far more probable,'' ``nor do I suppose \nthat the most divergent varieties are invariably preserved;'' ``if we \nsuppose,'' ``but we have only to suppose the steps in the process,'' \n``thus, as I believe, species are multiplied and genera are formed,'' \n``may be attributed to disuse,'' ``we must suppose,'' ``we may conclude \nthat habit, or use and disuse, have, in some cases, played a \nconsiderable part in the modification of the Constitution and \nstructure;'' ``I suspect,'' ``it seems to be a rule that when any part \nor organ is repeated many times in the same individual, the number is \nvariable, whereas the same part or organ, when it occurs in lesser \nnumbers, is constant;'' ``the fair presumption is,'' ``it must have \nexisted, according to our theory, for an immense period in nearly the \nsame state;'' ``the most probable hypothesis to account for the \nreappearance of very ancient characters, is that there is a tendency in \nthe young of each successive generation to produce the long lost \ncharacter, and that this tendency, from unknown causes, sometimes \nprevails;'' ``by my theory, these allied species are descended from a \ncommon time;'' ``if my theory be true,'' ``must assuredly have \nexisted;'' ``may we not believe . . .?''\n  I could go on and shall, indeed, go on for a brief moment. How long \nis a brief moment?\n  Here are some more: ``it is inconceivable'', ``it is therefore highly \nprobable'', ``it may be inferred,'' ``nor is it improbable,'' ``these \norgans must have been independently developed,'' and so on, and so on, \nand so on and on.\n  Strange, isn't it, that, while many of the devotees of Darwinism are \nagnostics, or even outright atheists, their idol shows no compunctions \nwith reference to a supreme being?\n  Let me quote Darwin. I have been quoting Darwin, but I want to quote \nDarwin to show that he has no compunction with reference to a supreme \nbeing. He says:\n\n       May we not believe that a living optical instrument might \n     thus be formed as superior to one of glass as the works of \n     the creator are to those of man.\n\n  Darwin himself poses the key question. This is the key question, and \nit is meant for all of us. It will make us stop and think.\n  This is what Darwin asked:\n\n       Have we any right to assume that the Creator works by \n     intellectual powers like those of man?\n\n  That is the question. That is where so many of us in this \nintellectual age, this cynical age, that is where so many of us trip \nover ourselves because we attempt to square God's intelligence with our \nown. And thus, we become unbelievers or doubters simply because we \ncan't conceive of all of the marvels of creation and how they came \nabout. Therefore, again, I cite this question by Darwin:\n\n       Have we any right to assume that the Creator works by \n     intellectual powers like those of man?\n\n  Of course, with man's finite, limited intellectual powers, man finds \nit difficult to conceive of that which his own puny mind cannot \nembrace. Hence, while the skeptics doubt the Biblical account of \ncreation, they seem to go out of their way to find alternative \ntheories. The problem is that the alternatives they propose border on \nthe absurd.\n  Beyond all credulity is the credulousness of atheists who believe \nthat chance could make a world, when it cannot build a house.\n  Some scientists say that life, and man himself, was the outcome of \nrandom mechanisms operating over the ages. It is my belief that there \nis, and always has been, a super intelligence, an intelligence that \nforesaw the necessity of preplanning human life on earth.\n  In order that life might be produced, everything had to be just right \nfrom the very start--everything from the fundamental forces, such as \nelectromagnetism and gravity, to the relative masses of various \nsubatomic particles. And I have read that the slightest tinkering with \na single one of scores of basic relationships in nature would have \nresulted in a very different universe from that which we know. It would \nbe a universe with no stars like our sun, or even no stars, period. \nLife was not accidental, but appeared to be a goal toward which the \nentire universe, from the very beginning nanosecond of its existence, \nhad been orchestrated and fine-tuned. In other words, there never was a \n``random universe.'' But before its origins in the Big Bang, life was \npreplanned from the very first nanosecond of the cosmos' coming into \nbeing. This is the cosmological anthropic principle, and it marks a \nturning point, in that it takes us toward, rather than away from, the \nidea that there is a God.\n  I believe that the universe is the product of a vastly superior \nintelligence and that in the absence of such a superintelligence having \nprovided guidance for millions of details, vast and small, this world \nwould not exist, this universe would not exist, nor would we exist.\n  The materialistic paradigm, which is the fundamental modern concept \nof the random, mechanical universe, is coming apart at the seams. It is \nnot a universe that is random and mechanical; instead, it is a universe \nof intricate order that reflects an unimaginably vast and intricate \nmaster design. The laws of physics that undergird the universe had to \nbe fine-tuned from the beginning and expressly designed for the \nemergence of human beings. Human life did not come about by accident, \nthe byproduct of material forces randomly churning over the ages, the \nfundamental constants of gravitational force and electromagnetic force \nnecessary for producing life in the universe.\n  I have to believe that the evolution of the universe over many \nbillions of years had, from the beginning, apparently been directed \ntoward the creation of human life. From my very limited reading, I find \nthat even the slightest tinkering with the value of gravity, or the \nslightest alteration in the strength of the electromagnetic force, \nwould have resulted in the wrong kind of stars, or no stars at all. Any \nweakening of the nuclear ``strong'' force would have resulted in a \nuniverse consisting of hydrogen and not a single other element. That \nwould mean no oxygen and no water--nothing but hydrogen. Even the most \nminuscule tinkering with the fundamental forces of physics--gravity, \nelectromagnetism, nuclear strong force, or the nuclear weak force--\nwould have resulted in a universe consisting entirely of helium, \nwithout protons or atoms, a universe without stars, or a universe that \ncollapsed back in upon itself before the first moments of its existence \nwere up. Even such basics of life as carbon and water depend upon \n``fine-tuning'' at the subatomic level.\n  Think for a moment about the very nature of water, H2O, which is so \nvital\n\n[[Page S3772]]\n\nto life. Unique among the molecules, water is lighter in its solid form \nthan in its liquid form. Ice floats. Every country boy knows that--a \ncountry boy like Robert Byrd. I learned a long time ago that ice \nfloats--not just Ivory soap, but ice floats. If it did not float, the \noceans would freeze from the bottom up, killing all forms of life \ntherein, and the Earth would now be covered with solid ice.\n  Witness the vast order that pervades the universe! Could random \nvariation have, even in the longest stretch of the imagination, created \nsuch magnificent order in the universe? Could chance have hit upon the \norder that we see all around us? To believe that it could is to believe \nthat a monkey with a typewriter would eventually type the complete \nworks of Shakespeare. But would he? Would he not more likely produce an \ninfinity's worth of gibberish? Regardless of the number of days or the \nlength of time available, what monkey could ever provide a single day's \nworth of typing Shakespeare--by random, by accident, by chance--let \nalone the complete works? The works of Shakespeare are complex enough, \nbut they are small potatoes compared to the universe.\n\n  Random selection is not the magic bullet that some biologists would \nhope. One cannot explain away the order in nature by reference to a \npurely random process. To pretend otherwise is the stuff of science \nfiction.\n  Mr. President, as we depart this city for the holidays, let us \nremember the old, old story. Let us pause at Easter time and think on \nthese things. I close with the reading of the 23rd psalm:\n\n       The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.\n       He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: He leadeth me \n     beside the still waters.\n       He restoreth my soul: He leadeth me in the paths of \n     righteousness for his name's sake.\n       Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of \n     death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and \n     thy staff they comfort me.\n       Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine \n     enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth \n     over.\n       Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of \n     my life: and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever. \n     Happy Easter!\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
