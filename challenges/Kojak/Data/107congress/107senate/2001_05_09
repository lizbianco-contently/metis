We have 5 minutes equally divided \non the Mikulski amendment.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to ask the support of my \ncolleagues for my amendment to create 1,000 community tech-based \ncenters around the country.\n\n[[Page S4526]]\n\n  The BEST Act creates a national goal to ensure that every child is \ncomputer literate by the 8th grade regardless of race, ethnicity, \nincome, gender, geography, or disability.\n  My amendment will help make this goal a reality.\n  What does this amendment do? My amendment builds on the excellent \nwork of Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Gregg. It \nexpands 21st Century Learning Centers by authorizing $100 million to \ncreate 1,000 community based technology centers around the country. The \nDepartment of Education would provide competitive grants to community \nbased organizations such as a YMCA, the Urban League, or a public \nlibrary.\n  Up to half the funds for these centers must come from the private \nsector, so we'll be helping to build public/private partnerships around \nthe country.\n  What does this mean for local communities? It means a safe haven for \nchildren where they could learn how to use computers and use them to do \nhomework or surf the web. It means job training for adults who could \nuse the technology centers to sharpen their job skills or write their \nresumes.\n  Why is this amendment necessary? Because even with dot coms becoming \ndot bombs, we badly need high tech workers. In fact, we have a skill \nshortage, not a worker shortage.\n  Senators Specter and Harkin have provided funds for Community \nTechnology Centers in Appropriations but the program has never been \nauthorized, so it has been skimpy. Only 90 centers were created last \nyear, although over 700 applied.\n  We need to bring technology to where kids learn, not just where we \nwant them to learn. They don't just learn in school, they learn in \ntheir communities.\n  Not every family has a computer in their home, but every American \nshould have access to computers in their community.\n  My amendment is endorsed by: the NAACP, the American Library \nAssociation, the National Council of La Raza, the YMCA, the American \nAssociation of Community Colleges, and the Computer and Communications \nIndustry Association.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in ensuring that no child is left out \nor left behind in the technology revolution.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I regretfully rise to oppose the \namendment of my colleague, although I agree with the program she is \ntalking about, the community technology centers. On the other hand, \nthis belongs with other programs such as the community block grants, \nnot on the educational side.\n  I must say I admire what the Senator is doing. The programs \nthemselves can be very useful, but I don't believe it belongs in this \nbill; rather, it belongs in other bills. For instance, the 21st century \nschools can provide similar programs. In a sense, it is duplication.\n  Regretfully, I must oppose the amendment, although I think it is only \nonce or twice a century that I do that.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the cosponsors of my amendment are \nSenators Kennedy, Bingaman, Sarbanes, Wellstone, and Reid.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield back the remaining time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now proceed to a vote in relation to the Mikulski amendment \nnumbered 379 to amendment No. 358.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, this amendment greatly strengthens this \nlegislation. It focuses on an issue that we haven't really spent a lot \nof time on yet. This has to do with how we make sure we have the very \nhighest quality of testing and how we make sure we give our States and \nschool districts the flexibility to do the very best job.\n  There has been a rush to expand testing without stepping back to \ndetermine whether the testing system we have is working. It is only \ncommon sense--I believe we have worked hard on this amendment, and \nthere will be strong support for it--to assume that if you want the \ntests to be effective, they have to be of high quality.\n  This goes back to why we are measuring student achievement in the \nfirst place and what our goals are if we are going to set up these \naccountability systems. Are we measuring for the sake of measuring only \nor are we measuring to get the best picture of how our children are \ndoing? That is what we are all about or should be all about.\n  If we want to get the best picture of how our students are doing and \nhow effective the schools are in teaching, we need to have the best \npossible assessments. That is what this amendment seeks. These \nassessments need to be aligned with standards, local curriculum, and \nclassroom instruction. These assessments need to be free from bias. \nThey need to reflect both the range and depth of student knowledge, and \nthey need to assess not just memorized responses but student reasoning \nand understanding. They need to be used only for the purposes for which \nthey are valid and reliable. This is important.\n  Holding States and school districts and teachers accountable to the \nwrong test can, in fact, be more harmful than helpful. Using low-level \nnational tests to measure performance within a State shows us little of \nhow the States, the school districts, the schools, and the students are \ndoing in achieving their State and local educational goals.\n  This amendment seeks to allow States to develop tests that are of \nhigher quality and better meet the localized needs of their students, \ntheir parents, and their teachers.\n  I will repeat these words again. They should be important to Senators \nand staff. This amendment allows States to develop tests that are of \nhigher quality and better meet the localized needs of their students, \nteachers, and parents.\n  To ensure that the assessments are of high quality, this amendment \nsays the assessments under title I have to meet relevant national \nstandards developed by the American Educational Research Association, \nthe American Psychological Association and the National Council of \nMeasurement in Education. These standards are the standards from \neveryone in the testing field--I say to the Senator from Vermont and \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, these are the standards that have been \nused as guides for testmakers and test users for decades, and they are \nimplied but they are not specifically referenced in the current law.\n  Secondly, it says that States have to provide evidence to the \nSecretary that the tests they use are of adequate technical quality for \neach purpose for which they are used.\n  Third, it says that itemized score analyses should be provided to \ndistricts and schools so the tests can meet their intended purpose, \nwhich is to help the people on the ground, the teachers and the \nparents, to know specifically what their children are struggling with \nand how they can help them do better.\n\n  Finally, the amendment provides grants to States to enter into \npartnerships to research and develop the highest quality assessments \npossible so they can most accurately and fairly measure student \nachievement.\n  I will go into this later on, but I say to the Senate: My background \nis education. I was a teacher for 20 years. I don't want to give any \nground on rigor or accountability, but I don't want us to do this the \nwrong way. I want to make sure our States and school districts can \ndesign the kinds of tests that are comprehensive, that have multiple \nmeasures, that are coherent, that we are actually measuring what is \nbeing taught, and also to make sure they assess progress over time.\n  This is so important because we don't want to put our teachers and \nschool districts in a position of having to teach to tests. We don't \nwant to drive out our best teachers. We want to have the best teachers \nin our schools. We don't want teachers to be drill sergeants. There is \na distinction between training and education.\n  The need for this amendment is clear. The Independent Review Panel on \ntitle I, which was mandated in the 1994 reauthorization, issued its \nreport ``Improving the Odds'' this January. The report concluded:\n\n       Many States use assessment results from a single test--\n     often traditional multiple choice tests. Although the tests \n     may have an important place in state assessment systems, they \n     rarely capture the depth and breadth of knowledge reflected \n     in State content standards.\n\n  The panel went on to make a strong recommendation. It said:\n\n       Better assessments for instructional and accountability \n     purposes are urgently needed.\n\n  The link between better assessments and better accountability was \nmade by Robert Schwartz, president of Achieve, Inc., the nonprofit arm \nof the standards-based reform movement. He recently said:\n\n       You simply can't accomplish the goals of this movement if \n     you're using off-the-shelf, relatively low-level tests . . . \n     Tests have taken on too prominent of a role in these reforms \n     and that's in part because of people rushing to attach \n     consequences to them before, in a lot of places, we have \n     really gotten the tests right.\n\n  This amendment is about making sure we get the tests right. That is \nwhat this amendment is about.\n\n  This is exactly my point. We need to get the tests right. Research \nshows that low-quality assessments can actually do more harm than good. \nThe Standards on Educational and Psychological Testing clearly indicate \nthis. The standards state:\n\n       The proper use of tests can result in wiser decisions about \n     individuals and programs than would be the case without their \n     use and also can provide a route to broader and more \n     equitable access to education and employment.\n\n  That is if it is done the right way.\n\n       The improper use of tests, however, can cause considerable \n     harm to test takers and other parties affected by test-based \n     decisions.\n\n  It is our obligation to help States and districts ensure that tests \nare done right so they can achieve the best effect.\n  The standards go on to say:\n\n       Beyond any intended policy goals, it is important to \n     consider any potential unintended effects that may result \n     from large scale testing programs. Concerns have been raised, \n     for instance, about narrowing the curriculum to focus only on \n     the objectives tested, restricting the range of instructional \n     approaches to correspond to testing format, increasing the \n     number of drop-outs among students who do not pass the test, \n     and encouraging other instructional or administrative \n     practices that may raise test scores without affecting the \n     quality of education. It is important for those who mandate \n     tests to consider and monitor their consequences and to \n     identify and minimize the potential of negative consequences.\n\n  With my colleagues' support, we want to make sure the testing is done \nthe right way, and that is what we will do if we adopt this amendment.\n  One of the key problems with low-quality tests and accountability \nsystems that rely too heavily on a single measure of student progress \nis in producing very counterproductive educational effects. There is \ntoo much teaching to the test, leading to drill instruction which does \nnot reflect real learning and which excludes key components of \neducation that are not covered by the tests. Further, the over-reliance \non tests could cause teachers to leave the profession at a time when\n\n[[Page S4528]]\n\ngood teachers are what our country needs the most.\n  Again, I am going to talk about this more, but if we do not get this \nright, we will rue the day that we have set up a system that basically \ncreates a situation where your very best teachers are going to leave \nthe profession, and we are not going to attract the best teachers.\n  The first concern has to do with teaching to the test. Let me cite \nfor my colleagues the Committee for Economic Development, which is a \nstrongly pro-testing coalition of business leaders which warns against \ntest-based accountability systems that ``lead to narrow test based \ncoaching rather than rich instruction.''\n  Test preparation is not necessarily bad, but if it comes at the \nexpense of real learning, it becomes a major problem. Many will say \nthat teaching to tests can be good, but if the tests are of low \nquality, which too many are, then it most certainly is not for the \ngood.\n  The recent Education Week/Pew Charitable Trust study, ``Quality \nCounts,'' found that nearly 70 percent of the teachers said that \ninstruction stresses tests ``far'' or ``somewhat'' too much. Sixty-six \npercent of the teachers also said that State assessments were forcing \nthem to concentrate too much on what is tested to the detriment of \nother report topics.\n\n  I will tell you what topics are neglected: social studies, arts, \nscience, technology, all of which are integral to good education.\n  For example, in Washington State, a recent analysis by the Rand \nCorporation showed that fourth grade teachers shifted significant time \naway from the arts, science, health and fitness, social studies, and \ncommunication and listening skills because none of these areas were \nmeasured by the tests. Is that what we want to do? We do not want to \nend up undercutting the quality of education of children in this \ncountry.\n  ``Quality Counts'' goes on to say:\n\n       Any one test samples only a narrow range of what students \n     should be learning. If teachers concentrate on the test--\n     rather than the broader content undergirding the exams--it \n     could lead to a bump in test results that does not lead or \n     does not reflect real learning gains.\n\n  In fact, 45 percent of the teachers surveyed said they spent a great \ndeal of time teaching students how to take tests, doing activities such \nas learning to fill in bubbles correctly.\n  Another recent survey of Texas teachers indicated that only 27 \npercent of the teachers believe that increases in the TAAS scores \nreflect an increase in the quality of learning and teaching, rather \nthan teaching to the test.\n  A 1998 study of the Chicago public schools concluded that the demand \nfor high test scores had actually slowed down instruction as teachers \nstopped introducing new material to review and practice for upcoming \nexams.\n  The most egregious examples of teaching to the test are schools such \nas the Stevenson Elementary School in Houston that pays as much as \n$10,000 per year to hire the Stanley Kaplan Test Preparation Company to \nteach teachers how to teach kids to take tests.\n  According to the San Jose Mercury News, schools in East Palo Alto, \nwhich is one of the poorest districts in California, also paid Stanley \nKaplan $10,000 each to consult with them on test-taking strategies.\n  According to the same article:\n\n       Schools across California are spending thousands to buy \n     computer programs, hire consultants, and purchase workbooks \n     and materials. They're redesigning spelling tests and math \n     lessons, all in an effort to help students become better test \n     takers.\n\n  Sadly, it is the low-income schools that are affected the most. The \nNational Science Foundation found that teachers with more than 60 \npercent minority students in their classes reported more test \npreparation and more test-altered instruction than those with fewer \nminority students in their class. This research is confirmed by the \nHarvard Civil Rights Project and several other studies.\n  The reason I believe the vote on this amendment will be one of the \nmost important votes on this bill is that this amendment speaks \ndirectly to whether or not we are going to have the best teachers. I am \nvery concerned that drill education and an increasing emphasis on \nscores is going to cause the best teachers to leave the profession, to \nleave the schools where they are needed the most. This is tragic at the \nvery time we face an acute teacher shortage. We know that the single \nmost important factor in closing the achievement gap between students \nis the quality of the teachers the students have. We will see teachers \nleaving the profession.\n  Linda Darling Hammond, who is a renowned educator at Stanford \nUniversity, and Jonathan Kozol, who has written some of the most \npowerful books about poor children and education in America, have both \naddressed this issue. Jonathan Kozol said:\n\n       Hundreds of the most exciting and beautifully educated \n     teachers are already fleeing from inner city schools in order \n     to escape what one brilliant young teacher calls \n     ``examination hell.''\n\n  It is ironic because in our quest to close the achievement gap, Kozol \nfinds that what we are actually doing is ``robbing urban and poor rural \nchildren of the opportunities Senators give their own kids.''\n  What is going on? We already know where all the pressure is. We \nalready know where all the focus is on the drill education, the \nteaching to the tests. It is in inner-city, rural, small towns. What \nyou are going to have, or what you have right now, is the teachers who \nknow how to teach and are not involved in worksheet education are the \nvery teachers who are going to leave. It is the teachers who are more \nrobotic and are intent to do worksheet teaching and learning, which is \neducationally deadening--they are going to be the teachers who stay. We \nwill be making a huge mistake if we don't make sure the testing is done \nin a comprehensive and coherent way.\n  There was an op-ed piece in the New York Times. It was written by a \nfifth-grade teacher who obviously had great passion for his work. \nListen to his words:\n\n       But as I teach from day to day . . . I no longer see the \n     students in the way I once did--certainly not in the same \n     exuberant light as when I first started teaching five years \n     ago. Where once they were ``challenging'' or ``marginal'' \n     students, I am now beginning to see ``liabilities.'' Where \n     once there was a student of ``limited promise,'' there is now \n     an inescapable deficit that all available efforts will only \n     nominally affect.\n\n  One way to avoid such negative outcomes and ensure that tests do not \ninhibit real learning is to design higher quality tests that measure \nhow children think rather than just what they can remember. The \nStandards for Educational and Psychological Testing asserts, for \nexample, that:\n\n       If a test is intended to measure mathematical reasoning, it \n     becomes important to determine whether examinees are in fact \n     reasoning about the material given instead of following just \n     a standard algorithm.\n\n  Too often, today's tests are failing their mission. The Center for \nEducation Policy's recent study on the state of education reform \nconcludes:\n\n       The tests commonly used for accountability purposes don't \n     tell us how students reached an answer, why they are having \n     difficulty, or how we can help them.\n\n  We therefore need to design assessments that are more closely linked \nto classroom instruction. That is what our school districts, schools, \nteachers, principals, school boards, and our PTAs at the local level \nare telling us. We need to reflect student learning over time so that \nschools are not judged in a single shot but, rather, are judged more \ndeeply and comprehensively through multiple measures of achievement.\n  Such an approach would reward teachers who, as the Center for School \nChange in Minnesota recommends, are able to actually effect and improve \nchildren's analytic abilities and communications skills rather than \nteachers who drill the best. It would reward schools and teachers who \nensure that day-to-day classroom instruction is high quality, not just \nthose who have learned how best to game assessments. That is what this \namendment seeks to do.\n  The Committee for Economic Development report urges this approach. It \nsays:\n\n       There is more work to do in designing assessment \n     instruments that can measure a rich array of knowledge and \n     skills embedded in rigorous and substantive standards.\n\n  Before we rush ahead, let's meet that challenge.\n  Beyond the effects in the classroom, higher quality tests and fairer \nuse of tests are needed because low-quality\n\n[[Page S4529]]\n\ntests can lead to inaccurate assessments, which do not serve but, \nrather, subvert the efforts at true educational accountability. Nobody \nput it better than the strongly protesting Committee for Economic \nDevelopment. These business leaders concluded in their report--there \nshould be almost unanimous support for this amendment--entitled \n``Measuring What Matters'' that:\n\n       Tests that are not valid, reliable, and fair will obviously \n     be inaccurate indicators of the academic achievement of \n     students and can lead to wrong decisions being made about \n     students and the schools.\n\n  We want to make sure these tests are accurate, reliable, and fair. I \nknow the language I speak is technical, but the issue is of great \nimport.\n  Let me just simply summarize my position. There is more to say, and \nperhaps we will listen to other colleagues as well, because there is \nmuch more than I can cite as evidence.\n  One of the things we have to make sure of is that we have \ncomprehensive multiple measures that will measure schools and students. \nYou have to do that; otherwise, you are abusing the tests. It is very \ndangerous to use a single measure to determine how well schools and \nstudents are doing. But beyond pure error, it is important to realize \nthat even without technical error, tests tell only a part of the \neducation story. They should be accompanied by other measures to ensure \nthat we are getting the best picture possible of how these students and \nschools are doing. That is the way we can hold the schools truly and \nfairly accountable.\n  In his testimony before the House Education and Workforce Committee, \nKurt M. Landgraf, president and CEO of the Educational Testing Service, \nwhich is one of the largest providers of K-12 testing services in the \ncountry, said:\n\n       Scores from large scale assessments should not be \n     used alone if other information will increase the validity \n     of the decisions being made.\n\n  Riverside Publishing, another of the major test publishers in the \ncountry, in their Interpretive Guide For School Administrators for the \nIowa Test of Basic Skills, said:\n\n       Many of the common misuses (of standardized tests) stem \n     from depending on a single test score to make a decision \n     about a student or class of students.\n\n  The National Association of State Boards of Education also did a \ncomprehensive study which indicated the same thing.\n  The study I mentioned before, ``Quality Counts,'' shows that we need \nto have multiple measures. In no area is this phenomenon more evident \nthan in the use of a single standardized test to make a high-stakes \ndecision about a student, as whether or not that student will be \npromoted from one grade to another or in what reading group that \nstudent will be placed.\n  Nearly everybody involved in the testing field, whether it is the \ngroups that write the professional standards, the National Research \nCouncil, test publishers, the business community that invested so much \nin the testing movement--all agree that a single test should never be \nthe sole determinant in making high-stakes educational decisions about \nindividual students or, for that matter, about individual schools.\n  The Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing asserts that \nin educational settings, a decision or characterization that will have \na major impact on a student should not be made on the basis of a single \ntest score. The National Research Council--we commissioned this \nreport--in 1999 concludes that:\n\n       No single test score can be considered a definitive measure \n     of a student's knowledge, and an educational decision that \n     will have a major impact on a test taker should not be made \n     solely or automatically on the basis of a single test score.\n\n  So we need multiple measures. Second, right now, too many of the \ntests are not aligned with the curriculum and standards. So another \ncondition that has to be met, another problem that has to be met, is \nthat current assessments all too often are not aligned with standards, \ncurriculum, and instruction. That is what it has to be.\n  I am putting into the language what we have implied. Alignment is the \ncornerstone of accountability. If we don't have tests that are aligned \nwith the standards and curriculum and the instruction, then we are not \ngoing to have real accountability.\n  Now, the Committee for Economic Development in their report makes the \npoint that barriers to alignment are more serious when States use so-\ncalled off-the-shelf commercial tests rather than developing their own. \nThe National Association of State Boards of Education confirms in their \nstudy and makes the point that norm reference tests are unable to \nmeasure the attainment of content and performance standards.\n  This amendment provides grants to States to better align their \nassessments, as well as to ensure that the tests validly assess the \ndomain they are intended to measure. This is common sense, but it is so \nimportant.\n  This amendment seeks not to stop using tests but to ensure fairness \nand accuracy in the large-scale assessments that are used under title \nI. This amendment seeks not to stop using tests. I want to make sure \nthis is done the right way. I want to make sure it is fair. I want to \nmake sure the tests are accurate. I want to make sure we have real \naccountability. I want to make sure we are respectful of teachers. I \nwant to make sure we are respectful of school boards. I want to make \nsure we are respectful of what goes on in our schools.\n  This call for fairness and accuracy is a call that has been made by \nbusiness leaders, by educators, by government leaders, and by the most \nrespected research institutes in the country. I rarely read text when I \nspeak on the floor of the Senate. However, there are so many \nauthorities and studies to cite, the evidence is irrefutable. We want \nto make sure we do this the right way and we must do it the right way.\n  This research and this call for accurate, fair testing has crossed \nparty lines. I hope it will have bipartisan support in the Senate.\n  The most recent National Research Council report on testing, \n``Knowing What Students Know,'' outlines the direction in which I think \nwe as policymakers need to move to make sure the testing is done fairly \nand correctly. The report concludes that:\n\n       . . . policymakers are urged to recognize the limits of \n     current assessments and to support the development of new \n     systems of multiple assessments that would improve their \n     ability to make decisions about educational programs and \n     allocation of resources.\n\n  It says:\n\n       . . . needed are classroom and large-scale assessments that \n     help all students succeed in school by making as clearly as \n     possible to them, their teachers and other educational \n     stakeholders the nature of their accomplishments and the \n     progress of their learning.\n\n  We surely ought to be able to meet that condition.\n  Right now, the authors report:\n\n       Assessment practices need to move beyond a focus on \n     component skills and discrete bits of knowledge to encompass \n     more complex aspects of student achievement.\n\n  The authors recommended that:\n\n       Funding should be provided for a major program of research, \n     guided by a synthesis of cognitive and measurement \n     principles, that focus on the design of assessments that \n     yield more valid and fair inferences about student \n     achievement.\n\n  And key components are what? Multiple measures of student achievement \nand a move to more performance-based, curriculum-embedded assessment.\n  Doesn't that make sense, to have multiple measures, and to make sure \nwhat you are testing is aligned with the curriculum? The three \nprinciples of good assessment are laid out.\n  I conclude on the principles: Comprehensiveness, meaning you have a \nrange of measurement approaches so that you have a variety of evidence \nto support educational decisionmaking; coherence, meaning that the \nassessment should be closely linked to curriculum and instruction; and \ncontinuity, meaning that the assessment should measure student progress \nover time.\n  I emphasize, this legislation, S. 1. is a major departure in public \npolicy in the sense we are now calling on all of the school districts \nin all of the States in all of the schools in all of our States to test \nchildren as young as age 8 to age 13 every single year. There can be a \nphilosophical discussion about whether we should be doing that. The \nonly thing I am saying is, let's do it the right way.\n\n  I have been working on this amendment, using the best studies we \nhave. I have been in touch with people all over\n\n[[Page S4530]]\n\nthe country. Basically, I am saying, let's make sure there is \ncomprehensiveness, which means multiple measures. Make sure there is \ncoherence; that we actually measure the curriculum and instruction. \nOtherwise the teachers teach to the tests. We don't want that. We don't \nwant drill education.\n  Finally, let's have continuity, which means that the assessment \nshould measure student progress over time.\n  Jonathan Kozol is someone I think we all respect. He writes that it \nis the best teachers that hate testing agenda the most. They will not \nremain in public schools if they are forced to be drill sergeants for \nexams instead of being educators. Hundreds of the most exciting and \nbeautifully educated teachers are already fleeing from inner-city \nschools in order to escape what one teacher, a graduate of Swarthmore \ncalls ``examination hell.'' I don't know that we have been in the \ninner-city neighborhoods; I don't think we visit the inner-city \nneighborhoods that Jonathan Kozol does.\n\n       The dreariest and most robotic teachers will remain, the \n     flowing and passionate teachers will get out as fast as they \n     can. They will be hired in exclusive prep schools to teach \n     the children of the rich under ideal circumstances.\n\n  He goes on to say: Who will you find to replace these beautiful young \nteachers? This is another way of robbing the urban poor and rural \nchildren of the opportunities that we give to our own children.\n  I think he is right. I have been a college teacher for 20 years. I \nhave been in a school almost all the time in Minnesota, about every 2 \nweeks for the last 10\\1/2\\ years. I desperately believe in the value of \nequal opportunity for every child. I absolutely believe education is \nthe foundation of opportunity. I know from my 20 years as a college \nteacher that you can take a spark of learning in a child and if you \nignite that spark of learning and you can take a child from any \nbackground to a lifetime of creativity and accomplishment. That is the \nbest thing about the United States of America. I also know you can pour \ncold water on that spark of learning.\n  I have raised two objections to this piece of legislation, but I \nthink this legislation can be improved upon and can end up being a \ngood, strong, bipartisan effort. Maybe. One of those concerns is, for \nGod's sake, if you are going to do the testing, you better give the \nchildren and the teachers and the schools the tools so they can do \nwell. That is the Federal Government living up to our commitment by way \nof resources. That is holding us accountable.\n  The other issue I raise, which is what this amendment speaks to, is \nlet's just do the testing the right way. There is a reaction all over \nthe country about too much of a reliance on one single standardized \ntest. You have to have multiple measures. Let's make sure the tests \nactually are connected to the curriculum and to the instruction that is \ntaking place, that is respectful of our teachers and our local school \ndistricts. Let's make sure the tests assess the progress of a child \nover a period of time.\n  I have been taking all of the best research and all of what we have \nimplied in this bill, language we already have in this bill, making it \nexplicit that we are going to do this the right way; that we are going \nto make sure that States and school districts can do this the right \nway.\n  There could not be a more important amendment. I am sorry that some \nof my presentation was so technical and seemed so cut-and-dried. But if \nwe do this the wrong way, we will have worksheet teaching and worksheet \neducation. We will have drill education. It is going to be training, \nbut it is not really going to be education. It is not going to fire the \nimagination. Then arts gets dropped and music gets dropped and social \nstudies gets dropped and drama gets dropped--because none of it is \ntested in this drill education. My God, we do not want to do that. We \ndo not want to channel schools down that direction. We do not want to \nforce them to go in that direction.\n\n  This amendment makes sure that this testing--if this is the path we \nare going down, using this definition of accountability--is done the \nright way.\n  If my colleagues think about their own States, they will see what is \nhappening. A lot of the teachers and kids around the country, actually \nmainly in the suburbs, are now rebelling against these standardized \ntests. They hate them. Some are refusing to take them, because the \nparents in the suburbs are saying we don't want one-third of the time \nof the teachers who could be involved in great education wasted just \nteaching to these tests. It is interesting from where the rebellion is \ncoming.\n  Again, one more time: The very school districts which are the most \nunderserved are the ones where you want to get the best teachers. I \nhave two children in public education. One is in an inner-city school, \nthe other isn't, but both hate this reliance on single standardized \ntests. You are not going to get the teachers. I would not teach under \nthis kind of situation, and you would not.\n  If the Federal Government is going to have this mandate, for God's \nsake, let's do it the right way.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time. There is no \ntime limit, I gather, on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am pleased today to discuss the Better \nEducation for Students and Teachers Act, the BEST Act. We can never \nhave too much debate on education. It is the future of our country.\n  This legislation achieves the simple yet powerful goal of ensuring no \nchild is left behind. It does this by strengthening accountability for \nhow Federal dollars are spent, by increasing students' access to \ntechnology, by improving teacher quality, and by making the schools \nsafer for all students. It also fulfills an important commitment to \nStates such as Wyoming that are already heavily invested in improving \nstudent achievement by allowing them the flexibility they need to \ncontinue to innovate.\n  I want to address a series of amendments we have and will be \noffering. I will be concentrating on quality of teachers, but I want to \nmention that yesterday we had two sense-of-the-Senate amendments. I am \nnot going to go into what those amendments were about, but I do want to \nmention that I voted against both of them. It had nothing to do with \nthe content of each of the sense-of-the-Senate amendments. It was \nbecause it was a sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  Sense-of-the-Senate amendments take a great deal of time, including \nif there are requested rollcall votes, which we know take 30 to 45 \nminutes. When we are done, they get discarded because the sense of the \nSenate doesn't have anything to do with the House. So they are just \nmaking a statement, and we have a lot of different ways we can make a \nstatement. Since I have not seen any value to a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment since I arrived in the Senate some 5 years ago, I will be \nvoting against sense-of-the-Senate amendments.\n\n  Sense-of-the-Senate amendments are often agreed to. It is because of \na mixture of approaches to sense-of-the-Senate amendments. A number of \nmy colleagues say: They never go anywhere, they don't mean anything, so \nI'll vote for them. Then I will have a good recorded vote.\n  Some people turn in sense-of-the-Senate amendments so they can have a \ngood recorded vote. I prefer to concentrate my efforts on those things \nthat will wind up in a final bill, in final legislation that will \naffect the country, if we are going to have votes.\n  Today we had a technology amendment. It passed on a 50-49 vote. \nSomething people might not be aware of is that technology is built into \nthe bill, but it is built in with a great deal of flexibility. The $100 \nmillion to which we agreed pulled out money from the big technology \npool and put it into a very specific area.\n  Let me tell you what happens when that gets down to Wyoming. We don't \nhave enough money to do a project. But if it is left in the big pool \nand we can utilize the technology as the school districts see fit, with \na bigger pool of money, it can make a difference to every kid in \nWyoming.\n  We have to be very careful in this legislation that we do not put in \nlittle protections, because we were asked to, that destroy the \nflexibility of the bill. Flexibility is the key philosophy of this bill \nthat allows the decisions to be made closest to the child and involve\n\n[[Page S4531]]\n\nthe parent, the teacher, the school board, and the community. That is \nwhere education works best.\n  The amendment before us now is on testing. I am not sure what all the \nfuss is about having some testing required. When I was in grade school, \nwe had annual testing. I know the kinds of tests we had were called \ninto question because they were multiple choice, which doesn't allow \npeople their full expression. It puts some limitation on the value of \nthe test as it comes out. But let me tell you, my parents looked at \nthose results. They expected to see my results. They expected to see \nhow it fit in with the rest of the class and the other students in the \ndistrict who were in my grade. They used that as a comparison. I can \ntell you, if everybody had been off the chart, they would not have been \npleased. They wanted to know how I was doing. That resulted in parent \ninvolvement, which we have said is one of the big keys to education.\n  When I was in the Wyoming Legislature, I headed up an education task \nforce at one point. It was interesting to hear teacher after teacher \nessentially say that the biggest problem they had in the classroom was \ngetting kids to show up, do their work, and behave. That is basic \neducation. The way it was handled when I was growing up was it was, \nagain, parent involvement, discipline at home. If my teacher would have \ntold my parents I did something wrong, the discipline would have \nhappened first and then the explanation of why I felt justified. The \nteacher was right. I had an opportunity to appeal after the punishment \nbecause discipline in the classroom was important.\n  When I was in fourth grade, I had the unique experience of being in a \nclass that was half fourth graders and half fifth graders. We do not \nhave a lot of class size problems in Wyoming. We definitely did not at \nthat time. To have about 15 students in the class, they combined the 2 \nclasses. It gave those of us in the fourth grade a little added \nadvantage because we were always hearing the things that the \nfifth graders were being taught at the point that their particular \nlessons were being taught.\n\n  But I also had the unfortunate situation of living about a half block \nfrom the school. I had this delightful teacher who said: As soon as you \nfinish your work, you can go out to recess. My dad happened to notice I \nwas out at recess a lot. I was a fast worker. So he asked to see some \nof my work. When he checked it, he found out it was not correct. So we \ndid a little discipline at that point, too.\n  He found out I was writing extremely small and that made it difficult \nfor the teacher to check my work. I do remember him saying I would \nnever write small again. It embarrassed him. He could afford the paper, \nand it looked as if he could not, and he was not going to put up with \nthat. And we moved. We moved to another school so I would not have the \nsame opportunity for recess.\n  My parents always said ``when you go to college.'' They didn't say \n``if you go to college.'' Parents make a huge impact on students by \ntheir faith in their child and their encouragement for their child.\n  My dad was a traveling shoe salesman most of his life, and I got to \ntravel with him in the summer. When we were making those trips, people \nwould say: Are you going to grow up and be a salesman like your dad? \nBefore I could answer, my dad would always jump into the conversation \nand say: I don't care whether he is a doctor or a lawyer or a shoe \nsalesman or a ditch digger. But what I always tell him is, if he is a \nditch digger, I want that ditch to be so distinctive that anybody can \nlook at it and say, ``That is a Mike Enzi ditch.''\n\n  Parental encouragement, parental faith--one of the unfortunate things \nfor us around here is we can't legislate that. There are just some \nthings that should not be legislated and can't be legislated. But they \ncan be encouraged. Today we are talking about one of these things. We \nare talking about the subject of teachers, which we can do something \nabout, and we are doing something about that in this bill.\n  Some of the most important provisions in this bill concern our \nNation's teachers. As we all know, one of our Nation's greatest \neducational resources is our teachers. Quite often our teachers spend \nmore time with our kids than we do. I say this not only because my \ndaughter is a teacher but because research has found that with the \nexception of the involved parent, no other factor affects a child's \nacademic achievement more than having knowledgeable, skillful teachers.\n  While I have been very interested in ongoing negotiations over some \nof the provisions in this bill, there is one area that is not \nnegotiable, and that is ensuring that our children have high-quality \nteachers, especially when it comes to reading and math.\n  I would like everybody to think back through their past to people who \ninfluenced them the most. I suspect as you go through that little \nexercise--I hope you will spend some time doing that--that many of the \npeople who will be on your list will be former teachers, ones who had \nsome kind of an influence on your life. I hope you will not only list \nthem, but I hope if there are any who are living, you will write them a \nlittle note and mention the effect they had on your life.\n  At this point I have to mention a couple that were my teachers.\n  When I was in eighth grade I had a home room teacher who made us \nconcentrate on where we were going to go to college and what we would \ntake, and even had us follow a curriculum and write to colleges, get \ntheir course book, and outline the exact courses we would take through \na 4-year college education in the field of our choice. I learned a \ngreat deal about how to plan for college.\n  She also involved us in a lot of interesting discussions and later \nserved in the State legislature with me. I have to mention that she \nquit teaching and became an administrator. After she retired, she ran \nfor the State legislature. It was a great deal of fun to be in the \nState legislature with a former teacher, particularly one with a voice \nthat attracts people's attention, gets their attention, and drives home \na point. I always did like the way she started a speech just after I \nhad spoken where she said: Mike Enzi was a student of mine, and he \nknows what he is talking about. Do what he says.\n  You just can't have that kind of backing in legislation you are doing \nand with quite as much effect as she had.\n  I had a math teacher in eighth grade, Mr. Shovelin. He introduced us \nto slide rules. Kids today don't know what slide rules are. He helped \nus form a future engineers club so we would be able to compete in math. \nHe did anything he could do to get us excited about math. Teachers do \nthat.\n  Later I had Mr. Popovich in high school, another math teacher, who \nwas probably the most enthusiastic teacher I ever had. He made sure \nthat everybody in our math class understood each principle we covered, \nand he did that by asking questions. If you got it right, he was \nenthusiastic and jumped in the air. If we got it wrong, he was \nenthusiastic, and he would literally climb onto the chalk tray saying, \nNo, that is not it, and giving another version of how it could be.\n\n  I also liked his explanation of geometry. He said that is really the \nonly course that you get in high school that is logic. Today, I think \nthere are some courses that are actually logic courses. But he pointed \nout how geometry is logic, and approached it as the old Greeks did, \ntrying to prove verbally and through pictures very basic concepts by \nstarting out with the most basic and building on it.\n  Mrs. Embry is a lady who is about 4-foot-nothing with bright red \nhair. She taught international affairs. I needed an elective, and I \ndidn't think I would have any interest in it. Before I left high \nschool, I applied for college at George Washington University and was \nplanning to go into international affairs. She had a tremendous effect \non my life. She also happened to be the lady who was part of the team \nthat decoded the messages when Pearl Harbor was being bombed.\n  Mrs. Sprague, an English teacher, had an impact on me. She said, \n``Why don't you use more humor in what you write? You do very well with \nhumor.''\n  One little sentence such as that changes a student's perspective on \nthemselves and their future.\n  There are thousands and thousands of teachers out there who are doing \nthat every day.\n  I am pleased that title II of S. 1 addresses the issue of teacher \nquality. Unlike more restrictive proposals that\n\n[[Page S4532]]\n\nrequire States and local school districts to use Federal funds \nexclusively for the purpose of hiring new teachers, this legislation \nprovides maximum flexibility to States. It will allow them to develop \nhigh-quality, professional development programs, provide incentives to \nretain quality teachers, fund innovative teacher programs such as \nteacher testing, merit-based teacher performance systems, or \nalternative routes of certification, or hire additional teachers if \nthat is what they believe is necessary.\n  It would authorize a separate program to support math and science \npartnerships between State education agencies, higher education math \nand science departments and local school districts, and activities for \nthese partnerships through the development of rigorous math and science \ncurriculum; professional development activities specifically geared \ntoward math and science teachers; recruitment efforts to encourage more \ncollege students majoring in math and science to enter the teaching \nprofession and summer workshops; and follow-up training in the fields \nof math and science.\n  When I was in junior high, Russia set off Sputnik. It launched a \nwhole new interest in science in the United States. A group of boys, \nwho were my friends, and I formed a rocket explorer post. It was the \nflexibility in the Boy Scout Program that allowed us to do career \ninvestigation.\n  The reason I mention this is because I personally had a teacher named \nTom Allen who was the biology teacher at the high school who worked \nwith me on my special project. Many of us have seen the October Skies \nmovie of young men who were encouraged by this great Russian event, and \nthen the American challenge that was issued at that point. That is the \ngroup of people with whom I worked.\n  This biology teacher worked with me to design a nose cone for our \nrocket that would take a mouse up and safely return it. We never put a \nmouse in the nose cone, but I designed space capsules for them, put \nmice in the capsule, spun them on a centrifuge, and then had to \nevaluate the way they came out of it.\n  I learned a lot of math. I learned a lot of science. I learned a lot \nof biology. He was a special teacher.\n  There are two teachers in Gillette, who are retiring now--Nello and \nRollo Williams. They are brothers. One runs the planetarium. One of \nthem runs the adventurium. The adventurium is a science lab that \ninvites kids from all over northern Wyoming to do actual experiments \nand special projects. They can see a series of events that give them a \nbetter understanding of science. Each of them taught during the summers \nfor science camps, kids doing extra school work, learning through extra \nspecial teachers.\n\n  It isn't just limited to the generation that is retiring. My daughter \nis a teacher. She is part of the new generation. While she has been \nteaching, she has been working on two master's degrees so that she can \nbe a better teacher, although one of those gets her a certificate in \nadministration.\n  I mentioned Mrs. Wright, who went to administration, Mr. Shovelin, \nwho went to administration, and Mr. Popovich, who went to \nadministration. My daughter is looking to go to administration. Part of \nthe reason is that that is where the money is. All of those people \nliked their classroom work better and believed they made more of an \nimpact on the kids as a teacher.\n  My daughter emphasizes school-to-career. She does some of that summer \nteaching. When she finishes a major assignment, she calls the parents \nof the kids who did not turn in the assignment. That sounds fairly \nsimple. Check and see how many teachers do that. If they don't, let me \nsuggest to you the reason they don't. Her biggest discouragement was \nthe first time she did it, and then she called us in tears. She called \nthe parents, told them the assignment had not been turned in, and the \nparents said: So, what are you going to do about it?\n  Not a very good parental involvement activity. But she persists in \nit.\n  She also catches them doing things right, writes a note to their \nparents, and slips it in their book or their backpack, where sooner or \nlater the child discovers it, and rather than delivering this missive \nto their parents, they open it first to see what it is, and find out \nthat it is something good, and it does get delivered to the parents. \nBut whatever she notes that they are doing well--better than anyone--\nthey do the rest of the year, perhaps the rest of their life.\n  Teachers do have an impact. This bill will affect teachers. This bill \ndoes allow States to pursue alternative routes of certification, to \nencourage talented individuals from other fields to enter the teaching \nprofession. There are many qualified individuals who might be willing \nto teach if it were easier to become certified.\n  Although the Federal Government should never dictate certification \nstandards to individual States, we should make it as easy as possible \nfor interested States to recruit midcareer professionals, and perhaps \nretired members of the military, into the teaching profession. Title II \nof S. 1 goes a long way toward achieving that goal.\n  Of course, it has some very good rural possibilities, too. I know of \none very small community in Wyoming where there was a lady who grew up \nin France who had a good command of the French language. She wanted to \nteach French to the very few students--fewer than 15--who were in the \nschool district. Sometimes certification can get in the way of that.\n  I think we also need to bring professionals from all careers into the \nschools to help the kids understand that what they are learning will be \nvaluable later in their life. I do not think I have ever learned \nanything that did not turn out to be valuable sometime later. Good \nteachers encourage that kind of participation.\n  Despite all these efforts to improve teacher quality, there are some \nwho say: All we really need to do to improve student achievement is to \nhire more teachers. I have to tell you, for small rural States such as \nWyoming, that is not the answer. While I certainly recognize that our \nNation is facing a teacher shortage in the coming years, Wyoming \ncurrently has a declining student enrollment which is forcing some \ndistricts to eliminate teaching positions. More money specifically \nearmarked for hiring new teachers will be of little help to the schools \nin those areas with declining enrollment.\n\n  In addition, rural States such as Wyoming often have difficulty \nrecruiting and retaining teachers, especially highly qualified \nteachers. Money that is earmarked for hiring new teachers will not help \nWyoming keep our best teachers from leaving the State.\n  Congress must provide States and local school districts the \nflexibility to pay good teachers more money or to provide them with \nother incentives in order to get them to continue teaching. This bill \nprovides flexibility.\n  I think it may be helpful to provide my colleagues with some hard \ndata on Wyoming to illustrate that this is not simply lip service to a \nparticular philosophy on education. The variations in education \nstaffing needs across the country are real, and they are very dramatic.\n  For example, Wyoming has 48 school districts, with a total of 378 \nelementary and secondary schools. Here is the important part: Of those \nschools, 79 have an enrollment of fewer than 50 students. I am not \ntalking of a classroom size of 50 students, I am talking of a total \nenrollment in the school of 50 students. I am not kidding when I say, \nin Wyoming 79 schools are defined as ``rural.''\n  Then we have what we call the ``small schools.'' Those are the \nschools with an enrollment of 50 to 199 kids. There are 122 such \nschools in Wyoming. There are 143 ``medium-sized'' schools, with an \nenrollment ranging from 200 to 599 students. And we have a whopping 34 \nschools with an enrollment exceeding 500 kids for grade school and 600 \nkids for high school.\n  Districts often have to incorporate several grade schools to form a \nbig high school. Let me tell you, nothing gets the good people of \nWyoming more agitated than suggestions that they ought to consolidate \nthose small or rural schools into a medium-sized or big school. It \ntakes away the community. It takes away the emphasis. It takes away the \nway we have done things in Wyoming.\n  Now let me put this in context. The total enrollment in Wyoming's 378 \npublic schools was 91,883. That is 1999 data. In New York State, 2.8 \nmillion children were enrolled in public school. That is\n\n[[Page S4533]]\n\n1997 data. So both of those would have changed a little.\n  As for teachers in Wyoming, they are our heroes. There are 6,887 of \nthem. Based on aggregate teacher salary expenditures reported for the \nState last year, the average salary of a teacher in Wyoming is just \nunder $29,000. Those teachers are underpaid.\n  This bill can do something about that. If we adopt the flexibility in \ntitle II of this bill, the teacher quality provision, then schools in \nWyoming can use funds to give teachers a raise or reward outstanding \nteachers or provide incentives to recruit highly qualified teachers to \nour great State.\n  When educators from Wyoming visit me, the resounding message is \nusually not: Make our schools and class sizes even smaller; it is: Help \nus recruit good teachers and keep good teachers--with a lot of emphasis \non the ``keep good teachers,'' and the need for higher pay and \nflexibility.\n  If you can believe it, there have been teachers hired in Wyoming \nunder the Class Size Reduction Initiative that was appropriated but \nnever authorized for the past 2 years. If they so choose, the schools \nthat hired those teachers can retain them under this bill. However, the \nquestion I ask, on behalf of all the schools that were not eligible for \nthat money because they already had small school size, is: Are the \nstruggles they face in recruiting and retaining quality teachers any \nless important in ensuring that every child receives a quality \neducation?\n\n  Do not forget the variations in this country, the fact that we cannot \nhave one-size-fits-all Government. When it comes from Washington, it is \ntoo little, with too many regulations. We are not suggesting it ought \nto be more, with more regulations.\n  The research shows that while a small class size may have an effect \non student performance and achievement, having a highly qualified \nteacher has an even greater impact. That was shown in a study by \nRivkin, Hanushek, and Kain in 1998. And, according to the Department of \nEducation's National Center for Education Statistics, we still need to \ninvest in figuring out how to best help current and new teachers to be \nhighly qualified. Massachusetts provided the perfect example of that, \nthat assisting schools in having great teachers is as important, if not \nmore so, than meeting federally targeted class size goals.\n  I hope this background about Wyoming's uniquely rural public \neducation system, juxtaposed on that of ``big'' States, can help my \ncolleagues to appreciate why the flexibility in this bill is so \nimportant to meeting the needs of all our children.\n  I will not see a bill enacted that doesn't provide as much support \nfor Wyoming students' success as it does for the students in big \ncities. Our children are our most valuable resource, and we must \nprepare them to face the challenges of the 21st century. We cannot do \nthis by allowing Washington politicians to implement a one-size-fits-\nall approach to education.\n  The Better Education for Students and Teachers Act allows States to \ndecide how to best serve their students and teachers. I strongly \nsupport this legislation and encourage my colleagues to do the same, \nand to maintain the flexibility that it has.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nWyoming for sharing his good judgment and observation about education \nin rural areas, States with smaller populations, and about their \nparticular needs and the challenges they are facing in terms of \nstrengthening teacher quality in those communities. We are grateful for \nhis comments.\n  I add my strong support to the amendment offered by my good friend \nSenator Wellstone of Minnesota, making sure the tests that are \ndeveloped under this legislation are going to be the kinds of tests \nthat are going to be helpful and useful in terms of advancing the \nacademic achievement of the children in this country.\n  We know tests in and of themselves are not reform. Tests don't \nprovide a well-qualified teacher. Tests don't provide smaller class \nsizes. Tests don't provide afterschool programs. Tests, in and of \nthemselves, are a device and only a device.\n  In Lancaster, PA, we have seen tests used as frequently as every 9 \nweeks by teachers. The purpose of those tests is to find out how the \nchildren are making progress in different courses. They have had a \nremarkable amount of success because they are broad dimensioned. They \nare challenging the thinking process of the children. It demonstrates \nthat when the tests are done well, not just in the kinds of tests, the \nmultiple choice tests, but ones that really evaluate the children's \nprogress and look at the thinking process of the child, and then takes \naction, it is going to be supplementary services for those children in \norder to enhance their academic achievement, then there is legitimacy \nin terms of these kinds of evaluations.\n\n  I commend the Senator from Minnesota for bringing this measure to the \nfloor. This has been a matter, among others, that he has been \nabsolutely passionate about. It is well deserved.\n  What we don't want to do is pass legislation that claims we are doing \nsomething about accountability and are relying on the slick, simple, \neasy multiple choice tests which are being taught by teachers in \ndifferent communities and then think we are doing something for \nchildren. We are not. That is something the Senator wants to address.\n  There are some wonderful studies that have been done in evaluating \nwhat is working and what is not working in the States and local \ncommunities. The statement of the Research and Policy Committee of the \nCommittee for Economic Development is a very interesting evaluation of \nthe effectiveness of evaluating students, measuring student \nachievement. It reviews in great detail what is being done. They start \noff by saying that tests are a means, not an end, in school reform.\n\n       Real educational improvement requires changing what goes on \n     in classrooms.\n\n  It continues from there.\n  Perhaps one of the more interesting comments came from Education \nWeek, which also has been doing evaluations of the testing process. I \nwill mention a paragraph here:\n\n       Districts must draft policies that rely on multiple \n     criteria, including test scores, student's academic \n     performance, and teacher recommendations.\n\n  That is how they think you can do the best kinds of evaluation of a \nchild.\n  ``Initially I was resistant to the use of multiple criteria,'' \nacknowledges Gary Cook, director of the Office of Education \nAccountability in the State education department. This is in the State \nof Wisconsin.\n\n       I have changed my opinion. I think it really forces \n     districts to consider all the pieces of evidence in a \n     student's performance to determine whether they should \n     advance to the next grade or graduate. We need something more \n     than just whether the child is going to be able to get the \n     right answer or guess at the right answer. We need to \n     evaluate how the children get to the answer.\n\n  That is the essence of the Wellstone amendment. He has explained it \nvery well.\n  I know there are other colleagues who want to address the issue. I \ncommend him.\n  We have enough experience now to know what doesn't work and what is \nan abuse of the whole testing process and what does work and can be \nused in evaluating children's progress so that well-trained teachers in \nclassrooms that are small enough so they can teach and can use these \ntests in ways to help children make progress during the year, \nunderstanding what the needs are of those children, and so they can \ncontinue to make progress.\n  That is the essence of the Senator's amendment. He is right on \ntarget. It is one of the most important aspects of this legislation. \nThis is one of the most important amendments we have. Many of us have \nbeen thinking about how to try to address it. The Senator from \nMinnesota has, in his typical way, found a pathway to do it.\n  I commend him and thank him. This is an extraordinary addition to \nwhat we are attempting to do with the legislation. I am grateful to him \nfor his bringing this to our attention. I am hopeful we will be able to \nachieve it.\n\n  Let me mention one other evaluation. This is using these portfolio \nassessments. Here students collect what they have done over a period of \ntime, not just because it is helpful to have all that material in one \nplace but because the process of choosing what to\n\n[[Page S4534]]\n\ninclude and deciding how long to evaluate becomes an opportunity for \nthem to reflect on their past learning as well as to set new goals.\n  As in other forms of performance assessment, they provide data far \nmore meaningful than what would be learned from a conventional test, \nstandardized or otherwise, about what the student can do and where they \nstill need help. This is the conclusion of an evaluation of a number of \nthe existing tests. It really captures in a few short words what is \nbeing sought by the Senator from Minnesota. I again thank him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will be brief. I thank the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts for his very gracious remarks.\n  To summarize: What this amendment says is there is three critical \ningredients about this testing to make sure that it is reliable, to \nmake sure it is fair, and that it is accurate. One of those ingredients \nis that it is comprehensive. You want to use multiple measures. You do \nnot want to use one single standardized test to evaluate how students \nare doing or how schools are doing or how a school district is doing.\n  The second thing is, you want it to be coherent. You want the testing \nto actually measure the curriculum, the subject matter that is being \ntaught. You want there to be a connection. You don't want, in turn, \nteachers to have to teach to standardized tests that have no relation \nto the subject matter.\n  It is critically important. This is what the Committee on Economic \nDevelopment was trying to say in their report. The final thing is that \nit should be continuous and it should measure the progress of a child \nover a period of time. That is terribly important to do.\n  I want to, one more time, say to colleagues that I guarantee you that \nif we don't have this language that just makes explicit what I think \nall of us are in agreement on, which is that this testing should be \nbased upon the very best professional standards, then what you are \ngoing to have is teachers all over the country having to teach to \nstandardized tests. It is going to be drill education, educationally \ndeadening. It is going to be horrible for kids. It is not going to fire \ntheir imagination. It is going to be at cross-purposes to getting \npeople to go into education.\n  A great deal is at stake. I hope to have support and I appreciate the \nsupport of the Senator from Massachusetts. I hope I will have support \nfrom the other side of the aisle and that we will pass this amendment. \nThe two concerns I have had about the legislation when we went through \ncommittee--I say to the Senator, when we marked up the bill, this was \none question. The other is the resource question.\n  At the very minimum, I think it is terribly important to do this the \nright way. If I could, I am speaking from this desk, and I will move to \nmy desk. If I may have the floor for one more second, let me just also \nlist a number of the organizations that are supporting this. They \nare: the American Association of School Administrators, Hispanic \nEducation Coalition, Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund, \nNational Council of La Raza, National Education Association, National \nParent Teacher Association, National Hispanic Leadership Agency \nScorecard, and the American Psychological Association.\n\n  There are a variety of organizations around the country that support \nit. So I hope this amendment will engender widespread support and that \nthe Senate will pass this amendment. I think it will make it a much \nbetter bill. I don't think it is the whole answer. It deals with part \nof the testing legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am a big believer in the importance of \ntesting students. I think that testing has an essential and appropriate \nrole in the curriculum of any educational system. I think there is no \ndoubt that we have to test in order to determine whether or not \nstudents are meeting high academic standards. It would be a delight, I \nsuppose, to most students who think that we are not going to test them \nbut, indeed, we are.\n  I think this debate and what the Senator from Minnesota is attempting \nto bring our attention to is that there are ``tests'' and there are \n``tests.'' Making sure that the tests are used for the purpose of \nmeasuring student performance, determining what kind of additional help \na student might need, is really what we are focused on through the \nSenator's amendment.\n  I appreciated very much Chairman Jeffords' important amendment that \nwe voted on last week to make sure we have Federal support, financial \nsupport, behind the design and implementation of these tests because we \nwant to send a clear message to States and local districts that we \nbelieve in accountability, but we want to put some dollars behind that \nbelief by saying we want you to design and implement tests that are \ngoing to really measure what students learn.\n  Right now, many teachers who contact my office, or the ones I see \nwhen I visit schools, as I did on Monday in New York City, are terribly \nconcerned that what might very well happen is that more and more \ntesting will be piled on without there being any requirement that they \nbe worthwhile tests and without the resources to assist the teachers--\nwho, after all, are on the front lines in the classrooms--in knowing \nhow best to address the needs of their students that are revealed by \nthe tests.\n  I was very impressed by this document put out by the Committee for \nEconomic Development. My colleagues know that the Committee for \nEconomic Development is a group of business people in our country. They \nare very committed to creating the conditions that will further \neconomic development, and they know that one of the key conditions, if \nnot the most important one, is the quality of our education. Looking at \nthe board of trustees and the Committee for Economic Development, we \nhave people from the leading corporations in America who see firsthand \nwhat their employees need when they come into the workplace, who are on \nthe front lines of hiring people for a job. They have put out a \npublication that I really commend to my colleagues, to the \nadministration, and to all of us who are concerned about using testing \nto improve student learning. It is called ``Measuring What Matters.'' \nIt makes many of the same points that Senator Wellstone makes.\n  It might be somewhat surprising for some of the people who serve on \nthe board of trustees for the Committee for Economic Development to \nknow that they agree with Senator Wellstone, but they do. They agree \nthat what we need are tests that will actually improve student \nlearning. That certainly is what the intent of the bill that we \nreported out of the Health Committee under Chairman Jeffords' \nleadership was aimed at doing. How do we make it clear that tests are a \nmeans, they are not an end, in school reform. We don't just give the \ntests and pick out winners and losers. We have never done that in the \nUnited States--one of the reasons our educational system is both unique \nand successful and has been for decades despite our problems, which we \ntalk about endlessly. We should look at some of the reasons why we have \nbeen successful.\n\n  I would rank near the top of that the flexibility of our educational \nsystem. We don't give a test when a child is 11 years old and say, all \nright, this group of children, you are consigned to a certain set of \noccupations; this other group, you did well on the 11-year-old test, so \nwe are going to send you to different schools and put you on a \ndifferent path.\n  We don't test when children are 14 and make that conclusion. We don't \nsay that there are some children who can only attend certain kinds of \ncourses in certain schools and others are barred because of tests. We \ndon't have the kind of one-test determination that opens the doors or \nshuts them in colleges in other parts of the world. I think that has \nserved us well in our country.\n  There are a lot of people who don't take school seriously until they \nare in high school. Sometimes they graduate and maybe then find their \nway to a community college. Then they really get energized; they know \nwhat they want to learn. So we have always viewed tests not as a stop \nsign for a child the system holds up and says: You are a loser; you \ndon't know anything. We use them to say: Look, we\n\n[[Page S4535]]\n\nneed to help. How can we provide more support for you to be able to get \nthe most out of your education?\n  I think it is important for us to remember that tests are not an end; \nthey are a means. They should be a means toward lifelong learning or \nimproving the climate for learning or for giving individuals the tools \nthey need to be successful, not just in the classroom but in life.\n  It is also important, as the Committee for Economic Development \npoints out, that tests need to be valid and reliable and equitable. \nThere should not be any doubt that I think any good test would meet \nthose three criteria. First of all, validity: Are we measuring what we \nintend to measure? If we spend the whole year teaching children one set \nof facts or studying one set of subjects and we test on something else, \nthat is not a valid test. So we need to make sure that what we measure \nis what we are teaching, and what we are teaching is in some way \nreflective of the standards of what we expect from our educational \nsystem.\n  Reliability is also a given. How consistent and dependable are the \nassessment results? Are these tests that teachers and parents and \nstudents and community leaders can depend on because they really \nreflect what we want our children to know?\n  Finally, are they equitable tests? That doesn't mean there are two \nstandards, one for certain children who live in affluent suburbs and \none for children who live in our poorest neighborhoods. No, if we are \ndoing anything with this effort, it is to try to make sure we combine \nboth excellence and equity and we do everything possible to give the \nopportunities where they are most needed.\n  We know we have to be very careful that our tests are fair, that they \nhave no sign of bias toward any group of students. We need the help the \nFederal Government should provide if they are going to stand behind the \nregimen of testing we are considering in this bill.\n  We also need to be sure, if we are going to be using tests, that we \nget timely results. I offered an amendment in the committee. If tests \nare going to be given, the results ought to be available in 30 days and \nno more. What is the point of giving a test in April and you get the \nresults in June or July when the children have gone home or may not get \nthem until the following year?\n  We should have a sensible testing schedule, and we should require \nthat the results be provided in a timely manner to parents, students, \nand especially our teachers if they are going to be used for diagnostic \npurposes and to measure and grade the curriculum as well as the \nchildren.\n  There are a lot of tests that are currently being administered. We \ngive tests for everything now. We give tests for graduation. We give \ntests for promotion. We ought to be sensible about this. If the Federal \nGovernment, through our actions in the Congress and the administration, \nare going to say we want a test every year from third to eighth grade \nto determine how effective our children are learning reading and \nmathematics, then States have to take a hard look at what else they are \ntesting because it is getting so that many of our schools feel they are \nspending all their time preparing for tests, administering tests, and \ngrading tests. We have to be sure the tests are appropriate in number \nas well as content.\n  I also hope as we move forward on this important education debate \nthat we recognize that accountability for students and teachers is best \ntied to school performance. I go into schools all the time that are \nliterally within blocks of each other. Some are very successful and \nsome are not. A lot of it has to do with how the school is organized \nand what their priorities are. I hope the testing we are discussing to \nbe implemented in this bill will help us move entire schools toward \nbetter outcomes so that we lift up the performance of a school and \ncreate the atmosphere that will be conducive to learning and teaching.\n  One thing that bothers me, though, is that in our rush for tests and \nin our implementation of so many tests, a lot of schools are finding it \nimpossible to keep the more well-rounded curriculum that has been the \nhallmark of American education.\n  I believe music, art, physical education, extracurricular activities, \neven field trips, are a part of the educational process. What I hear \nfrom so many schools in my State is that the tests take up so much \ntime. The costs of the tests and all that goes with the tests mean that \na lot of other important educational objectives are being eliminated.\n  I hope we take a view of testing that puts it into the context of \nAmerican education generally. I take a back seat to no one in saying \neducation has to be a local responsibility and a national priority. I \nhave had experience in advocating for testing.\n  I believe I was the first person in the country who advocated testing \nteachers, using high-stakes tests. I even recommended schools be based \non their performance in how many students they could bring up to grade \nlevel. But I am very cautious--and I guess I am putting up a caution \nlight--that we not go so much toward testing as the definition of \neducation that we forget what the learning process is and how \nunique the American education system is where people can literally wake \nup in 10th grade or 12th grade or a child can be exposed to art or \nmusic or some other part of the curriculum, such as a good science lab \nin the eighth grade, and all of a sudden learning becomes real and they \nare not consigned to a second-class citizenship because they did not \nget into gear before that time.\n\n  We are starting to see, with our high-stakes testing in New York, a \nlot of dropouts. We are worried we are beginning to see an increase in \ndropouts. We have to take that seriously. Our goal is not to test \nchildren for the sake of testing, then telling them they do not measure \nup, and then holding them back for the sake of holding them back until \nthey become so frustrated and discouraged they leave the educational \nsystem. I do not think that is the goal of any of us in this Chamber.\n  Our goal is to have an accountability system so that we actually know \nwhat is being taught and what our children are learning, and use it for \ndiagnostic purposes to make every child a success.\n  Raising the caution lights that the amendment of the Senator from \nMinnesota raises is important for us to think about. I will add one \nadditional caution light. I guess that is the biggest issue of all for \nme, and that is the resources. I am very concerned, as I will state \nwhen we come to this in the days ahead, about the budget. We have been \npromised it will leave no child behind and will provide the resources \nfor extra testing, to deal with special ed, to deal with more resources \nfor our poorest children, to add teachers so we have lower class sizes, \nto modernize classrooms. I am worried that none of that will be in the \nbudget.\n  That puts many of us in a very difficult position because we know \nthat accountability is necessary, but we also know that resources in \nour poorest schools are an absolute necessary condition for a lot of \nour kids to be successful.\n  I enjoyed listening to the Senator from Wyoming talk about the very \nsmall school districts of fewer than 50 children. I have some very fond \nmemories of districts that small in Arkansas. I remember going to \ngraduating classes of three and four children. That is a very different \nand wonderful educational experience. I hope we never get away from \nthat in our country; that we do have schools that are that small in \nStates from Wyoming to upstate New York.\n  I come from a State that has some different kinds of problems. I have \na school system with a million children. I have school systems, such as \nthat of Buffalo, where the school stock is so old they cannot wire them \nfor computers because the buildings were built like forts.\n  I visited a school called the Black Rock Academy that was built in \n1898, last renovated in 1920. They are bewildered about what to do. \nThey cannot figure out how to get those computers set up. They have \nwires coming up, going in a window, into a little room. They have about \n30 computers, only 10 of which can be connected to the Internet. That \nis the best they can do under the circumstances. Buffalo has \nundertaken, using State dollars and local dollars, a tremendous school \nrenovation and modernization program.\n  Our needs in New York are different than the needs of the small \ndistricts in Wyoming. I hope we are going to look\n\n[[Page S4536]]\n\nat all of our children from coast to coast and all of our local school \ndistricts to figure out what we can do to make everybody successful. \nResources are key. It is more difficult to provide education in remote \nrural areas and in very concentrated poor areas in our inner cities. We \nneed a bill and we need the resources in the bill that empower local \ncommunities to make the decisions that are best for them.\n\n  There is a wonderful menu of opportunities in the bill where people \ncan choose professional development or technology, but we would really \nbe selling our children short if we do not also include lower class \nsize and school modernization because in the absence of some Federal \nhelp on those two issues, much of what we want to achieve is going to \nbe very difficult and beyond the reach of many of our districts, even \nthose that are making a good-faith effort, such as Buffalo, to deal \nwith a very old stock of schools.\n  I kid some of my colleagues. We were educating people in some \ncommunities in New York before some of the States represented in this \nbody were States. We were building schools before a lot of people had \nto build schools because of the centuries of history in New York. We \nhave some of those schools that have been around a very long time.\n\n  Good education can and does occur in those schools. But the \nconditions are worsening to the point where, as I said the other day, \nwe have concrete falling out of a ceiling, hitting a teacher on the \nhead. We have overcrowded classrooms. If we are going to be seeking \nboth excellence and equity, we have to do more to provide the resources \nall districts need to do the job they want to do for their children.\n  This is a very important issue that goes right to the heart of this \nbudget. I, along with many of my colleagues, was very disturbed to \nlearn there was no increase for education in the budget coming back \nfrom the House. This body voted in a bipartisan way for important \nmeasures that were attached to the budget. This was not just about \nnumbers; it was about values, the value of making sure we put the \ndollars into our education system and many other important priorities, \nfrom defense to food safety.\n  The budget coming back does not reflect that. It does not reflect the \nflexibility for the dollars that will be needed to do what we have \nalready voted for in the Senate.\n  I was very proud of the vote that said we need to fund special \neducation. It is about as close as we can get to a mandate. A lot of \nschool districts are under tremendous pressure because they cannot \nafford to do what they need to do. I was proud of this body for voting \nto fully fund title I. That was a values statement. It said our values \nare that we will invest in our poorest children. I was proud of our \nchairman's amendment that if the Federal Government puts this \nrequirement of testing on our districts, the Federal Government should \nhelp to pay for the development and implementation of those tests.\n  This body, in a bipartisan way, made some very important values \nstatements about education--not that we were just going to pass a bill \nthat sounded good but one that could actually produce results. I am \nvery pleased that at least in the Senate we are crafting a bill that I \nthink will make a difference in the lives of our children. If we \ncontinue on this path, it could revolutionize education across our \ncountry. But it cannot be seen in isolation from the budget which, \nafter all, carries the resources that will determine whether we have \nanything other than an empty promise.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to add my voice to what we are trying to \ndo in this Chamber and to look for ways to work with my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to make sure it is real.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I appreciate the comments and excellent statement.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 384\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the majority \nwants to go to the McConnell amendment, so I call up the McConnell \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Kentucky is \noffering an amendment that has merit. I do believe, however, that it \nneeds some improvement. I believe the amendment of the Senator from \nKentucky leaves a big void. It doesn't do anything to protect teachers. \nAnd, most importantly, it doesn't do anything to protect students and \nparents who have corporal punishment administered to them either \nlegally or illegally.\n  For example, the National Education Association, which represents \nalmost 3 million teachers and other educational employees, has grave \nconcerns about the McConnell amendment. Specifically, the National \nEducation Association is concerned the amendment will lead to increased \nincidents of corporal punishment.\n  There are many instances where we have to take a look at corporal \npunishment which is administered legally in many States. Take, for \nexample, a situation in Zwolle, LA. A story out of the New York Times a \nfew days ago indicates a young girl was brutally beaten--legally, \nsupposedly--in the school. In fact, the story states:\n\n       Laid out on the kitchen table, the snapshots of 10-year-old \n     Megan make a grim collage. They are not of her sweet face, \n     but of her bare behind. There are 12 in all, taken, her \n     mother says, day by day, as the doughnut-shaped bruises on \n     each cheek faded from a mottled purple to a dirty gray.\n\n  Megan's father, Robert, recalls that when he first saw the bruises \nhours after she was paddled by her school principal for elbowing a \nfriend in the cafeteria, he collapsed on the floor, crying. ``It hurt \nme more than it hurt Megan,'' Robert said. ``You don't hit on my \nbaby.''\n  Megan, a fourth grader, whose name appears more often on the honor \nroll than on a referral slip at the principal's office, is one of \nmillions of public school students still subject to corporal \npunishment. In March, her family joined a small but apparently growing \nnumber to stop Megan's beating.\n  One of her classmates, a boy by the name of DeWayne Ebarb, is a \nhyperactive child who has been paddled regularly throughout his time at \nthis elementary school. In the last 8 weeks, he has been paddled 17 \ntimes. This is a small town of some 2,000. People are wondering what is \ngoing on.\n  I think we should be concerned in Washington what we perhaps are \nlaying a stamp of approval on if we allow this amendment to pass as it \nis written.\n  Mr. President, 27 States have banned corporal punishment. The first \nwas New Jersey back in 1887. Then came Massachusetts, a century later, \nin 1971. There was a crusade in effect started by a man name Robert \nFathman from Ohio, president of the National Coalition to Abolish \nCorporal Punishment. You can't whack a prisoner, but you can whack a \nkindergarten child. The state of the law by the U.S. Supreme Court \nallows people who teach and train children in schools to beat them, but \nprisoners cannot be touched. It seems a strange little quirk in the \nlaw.\n  In some communities, the activities to allow a student to be whipped \nor spanked is approved in the law.\n  Since Mr. Fathman started his crusade in 1984 after his own daughter \nlanded on the painful end of a paddle, five States have adopted bans. \nOne of those States is the State of Nevada which banned corporal \npunishment in 1993. West Virginia acted in 1994. The number of \npaddlings around the country is in the millions. In 1980, it was 1.4 \nmillion; it is now down to half a million students beaten each year. We \nhave to look at those children who are beaten. It seems it is quite \nclear that black students are 2.5 times as likely to be struck as white \nstudents, a reflection of what researchers have long found to be more \nfrequent and harsher discipline for members of minorities.\n  Court challenges have been largely unsuccessful, including a 1977 \ndecision by the Supreme Court rejecting the notion that paddling is \ncruel and unusual punishment. A decade later, an appeals court ruled \nthat a New Mexico girl held upside down and beaten had been denied due \nprocess, signifying school officials could be held liable for severe \nbeatings. But this has been rare.\n  The vast preponderance of lawsuits challenging the use of corporal \npunishment are unsuccessful, says Charles Vergone, a professor at \nYoungstown State University, who has been studying this issue for 15 \nyears.\n  I hope that my friend from Kentucky, the distinguished senior \nSenator, will accept an amendment I will\n\n[[Page S4537]]\n\noffer which, in effect, basically would have corporal punishment not \napply to this amendment. This, in effect, would not give a stamp of \napproval to corporal punishment.\n  I think the instances pointed out during the discussion I heard from \nthe Senator from Kentucky raise some interesting points: one case about \nthe cheerleader who was asked to run a lap. I don't know all the facts \nof that case. From what the Senator from Kentucky outlined, it does not \nseem fair that she was still allowed to cheer on the night that she was \nsupposed to have been reprimanded for not following the instructions of \nher coach. I don't know all the facts, but from what I heard it appears \nthere is some validity to that.\n  Also, the long narrative with which the Senator from Kentucky led his \ndiscussion, dealing with the student who actually tried to do physical \nharm, maybe even kill one of his teachers, wound up going to court. I \nthink there is some merit to what the Senator from Kentucky outlined. \nThat is what I think would still be available if the amendment I will \noffer in a short time were accepted.\n  We have teachers who talk about having been in areas where they \ndidn't have the right to paddle and they didn't paddle, but they say if \nyou have the right to paddle it becomes the punishment of choice. It \nmakes it easier. Emily Williams, in rural Mississippi, said when she \narrived from Williams College last year, one of the fine universities \nin America, she was horrified to hear teachers striking students in the \nhallways, classrooms, and cafeteria. But soon she was doing it herself. \nWe are told that a number of teachers, in effect, brag about the fact \nthat they can beat their students.\n  I started this discussion about 10-year-old Megan who was beaten. If \nshe had gone to law enforcement authorities and showed them her rear \nend with all the bruises and contusions on it and said, ``This was done \nby my mother or father,'' very likely the juvenile authorities would \nhave stepped in and been involved in the care and custody of Megan. But \nbecause it was done by a teacher and that is legal, nothing has been \ndone or will be done.\n  If you look at corporal punishment, which a few years ago numbered \n1.2 million and is now over 600,000, we recognize there is a real \nproblem. We need not get into Biblical references. ``Spare the rod and \nspoil the child,'' that is one saying to which people always refer. One \npolice chief said, ``The Lord said, `Spare the rod and spoil the \nchild,' and I think he knows a lot more than those bleeding heart \nliberals.'' I am sure that is probably true, that he does, but there is \na time and place for everything. We have to be very careful to make \nsure anything we do here does not, in effect, support something that is \nnot good for children.\n  As I have indicated, the National Education Association policy \nopposes the use of corporal punishment as a means of disciplining \nstudents. There are no studies that have found that paddling, the most \nprevalent form of corporal punishment, improves school discipline. To \nthe contrary, Dr. Irving Heiman of Temple University has found it is a \ndetriment to children learning.\n  The National Education Association believes there are better ways to \nestablish and maintain control, including reducing class sizes. Of \ncourse, we are going to debate that, as we have. The debate has not \nbeen completed.\n  There is an amendment pending by Senator Murray to deal with reducing \nclass size. I think everyone acknowledges that would be a sensible \nthing to do, to make discipline better. Smaller classes enable teachers \nto give students more individualized attention and to better control \nclassroom activities. Recent studies have documented reductions in \nclassroom disruptions as a result of class size reduction. I don't \nthink we need a study to show us that if we have smaller classes, there \nare going to be fewer disruptions.\n\n  I hope we will take a positive look at the amendment I will offer \nshortly. The Teacher Liability Protection Act which is the name of the \nact, which now, to my understanding, is in the form of an amendment, \nwould immunize negligent teachers, principals, and administrators when \ntheir misconduct injures students. Not only would this measure make \nteachers unaccountable to parents, it would preempt the laws of all 50 \nStates with little or no justification for such a sweeping exercise of \nFederal control.\n  I do not think there is any need to create a special Washington-\nknows-best immunity for principals, teachers, and administrators. The \nStates, which for more than two centuries have had dominion over tort \nlaw, already have ample protections in place for teachers and \nadministrators. Washington should not dictate policy to State courts \nand administrators, and it should not dictate policy to the local \nschool boards.\n  As I said, I don't know all the facts dealing with the cheerleader \ncase that was mentioned by the Senator from Kentucky, but even though I \nmay disagree with the decision made by the court--I would still like to \nknow the facts--I also say the court had the right to make that \njudgment.\n  In the State of Nevada, judges are looked at very closely, the reason \nbeing judges in Nevada run for election. They cannot, in effect, thumb \ntheir nose at public opinion. As a result of that, I think judges in \nNevada generally do an excellent job of determining what the law should \nbe. But they are totally aware of what is going on in the public, and I \nwould say the same applies to the cheerleader case where she refused to \nrun laps. We need to know all those facts.\n  The American Federation of Teachers indicates there is no crisis. In \neffect, the American Federation of Teachers challenges whether legal \nimmunity is really needed. I don't think the fear of lawsuits is \nkeeping teachers from doing their jobs.\n  As I said, I think there is some merit to the amendment of the \nSenator from Kentucky. That is why I think the best thing to do is \noffer a second-degree amendment to that, to take away from that, in \neffect, the approval of corporal punishment, which is in keeping with \nmany States in the United States.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question without losing my right \nto the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I do not seek to have the Senator lose his right to \nthe floor, but just to make certain the Senator understands my \namendment neither promotes nor condones corporal punishment. I don't \nknow what second-degree amendment the Senator plans to offer. If he \nwould be willing to discuss it prior to sending it forward, it may be \nwe could agree to it. As I will make clear when I regain the floor \nafter the Senator finishes speaking, my amendment has nothing to do \nwith corporal punishment. I am sorry the Senator from Nevada may have \ninterpreted it otherwise. I think I can make it clear to his \nsatisfaction that it is wholly unrelated to that subject. And I might \nwell be interested in supporting the second-degree if I can take a look \nat it.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to leave that matter strictly up to \nthe States. The Federal Government would not either support or oppose \ncorporal punishment.\n  Mr. REID. The problem with that--I will be happy to share the \namendment with the Senator, and I am confident and hopeful he will \napprove it--is the fact that the amendment offered by the Senator from \nKentucky, as I understand it, said basically that teachers and \nadministrators will not be sued for basic, simple negligence, but they \ncan be sued for gross negligence.\n  Is that the underlying import of the Senator's amendment?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think pursuant to State law. What we are seeking not \nto do is to replace State law on this subject.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate that. That is my point and my problem. If a \nteacher spanks, beats--whatever the term we want to use--a student, he \nis doing that under the confines, and under the direction of the State \nlaw, in effect. What we want to say is that any acts of teachers that \nare negligent that do not apply to their administering corporal \npunishment, we agree with the Senator from Kentucky. I don't think \nthere is any hindrance on our part of State law. If the State has \ncorporal punishment, fine. The State of Nevada outlawed corporal \npunishment in 1993. But that was up to the State legislature. I didn't \ndo that.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 421 To Amendment No. 384\n\n  Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n\n[[Page S4538]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 421 to amendment No. 384.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To limit the teacher liability protections in this bill for \nteachers who strike a child to those situations in which such action is \n   necessary to maintain order and in which a parent or guardian has \n            provided recent written consent to such actions)\n\n       On page 4, line 23, insert a comma after (b), strike \n     ``and'' and insert ``and (d)'' after (c).\n       On page 6, line 6, insert a new subsection (c), as follows, \n     and renumber accordingly:\n       ``(c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to apply \n     to any action of a teacher that involves the striking of a \n     child, including, but not limited to paddling, whipping, \n     spanking, slapping, kicking, hitting, or punching of a child, \n     unless such action is necessary to control discipline or \n     maintain order in the classroom or school and unless a parent \n     or legal guardian of that child has given written consent to \n     the teacher prior to the striking of the child and during the \n     school year in which the striking incident occurs.''\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. To move the process along, will the Senator object if we \nare able to dispose of the Wellstone amendment while the Senators are \ntalking, with the recognition that the Senator from Kentucky would be \nnext on the matter after the conclusion of the Wellstone amendment?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I would appreciate it if we would withhold on that.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. There has been a special reservation of that proceeding.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friends from Massachusetts and Kentucky that I \nwould be happy to do that. We want to move to another amendment. I \nwanted to confer with the Senator from Kentucky, but we were told that \nis what the majority wanted. That is why I called up the amendment \nwithout the opportunity of giving it to the Senator. I submitted the \namendment. I have other things to say. I could do that at a later time. \nI simply ask my friend from Kentucky and the majority manager of the \nbill to take a look at this amendment. If there are problems with it, \ntell us. We will talk some more about it on both sides.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I guess the understanding is that we \nwould move forward on Wellstone, and then come back to the McConnell \namendment in the second degree by agreement. Is that what we are \ntalking about?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that earlier there \nwas an agreement that the Wellstone amendment would be accepted. I \nguess that is no longer the case. We are now on the amendment of the \nSenator from Kentucky. I ask if the Senator would consider a quorum \ncall for a few minutes. The McConnell amendment is the business before \nthe Senate now. We can go to anything else without unanimous consent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it would be my preference that we stay \non the McConnell amendment in the second degree by Senator Reid, and, \nif it is all right with the manager, go into a quorum call to be able \nto work this out and go forward. Therefore, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Smith of Oregon). Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Kentucky has offered an \nalternative that I think is in keeping with what we have tried to \naccomplish. I think it is something that would make his amendment \nbetter. It is something named after Senator Coverdell; something \nSenator Coverdell would appreciate, especially in the fashion that it \nwas done.\n  Paul Coverdell, as you know, was a great conciliator, was great at \nmediating problems. I expect perhaps the spirit of Paul Coverdell was \ninvolved in this because I think it is a good settlement for everybody.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 421, Withdrawn\n\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my second-degree \namendment be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Kentucky, at the appropriate time, will \noffer a modification to his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 384, As Modified\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Pursuant to the agreement that Senator Reid and I have \ncome to, I send a modification of my amendment to the desk and ask \nunanimous consent that my amendment be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 384), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n                      TITLE __--TEACHER PROTECTION\n\n     SEC. __1. TEACHER PROTECTION.\n\n       The Act (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n\n                     ``TITLE __--TEACHER PROTECTION\n\n     ``SEC. __1.

Mr. President, I ask the manager of the bill, are we \nready to move forward with a vote after some closing observations?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think we will have to wait until about \n12:40. That is my understanding. Some people may not be available, but \nI am sure the vote will take a little while anyway. So if it is OK, \ncould we have the vote start at 12:40?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky has the floor. Is \nthat the unanimous consent request, that the vote begin at 12:40?\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nthe McConnell amendment begin at 12:40.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are about to vote on my amendment, \nthe Paul D. Coverdell teacher protection amendment. This important \nlegislation extends important protections from frivolous lawsuits to \nteachers, principals, administrators, and other education professionals \nwho take reasonable steps to maintain order in the classroom.\n  The amendment, I hasten to add, does not protect those teachers who \nengage in ``willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, or a \nconscious flagrant indifference to the rights and safety'' of a \nstudent.\n  This is not new ground for the Senate. I remind all of my colleagues \nthat last year we approved this virtually identical amendment by a vote \nof 97-0. It is now the appropriate time for the Senate to revisit this \nissue and give its full endorsement. Mr. President, 97-0 is about as \nstrong as it gets in the Senate. I hope we will have a similar vote \nwhen the vote commences at 12:40.\n  I know Senator Coverdell would obviously be grateful to see that his \nlegislation may well be on the way to becoming law this year. I urge \nall of my colleagues to support the amendment, as they did the last \ntime it was offered.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I understand we have a vote in about 7 or 8\n\n[[Page S4540]]\n\nminutes. During this period of time, unless somebody else wishes to \nspeak on the amendment, I would like to address the issue of teacher \nquality. This reflects upon one of the underlying amendments we are \ndiscussing--which is, class size--with an emphasis on the relationship \nthat exists between a teacher and a child where we know much of that \nlearning experience takes place, kindergarten through the 12th grade. \nIt is that relationship and a number of factors.\n  We start with having a very good, highly qualified teacher in a \nclassroom, an effective teacher in the classroom so that we really can \nsay that every child has an opportunity to have achievement boosted, to \nhave the achievement gap, which has gotten worse in the last 35 years, \nbe diminished over time.\n  The argument we have made again and again on this side of the aisle \nhas been that while class size is important, the absolute size should \nnot to be dictated by Washington but determined by local schools, local \nschool districts, local communities. Whether it be Nashville TN, \nAnchorage, AK, New York, NY, the decision should be made by people, not \nby Washington, DC.\n  Thus, what we have done in the underlying bill--and it is important \nthat people understand what is in the bill;--is combine that program, \nwith other programs so that we have the necessary resources we need--up \nto $3 billion, I should add. And these can be distributed, used, \nprioritized, locally rather than here in Washington, DC. So that in any \nparticular classroom, a decision can be made whether or not to use that \nmoney for smaller class size, for more computers, for better reading \nmaterials, for more technology,--that they have the flexibility to \nprioritize rather than having a Government program for each and every \nissue.\n\n  Yesterday I spent some time underlining what we have in the bill for \nteacher quality, teacher development. It is quite extensive, in terms \nof State activities, where States very specifically may use these funds \nfor things such as teacher certification, teacher recruitment, \nprofessional development, and other ways of teacher support. Examples \nof such activities include reforming teacher certification or licensing \nrequirements, addressing alternative routes to State certification of \nteachers, recruiting teachers and principals, providing professional \ndevelopment activities, looking at issues such as reform of tenure \nsystems for teachers.\n  Local educational systems may use these funds for professional \ndevelopment, teacher development, teacher recruitment or hiring \nteachers. Again, these decisions are made locally with the funds \nprovided through the Federal system--as I said, $3 billion.\n  It moves on down to local accountability because we do want to make \nsure, if these funds have been pooled and these resources are available \nlocally for teacher development, for improving the quality of teachers, \nfor attracting new teachers to the classroom, that the system is held \naccountable, and there are extensive accountability provisions in the \nunderlying bill, already in the bill, that include, such things as \nperformance objectives. Those performance objectives are related to \nstudent achievement, to reducing that achievement gap over time, to the \nability to retain teachers, to the ability of taking teachers who may \nbe certified in one field but haven't been certified in another.\n  A particular area I hope we will be able to address later this week \nor next week is this whole specific area of math and science teachers. \nAgain and again I have come to this floor citing the third \ninternational mathematics and science study, beginning in 1995 but even \nsince that point in time, which shows that 4th grade students in the \nUnited States are among the top scorers from the 41 nations tested. But \nthen both the TIMMS study and the TIMMS repeat study in 1999 show that \nby the 8th grade, U.S. students tested, not at the top, but in the \nmiddle. By the 12th grade, we see that U.S. students are scoring near \nthe very bottom in math and science of all of the countries tested.\n  In today's global economy this means that if we are not preparing \npeople in the 12th grade in terms of math and science, we are going to \nsee jobs move overseas because Americans, especially for the high tech \njobs of the future are going to be very ill equipped to compete with \nour neighbors globally in job creation, in math and science, in \ntechnology, and broadly.\n  Teacher educational development has to be a continuing process. It \nhas to be done in a collaborative partnership with those people, \nincluding at local teacher training, local universities, local high \nschools, and local elementary schools. It has to be done in a \npartnership way. Again, this is spelled out in the bill.\n  In closing, this bill--we call it the BEST Act--authorizes $500 \nmillion in fiscal year 2002 for the establishment of math and science \npartnerships, linking the math and science departments of institutions \nof higher education with States and local school districts. That is \nvery positive. There is a lot more we can do in terms of clarification \nof how moneys can be used, in authorizing the States to use funding in \ncertain areas to recruit and retain teachers and, finally, in looking \nat math and science funding for a master teacher program.\n  I am very excited about this amendment, which will be filed later \ntoday or later in the week. It will build on what is in the underlying \nbill, and puts the focus on the quality of teachers, not just the \nquantity of teachers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired. The question is now on \nagreeing to the amendment of the Senator from Kentucky. The yeas and \nnays have not been ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I have sent to the desk an amendment on my \nbehalf and of Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \nWellstone, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \nBaucus, Mr. Levin, Mr. Reid, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. \nDayton.\n  This amendment is a bipartisan attempt to ensure that the President's \nReading First initiative is a success. Let me commend the President for \nemphasizing literacy as a very important part of education reform. His \nproposal would recognize the importance of literacy and increase and \nsupport the training of teachers, but it would not reach another \nimportant aspect of achieving literacy, and that is a well-equipped \nschool library. My amendment would help students achieve literacy by \nauthorizing funds so schools could acquire new library books, new \nlibrary material.\n  Funding school libraries has been part of the educational \nauthorization for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act since its \nbeginning in 1965. The very first ESEA authorized the purchase of \nlibrary materials.\n  One of the sad commentaries about school libraries today is that much \nof that material is still on the shelves, with copyright dates of 1967, \n1968, 1969, and 1970. Clearly, the world has moved a great deal from \nthose days. We have landed on the Moon. We have created the Internet \nand done lots of other interesting things. Many other aspects of life \nhave changed since the mid-1960s and early 1970s.\n  My proposal would provide resources, based upon a targeted formula, \nso the poorest schools would have access to these funds, so we could, \nin fact, replenish library collections throughout the United States.\n  Last week the Senate uniformly voted for Senator Collins' Reading \nFirst amendment, where she incorporated additional provisions into the \nPresident's proposal for Reading First. I support this effort by \nSenator Collins, but I believe there is a deficiency within this \ninitiative. It fails to include an essential component that would \nensure students learn to read. We have to fund school libraries so \nstudents have the necessary books, technology, and materials, which is \nan integral part of our effort to improve reading in our schools.\n  What we are finding is the gap between the highest and lowest \nachieving students is widening. But what we are also finding, when we \nlook at data, is that in those schools that have first-\n\n[[Page S4542]]\n\nrate libraries and trained library personnel, achievement goes up \nconsistently. That is a factor I believe we cannot ignore. It is one of \nthose factors that provide additional support for my proposal today.\n  Again, the President's underlying proposal authorizes $900 million \nfor the Reading First Initiative. It has been enhanced and improved by \nSenator Collins' amendment. This proposal, which I and my colleagues \nhave offered, would provide further enhancement to this worthwhile goal \nof ensuring every child in America reads, and reads well.\n  Let me also acknowledge the great work of Senator Jeffords and \nSenator Kennedy who have brought us this far. But even though they have \nbrought us this far, even though we have, with the President's \ndirection, emphasized literacy, we still have this gap in achieving \nliteracy. We have to provide funds for school libraries so they can buy \nthe material and books necessary to support the scientifically based \nreading programs the President has made the centerpiece of his Reading \nFirst Initiative.\n  School libraries are really the places where we reinforce those \nreading skills. They are, in one sense, the laboratories where children \nexplore their ability to read and explore a great world beyond the \nconfines of their classroom or their community. You can go into a \nlibrary and, figuratively, travel around the world, even reduce \nyourself to the size of a microbe, and travel, coursing through the \nveins of the body. That is what is remarkable about reading and so \nfundamentally important about reading. It is also something that has to \nbe a lifelong pursuit.\n\n  Frankly, even though we can instruct children with respect to \nliteracy, unless we provide them with stimulating books and expose them \nto the library as students, it is not that likely that they will \nappreciate reading or continue the habit of reading, this habit of \nself-improvement. Children leave schools, but we hope they will not \nleave the library. That is one of the great lessons they will take from \ntheir schooling--not just the mechanics of reading but a love of \nreading so they will leave the school but never leave the library, they \nwill be patrons of public libraries, they will be patrons of books. The \nlibrary is the foundation for independent learning, and I cannot think \nof a more worthwhile goal in this reauthorization than creating that \ntype of spirit and that type of ability within the students of America.\n  As I mentioned before, as we look at high levels of literacy, we find \na very strong correlation between these high literacy levels and good \nschool library programs. In one study, this was the case for every \nschool and in every grade level tested, regardless of social and \neconomic factors in the community, and in very dissimilar States: \nColorado, Pennsylvania, and Alaska. These findings echo earlier studies \nwhich found that students in schools with well-equipped libraries and \nprofessional library specialists performed better on achievement tests \nfor reading.\n  Again, we understand one major focus of this legislation is testing \nstudents to standards, bringing those standards up and bringing every \nchild up to those standards. Without the support of good public \nlibraries in the community but, more particularly, good school library \nprograms, we are not going to be able to give these children the tools \nto reach the standards, to pass the tests we are prescribing now for a \nvast section of American students.\n  As I indicated, there is an array of scientific evidence, research \nevidence, that demonstrates this fundamental point. A 1993 review of \nresearch, ``Power of Reading'' by education professor Stephen Krashen \nof the University of Southern California, demonstrated that higher test \nscores result when there is a greater investment in better qualified \nschool library staff and more diverse school library collections.\n  A 1994 Department of Education report on the impact of school library \nmedia centers noted that the highest achieving students tend to come \nfrom schools with strong libraries and library programs. So I believe \nthis evidence is further proof that we can improve reading by making a \nwise and efficient investment by enhancing our school libraries.\n  We also understand that we have today on our shelves, in our \nlibraries, books that are simply out of date and inaccurate. I have \nmade something of a cottage industry of bringing my favorite anomalous \nbooks to committee hearings, such as a book that talks about what is it \nlike to be a flight attendant; only they use an incorrect term \n``stewardess.''\n  If you look through this book, if you look through these pages, you \nget a distinctly different impression of what it is like to be a flight \nattendant. First of all, they are all women. We know that is not the \ncase today. Second, there are very few minorities. We know that is not \nthe case today. Third, they talk about the rule that you must leave if \nyou want to get married, because they all have to be single. They have \npictures of flight attendants doing sit-ups and describe that as their \nhomework.\n  These are images that are totally out of sync with today's times. But \nyet this book was on the shelves of the school library. Ask yourself. \nIf a young man is interested in that profession and takes that book off \nthe shelf, what impression will he get? Obviously, it is not going to \nopen up the possibility of a career for him as a flight attendant.\n  That is just one example. There are examples of books on the shelves \nof today's schools that say things like some day we will get to the \nMoon.\n  I received a book from a librarian in Arizona that has the title, \n``Asbestos, The Magic Mineral,'' suggesting a book that was not written \nrecently.\n  One of my favorite selections that was sent to me is the story of the \nU.S. Constitution, and an analysis of the Constitution, with a foreword \nby President Calvin Coolidge--a little bit out of date but still on the \nshelves of a school library.\n  We can do more than provide our children with outdated sources of \ninformation. We also now know that we are in a situation where books \nare not the only way we are communicating information to children. \nLibraries need sophisticated, computer-based media. They need the \ntechnology of the computer.\n  Yet what you find at the local level is a situation where despite the \nbest intentions of school committee men and women and the best \nintentions of Governors and mayors, school library collections are the \nfirst casualties of unexpected expenses.\n  It is not a surprise. Here is typically what happens across this \ncountry day in and day out. A school superintendent has worked hard all \nyear. She reserved $50,000 for a new library, new books, and new media.\n  Then she gets a call. Their unexpected expenses have gone up $75,000. \nWhere do you get that kind of money for an unexpected expense? We will \ndo the library improvement next year. Next year becomes the following \nyear, and the following year. As a result, we have a crisis at school \nlibraries. Some shelves are near empty and the books are out of date. \nThey are not opening up new, modern vistas to students. In some cases \nthey are giving them erroneous stereotypes about the world at a very \nimpressionable age.\n  Let me suggest, as I said before, some of the books that we find on \nthe shelves of our libraries.\n  There is one called ``Rockets Into Space,'' copyright 1959. This \nbook, by the way, has been checked out of a Los Angeles school library \n13 times since 1995.\n  It informs the student that there is a way to get to the Moon. \nObviously, it was written before there was the successful voyage to the \nMoon by man. It states that it will take two stages to get to the Moon, \nfirst to a space station, and then to the moon. Essentially, that is \nnot what we did. But the book has been checked out numerous times \nwithin the last decade.\n  There is another book which I found interesting. This was from a \nschool library in Richmond, VA, entitled ``What A United States Senator \nDoes,'' copyright 1975. It notes that the Vice President of the United \nStates and the President of the Senate is Nelson Rockefeller, and that \nthere are two Senate office buildings, the Old Senate Office Building \nand the New Senate Office Building, which we now call the Dirksen \nBuilding.\n  There is a book from a library in Tarzana, CA, entitled ``Women At \nWork,'' copyright 1959, which informs\n\n[[Page S4543]]\n\nthe reader that there are seven occupations open to young woman: \nlibrarian, ballet dancer, airline stewardess, practical nurse, piano \nteacher, beautician, and author.\n\n  These are not positions open exclusively to women and are certainly \nnot the only professions open to women today.\n  Here is one from a Pennsylvania library entitled, ``The First Book \nAtlas,'' copyright 1968, which states that the five most populated \ncities in the world are New York City; Tokyo, Japan; Paris, France; \nLondon, England; and Shanghai, China.\n  That might have been correct in 1968. But, for the record, the five \nmost populated cities in the world today are Seoul, South Korea; Sao \nPaolo, Brazil; Bombay, India; Jakarta, Indonesia; and Moscow, Russia.\n  In a rapidly changing world when we expect our students to be \ninternationally adept and not just locally competent, we are providing \nthem with information that is woefully out of date.\n  I am sure there are atlases and maps throughout most schools and in \nschool libraries that do not have all the present sovereign nations of \nthe world. Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, we know there has \nbeen quite a few new nations emerging into the world. But this is what \nwe find consistently.\n  I believe if we do not provide better materials for our libraries, we \nare not going to fully complement the President's initiative and \nSenator Collins' amendment. It is one thing to be literate and to have \nthe mechanics of reading, but there is something else. A child must \nhave material to read which provides accurate information and that is \nnot full of stereotypes and misinformation. If you don't provide access \nthrough school libraries, students will not acquire the skills and love \nfor reading necessary to boost scores on reading tests.\n  That is what my legislation will do. It will give the school \nlibraries the opportunity to become up to date, to entreat children \nwith the idea of reading so that in their lifelong pursuits they will \nknow that libraries are the place to go to find knowledge and \ninformation that is accurate.\n  Let me also talk about the situation from the perspective of low-\nincome students because typically this is where you find the most \nchronic absence of a good school library for the reasons I talked to \npreviously--budget pressures that are so compelling and constraining on \nmunicipalities, and the idea that next year we will fix the library. \nNext year never comes. Jonathan Kozol, who has been referred to many \ntimes on this floor, and who is a passionate advocate for students \neverywhere but who has a particular passion for those disadvantaged \nstudents that he works with on a daily basis, wrote in May in a school \nlibrary article, entitled ``An Unequal Education,'' that a fiscal \ncrisis in the 1970s reduced school libraries and the poorest \nneighborhoods in New York City to: ``little more than poorly stocked \ncollections of torn, tired-looking, or outdated books. As student \npopulations grew and school construction was postponed by scarcity of \nfunds, libraries themselves were soon co-opted to be used as classroom \nspace. Librarians were fired or, more diplomatically, `retired'--and, \nas they retired, were not replaced. Books were frequently consigned to \nspaces scarcely larger than coat closets.''\n  He continues:\n\n       Few forms of theft are quite so damaging to inner-city \n     children as the theft of stimulation, cognitive excitement, \n     and aesthetic provocation by municipal denial of those \n     literacy treasures known to white and middle-class Americans \n     for generations.\n\n  The reason for this sad state of affairs is the loss of targeted \nnational funding for libraries, which we had provided in the 1965 ESEA \nauthorization.\n  I would challenge all of my colleagues to go to their States and go \nto a school library. It won't take too long until you find a book that \nhas a copyright of 1967, and maybe with a stamp, as they do in the \nPhiladelphia school system, that says, ``ESEA 1965.''\n  About 20 years ago, however, a decision was made to roll this \ndedicated funding into a block grant competing with other programs, and \nthe funding for libraries declined. Schools have not been able to \nreplace outdated books. At the same time funds have diminished, as \neverything else, the price of quality school library books goes up.\n  The average school library book costs $16. But the average spending \nper student for books in elementary schools throughout this country is \napproximately $6.75, $7.30 in middle schools, and $6.25 in high \nschools. You can't buy lots of high-quality books at those types of \nprices.\n  Earlier in this session, I introduced bipartisan legislation \naddressing the need for adequate library books, which is the \npredecessor of this amendment. On February 20, 2001, there was note of \nthat introduction in the Washington Times. Then there was a response on \nFebruary 23 from a school librarian who described the real frustrations \nwe are talking about, and that I have tried to suggest.\n  She has worked for 27 years, and she saw the article and took it upon \nherself to write the newspaper. Here is what she said:\n\n       The money coming down for spending has been diverted by \n     administrators for technology. The computers are bought with \n     book money and the administrators can brag about how wired \n     the schools are. The librarians are ordered to keep the old \n     books on the shelves and count everything, including unbound \n     periodicals and old filmstrips dating back to 1940s.\n       And most of all keep their mouth shut about the books--just \n     count and keep quiet. Now do you wonder why librarians keep \n     quiet?\n\n  Well they are not keeping quiet anymore. They have taken a very \nstrong position with respect to this amendment. Coincidentally, they \nhave come to Washington, and I believe they have visited most of my \ncolleagues' offices, to talk about the need, not some esoteric \nhypothetical pie-in-the-sky need, but the real need for investments in \nschool libraries.\n  What happens is that we have a situation where schools face this \nHobson's choice: with declining resources, and other demands, do we \nremove all of the outdated books, leaving only bare shelves or keep \noutdated books on the shelves, hoping that students wont be confused or \nturned off by reading? The result is too many of our students don't \nhave the tools they need to learn to read and achieve.\n  Too often schools sacrifice improvement in libraries. We can help \nchange that dynamic. We can pass this legislation. We can give them \nflexibility at the local level, although targeted to low-income \nschools, to go out and buy library materials, to fulfill an important \npart of our national purpose today to improve the literacy of all \nAmerican children.\n  Now I believe that we should, and we must, complement the President's \nReading First Initiative. He has, quite rightly, identified the \nproblem. He has very astutely suggested we need to train teachers in \nthe latest scientific methods, that we need to have classroom material, \nthat we need to do many other things. But one aspect is still lacking; \nand that is books - books to practice the skills they learn in class \nand books to foster a love for reading which is the key to success in \nschool and beyond. This amendment addresses that need.\n\n  My amendment specifically would add $500 million in funding reserved \nto support school libraries. It would not take away any resources that \nhave been already identified for the President's Reading First \nInitiative pursuant to Senator Collins' amendment. It targets funding \nto schools with the highest levels of poverty.\n  Recall now the comments of Jonathan Kozol: the diminishment of the \neducational experience by a lack of access to materials which in \nsuburban schools are taken for granted.\n  If we can get this spirit of inquiry, this excitement about reading, \nif we can infuse that into every child in every public school, \nparticularly in our disadvantaged schools, we will accomplish a great \ndeal with this reauthorization.\n  This amendment also provides the districts and the schools with the \nflexibility to use the funding to meet local school library needs. Who \nbetter than a local school system and local librarians to decide what \nthey need? A new atlas, new materials for the younger readers, a better \nlibrary media that can be used by all the students--all of that will be \ndecided by local individuals.\n  It also includes language that would help enhance the training of \nlibrary specialists. There is a misconception sometimes that all you \nneed to do is\n\n[[Page S4544]]\n\nhave the teacher just take the children into the library and say: Pick \na book. That overlooks the huge contribution a well-trained librarian \ncan make to the education of young children. A well trained librarian \nis essential to helping students read. It is also important to have \nlibrarians with particular skills to be able to show children different \nmeans of research, different techniques, to be able to answer their \nquestions, to find material for them, and to show them how to find \nmaterial. That is not done simply by walking the children into the \nlibrary, and saying: Pick a book. You need to try to get a sense of \ntheir interests and you need to try to lead them from one interest to \nanother interest.\n  This might be the most fundamental aspect of education, and yet if \nyou do not have the trained professionals to do it, you will not get \nthe kind of high-level achievement we seek in this legislation.\n  The amendment would also allow establishing resource sharing \ninitiatives. In my home State of Rhode Island, and in Ohio, the school \nlibrarians have set up a wonderful network with other school libraries, \nwith public libraries, with academic libraries, so they can multiply \nthe resources at their disposal. That would provide the kind of support \nthat I believe is not only necessary but long overdue with respect to \nschool libraries.\n  This amendment allocates funding on a formula basis to school \ndistricts, so that all needy districts and schools get the assistance \nthey need to improve school libraries, rather than authorizing a very \nlimited, competitive grant program which would only help certain \ndistricts that have a knack for grant writing.\n  This amendment is built upon the initial legislation I introduced \nalong with Senators Cochran, Kennedy, Snowe, Chafee, Daschle, and \nothers. The amendment, as I indicated, has broad support.\n\n  This bipartisan amendment I offer today, along with Senators Snowe, \nKennedy, Chafee, Bingaman, Wellstone, Murray, Clinton, Sarbanes, \nJohnson, Baucus, Levin, Reid, Rockefeller, Durbin, and Dayton, is a \nmodified version of that legislation because, rather than being a \nseparate, stand-alone portion of the ESEA, this amendment includes \nsupport for books as part of the Reading First initiative.\n  In conclusion, since I have talked about what the amendment does, I \nwould like to briefly talk about some of things the amendment does not \ndo.\n  First of all, this is not a new program. This amendment would \nincorporate school library funding into the Reading First Initiative, \nthe President's reading initiative. Unanimously, last week, we embraced \nSenator Collins' amendment, so I assume, without contradiction, we are \nall for Reading First, we are all for literacy. This would be \nincorporated into that. This is not a new program.\n  The second point I make is that this is not, as I said before, a \nnovel Federal intervention into school policy. In 1965, we authorized \nfunds to buy library materials. It worked. Those materials are still on \nthe shelves. It is something that has been long associated with our \nFederal effort to help local schools.\n  Now we all want to consolidate programs. I think that makes a great \ndeal of sense. As you look across the board, some programs could be \nmore efficient. But here is an effort to present, within the context of \nthe Reading First Initiative, a comprehensive reading program: training \nteachers to teach reading based on scientific principles, classroom \nmaterials, and then, if you will, the laboratory for reading, which is \nthe school library and the books to read.\n  If we are serious--and I know we are--that we want to see every child \nsucceed, if we want to see every child meet challenging standards, and \nin a very real sense pass the test, then we have to invest more in our \nschool libraries. It is not simply enough to just prescribe the test \nand hope for the best. We have to give children books to read, the \ntools to master these techniques and, hopefully, I think in a broader \nsense, to acquire a passion for reading that will carry them far beyond \ntheir schooldays into their adult days. That truly, in my view, is the \nsign of an educated person.\n  Let me conclude my initial remarks by citing the Department of \nEducation's guide for parents entitled ``A Guide For Parents: How Do I \nKnow a Good Early Reading Program When I See One?'' In that guide they \nsay that a good early reading program has: ``a school library [which] \nis used often and has many books.''\n  We must take this opportunity to dispense with inaccurate, out-of-\ndate books that line the shelves of our school libraries. We have an \nopportunity to complement the President's proposal and provide the \nfunding that is critical to making the program work so it can actually \nimprove the reading and literacy skills of our nation's students. I \nhope we will seize this opportunity and urge my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to voice my objection to \nanother blow committed by this majority against the Senate. I wish to \nexpress my dismay with the majority leader's decision, of which I first \nlearned in Monday's Roll Call, summarily to fire the Senate \nParliamentarian because of his advice on a number of budget-related \nissues.\n  This action appears to be yet another unfortunate turn in the \nmajority's heavy-handed efforts to transform the Senate into another \nHouse of Representatives. And I fear that the real victim of this \nlatest purge will be the rules and traditions of this great body. Bob \nDove has borne the brunt of the majority's latest outburst, but I fear \nthat the Senate, too, will suffer.\n  Let me begin by noting that I, as others, have had my share of \ndisagreements with Bob Dove during his time as Parliamentarian. I \nsuspect that most Senators who have devoted any time to learning the \nSenate's rules will find points on which they differ with the \nParliamentarian. But in the practice of law that is Senate procedure, \nthe Parliamentarian plays the role of the judge. It is before the \nParliamentarian that staff and even Senators make their arguments and \nstate their cases, much as advocates before a court.\n  It is in the nature of judging that a judge cannot please all \nlitigants, and it is in the nature of having a Parliamentarian that the \nParliamentarian's advice to the Presiding Officer cannot always please \nall Senators.\n  Were it not so, we would not have a Parliamentarian. If the \nParliamentarian cannot advise the Chair what the Parliamentarian truly \nbelieves that the law and precedents of the Senate require, then the \noffice of the Parliamentarian ceases to exist.\n  If the Parliamentarian merely says what the majority leader wishes, \nthen the majority leader has taken over the job. And in that case, the \nSenate has become less a body governed by rules and precedent and more \na body that proceeds according to rule and precedent only when it \npleases, in effect at the whim of the majority leader.\n  That the Senate rules constrain the majority has been one of its \nstrengths. It is oft-recounted lore that when Jefferson returned from \nFrance, he asked Washington why he had agreed that the Congress should \nhave two chambers. ``Why,'' replied Washington to Jefferson, ``did you \npour that coffee into your saucer?'' ``To cool it,'' said Jefferson. \n``Even so,'' said Washington, ``we pour legislation into the senatorial \nsaucer to cool it.''\n  It is the Senate's rules that allow legislation to cool. It is the \nSenate's adherence to its precedents and not to a rule adopted for this \nday and this day only that distinguishes the Senate from the House of \nRepresentatives. The Parliamentarian is a vital link in that chain of \nprecedents. It is the Parliamentarian's advice to the Chair that makes \nthis a body governed by rules.\n  The Senate has had an officer with the title of Parliamentarian since \nJuly\n\n[[Page S4545]]\n\n1, 1935, when the Senate changed the title of the journal clerk, \nCharles Watkins, to Parliamentarian and journal clerk. Since then, only \nfour other men have occupied the office: Floyd Riddick, Murray Zweben, \nBob Dove, and Alan Frumin. These five Parliamentarians held that office \nfor an average of more than 12 years each. By comparison, during the \nsame time, the Senate has had 14 different majority leaders.\n  As Justices sit on the Supreme Court, though Presidents will come and \ngo, so Parliamentarians have maintained the rule of precedent, through \nchanges in political majority. Removing a Parliamentarian because a \nmajority leader disagrees with a decision is akin to a President's \nattack on the Supreme Court. History has roundly decried President \nFranklin Roosevelt for seeking to pack the Court. I predict that \nhistory will also roundly decry the majority leader's man-handling of \nthe Senate's rules.\n  This majority has torn down another ancient landmark that our \npredecessors had set up. Once again, this majority has removed another \nboundary stone that once marked how far we could go. We are left today \nmore bereft of rules, a body less governed by law, and unfortunately \nmore governed by the wishes and ambitions of men and women.\n  The new Parliamentarian, Alan Frumin, has, as I have said, served as \nParliamentarian before. I hope this time he can serve for a good long \ntime.\n  I have always known Alan to be a man who calls them as he sees them. \nI hope that the majority leader will allow Alan to continue to do so. \nFor only by allowing the Parliamentarian to follow his or her best \njudgment will the office of the Parliamentarian continue to be able to \nplay its important role in preserving the Senate rules, and, thus, in \npreserving the Senate itself.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/09/senate-section/article/S4545-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4545-S4559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2002--CONFERENCE \n                                 REPORT\n\n  Mr. LOTT. Madam President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 83) and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Committee of Conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the concurrent \n     resolution (H. Con. Res. 83), establishing the congressional \n     budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2002, \n     revising the congressional budget for the United States \n     Government for fiscal year 2001, and setting forth \n     appropriate budgetary levels for each of fiscal years 2003 \n     through 2011, having met, have agreed that the House recede \n     from its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, and \n     agree to the same with an amendment, and the Senate agree to \n     the same, signed by a majority of the conferees on the part \n     of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The report was printed in the House proceedings of the Record of May \n8, 2001.)\n  Mr. LOTT. There are 10 hours for debate provided under statute. I \nexpect all debate to be used or yielded back by the close of business \ntoday with the exception of an hour or so. We will then obtain a \nconsent for closing remarks tomorrow morning to be followed by a vote \non the conference report. I will not propound that request now but will \nconsult with the Democratic leader and will propound the unanimous \nconsent at a later time. I do think it best to get started.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee has arrived. We \nwill begin debate and go as long as Senators desire today and reserve \nabout an hour tomorrow so there will be time equally divided to wrap up \nand then get a recorded vote.\n  Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for the job he has done again this year. A lot of people are \nappointed different jobs in the Senate in terms of leadership or \noffices of the Senate and have difficulties in doing our jobs. But few \nhave a job any tougher than being chairman of the Budget Committee \nbecause it lays out the plan for the year. It does have to take a look \nat the whole budget.\n  The Presiding Officer, the Senator from New York, is on the Budget \nCommittee. I know she found the process interesting, including the \nhearings. It is the committee that has to decide what is set aside for \nMedicare, for instance; if we have reform and need additional funds, \nhow much will be available for tax relief and how much will be \navailable for the nondefense and, in fact, defense discretionary \naccounts.\n  It is very hard to accommodate all the different parties. We have to \nwork it through the Budget Committee, Democrats and Republicans, and on \nthe floor of the Senate, with many amendments, and quite often vote-\naramas at the end of the process where we vote, many times, on 20, 30, \n40 amendments, in sequence. It is not a pretty process, but it is one \nthat has to be done.\n  The chairman of the committee and the ranking member of the committee \ngo to conference and see if they can find ways to work together and \ndeal with the House, too.\n  So it is a long process. Senator Domenici has been involved in that \nprocess, either as ranking member or chairman, I believe, almost since \nwe began. I remember I voted for the original Budget and Impoundment \nAct way back in 1973 or 1974. This time was probably even more \ndifficult than usual, trying to thread the eye of the needle, trying to \nget something that can pass.\n  I believe they have done a good job. It surprises me when I hear some \nof the condemnation that I just heard from the Senator from Wisconsin \nand in press conferences. I think this is a good budget resolution.\n  Some people seem to think that people who work and make money should \nnot be able to keep a little bit more of their money. Anybody who wants \nto defend this Tax Code can go right at it, but I don't believe it is \ngoing to work with the American people because the people I talk to, \nblue-collar working neighbors in my hometown--shipyard workers, paper \nmill workers, refinery workers, small business men and women--don't \nthink it is fair; they think they are overtaxed by the Federal \nGovernment, and by the State and local government, for that matter. \nThey think they pay too much for gasoline taxes, which contributes to \nthe price with which they are having to deal.\n  They think the Tax Code is too long, too complicated, and unfair. \nWhen I say: Does anybody in this room want to defend the marriage \npenalty tax, any Democrat, any Republican, anybody, old or young, \nmarried or single? I see not one hand.\n  Yet we have been yapping around here for 10 years about how we are \ngoing to get rid of the marriage penalty tax. It has gotten so serious, \nmy daughter who got married 2 years ago, has threatened to run against \nme if I don't finally do something about this. This is an unfair, \nridiculous tax.\n  Does it cost some money? Yes. Whose money is it, for Heaven's sake? \nIt is my daughter's and her husband's, a young couple trying to make \nends meet. Nobody wants to defend that.\n  The very concept of the Federal Government coming in when you die and \nreaching into the grave to take the benefit of the fruits of your labor \nin your lifetime is so alien to what America should be about, I just \ncannot believe people will say estate taxes are a good idea.\n  Oh, it will not affect me. I have asked for and been given a life in \nthis institution in the Congress. I came here young and don't have any \nmoney and don't really ever expect to have very much. But the idea that \nmy son, who has chosen a different route, would have the Federal \nGovernment show up and say: Give me 40 percent or 50 percent of your \nlife's earnings--I am not going to give him an estate; he is not going \nto inherit it; whatever he has, he is going to earn it--I think that is \nwrong, fundamentally unfair and basically wrong. Rates are too high; \ntaxes are too high.\n  Oh, there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth--the very idea that \nyou would lower the top rate from 39.6 to 33 percent. You go out and \nask the average man or woman on the street, do they think one-third of \nwhat they earn is enough to pay for Federal taxes--anybody--anybody \nshould pay more than a third, 33 percent?\n  Then you have to add on to that State taxes, local taxes, sales \ntaxes. On everything you do from the moment\n\n[[Page S4546]]\n\nyou get up and flip on a switch and you drink that cup of coffee until \nyou get your paycheck, you are paying taxes.\n  I realize in this city, unbelievably, it is hard to cut taxes. But I \ndon't think this is too much. In fact, I don't think it is enough. \nAllow people to keep a little bit more of their money through a child \ntax credit? We should not do that? We have been trying now to get some \nother things, such as the education savings account, in place to allow \npeople to save a little bit more of their money.\n\n  People say we need more money from the Federal Government so we can \nhelp people with the things they need, such as child care. I have a \nunique idea. How about letting them keep some of their own money and \npay for their own childcare as they see fit. That will be one way to do \nit. I am not saying we don't need additional support, but that is one \nway to do it.\n  I think what is provided in this budget resolution is not an unfair \namount. We went through a process. It is not as high as I would like \nfor it to be, but it is a pretty substantial amount. I assume it has \nbipartisan support.\n  In terms of spending, why, listening to some of the stuff I heard on \nTV last night, you would think we were going in there and slashing \nFederal programs all over the place. I thought it said a 4-percent \nincrease--4-percent or more increase over what we are going to spend in \nthis fiscal year. Is there anybody in this room who thinks it is only \ngoing to be 4 percent? No; this opens the bidding, unfortunately. I \nhope the President will veto these appropriations bills if they start \nproviding increases of 6 percent, 7 percent, 12 percent. There is no \nlimit.\n  We have been saying it right here in the Senate. Does anybody want to \noffer an amendment to have more spending? Just offer it. It will pass. \nIt doesn't matter what it is. I don't know what we think. I guess we \nthink somebody somewhere some other day will pay for all this or we \nwill worry about that later.\n  This is a balanced, fiscally responsible budget resolution. It \nprovides for additional action on Medicare. It provides for increases \nin a lot of areas. The President's budget does provide for some \nreductions in certain areas, but can we not have priorities in the \nGovernment? Can't we spend a little more here and a little less there? \nIsn't a 4-percent increase over an inflated expenditure from last year \nand the previous year an adequate amount? I think it is.\n  I don't know, maybe we are just not reading the same budget \nresolution. I think this is a responsible resolution. I urge Senators \nto vote for it. Again, it is not the end of the process. This is the \nkickoff. We have been wrestling around with this thing now for 3 \nmonths, and this is just the kickoff. We haven't even gotten into the \nfirst quarter. We need to get it done.\n  Think of the alternative if we didn't pass this budget resolution. \nWhat happens? We are stalled out right here and cannot go forward with \nthe annual appropriations bills, with the tax relief package. There \nwould be uncertainty about what would be available, I guess, in certain \nentitlement programs.\n  I hope we can calm the rhetoric. Sure, there will be substantive \ndisagreements. There will be people who advocate spending more or less \nat various places. That can be done. We have budget resolutions. We \nhave authorization bills. We are going to be continuing to vote on \neducation. We are going to have more spending for education. Everybody \nknows that; that is part of the package. I am for that. I think further \ninvestment in education is a good investment. I am prepared to support \nit.\n  There are going to be emergencies. Unfortunately, there will be \ndisasters somewhere in this country, probably in my own State. We have \nfloods, tornadoes, droughts--everything but locust so far. We will help \npeople with their disasters.\n\n  We are going to have emergency requests for defense. We have costs \nthat were unexpected in health care and additional steaming and flying \ntime. But we will work through that process.\n  I hope we will overwhelmingly pass this resolution tomorrow and go \nforward with the bills that will follow in due course.\n  Again, I say to you, Senator Domenici, thank you. I know it is never \neasy. For some reason I am not quite sure, you have been willing to \ncontinue to do it year after year. I will be looking forward to hearing \nwhat you have to say about the final product. I know Senator Conrad \nwill have some remarks, too, and then we will go to a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I know Senator Conrad will come to the \nfloor in the not too distant future. But until he arrives, I want to \ntake a moment to comment on the budget resolution and respond, in part, \nto some of the comments made by the distinguished majority leader.\n  I don't know that there has been a budget resolution during my years \nin the Senate, or at least as Democratic Leader, that has generated \ngreater anger and frustration among our colleagues than this one.\n  There are three concerns we have with this budget resolution. I want \nto address each of them briefly and accommodate other Senators, if they \nwish to speak.\n  The first is process.\n  This process was an abomination. I have great respect for the \ndistinguished chairman of the Budget Committee. I admire him for a lot \nof reasons. I know that he isn't the one who calls all the shots in all \ncases. But I think this process is inexplicable. As we profess the \ndesire and a need for bipartisanship, I don't know why we have a \nprocess that is so highly partisan on an issue that is so important.\n  I think it is fair to say--and I don't know that any Republicans \nwould ever dispute it--that the Democrats were virtually locked out \nfrom the beginning on this issue. No Democrats participated. There \nwasn't a markup in the Budget Committee, therefore you didn't see \nDemocratic participation in formulating this budget or Democratic \nopportunities to offer amendments. There was none. You didn't see any \nparticipation among Democrats in the conference committee--none, zero.\n  I am sure that when those who created this budget process nearly 30 \nyears ago and enacted it into law, as well intended as they were, they \ndid not envision decisions as paramount as these being made in some \nclosed room, locking out one party, denying the opportunity for \nDemocrats to be involved. I don't think that they even imagined that \nsomething like this could happen.\n  Unfortunately, that is precisely what has happened. I believe it is \nfair to say that there isn't a Member of this body who has seen this \nbudget in its entirety other than the chairman. I can guarantee you \nthere are no Democrats who have seen it. Yet, with less than 24 hours \nto review it, we are being asked to vote on a budget blueprint that \nwill dictate our fiscal policy for the next 10 years. We have been \ngiven nearly a $2 trillion budget without a fair opportunity to \nevaluate it, without an opportunity to participate, and now we are \nbeing asked to vote up or down.\n  This is an abomination. This is inexcusable, especially in a 50/50 \nSenate.\n  But here we are. I am angered and frustrated that we even have to \nbegin this debate with this reality. It is an outrage.\n  The second concern I have is this budget is a fabrication. This isn't \na budget. This is a make-believe document with more holes, more gaps, \nmore missing pages, and more questions than there are answers. Don't \nlike the baseline? Create a new one. Don't like the numbers? Come up \nwith other ones you like better. Don't know what the President wants to \ndo on the defense budget? Give him an opportunity to put that number in \nlater.\n  This isn't a budget. This isn't even close to a budget. In fact, \nbecause this is such a fabrication, we have virtually destroyed the \nbudget process as it was originally designed by excluding Democrats and \nby making up things as we have gone along.\n  Let me rephrase that. Democrats haven't made it up because we weren't \ninvolved. Republicans made it up.\n\n[[Page S4547]]\n\n  This is a fabrication. This is make-believe budgeting. This is a \nbudget process gone awry.\n  This is absolutely one of the worst documents we will be called upon \nto vote on in this Congress. We ought to be ashamed that we are \nbringing this budget to the floor--ashamed.\n\n  The third problem is, of course, policy. I have to say, I don't know \nanybody who can say without equivocation the policy implications \ncontained within this budget fabrication. If it is possible to come to \nany conclusions based on what little we already know, here are the \nconclusions one has to reach.\n  First of all, don't let anybody fool you. If this budget does go into \neffect, the tax cut is so large that we could ultimately tap right into \nthe Medicare and Social Security trust funds.\n  There is no question about that. The Medicare trust fund is no longer \ninviolate. All of these votes and all of these speeches about \nprotecting Medicare and having this lockbox are malarkey. This budget \nthreatens the Social Security trust funds. Malarkey.\n  When this resolution passes, we will dramatically hasten the date \nwhen the Social Security trust fund becomes insolvent. I guarantee you \nthat we are going to hear actuaries talk about how short the viability \nfor the trust fund will be as a result of this resolution passing. Why? \nWe just heard the majority leader, and he was right about this. Who can \nvote against a tax cut? Who can vote against all of these wonderful-\nsounding opportunities to reduce taxes? If you are a politician of any \nability, you ought to be able to support a tax cut. However, this \nPresident couldn't even get his $1.6 billion.\n  I have to say no one should believe that the final cost of the tax \ncut is $1.4 trillion because that is what Republicans say it is.\n  I want to see what they do when the alternative minimum tax is \nproposed. That is $300 billion. I want to see what happens when the \nextenders are proposed. That is $100 billion. I want to see what people \nsay when they are forced to acknowledge that the cost of the tax cut \nmust include about $400 billion in interest. Where does that go? That \nis $800 billion on top of the $1.4 trillion. That is $2.2 trillion, and \nwe haven't gotten to capital gains reductions, business tax breaks, \npension reform, and all the other tax ideas that someone is going to \nconjure up.\n  This budget is going critically wound the fiscal well-being of this \ncountry, in a manner in which we haven't seen in our lifetime.\n  This is outrageous. We gut education at the very time we are talking \nabout education policy in this country. It is gutted. Don't let anybody \nmislead you. You are going to hear nice-sounding phrases about sense of \nthe Senate language and ideas about how we are going to be able to \nmanipulate the numbers to put additional education money in the budget.\n  If you believe that, there is a tooth fairy and a bridge I want to \ntalk to you about.\n  This isn't budgeting with priorities the American people care about. \nThere isn't any new money in here for education. There isn't a real \nplan in this budget to provide a prescription drug benefit--regardless \nof how many people campaigned in the last election on the importance of \nthis issue. This is a tax cut made into a budget, and it is a budget \nlacking in virtually everything we said is important. Is Social \nSecurity important? Not in this budget. Is Medicare important? Not in \nthis budget. Is education important? Not in this budget. Are \nprescription drug benefits important? Not in this budget.\n  I daresay everything we stand for on this side of the aisle is lost \nin this budget. I can't think of a reason why somebody who holds the \ncore values that many of us hold would ever even think about voting for \na fabrication as disastrous for this country as this budget will be.\n  If I sound exercised, I am. If I sound as deeply troubled as I hope \nmy rhetoric would convey, I am.\n  This is not good for the country. It is not good because there has \nbeen a complete breakdown of whatever modicum of bipartisanship that I \nhoped a 50/50 Senate would deliver. There isn't any bipartisanship \nreflected in this budget.\n  I think the die is cast. But I hope somehow over the course of this \nyear we can truly find ways to reverse some of the incredibly \ndisastrous decisions that have been made in this budget.\n\n  Senator Conrad has done an outstanding job in leading the Democratic \ncaucus and providing us with his guidance and his insight. I publicly \nwant to acknowledge my gratitude to him. No one cares more deeply. No \none has studied this issue more thoroughly. As a consequence, no one \nhas the respect of our caucus more than the Senator from North Dakota. \nI thank him for that. This has to have been a frustrating experience \nfor him. But there will be another day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, fellow Senators, and anyone listening, \nI am very sorry that the minority leader is frustrated. I wish he were \nnot. I am also very sorry that my facts and what is in this budget, as \nI see it, are very different from his--very different. I have been part \nof this process.\n  I want to talk for a minute about partisanship. I can tell you when \nPresident Clinton won office and had a Democratic Senate, they did the \nbudget. They did the tax bill. We did nothing. We were left out of \neverything. And I do not think our leader came to the floor and called \nthat the kind of names the minority leader has used today.\n  Frankly, I think the Senate, itself, will prove that what he has said \nis wrong because they will vote for this budget resolution. If it were \na fabrication, they would not vote for it. If it were unreal, they \nwould not vote for it.\n  But I want to start by using a different approach. I want to start by \nsaying: If not now, when? If not now, when will the American taxpayer \nget back some of the surplus that their taxes have generated? How big \nmust the surplus be, Madam President, and fellow Senators, before we \ngive the taxpayers some of their money back? How big should it be?\n  It is $5.6 trillion. That means getting that much money more than we \nneed for the policies of our Government. Should it be $10 trillion \nbefore we give them back any money? Should it be $20 trillion before we \ngive them back some? Absolutely not. Madam President, $5.6 trillion \nyields to the American people in their hands for use as taxpayers--\nlet's get the number--$1.25 trillion. Remember, there is a $5.6 \ntrillion surplus, and then, secondly, $100 billion that must be \nspent this year and next year as an economic stimulus. And the \nDemocrats wanted that. Of course, they did not want the other one. They \ndid not want the long-term one.\n\n  So every single thing has been invented by way of the fault of this \nbudget, to put it in the way of one thing, and one thing only: taxes \ngiven back to the American people. In fact, the minority leader, again, \nto borrow his own words, is frustrated. I tell you, tomorrow I think \nthe Senate will indicate that it is frustrated, that it is frustrated \nin not giving back the taxpayers some of their money, and they are \ngoing to vote to do that.\n  Frankly, I wish we were here without controversy and that those who \nlead on that side and those who lead on this side, including this \nSenator, could say: This has been done together; we have had total \nbipartisan support. But let me tell you, we have already gone from the \n$1.6 trillion that the President asked for in the tax cut, and with \nsome Democratic help we are down to $1.25 trillion, plus $100 billion \nfor stimulus.\n  How far down would we have to go under the idea we would have \nbipartisan support, and write this together in the Budget Committee, \nand go the conference, Democrat and Republican? Just think of it. It is \nalready, on the one hand, being claimed as a loss for the President \nbecause he did not get enough tax cuts, and, on the other hand, it is \ntoo much; and, therefore, we talk about everything wrong in this budget \nbecause we would not like to see this tax cut pass.\n  The good news is, fellow Americans and taxpayers, regardless of the \nrhetoric of today, within a week to 10 days, the Finance Committee of \nthe Senate will produce a tax cut bill. It will come to the floor. Then \nwe are going to see how many support it and how many support the \nstimulus of $100 billion spread equally this year and next year. I \nsurmise there will be plenty of support for it.\n\n[[Page S4548]]\n\n  But every obstacle is put in its way by those who lead on the other \nside of the aisle. Now they complain: It's too big a tax cut. But the \nPresident did not get what he wanted. And there are all these other \nthings we should be doing, not giving back money to the taxpayers.\n  So I again say: If not now, when? And I answer my own question: Now. \nGive them back some of their money. It is not an extraordinary amount. \nSocial Security is funded. Some would like to say: Before we give the \ntax cuts, we want to fund the next generation of Social Security. I \ndon't know about that. I think we put all the money into Social \nSecurity that they are entitled. No matter what is said on the other \nside of the aisle, it is our position--and I think it is right--we do \nnot touch Social Security and we do not touch Medicare.\n  For those who want to get up on the other side of the aisle and just \nsay we do, I stand up on this side of the aisle and say we don't. You \ncan believe who you would like, but we have committed to not bringing \nyou a budget that offended the Social Security trust fund. We have \ncommitted that we will not do that on the HI, the Medicare program. You \nsay we do, and I say we don't.\n  So let's see how we vote tomorrow. If there were a large group of \nSenators who thought we were violating Social Security and Medicare, \nthis would not be adopted tomorrow. So they can keep on repeating it, \nbut let's see how the Senators vote tomorrow.\n  One thing happened during this process that is very extraordinary and \ngood. The other side of the aisle has developed a budget ranking member \nwho works hard, knows a lot, and makes his case. It is not that I agree \nwith him all the time, but he makes his case. I commend him for that. \nAnd he does it well. It is just that on this one I do not believe he is \ngoing to tell all of you and tell the American people what this budget \nmeans.\n\n  I would like very much to quickly tick off on the charts right there \nbehind me--and we will do it early on so the other side can go on and \nproduce a chart that says it isn't so, but I do not like to say things \nin this Chamber that I do not believe are true and honest and \nforthright.\n  First, it reduces the debt to $818 billion, down from $2.4 trillion. \nFor those who complain that it isn't enough, just look at the numbers. \nWe have Treasury bills that we owe to people that are accruing \ninterest, that we have to pay every year; and it is $2.4 trillion. It \nis almost as large as the surplus--well, half as large. We are going to \nreduce it to $818 billion, which is the largest decrease we have ever \nhad in history and I believe very close to the maximum amount we can \ndo. We can talk about what it does in terms of the budget percentages, \nand the like, but those are the numbers.\n  It protects Social Security and the HI trust fund. In fact, on Social \nSecurity, none of the tax cuts here are predicated on any numbers that \ninclude Social Security trust fund money. That is taken out first. I \ndon't know what else we ought to do to live up to our lockbox \ncommitment, unless it is to start a new funding to take care of Social \nSecurity in another way that we have not yet passed and don't know \nanything about.\n  It maintains a balanced budget every year: $219 billion in fiscal \nyear 2002, $48 billion not counting the Social Security trust fund \nsurplus.\n  When you added it all up, people thought we were using the entire \ncontingency fund, but we did not. There is a $\\1/2\\ trillion--$500 \nbillion--unspent over the 10 years. For those who want to do something \nabout the ID or special ed program, by making it mandatory, have at it. \nLet's get it passed. It can come out of that $500 billion. We just \ncould not pass a new mandatory program in a conference with the House \nfor that piece of education.\n  On taxes, let me repeat, you can state it two ways, but, in essence, \nover the next 11 years, the American people will either get back in \ntheir pockets or have changed the law such that $1.25 trillion is back \nin their pockets. In addition, for the rest of this year, plus next \nyear, we will rebate, refund, cut, another $100 billion for the \nAmerican people.\n  So you might say this is a $1.35 trillion reduction in taxes for the \nAmerican people, and that would be a correct statement. Some would like \nto put it in two pieces: having the $100 billion for stimulus first, \nand take that out first. That is all right with me. The sum total is \nwhat I have said.\n  I repeat: If we are not going to give them back some of this money \nnow, when will we? Will we wait 3 or 4 more years and find ways to \nspend the surplus? If you want to wait, I am not sure who will spend \nit, but somebody will spend it. You had better get on the record giving \nsome back to the people.\n  On spending, there are a lot of ways to look at this budget, but I \nsuggest that the spending in this budget, as we add it up, is $1.92 \ntrillion for the year 2002--excuse me, $1.952 trillion for everything. \nThis authorizes, for the appropriations process, $631 billion in 2002. \nIn that number there is both defense and nondefense, and Social \nSecurity and everything, but the 631 is just appropriated accounts. \nThere are many assumptions made--many--but the appropriators will \ndecide what they are going to fund out of that total amount and how. If \nthey do what we assume, they will put an awful lot of it in education. \nThey may not do that, but you can't do more in a budget than to say \nthat we assume it and ask the others to pay for it.\n  In addition to the President's increase, which was about 4 percent \nfor the year, we have authorized an additional $6.2 billion for \nnondefense programs. That is without emergencies, which are handled as \nthey were in the past; when they come, they are added to the budget. We \ndidn't change that. The House wanted to change it. That was one of the \nthings over which we fought in an argument with reference to using our \nbudget process.\n  Let me talk about Medicare for a minute. I can't understand when \nthere is a reserve fund in this budget that says, if you do a new \nMedicare bill with prescription drugs in it, $300 billion is given to \nyou to spend: How much did you want: 500? 600? 800? The House had 146. \nWe won that debate. We got 300, just as the Senate had voted. I don't \nknow what else we can do. We have stated unequivocally, you cannot use \nany of these programs or moneys to affect either Social Security and/or \nMedicare.\n  Let's talk about defense for a minute. How could we have budgeted \ndefense when the President gave us a number and said, we are having a \ntop-to-bottom review and it won't be ready until a few months down the \nline? Are we supposed to say, let's leave it all out of the budget and \nstart over in 3 months? The best thing I could see to do was the \nfollowing: Fund defense as he requested it, which is not a very big \nincrease, and put in this budget that when the top-to-bottom review is \ncompleted, whatever their number is, they get to submit it, and it \nbelongs to defense and nothing else.\n  But guess what. It is not a free ticket. It has to be appropriated by \nthe Congress. If we don't like it or don't want some of it, we don't \nhave to do it. I didn't know any other way to do it. It is not intended \nas a blank check. It is intended as what I have described.\n  There are some saying, what else did we do in this budget, besides \nthe $300 billion we set aside for Medicare, if they reform it and if \nthey do prescription drugs? Frankly, I am very pleased to say the House \ngave on that to us; it went our way.\n  In addition, we had a program in here to make sure that the farmers \nthis year, 2002, and for the decade--we had unanimous support that we \nought to increase the authorization and allocation and use some of the \ncontingency fund for that. Guess what. The House had nothing for that \nin their budget, and before we finished, they said, we think we should \ndo a little more than the Senate--I assume because that is what they \nwant to show their House Members. So we did agriculture at an $80 \nbillion increase, to make sure it gets money. Frankly, I don't know how \nmuch more you can do. I believe if we are not right, it has so much \nsupport that next year or the next year we can do more. We could take \nit out of the contingency fund and fund agriculture even more.\n\n  Here on the Senate floor, Senator Kennedy was going to propose a very \nlarge amount which had to do with uninsureds--health uninsureds. \nSenator Smith of Oregon, joined by his friend, Senator Wyden, proposed \nan add-on to the health uninsured fund of\n\n[[Page S4549]]\n\n$28 billion to be used over the next 3 years. They can use it if they \nwant in the committee for uninsured benefits and enhancement of the \nprogram. The House had zero. We got a full $28 billion. They gave us \neverything we asked.\n  So Medicare, health insurance for the uninsured, agriculture, and \nthen in the area that many here worry about, home health care. For home \nhealth care we have another reserve fund that comes from Senator \nCollins' work in the Chamber. We put in $14 billion to make sure that \nthat fund continued unabated; that is, that home health care funding, \ninstead of coming down at a point in time which is currently \nprescribed, it says that sunset brings it back up, and it is almost $14 \nbillion.\n  There is another one Senator Grassley and Senator Kennedy have been \nworking on that is called the childcare credit and earned income tax, \n$18.5 billion for its expansion. Then we added to it nearly $8 billion \nto expand Medicaid benefits to children with special needs.\n  We don't hear anything about any of those as this budget is \ndenounced, as it is called a fabrication, as it is called a sham of \nprocess, none of which is true. I have brought budgets here many times. \nThis is a solid budget.\n  I will close by talking about the appropriated accounts because every \nyear we have to do 13 bills. There is a lot of commotion about them and \na lot of trouble getting them done. I just described to you what is \ngoing to happen on defense. I might tell you this budget resolution \ncontemplates a supplemental this year principally for defense, which \neveryone knew would happen. This contemplates it because we have room \nunder the caps for this year. But if you take just the nondefense part \nof this budget that is appropriated, our mathematics and arithmetic say \nthat that is going up 5.5 percent, not 4 as the President asked.\n  There are some--perhaps the other side--who will say it didn't go up \nat all. Let's deal with that on apples and apples, the totality of the \naccounts now this year and the totality of the domestic accounts next \nyear. There is $6.2 billion in new money, and the percentage increase \nis 5.5. If the House knew it was 5.5, I am not sure they would pass the \nresolution. So they used their numbers; I used mine. I know what is \ngoing to appropriations, and it is not 4 percent for which the \nPresident asked. It is not 5 percent. It is more than 5 percent.\n  Can you get along with it? I don't know. Is there enough money for \neducation? Absolutely. If you want to take every assumption in this \nresolution that is attributed to education and then add the 6.2 new \nmoney and assume they are going to give some of that to education, you \nhave funding of education programs that I believe will be voted for in \nappropriations by both sides of the aisle because there is sufficient \nmoney in there for education, including the increase, a substantial \nincrease, in special ed. In fact, I think the amount is $7 billion, \n7.9--almost $8 billion for special ed, the IDEA program.\n  Let me say to everyone, the Senate voted in an amendment that said, \ndo a huge new mandatory entitlement program for IDEA for special ed. It \nis not a mandatory entitlement. It is appropriated every year. Congress \nhas not done well, except in the last 2 or 3 years, in doing its part \nfor the funding for special ed kids, but we are starting up that path. \nFor anybody who is looking in this budget to find a brand new mandatory \nentitlement for IDEA, it isn't here. I guarantee you, there is no way \nyou can get a new entitlement out of the House. It will work its will, \nand we will work our will. But we couldn't do it in the budget \nresolution because they said it is a whole new way to approach it; do \nit separately. There is still money around if you want to do that, \nstill money around over the decade, without violating the balanced \nbudget, Medicare, or Social Security.\n  I guess I could close just like the minority leader did. If you think \nI am kind of worked up, first of all, that is the way I am all the \ntime. However, I am just slightly worked up more than I normally am. \nWhile he is infuriated about certain things, I am infuriated about some \nthings said by a number of people about this budget. I won't say who.\n  I close by saying to everybody, there is no doubt in this Senator's \nmind that the people of this country deserve to have a significant \namount of this surplus given back to them now. There is no doubt in my \nmind that it is fair; it will help the American economy; it won't hurt \nit. I close by saying, if we can do anything to stimulate the economy \nthrough tax changes, this resolution will permit that to happen. It \nwill permit money to be spent from the hands of our people, encouraging \nthem to spend money and keep the economy going, or to pay some of the \nmoney for expenditures for gasoline and related fuel prices.\n  I anxiously await hearing from my friend, who I have just indicated, \nright in the middle of my speech, has done a great job becoming very \nlearned and an expert. He knows I was here a lot longer and, probably \ntoday, he is willing to stand up on the floor and say in all ways I \nknow more than Domenici about the budget because I have really learned \nit. I would not doubt that. I think I have just enough to get it done. \nIt has been a lot of years.\n  The charge of partisanship could be levied more times than not, as \nbudgets have been produced in this place. I didn't go through each one \nto find out how partisan they were, but I can vividly remember the \nbudget resolution ran through here with no Republican support, no votes \nin the Senate, when President Bill Clinton was given what he requested.\n  Whether that was the right thing to do, who knows? Whether this is \nthe right thing to do, some say no on the other side; some say yes. I \nbelieve the American people are watching us. We had a big chart that \nsaid: $5.6 trillion overpayment to Government, $1.25 trillion to the \npeople in taxes, and $100 billion to stimulate the economy by giving \npeople back some money to spend. We will let them judge whether that is \ntoo much.\n  Let me close by saying those are simple numbers. They already take \ninto account a 4-percent growth in Government. That still yields those \nnumbers. How much more should Government grow? I don't know. I surely \nthink there ought to be enough to give people tax cuts. It seems to me \nit is rather basic and simple. Nonetheless, because we are a different \nbody than the House, we have more allocated than 4 percent, for which \nthe President asked. Repeating, for the domestic side, it is more like \n5.5 percent they are going to have to spend. We still have those \nnumbers--$5.6 trillion, and $1.25 trillion of that going back to the \npeople, plus $100 billion to be in their pockets this year and early \nnext year as a stimulus, for them to use as they see fit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the budget resolution \nthat is now before us and the conference report on the budget \nresolution.\n  First, let me say I have profound respect for the chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee. I have worked with him for the 15 years that I \nhave been in the Senate. He is a man of integrity. He is an honest man. \nHe is well motivated. He does what he believes is the right thing for \nthe country, and certainly for New Mexico. I don't question any of that \nin the slightest degree. He also has an outstanding staff that benefits \nthe entire Senate. So I want to stipulate right at the beginning that I \nhave respect for him and affection for the Senator from New Mexico as \nwell.\n  He is Italian. My wife is Italian. Italians have a lot of spirit. We \nsaw some of that spirit from the Senator from New Mexico this \nafternoon. I am Scandinavian, and we Scandinavians don't show a lot of \nemotion, although from time to time it erupts. We also have strong \nfeelings and strong beliefs.\n  I believe this budget is a very poor product for the conference \ncommittee. One of the reasons I believe it is a poor product is because \nthe fact is that Democrats were locked out completely from the process \nof writing this budget. There was one meeting at the conference \ncommittee, the initial meeting, in which we were allowed to give \nopening remarks. After that, we were locked out completely. We weren't \ninvited. In fact, we were told by the chairman we would not be invited \nback. That was true on the House side as well. The Democrats were \nsimply excluded.\n  So make no mistake; this is not a bipartisan budget. This is a budget \nthat\n\n[[Page S4550]]\n\nhas been written by one side and one side alone. They bear full \nresponsibility for what flows from this budget.\n  I agree with much of what the Senator described in this resolution. \nWhat he is not talking about is what is not in this budget. What he is \nnot talking about is what has been left out. What he is not talking \nabout is what is left hidden from view and how profound an effect it \nwill have on every decision we make in this Congress, not only for this \nyear but for 10 years, and for years beyond. These are consequential \ndecisions that are going to have an effect that is going to last a very \nlong time. Let no one make any mistake about it.\n  The Washington Post, on Monday, had as their lead editorial this \nwork, entitled ``An Unreal Budget.'' That is a pretty good description \nof this budget because it, I would say, borders on bizarre. It is not a \nbudget. It is not a budget. Much of what we know is going to be spent \nis not revealed in this document.\n  The conclusion of the Washington Post was:\n\n       The theme of this budget is tax cuts first, sweep up \n     afterward. It's the wrong way around. Budget resolutions are \n     supposed to foster fiscal responsibility. This one will have \n     the opposite effect.\n\n  Unfortunately, in my judgment, that is true. This budget abandons \nfiscal responsibility. The chairman of the committee referred back to \n1993 and suggested, well, it was really done the same way then as it is \nbeing done now. That is not true. In 1993, we had a full markup in the \nSenate Budget Committee. This year there was no markup in the Budget \nCommittee. In 1993, we had full debate, full discussion. What we did in \n1993 was to reduce deficits.\n  Let's go back to 1993. We had a $290 billion budget deficit the year \nbefore. We put in place a package that reduced deficits each and every \nyear for the 5 years of that budget resolution. We then followed it \nwith a bipartisan plan in 1997. That one we did in a bipartisan way. We \nfinished the job of balancing the budget and moving us from deficits to \nsurpluses.\n  This is an unreal budget because there are whole chunks of spending \nthat have been left out, conveniently forgotten, like the two pages \nthat were lost in the House that hung up consideration of this package. \nThe two pages that were lost, interestingly enough, just happened to be \nthe critical two pages. You know what. They did not just lose two \npages; they lost dozens more because this budget does not contain all \nthe spending that is going to be done, and all of us know it. It is not \nin this budget because it is the only way they could make this budget \nadd up.\n\n  If they put in what we all know is going to happen, it does not add \nup, and they take us back to the bad old days of deficits and expanding \ndebt.\n  That is the harsh reality about this budget. First of all, we ought \nto deal with the uncertainty of the projections that surround this \nbudget. All of this is based on a 10-year projection that we will enjoy \na surplus of $5.6 trillion over the next 10 years--$5.6 trillion. That \nis not money in the bank; that is a forecast, that is a projection, and \nthe people who made the forecast themselves have warned us of its \nuncertainty.\n  What did they tell us? They said there is only a 10-percent chance \nthat number is going to come true, $5.6 trillion. There is a 45-percent \nchance there will be more money. There is a 45-percent chance there \nwill be less money. That forecast was done more than 8 weeks ago. With \nwhat has happened in the economy during this interval, between the time \nthe forecast was made and today, do you think it is safe to assume \nthere is going to be less money or more money?\n  Just one statistic. Yesterday, the productivity numbers were released \nfor the first quarter of this year. They were estimating that \nproductivity would be up 1 full percentage point. Instead, it went down \nby one-tenth of 1 point.\n  That difference makes a profound change over time. That would wipe \nout hundreds of billions of dollars of this forecasted surplus over \ntime.\n  The people who made the forecast provided us this chart. It shows in \nthe fifth year alone, we could expect a range of anywhere from a $50 \nbillion deficit to more than a $1 trillion surplus.\n  How did they come up with that forecast? How did they come up with \nthat projection? They looked at their previous forecasts. They looked \nat what they said in the past and they looked at the difference between \nwhat they predicted and what actually occurred. Then they applied it to \nthis forecast. As I say, in the fifth year alone, they said it could be \nanywhere from a $50 billion deficit to more than a $1 trillion deficit. \nThat is how uncertain this forecast is.\n  What does that tell us? I believe it says we ought to be cautious. We \nought to be conservative. We ought to be careful. This budget throws \ncaution to the winds. This budget reminds me very much of what happened \nin 1981: A new President, big tax cut proposal, big defense buildup \nproposal, rosy economic forecast, and what happened. The deficits and \nthe debt of this country multiplied geometrically, and they put this \ncountry in a deep hole which has taken 15 years to dig out. And these \nsame folks with the same view and the same philosophy are getting ready \nto do it all over again.\n  Unfortunately, this time there is not time to recover. In the 1980s, \nwe had two decades to recover. This time the baby boomers start to \nretire in 11 years, and then it all changes. We will go from massive \nsurpluses to substantial deficits because all of a sudden the number of \npeople eligible for Medicare and Social Security increases \ndramatically.\n  That is the first thing we need to keep in mind about this budget: \nthe uncertainty of the forecast that underlines all of the assumptions. \nI do not think there is a family in America who would bet the farm or \nbet their household on the basis of a 10-year forecast. I think most \npeople would say it would be nice if it came true, but we are not going \nto count on it; we are going to be careful in what we do.\n  I put up the Washington Post editorial that called it an unreal \nbudget. Boy, they have it right. It is unreal. Huge chunks of Federal \nspending are not included.\n  Let's start with defense. We all know what is going to happen with \ndefense. Here is a story from USA Today, Friday, April 27: ``Billions \nSought for Arms.'' The Secretary is going to propose a boost in defense \nspending of $200 billion to $300 billion over the next 6 years. That is \njust USA Today. This is in headline after headline all across the \ncountry. The Secretary of Defense is going to ask for very major \nincreases in defense expenditures, $200 billion to $300 billion in \nadditional spending in just the next 6 years.\n  Not a dime of it is in this budget. It is not here. They did not \ninclude it. Why not? Let's go to the Secretary of Defense and see what \nhe said. The Secretary of Defense was interviewed on ``Meet the Press'' \non May 6, this past weekend.\n  The host of the show: Will you get the $10 billion more in defense \nmoney this year that you need?\n  The Secretary of Defense: I don't know. I have not gone to the \nPresident as yet. He wanted to wait until after some of the studies had \nbeen completed and until the tax bill was behind us and we're going to \nbe discussing that over the coming weeks.\n  The host of the show: But you need more money.\n  The Secretary of Defense: We do.\n  And indeed they do, but the money is not in this budget. This is \nsupposed to be a budget document that tells us the revenue and the \nspending of the Federal Government over the next 10 years, but it is \nnot that. This is a document that excludes as much as it reveals.\n  It leaves out this major defense expenditure. Oh, not completely. It \nprovides for a reserve fund so if there is a determination by the \nchairman of the Budget Committee that more money should be added, and \nthe authorization committee believes it, they can put it in with no \nvote in this Chamber, no opportunity to review their decision. They \nmake the decision alone.\n  It does not resemble representative democracy to me. It resembles a \nhandful of people in a back room making a decision that has a profound \nimpact on the budget of the United States without ever being considered \nby the full Senate or the full House of Representatives. That is what \nis in this budget: the authority to do precisely that. That is the \nwrong way to do business.\n  The President has said education is the top priority. Those have been \nthe\n\n[[Page S4551]]\n\nPresident's remarks during the campaign and during his first weeks in \noffice: Education is the top priority. We have speech after speech in \nthe Senate by our colleagues saying education is the top priority, but \nit has not been given priority in this budget because there is no new \nmoney for education in this budget.\n  In the Senate, when the budget resolution was considered, we adopted \na Harkin amendment. It reduced the tax cut by $450 billion. It gave \n$225 billion to education. It gave $225 billion to a further paydown of \nour national debt.\n  We got back from conference committee zero--not a dollar. In the \nSenate, a bipartisan Breaux-Jeffords amendment was adopted by the \nSenate providing $70 billion for IDEA. That is the disabilities act. \nThat is the promise the Federal Government made to local school \ndistricts, that we were going to fund a certain percentage of the cost, \na promise we have not kept.\n  When we moved to keep the promise, we adopted an amendment when the \nbudget resolution was considered by the Senate. We added $70 billion to \nkeep the promise. Every dollar was taken out. There is not a single new \ndollar for education in this budget. They have increased it by \ninflation, but there is no new money for education.\n\n  The same is true of Social Security. The President had a big meeting \nat the White House. He said in that meeting: We have to strengthen \nSocial Security. The baby boomers are going to start to retire, and \nSocial Security will be under enormous pressure.\n  He is right. That is going to happen.\n  Here are contradictory goals of the administration, an editorial from \nthe Columbus Dispatch of December 24, 2000:\n\n       . . . the tax-cut proposal works against this plan to begin \n     privatizing Social Security. Experts differ on how much this \n     ``transition cost'' will be, but it won't be cheap. Thus, \n     Bush's 10-year $1.3 trillion tax cut would deprive the \n     government of the cash it would need to pay the $1 trillion \n     transition cost for the first 10 years of Bush's Social \n     Security privatization plan. The goals are contradictory.\n\n  They couldn't be more right.\n  In the Democratic plan, we provided $750 billion to strengthen Social \nSecurity in the long term. Not one penny of that is in this budget.\n  If we review the situation, we have the administration proposing a \nmajor defense buildup, but none of the money is in this budget. We have \nthe President saying education is the top priority, but there is no new \nmoney in the budget. We have the President saying Social Security \nshould be strengthened, but there is no money in the budget.\n  Excuse those who are somewhat skeptical about this process. The \nDemocrats are locked out. The budget is written in secret in a back \nroom in the dead of night, presented to us late at night. And when we \nlook at the details, if they put in the things they say they are for, \nif they put in money for education, if they put in money for defense, \nif they put in money to strengthen Social Security, the budget doesn't \nadd up. That is their problem. That is the little secret about this \nbudget.\n  If it is a compendium of the expenditures of the Federal Government, \nwhat we are really going to do in terms of additional resources for \neducation, a buildup for national defense, strengthening Social \nSecurity, if you put all those numbers on a page and add them up, you \nwill find we are raiding the Social Security trust fund and the \nMedicare trust fund. That is why they don't have a full budget. That is \nwhy they don't add it all up. That is why they have excluded the money \nto strengthen Social Security, the money to build up national defense, \nthe money to improve education. They know what we know: When you couple \nit with the President's massive tax cut, it doesn't add up.\n  They will be into the Medicare trust fund for $200 billion and more. \nThey will be into the Social Security trust fund by hundreds of \nbillions of dollars. That is the reason we have what the Washington \nPost called ``an unreal budget'' because they don't dare come with all \nof the details. They don't dare come up with all of the numbers. They \ndon't dare come up with what they really intend to do because it \ndoesn't add up.\n  Let's talk a little about the tax cut in this bill. They say this tax \ncut is $1.35 trillion. It is a lot of money. It is a stunning amount of \nmoney--$1.35 trillion. Indeed, the amount reconciled over 10 years is \n$1.25 trillion. The economic stimulus is another $100 billion.\n  There are other elements they do not talk about, including expanded \nhealth insurance coverage, designed in the Senate to be additional \nspending that is now written as a tax cut, another $28 billion. A \nspecial reserve fund has been set up that blocks points of order \nagainst the use of that money. They have refundable tax credits--I call \nthose tax cuts--for health, childcare, for earned-income tax credit, \nanother $37 billion. Those they call ``spending.'' They don't call them \ntax cuts. In common parlance, any person would recognize them as tax \ncuts because that is what they do.\n\n  We have a reduction in SEC matters and other minor matters, another \n$19 billion. The total revenue reduction is $1.434 trillion. That is \none of the reasons they don't have the defense buildup. That is one of \nthe reasons they have taken out the additional money for education. \nThat is a reason they don't have the money to strengthen Social \nSecurity for the long term. The tax cut has become so large, the \npackage doesn't add up if you put in all of the things we know are \ngoing to happen.\n  We have a calculation on how the final conference agreement threatens \nSocial Security and Medicare. This calculation will not be found in the \nbudget. They don't want to put these numbers on a page. They don't want \nto add them up. They don't want to have any one place to look to, to \nput the whole puzzle together. When we put the puzzle together, it does \nnot fit; it does not add up.\n  If we adjust the defense number for what the new Secretary of Defense \nis talking about, if we adjust the tax cost by what is needed to fix \nthe alternative minimum tax, which now affects 2 million taxpayers, if \nwe pass the tax cut plan before us, the Joint Tax Committee says it \nwill affect over 30 million taxpayers. There is no provision to deal \nwith that problem in the President's tax proposal--none. It costs $292 \nbillion just to pay for fixing the alternative minimum tax problem \ncreated by the Bush tax cut.\n  Make no mistake; that amount of money isn't enough to fix the \nalternative minimum tax in total. That is just the amount of money \nnecessary to fix the costs created by the Bush tax cut itself. The \nalternative minimum tax is growing every year with the effects of \ninflation. We have gone from 2 million people being affected. If the \nBush tax cut passes, the Joint Tax Committee says 35 million people are \ngoing to be affected. Boy, are they in for a big surprise. They think \nthey are getting a tax cut. What will happen is they will get pushed \ninto the alternative minimum tax--one in every four taxpayers. But \nthere is not a dime in this budget to fix it.\n  As I indicated, there is no new education money. Even though this \nweek on the floor of the Senate, or last week, we passed an amendment \nto put in $150 billion for education, there is not a dime of it in this \nbudget.\n  Emergencies. Over the next 11 years, we can anticipate $55 billion of \nemergency costs--tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes, floods. Every year \nit averages $5 billion. They don't have it in here. We know it will \nhappen. When you apply the interest costs to all of the above, you are \ndeep into the Medicare trust fund and you are deep into Social \nSecurity: into the Medicare trust fund by over $300 billion; into the \nSocial Security trust fund by over $200 billion.\n  What is it going to be? We are not going to have the defense buildup? \nWe will not have any new money for education? We will not fix the \nalternative minimum tax? We are not going to have emergencies? I don't \nthink so. I think we have a budget document that simply is not telling \nthe whole story. It is telling just a piece of the story, just part of \nthe story because if you tell the whole story, it does not add up.\n\n  This is an especially important time because we know that in this 10-\nyear period we are forecasted to have surpluses. We also know from \ntestimony before the Budget Committee that we are headed for a \ncircumstance very soon, in the next decade when the baby boomers start \nto retire, that the Social Security and Medicare trust funds face\n\n[[Page S4552]]\n\nhuge cash deficits. Those deficits start in the year 2016, and you can \nsee what happens after that. There is a cascade of red ink. The \ndeficits explode.\n  There is no provision in this budget for strengthening Social \nSecurity for the long term. In our proposal, we had $750 billion. It is \njust another one of the missing pieces of this budget.\n  Some have said there are all these increases in spending in this \nbudget. The chairman talked about a 4-percent increase. The only 4-\npercent increase that is in this budget is for 1 year in one part of \nthe budget. It is not the whole budget. The whole budget over the 10 \nyears goes up by 3.5 percent a year. Domestic discretionary spending \ngoes up by 2.9 percent a year on average over the 10 years of this \nbudget. This is not big spending.\n  In fact, what we see, as I have indicated, is that total spending \ngoes up on average per year for the 10 years of this budget by 3.5 \npercent a year. Discretionary spending goes up on average by 2.9 \npercent a year. When we look at spending as a percentage of our gross \ndomestic product, which the economists tell us is the best way to \nmeasure changes in spending over time, what we see is the total \nspending in this budget resolution is going to the lowest level since \n1951--the lowest level since 1951. The size of Federal Government, that \nhas already come down rather dramatically over the last 9 years from 22 \npercent of the gross domestic product to 18 percent of the gross \ndomestic product today, will continue to decline to 16.3 percent of the \ndomestic product in the year 2011, the lowest percentage since 1951.\n  Discretionary spending is military spending. Discretionary spending \nis the other part of domestic spending that is not controlled by the \nmandatory spending. Discretionary spending is law enforcement, \neducation, parks. Discretionary spending as a percentage of GDP is \ngoing to its lowest level ever, 5.1 percent. So much for the claims of \nbig spending.\n  In fact, the appropriated spending levels shortchange education and \nother critical priorities. Here is what the Senate passed: $181 billion \nover 10 years. The conference committee has actually produced a cut of \n$56 billion. This is going to mean dramatic changes--in law enforcement \nfunding, funding for parks, funding for education, funding for health \ncare--because the money simply will not be there.\n  The fundamental difference in our budget approach and the budget \napproach of the other side has been, yes, we have had a difference on \nthe tax cut. We believe the tax cut should be about half as big and \nthat we should do twice as much on debt reduction, both short term and \nlong term. That is the fundamental difference between us on budget \nmatters. But, in addition to that, we also have different priorities on \neducation. We believe that is a place where a significant investment \nshould be made. But in this budget there is no new money for education.\n  As I indicated, this budget threatens to put us back into deficit, \nback into debt, and to see the gross debt of the United States actually \nlarger at the end of this period rather than smaller.\n\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee has talked about the reduction \nin the so-called publicly held debt. That is what the red line on this \nchart shows. He is exactly correct: Debt held by the public is going \ndown. Debt held by the public is going to be paid down to about $800 \nbillion.\n  But at the very same time that debt held by the public is going down, \ndebt held by the trust funds of the country is going up. In fact, the \ngross debt of the United States at the end of this period is going to \nbe substantially more than it is as we meet here today. The gross debt \nof the United States today is $5.6 trillion. At the end of this 10-year \nperiod, the gross debt of the United States will be $7.1 trillion. The \ngross debt is increasing by just about the same amount as the tax cuts \ncontained in this budget resolution.\n  Here is a comparison of what President Bush proposed, what the \nDemocratic alternative was, what the Senate passed, and with what the \nconference has come back. There are two differences that really jump \nout at you. They are dramatic differences. The first one is in \neducation, where the President proposed $13 billion of new money over \nthe 10 years, Democrats proposed $139 billion, the Senate passed $308 \nbillion, and the conference committee has come back with nothing--zero. \nThat is a pretty dramatic difference.\n  The second dramatic difference is in strengthening Social Security. \nThe President had reserved $600 billion of the trust fund to strengthen \nSocial Security for the long term. We proposed $750 billion, but not \nout of the trust fund because we believe that is double counting. We \ntook it out of the general fund to strengthen Social Security because \nthat is what we believe it will take to do the job. Just taking money \nout of the trust fund does not solve the problem. This problem is \nbigger than saving every penny of the trust fund.\n  What came back out of the conference committee? Nothing, zero.\n  The same on defense--defense--where they have left out the massive \ndefense buildup that we all know is about to be proposed by the \nSecretary of Defense.\n  I want to conclude by saying I believe there are six key reasons to \noppose the budget resolution conference report that is before us.\n  No. 1, there is no new money for education.\n  No. 2, the magnitude of this tax cut crowds out other important \npriorities, including national defense, including education, and \nincluding expanding health care coverage in America.\n  No. 3, this budget hides the defense spending increases by providing \na blank check to the Bush administration. I have never seen this \nbefore, a reserve fund created where one person is able to determine \nwhat the defense spending of the United States is going to be. That is \na rather extraordinary grant of power to one individual.\n  No. 4, it sets up a raid on the Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds just as certainly as night follows day. Because of all they have \nleft out, because of all they have left aside, because of all that we \nknow is to come, this budget sets us up for major raids on the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust fund.\n  No. 5, it cuts spending for high priority domestic needs by $56 \nbillion over the next 10 years. That, by the way, was something that \njust changed in the final hours of the conference committee.\n  No. 6, it fails to set aside funds for strengthening Social Security \nfor the long term.\n  I submit to our colleagues that those are the reasons this budget \nconference report should fail.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose it so that we can have a bipartisan \nbudget agreement, one that is in line with the values of the American \npeople.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, it almost seems to me as if we are not \nreading the same pages. To say that there is no new money in this \nbudget for education is incomprehensible to me.\n  In fact, this chart shows exactly what the increase in spending in \neducation is. This is just the baseline. We are probably going to \nincrease spending even above this.\n  But this is the Clinton request. This is the Bush request. This is \nwhat we are voting on right now. The difference is $40 billion, and the \nBush request we are voting on as a baseline is $44 billion. We probably \nhave $6 billion on top of that.\n  When we are talking about no spending increases when the President \nhas clearly given an 11.6-percent spending increase, the largest of any \nFederal agency, I think it is just some vast miscommunication.\n  Senators understand what is in this budget resolution. We are \nincreasing spending 5 percent above last year's level. That is bigger \nthan the rate of inflation.\n  There is not a business or household in this country that considers a \n5-percent increase a cut--a cut in our spending needs? I think what we \nhave here is really a difference in basic philosophy and basic \npriority.\n  The budget we will be voting on today increases spending in priority \nareas, such as education at the 11-percent increase. It will also \nincrease defense. It will increase other high-priority areas. It will \nbright-line some areas; there is no doubt about that.\n  Those are the kinds of choices that every American has to make in \ntheir own household budgets. Why shouldn't\n\n[[Page S4553]]\n\nGovernment do the same thing with the American taxpayer dollars? Let's \nnot forget whose money it is. Let's not forget our responsibility for \nthe stewardship of other people's money. If we had our own choices, \nmaybe we would spend it a little differently. But we must be careful \nstewards of taxpayer dollars. That is what this budget does.\n  It also makes sure that we return some of the excess money back to \nthe people--$1.5 trillion in tax relief for the American people, which \nis about 25 percent of the projected surplus. It is not the whole \nsurplus; it is approximately 25 percent of the surplus.\n  Social Security is going to be kept totally intact. All of the money \nthat comes into the Social Security fund is going to stay with Social \nSecurity because we are going to need to reform Social Security to keep \nit from going into a deficit in the year 2038. We are going to keep the \nmoney in the Social Security trust fund, just as we said we would do, \nin order to prepare for the reform that will keep Social Security \nsecure. And the downpayment on that is to keep the money that is coming \nin, in Social Security, right there and not allow it to be spent for \nany other purpose.\n  Yes, there is a difference in philosophy. We will see that coming \nforward. The difference is we believe the money that is coming into the \ncoffers of the taxpayers of America should be carefully managed, should \nnot be overspent, and should not be thrown around but should be \ncarefully spent and carefully prioritized, just as the people who \nearned the money and send it to Washington do in their own budgets. \nThat is our responsibility. That is what we are producing in this \nbudget today.\n  Senator Domenici has been the most bipartisan and cooperative \nchairman of the Budget Committee I have ever seen. When I heard some of \nthe comments about Democrats not having a role in this budget, I \ncouldn't believe my ears because I have been watching Senator Domenici \nfor the last month. I know he has been in meeting after meeting after \nmeeting with the Republicans and the Democrats on the committee and, \nyes, with the White House to have the total input and, yes, with \nMembers of the House of Representatives to try to see what we could do \nto pass a bill in a very evenly divided Senate.\n\n  I think what was produced by the Budget Committee under the \nleadership of this great chairman is a wonderful budget that shows we \nrespect the taxpayers of this country and we are going to manage their \ndollars wisely. We are going to spend more on public education, on \nMedicare, and on defense. We are going to spend money in high-priority \nareas. We are not going to spend more money in every area. I think it \nwould be irresponsible to do that.\n  Let's argue about those priorities. That is legitimate. That is a \nlegitimate debate. But to say that we aren't increasing spending when \nwe are increasing spending 5 percent, which is more than the rate of \ninflation and more than the spending increases in most households in \nthis country, I think we have to get the truth on the table.\n  The fact of the matter is, in the area of education, we see the \nlargest increase and the highest level of funding for education for \ndisabled children. We are making a commitment to the disabled children \nin this country. We are increasing Pell grants for low-income college \nstudents. It is a clear priority in this bill that we would try to make \nsure every young person in this country will have the ability to go to \ncollege if that is his or her desire. If that is a goal of a young \nperson in this country, through Pell grants, low-interest loans, we \nwant to make it possible for those children to have that opportunity.\n  We have increased Pell grants every year I have been in the Senate. \nIn fact, I submitted the amendment that made sure Pell grants went to \nneedy students first rather than being peeled off by other interests.\n  New reading program: That is the basis of the increase in spending in \nthe education bill, $1 billion, tripling current funding, because we \nbelieve that if a child can't read at grade level in the third grade, \nthat child is going to fall behind. There is no doubt about it. If you \nwait until that child drops out of junior high school or high school, \nof course, the child is lost. Of course, the child is frustrated. In \nfact, that is exactly the cause of many high school dropouts today--not \nthat the young people aren't smart. It is not that they can't learn. It \nis that they cannot read. If they cannot read, of course, they can't \ncomprehend the math and the history and the geography: Of course, they \ncan't.\n  That is why we are prioritizing getting to those young people at the \nearly stages and finding out what the weaknesses are and correcting \nthose weaknesses while they still have a chance to have the full \nbenefit of their education.\n  There is $472 million to encourage school choice and innovation. We \nare increasing the spending for historically black colleges and \nHispanic-serving institutions. That is an area where I have been \ninvolved since I have been here. We have been year after year after \nyear increasing the spending in both of those areas, and this is going \nto increase what we have increased by 30 percent by the year 2005 \nbecause that is a priority.\n  Under the National Science Foundation, there will be $200 million for \nnew K-12 math-science partnerships to try to encourage our young people \nto go into science and math because we know that is where the future \nis.\n  I commend the Senator from New Mexico. I appreciate that he has been \na responsible steward of taxpayer dollars in our country. I would not \nwant someone in the Senate who thought that just because the money was \nthere it should be spent whether or not the program warranted the added \nexpenditures. And continuing spending is still something that should be \nworth applauding. If we are continuing the spending for a program, if \nwe are increasing it, then I think that we have determined it is a \npriority. I think we should look at this budget from the eyes of the \npeople we are representing to determine what the priorities should be, \nand knowing that perhaps we did not increase in some areas, and we \nmight have decreased in some areas, but that does not mean we will not \nbe able to come back and do something later. But it does mean we are \ngoing to keep our eye on the ball, and we are going to increase \neducation spending, we are going to increase defense spending, we are \ngoing to increase Medicare, we are going to keep Social Security \nsecure, and we are going to do the things that people elected us to do; \nthat is, to represent them and their tax dollars with respect for their \nhard work to earn that money.\n  The people of this country are hard working. They are productive. \nThey should be able to keep as much of their money as we do not need \nfor Government, to spend as they wish on their families. I do not think \nthat is a bad priority.\n  So, Mr. President, I thank the Senators. I thank them for this \nbudget. I hope we will have a budget adopted by a large majority \nbecause I think they have done a good job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have been talking with the ranking \nmember. There are two Members on his side ready to speak. I am going to \njust speak for a couple minutes, and then the other side can have two \nin a row. If we have another speaker come, we will work to accommodate \nthat person, but that will be after the two speakers from the other \nside.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Might we just lock it in at this point?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Sure.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We will recognize the two Senators after Senator Domenici \nhas concluded his thoughts. On our side, we will first go to Senator \nKennedy.\n  I ask Senator Kennedy, are you seeking 20 minutes?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Please.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Twenty minutes for Senator Kennedy.\n  I ask Senator Stabenow, are you seeking 20 minutes?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Fifteen minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And then we will go to Senator Stabenow for 15 minutes, \nif we can enter into that as an agreement after Senator Domenici \nconcludes. I ask unanimous consent that that be the sequence of \nrecognition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4554]]\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let me say to the Senator, I hope the debate does not \ngo late into the evening. But I think we are just on a path now where \neach side has 5 hours. I hope we do not use it. I do not know if you \nwill use it. But essentially, for anybody who wants to speak on our \nside, you just heard the consent agreement. So if you want to speak, it \nwill be 40, 50 minutes before we have another Senator from our side. I \nhope we will all recognize that. We will welcome you before the evening \nis out.\n\n  I might say to anybody who is concerned about what this budget \nresolution has in it, I have stated that one time today. But I believe \nas a wrap-up I will go through again everything that we have put in \nthis because anyone can pick out certain areas and debate them.\n  But overall, I want to first thank those Democrats who voted with us, \nthose from the other side, so we could go to conference. Anyone who \nthinks they have not had an impact, they have had an impact. They had \nan impact to permit us to get a budget, go to conference, and get a \nconference report that included tax cuts. How the tax cuts are going to \ncome out and all the ingredients of that over the next 11 years, \nincluding 2 years of stimulus, clearly, those on the other side will \nhave a very big impact on that. Not only did they have an impact as we \nleft here, they had an impact as we produced the conference report for \nthe Senate and final wrap-up of the language that went to conference. \nBut essentially I assume they will be big participants in the kind of \ntax reductions that people are going to get. I thank them for that.\n  I am going to summarize on education because I am sure there will be \nmany speakers speaking to what they thought should have been the \nnumbers on education. I just want to say that whatever the President \nassumed as education increases are assumed in this budget. IDEA is \nassumed to increase to $7.6 billion. That is up $1.25 billion. That is \na 20-percent increase in special education. There will be some who \nthink it should be more. There are some who think it should be a new \nentitlement program. But it did receive a pretty substantial increase.\n  For those who are wondering about funding IDEA, we can look at the \nlast 3 years, plus this year, and we are well on our way to living up \nto our commitment, which has taken a long time to fulfill. We are \nmoving toward the amount we assumed the Federal Government's \nparticipation in special ed was going to be a long time ago. We are \nmoving aggressively on that. We have another $6.2 billion that could \nbe, if the appropriators see fit, part of it--they could use all of it, \nhalf of it. It could go to education if they choose to do that. That is \nwhat is in the budget resolution.\n  I want to wrap up and say, I understand my worthy opposition talks \nabout the assumptions in this budget, the 10-year totals. I can only \nsay to everyone, if you believe that we have assumptions for growth, \ninflation, and the like, that are optimistic, then go ask those who are \nnot optimistic what their assumptions are. You will find this is a \nmodest set of assumptions. It is not extraordinarily high. If some \nPresident in the past and some Budget Director in the past used rosy \nscenarios in economics, we did not. It is not in this budget. It was \nnot done by CBO.\n  Lastly, there is no question that everyone wants to do something in \nMedicare. I repeat, I think when the Senate comes out with a $300 \nbillion reserve fund--the House had $145 billion or $146 billion, and \nwe end up with $300 billion--we did pretty good, considering that both \nHouses have to speak. We doubled the amount the House had. Frankly, it \nis a pretty good number for those who want to work on that.\n  There are many other things that will be addressed from time to time. \nI will try, after much discussion, to recap it all. But it may be we \nwill get through early enough and, who knows, maybe the Senate will not \nwant to even hear from me again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask that the Presiding Officer be good \nenough to tell me when I have 5 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will notify the Senator.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my good friend from New Mexico in \nthe Chamber, Senator Domenici. I saw, as well, my friend from the State \nof Texas in the Chamber. They were commenting earlier--particularly the \nSenator from Texas--about how this budget protects education. Well, it \ndoes not.\n  We Democrats challenge the chairman of the Budget Committee or the \nSenator from Texas to take the budget here and show us where and how \neducation is protected in this budget--because it is not protected.\n  We will give you a very quick lesson on why the budget fails to \nprotect education.\n  First of all, let's take how this budget considered the tax breaks. \nIt is very clear, on the top of page H1961 in the Congressional Record, \nin how it treats the tax cut. It says, ``the Senate Committee on \nFinance shall report a reconciliation bill'' which is to include their \ntax reduction of $1.25 trillion. The Finance Committee shall do it.\n  Then we come over to the issue of defense on page H1962. And it says: \n``Senate Defense Firewall.'' It says: ``for the nondefense category, \n$336,230,000,000 in new budget authority.'' That is less than current \nservices. Still nothing on education. Written right here, H1962. Let's \nat least, when we are talking about this extremely important measure, \nget away from general rhetoric and let's look at the facts written in \nthis budget.\n  It says right up here on H1962 that you won't even have current \nservices. Current services means the money needed to provide the same \nservices the government provides today next year. It costs more to \nprovide the same services because of inflation. We are not even going \nto get the current services level of funding for domestic discretionary \nspending under this budget. It is written right in here on H1962, but \nyou need to look at the Congressional Budget Office report to know that \ncurrent services in domestic discretionary spending will require $343 \nbillion next year, in fiscal year 2002.\n  Then we stay on the same page H1962 and go on to the third column. As \na reserve fund for agriculture, it says the Committee on the Budget may \nincrease the allocation for farmers by $66 billion.\n  Well, then, let's go ahead and look in here on page H1964 and see \nwhat they say about education, when we have all of that written in here \nto set money aside for tax cuts and defense and agriculture. Now we \ncome to education.\n  If the Senator from Texas or the Senator from New Mexico can read the \nlanguage of the report at H1964 and tell me where we have this increase \nin funding for education, I will be glad to wait here for all 10 hours \nto hear it. But we won't hear it. They can't get there because this is \nwhat it says: ``It is the sense of the Senate.'' No requirement, no \nmandate, no words like ``shall,'' or even ``may'' set aside specific \nfunds. Instead, ``It is the sense of the Senate'' that the budget makes \navailable ``up to $6.2 billion.'' ``Up to''--``up to.'' Come on. \nPlease, please, for those who are going to support this budget, don't \ninsult our intelligence by maintaining that this is any commitment even \nof $6 billion for education. It is not. Read the language. It is not \nthere. Don't distort the facts. No new money is in this budget for \neducation. If it is, answer where it is, because it isn't there. We \nhave given you the references. We await the answers. We await the \nanswers from the members of the Budget Committee.\n\n  Money for education just isn't there. It is a sham. The commitment of \nthe administration and the budgeteers is a sham when it talks about \nincreasing education for the children of this country. It is a cliche. \nIt is a shibboleth. It is nonexistent. This budget doesn't provide it. \nWe wait to find out where it is. We wait to have it clarified. We wait \nfor them to tell us how they claim it is in here. They won't be able to \ndo it.\n  The only increases they have provided in the last year come not from \nnew money but come from the cuts in other programs. We heard Members \nhere on the floor of the Senate talk about the increases last year in \neducation. Wouldn't we be proud to have all this in education? You \nwouldn't be proud of it if you were a worker who needed job training \nand you had your job training resources cut $540 million next year \nalone. And you wouldn't be\n\n[[Page S4555]]\n\nproud if you were a mother and your child needed early learning \nopportunities--you wouldn't be so proud of it. And you wouldn't be so \nproud of it if you were a young person trying to upgrade your skills to \nbe trained as a pediatrician and to try to get some help for training \nso that we have the best doctors in the world to take care of our \nchildren. They slashed that program too, to pay for what they call a \none-time ``increase'' in education.\n  The list goes on--the slashing of clean water, the slashing of \nrenewable energy, the slashing of the National Science Foundation, \ndisaster relief, community policing. It adds up to, what, $1.8 billion, \njust to the level of new real dollars that the administration claims it \nwill provide for education. Come on, please. Please, Budget Committee. \nPlease don't insult our intelligence. You don't have a nickel in this \nprogram that is new money in terms of education. You just don't have \nit.\n  The money you put in there you have taken from someplace else. You \ndon't have it in the outer years, as we see the outer years. Here it is \nin the Education Department's own 2002 budget. You talk about it here \non in the budget resolution as well. There will be no new education \nmoney in the outer years. It is very clear what it is, on page H1983, \nif you read through the ``Functions and Revenues'' paragraph on the \nfirst column. The budget plainly says, ``This report assumes that the \n2002 discretionary function level grows by inflation.'' There it is. \nThere it is, ``grows by inflation.'' That is all for education. It \ngrows by inflation. That means zero increase in 2003, zero increase in \n2004, zero increase in 2005, zero increase in 2006, zero in 2007, zero \nin 2008, zero in 2009, zero in 2010, and zero in 2011. That is in the \nCongressional Record on page H1983. There are others who may know this \ndocument better than I, but I'm just reading the words written in this \nbudget. We have cited the relevant passages.\n  This budget comes in the wake of actions of this body, in a \nbipartisan way, to provide $250 billion through the Harkin amendment. \nWe look around here, we look around and say, the Harkin amendment? We \nwere going to reduce the tax bill by $200 billion so that education \ncould be realistically funded. Is there $200 billion in here for \neducation? No. Is there $100 billion? No. Is there $50 billion in here? \nNo. Is there $10 billion? No. The Senate voted, Republicans and \nDemocrats, to reduce the tax cut by $250 billion and put that in \neducation. Is there $5 billion in here? No. Here's what new money the \nbudgeteers and the administration provide for education: Zero.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator had up a chart that shows the Bush increase \ncompared to the Clinton proposal.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, the differences in proposed Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act increases.\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is what is in the President's proposal. It is very \ninteresting. We had the Senator from Texas hold up a chart that talked \nabout the President's proposal. Will the Senator from Massachusetts \ncorrect me if I am wrong? Are we voting on the President's proposal or \nare we voting on the conference report?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator, who has spoken so eloquently, knows we are \nvoting on the budget conference report.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And would the Senator from Massachusetts correct me if I \nam wrong. As I read the conference report, there is no increase in any \nyear for education, other than the sense-of-the-Senate language buried \ndeep in the document that every Senator knows isn't worth the paper it \nis written on because it means zero. Isn't that correct?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct and reminds us about \nthe importance of being accurate in the representation of what is in \nthis budget.\n  I hope that those on the other side will take the time to come out \nhere, because we are challenging them on this point on education. Come \nout here and refute us. Show us where we are wrong. I would welcome \nthat opportunity to hear how we are wrong. As the Senator from North \nDakota has pointed out, the language is what is guiding. It isn't what \nwe think might be in here. It isn't what might be in here at some time. \nIt is what is in here. It is what is written down for all to see.\n  The Senator has pointed out the controlling language which shows that \nthere is no increase in education. Education is funded at current \nservices, adjusted for inflation. That is against a background of an \nadministration that has said: ``Education is the No. 1 priority. We are \nnot going to leave a child behind.''\n  Well, we know that two-thirds of the children are being left behind \nwith the current expenditures in title I--two-thirds of them. And 50 \npercent of the children are being left behind in the Head Start \nProgram. And 95 percent of the children are being left behind in Early \nHead Start. And we know we are only funding about 15 percent of the \neligible children in terms of the childcare for working mothers.\n  We are leaving no child behind? We are leaving them all behind, a \nwhole generation behind. That is what this budget does.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to. I hope the Senator will give me 5 more \nminutes at the end.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to do that.\n  It is interesting, our friends on the other side, first of all, they \nhold up the Bush budget, which has nothing to do with what we are \nvoting on here. We are voting on the conference report that has no \nincrease in education. They also tried to misrepresent what the Bush \nincrease was by claiming credit for money that was advance funded last \nyear when he was Governor of Texas. He didn't have a thing to do with \nit. They count that in their so-called 11-percent increase he has \nproposed. Of course, none of that is relevant to what we are doing here \nbecause we are dealing with the conference report.\n  Correct me if I am wrong because I look at discretionary spending, \nthe total pot of money that education comes out of, and just to keep \npace with inflation it requires $663 billion for 2002. The conference \nreport says they have $661 billion available. So they have cut $2 \nbillion in the total pool of money from which education funding comes. \nOn top of that, defense is about half, and they have increased defense \nby $3.3 billion. So other nondefense programs have to be cut by $5.5 \nbillion to make this budget.\n  Will the Senator from Massachusetts indicate whether that is a \ncorrect conclusion or not?\n  (Mr. BROWNBACK assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, just in answering--and I intend to--I was looking \nat page H1867 of the budget that Republicans filed before they lost \ntheir two pages last Friday, which contains the exact same numbers for \neducation, Function 500, as the budget they filed today, if you look at \npage H1960. I don't know whether the Senator is looking at this \nparticular passage. It has in here education training employment and \nsocial services. Then it has the budget authority, the outlays for \n2001; from 2002 with $76 billion; for 2003, $81 billion; 2004, $83 \nbillion; 2005, $85 billion--you get the drift--then $85 billion to $87 \nbillion. It goes up about $2 billion a year. That looks like flat \nfunding to me, adjusted only for inflation, which describes what is \ngoing happen if Republicans have their way. Flat funding on education \nall the way to the year 2011.\n  Let me ask the Senator this. In this budget proposal, they include \nfigures in the tax program, don't they--for example, for all of the out \nyears; am I correct? Maybe the Senator can inform me. As I understand \nit, the budgeteers were able to say what would be given or returned to \ntaxpayers all the way through to 2011, but we can't do it with regard \nto education.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator makes a powerful point. What they have done--\nwhen they want to reserve money for something, they know how to do it. \nWhen they want to reserve money for the tax cut, it is in a \nreconciliation instruction that goes to the Finance Committee, and they \nhave to report it. When they want to reserve money for defense, they \nknow how to do it. They create a special fund, and the chairman of the \ncommittee will decide how much we spend on defense. It is a remarkable\n\n[[Page S4556]]\n\nthing that one person has the power to decide what we are going to \nspend on defense. When they want to have funding for education, there \nis no reserve fund. They say it is the top priority. There is no \nreserve fund, and there is no increase. In fact----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We are talking a real increase for education. It would \nrequire more than inflation, would it not, because the student \npopulations are growing. It isn't enough to just offset inflation. The \nschool population is growing. So the truth of the matter is, in real \nterms, education is being cut under this budget.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Well, the Senator is correct. The fact is, the poorest \nstudents--yes, poorest students--in America over the last few years \nhave increased in terms of poverty, yet the budget includes nothing to \naddress their needs. We expect a doubling in those attending school who \nspeak foreign languages, yet we have nothing in this budget but current \nservices; no increase. The total numbers of students are increasing, \nand we'll have a million more to educate by 2009. We will have a \nmillion more students that will come to school over the next 9 years \nwhose interests aren't even being taken care of. This budget is a \ncomplete abdication of responsibility to students in this country.\n  I wonder if I could have 10 minutes for to offer my prepared remarks \nfor the consideration of my colleagues.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts be given 10 minutes off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose this budget conference report. \nIts tax breaks are excessive and tilted overwhelmingly to the wealthy, \nand it ignores the urgent need to invest effectively in education.\n  Under the enormous tax breaks provided by this Republican budget, \nthere will be no funds to increase education investments for the next \nten years. It's a budget that fails to provide the nation's schools, \nteachers, parents, and communities with the resources that are \nessential to carry out the reforms we all know are needed. At the same \ntime, it gives away half a trillion dollars to the wealthiest one \npercent of Americans. How very Republican!\n  That is the bottom line proposed by this Republican budget--nothing \nnew for education, and over half a trillion new dollars for those whose \nincomes already average over $1.1 million a year.\n  This budget doesn't just leave some children behind--it shortchanges \nan entire generation of children. Nowhere are Republicans' misplaced \npriorities clearer. After all the talk about the importance of \neducation to children's lives and the nation's future after all the \ntalk about unmet needs in the nation's schools--after all the Senate \nvotes to increase investments to meet the most basic education needs, \nthis Republican budget contains no new funds for education. It tells \nmillions of children who attend disadvantaged schools that they don't \ncount--that no help is on the way to give them the long-overdue support \nthey need and deserve.\n  The federal budget is, in fact, the budget of the American family as \na whole. Individual families have their own budget process. They know \nwhat they would like to do, but almost all of them have limited \nresources, so they set their priorities. Wise family budgets guarantee \nthat the family's basic daily needs for food and shelter are met. Then \nthe family can plan for long-term needs. And after these needs are met, \nvacations and other non-essential items can be included. Families know \nthat failing to budget for both immediate and long-term needs can risk \nfinancial disaster even bankruptcy.\n  The same is true of the federal budget. Yet Republicans have chosen \nto purchase the country club membership, the extravagant cruise, and \nthe high-priced sports car, while refusing to invest in educating the \nyouth who will lead the nation and guide its economy in the next \ngeneration. Today's irresponsible Republican decisions on this budget \njeopardize America's future.\n  Two basic facts tell the whole sad story about how badly this budget \ntreats education. First, it spends every penny of the total $2.7 \ntrillion surplus that will be available over the next ten years, \nwithout providing even one penny of that surplus to improve education. \nSecond, to add insult to injury, this GOP budget caps education funding \nat the amount needed only to maintain current services and then it \napplies heavy additional pressure to cut education funding even below \nthe level of current services over the next ten years.\n  In allocating the surplus, the only real Republican priority is to \nprotect the GOP tax cut. As the conference report bluntly states, ``the \nCommittee on Finance of the Senate shall report to the Senate a \nreconciliation bill not later than May 18, 2001 that consists of \nchanges in laws within its jurisdiction sufficient to reduce revenues'' \nby $1.25 trillion through the year 2011. This language requires a tax \ncut. It sets a date certain for the tax cut to be sent to the full \nSenate for a vote. It sets a specific amount for the tax cut. And it \neven protects the tax cut from a Senate filibuster--the ultimate \nprotection for GOP tax cuts. Wouldn't it be nice if our Republican \nfriends would give the same tender loving care to education that they \ngive to tax cuts under their budget?\n  Democrats support a tax cut. But it must be a responsible tax cut--\none that the Nation can afford, and one that is fair to all workers. \nBut the tax cut supported in this budget flunks those tests. The GOP \ntax cut--so explicitly touted and protected in this budget--is \nirresponsible, excessive, unfair, and unaffordable.\n  In addition to tax cuts, this GOP budget carves $66 billion out of \nthe surplus to enable the Agriculture Committee to increase support for \nfarmers. The GOP budget also adds special protections to increase \nspending on defense. Democrats support these priorities too and their \ninclusion in the conference report clearly demonstrates that Republican \nmembers of the House and Senate know how to write a priority into the \nbudget when they want to. But they refuse to do so for education.\n  Let's look at what the budget does say about education. Here it is: \n``Sense of the Senate With Respect to Education Funding. It is the \nSense of the Senate that this budget resolution makes available up to \n$6.2 billion in discretionary budget authority for funding domestic \npriorities. . . .'' As we all know, a Sense of the Senate provision has \nno binding legal effect on anyone. That is why Republicans did not use \na Sense of the Senate to protect their tax cut.\n  The language of this budget proves that Republicans know how to \nprotect their priorities--it also proves that education is nowhere to \nbe found in Republican priorities. All of the GOP education rhetoric \nrings hollow when you examine the GOP budget.\n  The Republican leadership could easily have accepted the recent \nSenate vote on the Harkin amendment, to reduce the size of the tax cut \nby 20 percent, so that support for education could increase by $250 \nbillion over the next 10 years. A responsible proposal like that would \nenable vital improvements to be made in education throughout America, \nwhile still leaving $1 trillion dollars for tax cuts. But no, said our \nRepublican friends. They want every last penny for their tax cut, and \nthey write specific language to force it into law.\n  In addition, they added specific budget language that restricts \neducation funding. The conference report itself specifically sets \neducation discretionary funding at CBO's current services level, and \nthen adjusts it for inflation for the next 10 years. These figures fail \nto account for the estimated increase in enrollment of 1.1 million new \nstudents, which the Department of Education expects between now and \n2008. When this increase is taken into account, it is clear that \nFederal spending per student will actually decline under the Republican \nbudget. With all the challenges facing schools and students today, \nRepublicans intend to reduce Federal funding per student.\n  The conference report goes even further, and directs a $5.5 billion \ncut next year in total nondefense discretionary spending--2 percent \nbelow the amount that the Congressional Budget Office says is needed to \nmaintain current\n\n[[Page S4557]]\n\nservices next year. With all this downward pressure on overall domestic \ndiscretionary spending, any increased education investments will be \ndifficult at best to achieve.\n  We are already well aware of the difficulty in funding the small $1.8 \nbillion increase that President Bush proposes for education next year. \nNone of it comes from the surplus. Instead, Republicans expect it to \ncome from cuts in other domestic programs, as I pointed out earlier.\n  Those cuts include--$541 million from a range of job training \nprograms, $20 million from the Early Learning Opportunities Act, $35 \nmillion from Pediatric Graduate Medical Education, $497 million from \nthe Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Water Fund, $156 million \nfrom renewable energy programs, $200 million from basic science \nresearch at NASA and the National Science Foundation, $270 million from \ndisaster relief at the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and $270 \nmillion from Community Oriented Policing Services. All of these cuts \nare demanded under the Republican budget in exchange for a small \nincrease in education.\n  If the tax cut were trimmed by 20 percent, major resources in the \nrange of $250 billion over the next decade such as the Harkin amendment \nthat was approved by a bipartisan vote in the Senate a few weeks ago, \nwould be available to vastly improve education throughout America, \nwithout requiring cuts in other essential services.\n  America's school administrators, teachers, and State and local \nleaders all know the need for additional Federal investments in \neducation. They are the ones today who cannot afford to hire additional \nqualified teachers in overcrowded school districts. They are the ones \ntoday who confront the social problems that arise when 7 million \nchildren are left alone after school each day. They are the ones who \nendure first-hand the crumbling school buildings.\n  Countless business executives know the needs too. They are the ones \nwho see young children enter school without being ready to learn. They \nare the ones who search in vain for qualified employees among graduates \nof many public schools.\n  Across America, 12 million children live in poverty--but we provide \nthe full range of title I Federal education services to only one in \nthree of these children. The rest are left to fend for themselves, with \nthe most inadequate teaching, the most inadequate attention, and the \nmost inadequate facilities.\n  Four of every 10 children in poverty are taught by teachers who lack \nan undergraduate major or minor degree in their primary field. Gym \nteachers are teaching math. English teachers are teaching physics.\n  Because Federal title I funding is so deficient, needy children have \nmore teachers' aides than teachers. The vast majority of teachers' \naides never graduated from college. In all, at least 750,000 well-\nmeaning but underqualified teachers are working in classrooms across \nAmerica today.\n  Nearly one in five first through third graders are attempting to \nlearn in overcrowded classes of 25 or more students. In these cases, \nsome students inevitably lose in the competition for essential teacher \ntime. Entire classrooms suffer as well. Ask any teacher or student. \nOvercrowded classrooms undermine teaching for everyone.\n  In addition, over 7 million latchkey children are left alone to fend \nfor themselves after school each day, without constructive after school \nactivities to keep them off the streets, out of gangs, and away from \ndrugs and other dangerous behavior.\n  Even though Head Start ranks as the public's favorite Government \nprogram, inadequate funding continues to deny Head Start to half of all \neligible children. In the case of Early Head Start, 95 percent of \neligible infants and toddlers are left out.\n  Students with disabilities suffer from the same Federal neglect. The \nFederal Government has long promised to fund 40 percent of disability \neducation. Yet it still only funds 17 percent. As a result, only one in \nsix children with a disability obtains the needed Federal support.\n  This afternoon, we have a release from the White House talking about \nthe education program:\n\n       The administration strongly opposes the costly and \n     unwarranted amendment to convert special education funding \n     under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act to \n     direct spending.\n\n  Unwarranted. Tell that to the parents of disabled children. Tell that \nto local communities that are paying for these services. Unwarranted. \nUnwarranted against this tax program? Please.\n  For years, States have called on the Federal Government to live up to \nits commitment to disabled students. Yet this Republican budget says \nno.\n  Fourteen million children attend crumbling schools--schools with \ncontaminated drinking water, heating and plumbing systems that do not \nwork, falling tiles, broken windows, and soot-filled ventilation \nsystems. Seven million children attend schools with severe safety code \nviolations.\n  Parents across the country are pleading for increased investments to \nmeet these basic needs for modern facilities. But the Republican \nleadership says no, no, no.\n  In all of these cases, our Republican colleagues say that ``money \ndoesn't guarantee a quality education.'' What a preposterous response. \nMoney may not guarantee quality education, but it is impossible to \nprovide quality education in today's schools without substantial new \ninvestments. ``Reform'' without resources simply rearranges the deck \nchairs on the Education Titanic.\n  Make no mistake. The Nation stands at a crossroads. It is long past \ntime for Congress to make the investments that are so urgently needed \nin education, and we can do so by using less than ten percent of the \n$2.7 trillion budget surplus estimated over the next decade.\n  Sadly, lipservice is all the Republican leadership gives to \neducation. We have a unique opportunity to use the budget surplus to \nimprove education, and we cannot afford to waste that opportunity. I \nurge my colleagues to vote against this anti-education budget and send \nit back to conference so Congress can do the job that needs to be done \nand do it right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMichigan is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Absolutely.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from West Virginia is here seeking time on \nanother matter. Could we enter into an agreement that the Senator from \nWest Virginia be recognized for 15 minutes after the Senator from \nMichigan has completed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator and manager of this conference report, \nand I thank the distinguished Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise to thank our ranking member on \nthe Budget Committee, Senator Conrad from North Dakota, for his \nleadership on this important issue and, as well, Senator Kennedy, who \nhas spoken so eloquently about the fact that there are no dollars in \nthis budget resolution for education for our children.\n  One of the real pleasures for me as a new Member of the Senate on the \nBudget Committee has been to serve with Senator Byrd and to learn from \nhim, as well, about the processes of budget and appropriations.\n  We all, today, stand in opposition to this conference report that \nputs the United States on a risky fiscal path and threatens the longest \npeacetime economic expansion in our history.\n  I had an opportunity as a member of the Senate Budget Committee to \nsit through 16 different hearings. Secretary after Secretary came \nforward--the General Accounting Office, the CBO, Chairman Greenspan. In \nevery case, people came forward and said what was driving this economy \nand these projected surpluses was increased labor productivity.\n  I echo what Senator Kennedy has discussed in terms of education. If \nin every case before the Budget Committee the discussion was about \nincreased labor productivity, doesn't that mean education? It means \nresearch and technology development. But if we don't have the skilled \nworkforce to be able to use that technology, to do the research, to be \nable to work in these new economy jobs, we will not be able to keep \nthis economy going.\n  When we look at this budget and we see zero being guaranteed for \neducation, it makes no sense. It makes no\n\n[[Page S4558]]\n\nsense from an economic standpoint, it makes no sense from a human \nstandpoint, and it makes no sense from the standpoint of our families.\n  What we are saying regarding this budget is that this is a budget in \ntoto, not just a debate about a tax cut. It is a debate about the \nvalues and priorities of the American people. I believe in using and I \nknow the people in Michigan desire using common sense. They want us to \nbe balanced in our approach. They want to see tax cuts. I support tax \ncuts geared to middle-class families, folks working hard every day, \nhaving to make those choices for their families--our small businesses, \nour family farmers. I support providing meaningful tax relief.\n\n  I also hear from my constituents of a concern about paying down our \nnational debt. We have certainly heard a lot of people talk about it \nfor years and years. Now is the time when we can actually do it. We \nneed to do it.\n  I also hear great concern about making key investments in the \neducation of our children. I hear that whether I am talking to a \nbusiness group, whether I am talking to a local PTA, or whether I am \ntalking to people in the community on a daily basis. There is a great \nconcern about education and what it means for the future of the \ncountry. I hear great concerns about education.\n  There is more than one way to put money into people's pockets. One \nway is tax relief. I support that. Another way is to provide lower \ninterest rates by paying down the debt. That means lower mortgage \npayments. That means lower car payments. Coming from the great State of \nMichigan where we make a lot of those automobiles, we want people to be \nable to buy new automobiles. We want those car payments to be low. \nLower student loan payments, business loans, all of these things put \nmoney in people's pockets.\n  But there is another item that puts money in people's pockets. That \nis for those who are senior citizens in this country. When we look at \nthe tax cut proposed for those under $25,000 in income a year, they \ndon't see anything from the proposed tax cut. A large percentage of \nthose are our seniors. For them, if we want to put money back into \ntheir pockets, we need to lower the cost of their prescription drugs.\n  There is more than one way to put money back into people's pockets. I \nsupport a variety of strategies that make sure we do that, as well as \nmaking sure we are responsible and that we are willing to make sensible \ncommitments for the future.\n  We will hear colleagues talk about different percentages, different \namounts on the budget surplus, but I choose to look at it like this: \nWhen we look at a surplus, some of it is Social Security and Medicare. \nWe are paying in; we are building up surpluses in the trust funds. \nWithin 11 years, many baby boomers will start to retire and we will see \nthe major strain on Medicare and Social Security, but we are building \nup surpluses. If we take that out of the equation and the debate, as I \nbelieve we should, and we look at the non-Medicare and Social Security \nsurpluses, when all is said and done, virtually every penny of that \nsurplus, non-Medicare and Social Security, is dedicated to the tax cut. \nThat means for the next 10 years for our families, the only priority we \nbelieve American families have is the tax cut geared to the wealthiest \nAmericans with the idea that it will trickle down, through supply side \neconomics, somehow into people's pockets.\n  Then in order to provide any spending, the majority of the Medicare \ntrust fund is moved over into something called a contingency fund and \nspent. This budget spends the Medicare trust fund as if it were not a \ntrust fund but as if it were dollars to be spent on other programs.\n  This is a serious issue underlying this budget. We now find out, in \naddition to Medicare, this budget spends a portion of Social Security. \nWe know within 11 years baby boomers will start to retire in large \nnumbers. We don't have time to pay it back. This is a serious issue, \nand there is no doubt in my mind that the way this is structured puts \nus back into debt. It causes Medicare to be insolvent much sooner--\nwithin 10 years--and it seriously weakens Social Security.\n  What we see underlying this budget and all that is being talked about \nis the idea of using Medicare and a portion of Social Security to \nfinance this tax cut and budget. I believe that is fundamentally wrong. \nI support the position that we strengthen Medicare both for our \nhospitals and home health and other providers, and we strengthen it by \nmodernizing it with the prescription drug benefit for our seniors. I \nbelieve it is important we say, ``Hands off Social Security and \nMedicare.''\n  We have a budget surplus. There is no reason we ought to be spending \na dime out of Medicare or Social Security to fund anything in this \nbudget or a tax cut. Yet that is what is happening. That is a \nfundamental flaw in this budget. We have a situation where we are using \nMedicare and Social Security in this budget resolution to fund the tax \ncut and the budget. We see zero dollars being put aside for \neducation. We find ourselves in a situation where, despite the \namendment that was agreed to by the Senate by a bipartisan vote to \nincrease funds for education and to pay down the national debt, in the \nend analysis those things are taken out. We are back where we started. \nWe are not paying down all the national debt that we can, we do not \nhave dollars included for education, and we have a very narrow, ill-\nconceived budget resolution in front of us.\n\n  I also believe we need to keep our promise to special education, as \nwas talked about earlier. I think we have made several promises as a \ncountry. Two of them were Medicare and Social Security--great American \nsuccess stories, promises made to the American people.\n  Another promise that was made 25 years ago was that the Federal \nGovernment was to provide 40 percent of special education costs for our \nchildren in schools. We have yet to hit 15 percent. If we are not going \nto keep that promise now, when will we keep it? We are hearing now the \nPresident is saying he will not support that. Yet when I go home and \ntalk to my teachers and principals, they tell me if we would just keep \nour promise to special education, that would go a long way to free up \nother dollars for them to be able to address lowering class size, \nsafety in schools, math and science efforts, reading, and other \nimportant areas--if we just kept our promise.\n  If we cannot do it when we are projecting trillions of dollars in \nbudget surpluses at this time in our history, when will we? When do we \nkeep our promises, if not now?\n  Finally, we all know we are looking 10 years into the future. We do \nnot have to be doing that, but this is being designed as a process to \nsomehow look 10 years down the road. We know in the Budget Committee, \nthe Congressional Budget Office told us there is a 10-percent chance \nthey are accurate. It may be more; it may be less. It could be a $1 \ntrillion surplus; it could be a $50 billion deficit. We do not know. We \nare being asked to look 10 years down the road and to guess, to \nbasically gamble with the future of the country and the families of \nthis country by picking a number and somehow spending dollars that we \ndo not know will materialize in the future.\n  I joined earlier in this debate with Senators on both sides of the \naisle to propose that we put in place some kind of budget trigger so \nthat if the dollars did not materialize, they would not be spent. I \ndon't know; I am just a midwesterner. I am new here. But it seems to me \ncommon sense says we ought to have it in hand before we spend it. A \ntrigger would do that. Yet there is no trigger in this budget \nresolution. We are guessing about what will happen down the road. CBO \nsays there is a 10-percent chance they are right.\n  I urge my colleagues to take another look. We can do better than \nthis. We can do better than this for everybody. We can provide a \nmeaningful tax cut. We can pay down the national debt. We can do it \nwithout spending Medicare and Social Security. And we can invest in \neducation and in health care and critical quality-of-life issues for \nour families if we decide that is what we want to do.\n  It can be done the right way and can be done in a way that is \nfiscally responsible, that keeps the books balanced, and makes sure we \ncan be proud when we are done that we have truly kept going in the \nright direction as a country.\n  My fear with this budget is it is looking at the future through a \nrearview\n\n[[Page S4559]]\n\nmirror. I am very afraid of what is coming down the road because we are \nusing Medicare to pay for this tax-cutting budget, using part of Social \nSecurity, and refusing to invest in education even though we know \nincreased labor productivity is what will keep our economy going. We \nknow what works and what does not work and what needs to be done to be \nfiscally responsible.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to vote no on this legislation and give us a \nchance, as the Budget Committee, to do our work. We were not given a \nchance to sit down together and work something out that made sense.

Mr. President, the Senate has just undergone an abrupt \nchange in an office well known to all of us here in the Senate, but \nhardly visible, until lately, outside of the Senate--the office of the \nSenate Parliamentarian. I wish to make some comments on this matter. \nBut first I would like to commend the outgoing Parliamentarian, Robert \nDove, for his years of devoted service and to congratulate Alan Frumin \non his assumption of the duties of the office.\n  In my view, there are important institutional considerations that \nmust guide the selection of any individual who aspires to become the \nParliamentarian of the Senate.\n  A long career in non-partisan service in the Senate offers the \nobvious benefit of experience, and fosters a detailed comprehension of \nthe Senate's institutional role. An understanding of the Senate's \nunique constitutional role can best be developed by actually working on \nthe floor of the Senate, and by close observation of Senate debate.\n  A prospective parliamentarian should have little or no history of \nactive partisan politics but instead should demonstrate an interest in \nthe whole Senate as an institution. An individual with such a \nbackground can best represent the Senate's prerogatives in its dealings \nwith the other departments of Government and with the other body, the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  To date, each person who has served as Senate Parliamentarian has \ndevoted a career to non-partisan service to the Senate. Every person \nwho has become Senate Parliamentarian has served at least a decade as \nan assistant Senate parliamentarian before rising to the position of \nSenate Parliamentarian. Each person who has become Parliamentarian was \npromoted to that role from the status of most senior assistant \nparliamentarian.\n  The five individuals who have been Senate Parliamentarian--and I have \nknown them all--served an average of 12 years in the Secretary's Office \nbefore becoming Parliamentarian, with none less than 10 years. Each \nParliamentarian served as an apprentice to his predecessor and \nprogressed in sequence through the ranks following his predecessor.\n  The first Parliamentarian, Charles Watkins, served in the office of \nthe Secretary of the Senate as the Journal Clerk for 13 years before \nbecoming Senate Parliamentarian.\n  The second Parliamentarian, Dr. Floyd Riddick, who only recently \npassed from this life, served in the office of the Secretary of the \nSenate for 17 years, 13 as assistant parliamentarian, before becoming \nSenate Parliamentarian.\n  The third Parliamentarian, Murray Zweben, who I believe only recently \nwas deceased, served in the Parliamentarian's office for 16 years, 13 \nas assistant parliamentarian, before becoming Parliamentarian. The \nfourth Parliamentarian, Bob Dove, served as an assistant \nparliamentarian for 14\\1/2\\ years before becoming Parliamentarian. The \nfifth Parliamentarian, Alan Frumin, served as an assistant \nparliamentarian for 10 years and had a total of almost 13 years of non-\npartisan Congressional service before becoming Parliamentarian.\n  Mr. President, trust is the basis of all fruitful human \nrelationships. Loss of trust has poisoned many a well\n  Kings have fallen, presidents have fallen, and Senators have fallen \nbecause the people lost their trust. Treaties have been abrogated \nbecause trust was compromised. Especially in a body like the Senate, \nwhere one's word is one's currency, trust makes the wheels turn. Trust \nand comity, I would say, are the twin pillars upon which this body \nreally rests.\n  The Parliamentarian is the keeper of the rules. He guards the \nprecedents. He keeps the game fair. His advice about complicated \nprocedural matters must be above suspicion. Both sides must view him as \nhaving no personal agenda--no goal but the goal of the best interests \nof the institution; no calling but the calling of doing his utmost to \nsee that the Senate remains true to its constitutional mandate. He must \nbe trusted by both sides.\n  Such an individual must be steeped in the Senate's history and \ntraditions. He or she must understand intuitively not only the rules \nand precedents but also the underlying principles which they seek to \nprotect and the pitfalls they seek to avoid. His must be a calling and \na commitment. His must be a labor of love.\n  It is heavy, heavy lifting--not a job for a faint heart or a faint \nintellect.\n  Benjamin Disraeli once observed that, ``Individualities may form \ncommunities, but it is institutions alone that can create a nation.'' \nThe Senate is the one institution in that constellation of \ninstitutional stars that comprise the universe of a Representative \ndemocracy which is designed to protect the rights of the minority. The \nright of unlimited debate and the right to amend are prima facie \nevidence of the Senate's raison d'etre.\n  Unlike the House of Representatives, unlike the Judiciary, the Senate \nalone guarantees that the minority will be heard, and will have the \nopportunity to alter the course of events.\n  In the Senate, when we speak of the minority of the membership, we \nalso speak of the minority of the States.\n  The Parliamentarian and his rulings are key to guarding those rights \nand preventing the Senate from losing its purpose. Remember, majorities \nchange, and it is in the interests of both political parties to have an \nindependent, experienced keeper of the Senate's historical and \nconstitutional mandate.\n  There must never, ever be a majority or a minority parliamentarian. \nAs difficult as it may be in such times as these, we must all work \ntogether to strive to avoid the crass politicization of that critical \noffice. Such an event, were it ever to occur, would be a nail in the \ncoffin of the United States Senate. We must not travel down that road, \nno matter how tempting such a path may be. Expediency must never become \nthe watchword of the Parliamentarian.\n\n  I have given most of my life to this institution of the Senate. To me \nthis is hallowed ground. This Chamber is a sanctuary. To me the \nprotection of the liberty of the people rests squarely on these old \nfloors. I speak not as a member of any political party today. I speak \nonly, as I hope I am, as a faithful steward of this grand and glorious \ninstitution. I hope that we all can come together in a spirit of true \nbipartisanship to reject any tendency to use the office of \nParliamentarian as a tool for partisan advantage.\n  To guard against such a possibility, I urge that any decision to \nremove or replace a Parliamentarian be the joint decision of both \nLeaders.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, might I say to the distinguished \nSenator, with reference to this place, that while I can't claim to have \nspent as much of my life as you, it seems almost forever. It has been \n29 years for me. It has been\n\n[[Page S4560]]\n\na long time since I first met you. You had been here a long time before \nyou met the Senator from New Mexico. But I have 29 years of activity \nhere of seeing how things are done.\n  This is a rather unique institution--unique in the very best sense of \nthe word. You really have to be part of it for a while. You can't just \nread a history book. Many political scientists have written about it, \nbut none have really captured what it is.\n  What you say about trust and comity is very right. There is no doubt \nabout it. When people ask you how it runs, you say by rules. But by \nunanimous consent, a lot of the time, Senators can agree. A lot of \ntimes they are not here when agreements are entered into. Leadership \ndoes that. That is just one example. Everybody trusts them. They trust \nus who are doing it. We put together a unanimous consent, or my good \nfriend, the ranking member, did, and it sounds right to both sides. \nEverybody thinks we are not going to cut them out or improperly agree \nto something. But we run that way.\n  Unanimous consent is an interesting word. It means a lot of comity, a \nlot of trustworthiness between individual Members.\n  I am not as acquainted with the history, but I have known a number of \nthose who are mentioned.\n  But you took to the floor talking about this great institution of \nAmerica, and about its moving forward. I thank you.\n  When I talked about whether your time should come off the resolution \nand about whether you had 15 minutes or an hour, whatever you needed, \nyou got.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New \nMexico, my friend.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/09/senate-section/article/S4560-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4560-S4581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2002--CONFERENCE \n                           REPORT--Continued\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, so Members on our side of the aisle \nunderstand, I want to say that we are going to go on this evening \nbecause there is kind of a gentleman's agreement that we are going to \nuse up most of the time tonight; that is, most of the 10 hours allowed, \nand set a small amount aside tomorrow just before the vote. I am not \ndictating that. I am merely saying under the rules we can stay here \nuntil the 10 hours are used tonight. I hope we don't use all of it. I \ndon't intend to do so. But if there are Senators who would like to \nspeak, and for whatever reason they want to talk about one portion of \nthis budget, they want to talk about defense, they want to talk about \ntaxes, we have time. I don't have anyone planning at this time to \naddress the Senate.\n  I want to make a couple of comments, however, before I move to the \nother side to see if Senator Conrad has additional speakers. I want to \ntalk about a habit we get into, depending upon what we have been saying \nand how we have been acting in the past. But, essentially, there were \nsome comments about what the tax bill would look like and how one part \nof this institution--to wit, Republicans--were for the rich. I assume \nby that they meant that the other party is for the poor. But, in any \nevent, I think it would be good for the American people, and those who \nare watching the evolution of a tax bill pursuant to this budget \nresolution, to know who is going to make the decision about the tax \nbill. So give me a moment while I tell everyone who is going to make \nthat decision.\n\n  The makeup of that bill--that $1.25 trillion over 11 years and the \n$100 billion that is going to go back to the American taxpayers this \nyear and next year--is not decided or determined by this budget \nresolution. It tells them how much to do. But the Finance Committee of \nthe Senate decides what are the cuts.\n  I believe it will serve a purpose to read their names. Then people \ncan think about them as a group, and then remember that at least 11 of \nthem have to agree. Frankly, I believe it is a very representative \ngroup. I believe it represents the various philosophical and \nideological attitudes of Senators from both sides of the aisle, and \neven subgroups between it as to Senators.\n  So let me start: The chairman is Senator Charles Grassley of Iowa; \nthe ranking member is Senator Max Baucus of Montana. Senator Orrin \nHatch is second on the Republican side; and Senator John Rockefeller is \nthe counterpart on the Democrat side. Senator Frank Murkowski is a \nRepublican; and Senator Tom Daschle, the minority leader, is a \nDemocrat. Senator Don Nickles is a Republican; Senator John Breaux is a \nDemocrat. Senator Phil Gramm is a Republican; Senator Kent Conrad, who \nhas been speaking here about the budget, is a Democrat; Senator Trent \nLott, a Republican, was also here speaking about the budget; Senator \nBob Graham of Florida; Senator James Jeffords of Vermont; Senator Jeff \nBingaman of New Mexico; Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee; Senator \nJohn Kerry of Massachusetts; Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine; Senator \nRobert Torricelli of New Jersey; Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona; Senator \nBlanche Lincoln of Arkansas.\n  All I want everybody to know is they are going to decide what the tax \ncuts are. They are going to decide who benefits over the next 11 years \nand how we give people back money in an urgent manner this year and \nnext year.\n  Frankly, I believe if we were to decide we wanted a well-balanced \ncommittee, that clearly would make its own decisions based upon very \nbig differences of opinion, that is what you would have. Those would be \nthe Senators. And more than half--half plus one--must agree on what is \nthe tax plan.\n  I am not fearful they are going to bias this result in favor of the \nrich against the poor or they are going to bias it in some way that is \nnot common to the desires of this place we call the Senate. I do not \nsee how they could and expect it to be adopted.\n  So after all the words are finished about who is going to be helped \nby the tax bill, let me say, no matter what we say in this Senate \nChamber in a budget resolution, no matter what we agree to, no matter \nwhat we are accusatory about, that group of Senators, with a simple \nmajority required--which means one more than half--will decide what is \nthe tax bill.\n  Having said that, I want to speak for a moment and then I will yield \nthe floor. I will be pleased, once again, before we finish, to wrap up \non what is in this budget and how we got there and how it will be \nimplemented.\n  I believe it is a good budget. If one were to look at a previous \nbudget and determine that we wanted to look at every single item in it, \nand analyze it, and take it to the floor and talk about what should \nhave been done versus what somebody else would do, sure, it is subject \nto others looking at it and saying: We would have done it differently. \nBut I say, whatever the adjectives are that have been used to describe \nit, it is an honest budget. It may not be what some want, and it may \nnot answer questions the way some would want them answered, but it is a \nwell-intentioned, honest, honorable budget.\n\n  I am hopeful that those who helped us get where we are will help us \nget the vote tomorrow and let the Congress, with the President, decide \nwhat is going to happen during the next 8 or 9 months.\n  For those who are concerned about Social Security or Medicare, let me \nrepeat, on the Medicare side, we have set aside $300 billion that can \nbe used for Medicare reform and for prescription drugs.\n  How well did we do? The House had $146 billion. They went to our \nnumber of $300 billion--a pretty good compromise. We won. They gave up. \nWe have a lot more available if we get a bill.\n  With reference to farms in America, and the farm program, which \nclearly, for some reason or another, requires that we supplement the \nmoney that would come under the existing law every year by way of \nemergencies and the like, we have put in a number for the next decade \nthat uses $5 billion in the first year, $80 billion over a baseline \nthat would be the law as we have it implemented on the books. The House \neven asked that we put in more than we had passed which had received \nvery broad bipartisan support.\n  If you look at education--we will prepare, before we close, a \nseparate chart about it, but I want to repeat, the special ed program \nof the United States is going up $1.25 billion year over year. I\n\n[[Page S4561]]\n\nknow that is not enough for some, but it is a pretty good sum of money \nfor others. The rest of the programs in education, those within the \ncontrol of the appropriators, surely some that are not real education \nwill come down, but essentially the rest of education will go up 11 \npercent.\n  People can say that isn't enough and there are other programs in \nthere that should go up, but let me suggest, as I started today, when \nmight it be right to give the taxpayers back some of this surplus? I \nthink it is now. I think that is what the vote is going to be about: Do \nwe want to really seriously give back to the American taxpayers some of \nthis surplus tax money? And if not now, with a $5.6 trillion surplus, \nthen when? That is what we are trying to do.\n  We are very grateful we had bipartisan support, albeit it reduced the \ntax number from $1.6 trillion, which the President wanted, to $1.25 \ntrillion, plus $100 billion in stimulus this year and next year, which \nwould go into the pockets of American working men and women, those who \ninvest, small businesspeople, and the like.\n  The President did not get all he wanted. Republicans did not get all \nthey wanted. We came to the floor with a budget resolution with $1.6 \ntrillion. I just told you what we ended up with.\n  Let me also say that when it comes to defense, some have continued to \nspeak about this as if we gave a blank check to the military. I want to \nrepeat, what should we have done when there was almost bipartisan \nconcurrence that the President's top-to-bottom review, if it were going \nto be credible, should ask us to do some things differently but we did \nnot know what they were, and we could not have them for 4 or 5 months. \nWould we have said, let's wait around and do another budget resolution \nfor defense? I do not think so. So we said, let's use the President's \nnumber for this year, which is a low number, I acknowledge. Then let us \nsay, subject to appropriations when the President is finished, we can \nput his number in and see what the appropriators want to do but not \nmore than the number he recommends.\n  I guess we could have done it differently. There are a number of ways \nto do it, but I do not think it is a blank check because I think \nCongress has to vote on it, on any additions above his request, which \nis a very meager request for this year.\n  I want to also close by saying that I think, because some Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle insisted we do something in the field of \nhealth care for the uninsured, we did something.\n  We have an additional $28 billion over and above the current programs \nfor the uninsured, thanks to Senator Smith and Senator Wyden, on which \nthe House had zero. They conceded and said OK. We also have home health \ncare which one of our Senators championed, Senator Collins, with \nsupport. We put in $13 billion to complete it over the decade with the \nincreases instead of the cuts currently contemplated. In the conference \nthey said: We should have give and take. They gave us the whole number \nand conceded that we could proceed on that front.\n  Then there is the bill of Senator Grassley and Senator Kennedy, the \nFamily Opportunity Act. We went into conference with nothing on that. \nWe came out with $9 billion on top of the other items for just that \nprogram. The House gave in and gave us the whole thing.\n  We had some great successes in the direction of championed causes \nthat came from the Senate to the Senate budget resolution, to \nconference, and back to us intact.\n\n\n                        agriculture reserve fund\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to thank Senator Domenici for all \nhis efforts helping to bring about this historic conference agreement \non the fiscal year 2002 budget resolution, H. Con. Res. 83. The \nagreement's reserve fund for agriculture, Section 213, provides the \nAgriculture Committee with mandatory spending authority totaling $66.15 \nbillion over fiscal year 2003-2011 in addition to the current law \nbaseline to support the Agriculture Committee's work to formulate a new \nmulti-year farm bill.\n  I want to make certain that there is full agreement and understanding \nas to how the Budget Committee will interpret the reserve fund for \nagriculture on a couple of key points. First, I understand that the \n$66.15 billion in new mandatory spending authority over fiscal year \n2003-2011 will be available to support reauthorization, modification, \nextension, expansion, and innovation concerning any or all titles of \nthe Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996. FAIR Act \ntitles are the Agricultural Market Transition Act, Agricultural Trade, \nConservation, Nutrition Assistance, Agricultural Promotion, Credit, \nRural Development, Research, Extension and Education, and \nMiscellaneous. Is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, Senator Lugar's understanding is correct. Section \n213 is intended to give the Agriculture Committee the flexibility to \nuse this additional mandatory spending authority in the ways the \nSenator mentioned, if it so chooses in reporting a new farm bill.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator. I also understand that the Joint \nExplanatory Statement of the Committee of Conference which accompanies \nthis conference agreement suggests that the agriculture reserve fund's \n$66.15 billion be divided among two budget functions--$63 billion for \nagriculture (budget function 350) and $3.15 billion for natural \nresources and environment (budget function 300). It is my understanding \nthat the conference agreement permits the Agriculture Committee to \nspend more or less in each of these functional areas when it reports \nout a new farm bill as long as the $66.15 billion total is not exceeded \nover the specified time period. Is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Yes, the Senator's understanding is correct.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I thank the Senator for clarifying these key points.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I hope on our side, if anyone wants to \nspeak, they will let me know. I will be here and try to reserve time. \nThe Democrats can go with one Senator. Then we go with one. In the \nmeantime, if there is none, I will tell Senator Conrad he can have as \nmany Senators as he wants in a row if he wants to line some of them up. \nIf I don't hear from our side,I may agree in advance with Senator \nConrad.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we have Senator Dorgan ready to go for 20 \nminutes and then Senator Sarbanes. If we could put those two in at this \npoint, that would be helpful to moving the process along.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Let's agree now so they will know where they are.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Twenty minutes for Senator Dorgan, and Senator Sarbanes \nonly requested 10.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Senator Dorgan is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank Senator Conrad.\n  What I would like to do at the beginning is to ask a few questions \nand see if I can get some information from Senator Conrad. It is \ninteresting to me, we now have this budget agreement on the floor of \nthe Senate. We have a Senate that is divided 50/50--50 Democrats, 50 \nRepublicans, elected by the American people to come and serve. We have \na Budget Committee, and that Budget Committee worked and produced a \nbudget. We had a vote on the floor. Then we had a conference between \nthe Senate and the House.\n  I ask Senator Conrad whether, as the ranking Democrat on the Budget \nCommittee of the Senate, he was part of the conference. Was he, along \nwith the other Democrats, part of the budget conference which produced \nthis conference report?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No. What happened was, we had an initial meeting in which \nstatements were made, the opening statements that are traditionally \ndone in any conference. Then we were invited not to return. So this is \na budget that has been written wholly by the other side of the aisle.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I further ask the Senator, isn't it the \ncase that at the start of this year we heard all of this talk about, \n``this is a new day, a new approach; we are all going to work together, \nhave a great deal of bipartisanship; we are not going to do things like \nwe used to do them''?\n  Isn't it the case that when you have a 50/50 Senate and you have a \nBudget Committee that is 50/50, equal membership on each side, and then \nyou have a\n\n[[Page S4562]]\n\nconference but only one side is invited to the conference, that that \nsomehow sounds like the old way, sounds like the partisanship we used \nto see? Would the Senator from North Dakota agree with that?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It certainly is not a new way. It is certainly not what \nwe were given to believe we were going to see when the President came \nto town, saying he was a uniter, not a divider. We have seen precious \nlittle of his moving in any way but insisting that it be his way or no \nway.\n  This budget is certainly an example of that. Not only was there no \ninvolvement of our side or any Member of our side in the budget \nconference, there was not even a markup in the Budget Committee--none. \nThere was not even an attempt to mark up a budget resolution in the \nBudget Committee.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The reason I ask the question is I think most people \nwould be very surprised by that. They see a Senate that is 50/50, a \nBudget Committee that has 50 percent of its membership Democrats, 50 \npercent Republican. Then you go to a conference, and the Democrats are \ntold they are not welcome. The American people would be mighty \nsurprised by that.\n  Let me ask a couple other questions because this is a very important \narea. I want to try to understand it. I heard the chairman of the \nBudget Committee talk about this conference report with respect to \ndefense. He said: This is not a blank check with respect to defense. He \nsaid: What we have done is we have created a circumstance where \nwhatever number the President would ask us for will be ``subject to \nappropriation.'' In other words, we don't have the right number in \nhere. Whatever it is the President wants, he is going to get, subject \nto appropriation.\n  I ask Senator Conrad, is there any other area of this budget that is \ntreated quite that way? For example, have they decided that for \neducation we won't put the right number in, whatever somebody else \nwants at some point, subject to appropriation? Is there any other area \nthat is treated quite that generously?\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. No, not to my knowledge. I find it really rather \nincredible that we have a circumstance in which one person is going to \nbe able to decide the defense budget for the United States--one person \nin the Senate, one person in the House of Representatives. In the \nSenate, the Budget Committee chairman for 1 year will be able to decide \nwhat number goes in, and in the House, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee there can decide for 10 years what the defense budget is \ngoing to be. It is fairly breathtaking.\n  Think about what we read in the textbooks: That we have a \nrepresentative democracy, that every State has two Senators and they \nhave Members of Congress determined by the population of their States. \nThey come here, they vote, and they decide. But in this circumstance, \nwith the Republicans in control of the House and in nominal control of \nthe Senate, because they have the Vice President prepared to break a \ntie, they are in complete control. They are in total control. This is \ntheir document.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Without using all of my time, let me further propound a \nquestion on the subject of debt. I have here the conference report, and \nit says the following with respect to (5), under title I, recommended \nlevels and amounts: (5), public debt, the appropriate levels of public \ndebt are as follows: Fiscal year 2001, $5.660 trillion; 10 years later, \n$6.720 trillion.\n  It looks to me as if we have gross Federal debt increasing by $1.1 \ntrillion with this conference report. Would that be accurate?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator would be correct, if he is on page H1958 of \nthe Congressional Record.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Dated May 8, it shows there the public debt increasing \nduring this period. There has been a lot of talk out here that we are \nreducing the debt. That is true of the so-called publicly held debt, \nthat debt which is held outside of Government coffers, outside of \nGovernment hands. The publicly held debt of the United States as we sit \nhere today is some $3.4 trillion. By the end of this year, it will be \n$3.2 trillion. That is being reduced to the $800 billion referred to by \nthe chairman.\n  But the gross debt, the combination of the publicly held debt and the \ndebt to the trust funds of the United States from the general fund, is \nactually growing.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Further asking a question, that gross debt, the debt that \nis owed to the trust funds, the debt that is a debt that represents a \nliability by Government agencies, is that real debt or is that just a \nnumber someplace? We hear people saying: We can have very large tax \ncuts; that is not a problem; and we are also paying down the debt.\n  I look at this and I see gross debt is increasing by $1.1 trillion. I \njust heard a statement a few minutes ago by a Senator who said: Here is \nwhat we are going to give the taxpayers, referring to tax cuts.\n  Are we also in this budget going to give the taxpayers $1.1 trillion \nin an increase in gross indebtedness in this country during the 10 \nyears?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I don't know of any other way to read it. This chart I \nhave shows the two debts that we have.\n  The debt held by the public is the red line on this chart. The debt \nheld in Government accounts, debt that is owed to the trust funds, is \nthe green line. We see the debt held by the public going down, which is \nwhat has been described by the Senator from New Mexico. We see the debt \nthat is owed to the trust funds going up. And the reason for that is, \nwhat is being done to pay off the publicly held debt is to use the \nsurpluses from the Social Security trust fund--money that is not used \nnow. That money is going to pay down publicly held debt--debt that is \nheld by companies and individuals and other countries that is in U.S. \nsecurities--that debt is being paid down. But it is being paid down by \nusing trust fund surpluses of the United States and, of course, they \nare then owed from the general fund of the United States, the money \nthat has been borrowed from them to pay down the publicly held debt. So \nat the end of this time, the gross debt of the United States--the \ncombined debt--will actually be more than when we started.\n  So I think it is a little misleading for people just to talk about \nthe publicly held debt.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask how much time remains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 11 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the answers to the questions \nI have raised. They are very important questions. I think it suggests \nthat there is false advertising involved here. In the commercial \nsector, we have the Federal Trade Commission that regulates that kind \nof thing, but in politics it cannot be regulated. It seems clear to me \nthat you have a $1 trillion increase in gross indebtedness.\n  If anybody comes to the floor of the Senate--and if they would, I \nwould love to spend time with them, and I will be available--to talk \nabout indebtedness and whether the liabilities incurred by Federal \nagencies and programs that we must meet--whether those are real \nliabilities--and I think they are--then we have an increase in gross \nindebtedness by $1.1 trillion in the next 10 years. At the same time, \nwe have people advertising that there is so much money that we need to \ncreate a huge tax cut, the bulk of which will go to the top 1 percent \nof the taxpayers, and that is fine because we are paying down the debt \nat the same time.\n  That is fundamentally untrue. Gross debt will increase by over a \ntrillion dollars. That is the bottom line. Let's talk about that. I \nwill be here if someone wants to talk about it.\n  Let me talk about this general budget. Here is a budget written in a \nconference by the majority party, telling the minority party: You are \nnot welcome. See you later. We are going to write this. It is true that \nyou have 50 percent of the membership on the Budget Committee, but you \nare not welcome as part of the conference.\n  That is the way it was written. The way it was brought to us is kind \nof a virtual budget, in the sense that it suggests certain things that \nexist that don't exist.\n  I was thinking about the story about raccoons and something raccoons \ndo that is quite unusual. They apparently have a tendency--and I \nwatched this as a kid--when they get their food, to take it to a stream \nand begin to wash it meticulously with their hands. They wash it and \nwash it. But if raccoons find something to eat and there is no water \naround, they still walk away and\n\n[[Page S4563]]\n\npretend there is water, and they do the same actions with their hands, \npretending they are washing. Somehow it makes them feel they have done \nthe right thing.\n\n  We have kind of a pantomime activity in this budget like the \nraccoons, I guess. We believe if we pantomime it, somehow people will \nbelieve it. Let me talk about what this pantomime is about. Education. \nWe have replaced the Elementary and Secondary Education Act on the \nfloor of the Senate--that is what we were debating--with this budget \nconference report. In the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we \nhave made commitments as a Senate. We have said we commit ourselves to \neducation. We, by the way, are going to require accountability. We are \ngoing to insist on accountability, and we have a whole series of things \nto do that.\n  We want better schools and we also say, by the way, we are willing to \nauthorize funding to pay for those schools--at least to pay for the \nimprovement of those schools. We know most of the funding for schools \ncomes from State and local governments and school boards. We know that, \nbut we provide some important niche funding.\n  We have said we insist on accountability and we want to improve this \ncountry's schools and we commit ourselves to authorizing the funding to \ndo it.\n  Then we bring a budget conference report to the floor of the Senate \nand say, no; I know we committed ourselves, but we are not going to pay \nfor it. We are going to require these things, but we will not pay for \nit. Talk about unfunded mandates.\n  I have been around here year after year when we have had people \nstanding on the ceiling talking about unfunded mandates, how awful that \nis. Well, the fact is, we are, in the underlying bill--the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act--going to make certain representations \nabout what we expect of schools and what we are going to do to help \nthem; and then in this budget we say, by the way, we didn't mean that. \nThat was kind of a virtual argument we made. That is kind of the \nraccoon washing without water--a pantomime. We didn't really mean that.\n  This budget would have been a much better budget had that conference \nbeen able to get the best ideas that everyone had to offer. We work \nbetter, it seems to me, when we take the ideas from all sides and try \nto find out what works and what doesn't, who has a good idea and who \ndoesn't, gather all the ideas, make it a competition of ideas. That is \nnot what happened. The reason it didn't happen that way is because we \nhad a mission at the start by the President and majority party--I \nshould say the majority party, Republican Party, which has 50 votes in \nthe Senate. They said: We want a $1.6 trillion tax cut, which got \nshaved a little bit. We insist on that and we are going to try to make \neverything else fit in that format.\n  Well, it doesn't fit. They know it; we know it; everybody knows it. \nIn fact, the gross debt is going to go up $1.1 trillion, even as we \nshortchange schools and give a blank check to defense. Can you imagine \na city council doing this? Voters would run them out of town. Can you \nimagine a family making these choices? It doesn't make any sense. It is \nthe wrong way to do business. It is the wrong result. It is not giving \nanything to the American taxpayers except a future in which we \nunderfund the most important things that exist in this country's \nfuture--educating our children.\n  We underfund a range of areas that are very important to this \ncountry, including agriculture, which is critically important to my \nState. At the same time, we provide substantial room for a very large \ntax cut, at the very time that our economy is softening, and the tax \ncut is going to spend surpluses that don't yet exist. It anticipates 10 \nyears of straight surpluses at a time when our economy is beginning to \nhave significant troubles, when yesterday productivity was down for the \nfirst time in some long while, and we know and everybody should know \nthat we will not likely have 10 straight years of surpluses. I hope we \ndo. I wish we would. But we may not.\n\n  If we don't, this $1.1 trillion in increased gross debt in the budget \nwill balloon and grow, and we will find ourselves back in the same \ncircumstance we were in during the late 1980s and early 1990s, with a \nmushrooming budget deficit strangling the economy of this country and \ndriving up interest rates and causing economic havoc.\n  We worked long and hard to get back to a point where we had a \nbalanced budget. That wasn't easy to do. We ought to have a budget that \ncomes to the floor of this Senate that represents the priorities of a \n50/50 Senate and priorities of the American people, and one that \ndoesn't undercut the opportunity for this economy to grow and expand \nand produce new jobs and new economic opportunity.\n  Now, this budget was not prepared the right way and it didn't come \nout with the right answer for this country's future. It is a partisan \ndocument, produced by people who excluded half of the committee from \nthe room, and then said to us: We are going to be true to the \nPresident's mission by bringing a document to the floor of the Senate \nthat you didn't help write on the other side of the aisle because we \nwould not let you. Now we insist that you accept our representations of \nwhat it contains.\n  We don't accept that. My colleague, Senator Conrad, describes it very \naccurately. This issue about added money for education is a mirage, \njust a myth. I will give you one example.\n  We have a huge energy problem in this country and we have folks \ncutting research for renewable energy by 40, 50 percent. That is a \nsmall example but an important one. It represents all of the wrong \npriorities.\n  We can do much better than this. I hope we will turn this conference \nreport down and say, look, we have a Budget Committee that has half \nDemocrats, half Republicans. Let's get the best ideas that each has to \noffer. Politics doesn't have to produce the worst of both. You can get \nthe best of each, and it seems to me that we could go back and do this \nin a week or 2 and come up with an approach that, yes, has a tax cut--I \nsupport a tax cut--but not one that crowds out all other opportunities \nfor investing in matters of importance to the country; one that makes \nthe right investments in education; one that says schools for our \nchildren are important and we intend to hold them accountable. But we \nalso do intend to help them and to meet our promises to those kids. We \nneed one that says let's fix our energy problem but not cut back on \nrenewable energy research, for example to contribute to solving our \nenergy problem.\n  We have a whole series of opportunities. We ought not to be wringing \nour hands and gnashing our teeth and wiping our brow about this. This \nrepresents an opportunity. We live in a time and place that is a \nblessing. We have an opportunity to do the right thing. I fear at this \npoint that if this Senate passes this conference report, it moves this \ncountry in the wrong direction.\n  Let's do it over and do it right. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMaryland is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, because I know he has a pressing \ncommitment, I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I yield him 2 minutes out of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  I voted for the original budget resolution a month or so ago. I did \nso because I believe we ought to cut taxes and cut marginal tax rates, \neliminate the marriage penalty, and provide estate tax relief. I would \nlike to see us increase the child tax credit.\n  I also voted for a budget resolution that dramatically increased \nFederal funding for education. We are in the throes, last week and this \nweek, of redefining the Federal role in education in this country. Part \nof that legislation says to States: We expect you to narrow the \nachievement gap for all your students over the next 10 years. We expect \nyour students to perform at higher marks, making progress along the \nachievement path toward being able to read well and doing math well.\n  If States, school districts, and schools do not measure up, under the \naccountability provisions of the education bill on which we are \nworking, there is real accountability and real\n\n[[Page S4564]]\n\nconsequences for those schools that do not measure up, that do not make \nprogress, and that do not narrow the achievement gap.\n  Meanwhile, in our Nation's Capital, we fund one out of every three \nchildren for Head Start. We do not provide for the others.\n  We fund one out of every three kids who are eligible for title I \nfunding. These are kids who need extra help, especially in reading and \nmath.\n  For special ed students, we meet one-third of what we promised to \nfund. We are supposed to be providing 40 percent. We do about 13 \npercent. We are pretty good at thirds.\n  We had hoped the budget resolution that came back to us would meet \nsome of those shortcomings. It does not. Regrettably, there is not more \nmoney for Head Start, there is precious little more money for title I, \nand there is precious little more money to meet our obligations under \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n  I cannot support this conference report on the budget resolution. I \nwish I could, but I cannot.\n  This is what I fear we are going to end up doing. I fear we are going \nto end up cutting taxes more than we ought to and, in the end, come \nback and say we are spending more money than we can afford. We went \ndown that path in 1981, and my fear is we are going to go right down \nthat same path in 2001.\n  We do not have to do it. The real tragedy is we could have had a \nbroad bipartisan agreement on a tax cut of a trillion dollars. We could \ninvest in education, defense, and needed investments in health care, \nand we could have had a bipartisan majority do that. My fear is we are, \nin the end, shortchanging the States, the schools, and the kids about \nwhom we say we care so much.\n  I wish it did not have to be this way. Unless we defeat this budget \nresolution tomorrow, it will be.\n  I, again, thank the Senator from Maryland for yielding me this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in very strong opposition to the \nconference report pending before us. Unfortunately, this budget falls \nfar short of the mark in almost every respect.\n  We had just a brief meeting of the conference committee in which the \nDemocrats participated. We were excluded from everything else that took \nplace. I said then that I thought we were at a crossroads in \nconsidering this budget; that I thought we had a historic opportunity \nbefore us if we made wise decisions, and that I was fearful we were \ngoing to lose that opportunity. This conference report bears out that \nfear.\n  If we pass this misguided budget, I have no doubt that in a few years \nwe will all be put in mind of the words of John Greenleaf Whittier, who \nwrote:\n\n       For of all sad words of tongue or pen,\n       The saddest are these: ``It might have been.''\n\n  We are throwing away a magnificent opportunity to develop a sane, \nrational fiscal policy for the Nation which will help to deal with a \nwhole series of problems. We have this unparalleled opportunity to pay \ndown the Nation's debt, to invest in our Nation's future, and to shore \nup vital programs. If we act prudently, we can ensure that the Federal \nGovernment will have the resources in the future to meet our \nobligations after the baby boomers retire and beyond. We can do a \nreasonable tax cut in response to the problems confronting working \nfamilies all across the Nation, and we can do this all in a very \nbalanced way.\n  Instead, because of this excessive zeal for a massive tax cut, we \nrisk knocking our economy off track and sending ourselves back into the \ndeficit ditch from which we have only recently emerged.\n  The budget outlined in this conference report would squander our best \nchance for investing in America's future, lifting the debt burden off \nthe next generation, and providing a reasonable tax cut for our working \nfamilies.\n  We are constantly told these revenues are the people's money. Of \ncourse they are the people's money. From where else does it come? But \nthe debt is the people's debt. The challenge of educating our children \nis the people's challenge. Providing Social Security and Medicare for \nour seniors is the people's challenge. It all flows from the people.\n  That sort of bumper-sticker comment does not come to grips with the \nreal problems. There are other bumper-sticker comments we can make. \nEvery time they say, ``Well, the tax money is the people's money,'' we \ncan say, ``The debt is the people's debt,'' and on and on.\n  One cannot use a bumper-sticker slogan as a substitute for tough \nanalysis and a real calculation of what serves the Nation's interest.\n  I commend the ranking member of the Budget Committee, the very \ndistinguished Senator from North Dakota, for his terrific leadership \nthrough this budget process. I know how frustrating it was. He \ncontinually implored the chairman of the committee to work together to \ndeal with these difficult problems.\n  The Budget Committee, the only committee in the Senate that is \nuniquely focused on the Federal budget, never held a markup. It never \nheld a markup. Thus, the committee was prevented from fulfilling its \nprimary duty of developing a responsible Federal budget. That is what \nthe committee is there for. It was not allowed to do its job.\n  The budget resolution was debated for the first time in this Chamber \nbefore we had even seen the President's detailed budget submission.\n  Of course, others have spoken about how the conference functioned. We \nwere clearly closed out of the conference. In fact, the chairman, at \nthe one meeting they had, said there was going to be a meeting over the \nweekend. I said: ``Mr. Chairman, I didn't quite catch that; when will \nthe meeting be and where,'' preparing myself, of course, to attend the \nmeeting the chairman indicated we were going to have over the weekend.\n  He was very blunt in his response. He said: ``You all are not going \nto be at the meeting. This is not a meeting for you. This is all going \nto be done by the Republican side.''\n  I regret that. I thought the ranking member of the House Budget \nCommittee, Congressman Spratt of South Carolina, a very able Member, \nmade a very eloquent statement about how the product of the conference \nwould be better if it went through a proper conference deliberation. We \nat least would have had the opportunity to get the benefit of thinking \non both sides.\n  That was really brought home when the House last week had to suspend \nits consideration of the budget because they left a couple of pages out \nof the budget document. So much for handling it all on one side.\n\n  Surely if there had been a consultative process, it would have been \npointed out that these pages were missing. But instead, they tried to \nrush this through, staying in until a wee hour in the morning trying to \npass this thing, and all of a sudden they discovered two essential \npages were missing out of the budget document.\n  That led Paul Krugman in the New York Times to write an article which \nI enjoyed called ``More Missing Pages.'' I ask unanimous consent this \narticle be printed in the Record at the end of my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. There is a subheading called ``The Farce is With Us.''\n\n       It was, if you believe the official story, a case of farce \n     majeure: House Republican leaders had to call off Thursday's \n     planned vote on the budget resolution because two pages that \n     were supposed to be in the document were accidentally \n     omitted. . . .\n       Whatever really happened, the fundamental cause of the \n     mishap was that the Republican leadership was trying to pull \n     a fast one--to rush through a huge tax cut before anyone had \n     a chance to look at the details.\n\n  Krugman, in this column, goes on to talk about, in effect, other \nmissing pages in the budget document.\n  Now we have had a little chance to look at the details, and I want to \nask the ranking member, my good friend from North Dakota, a couple of \nquestions. First, on defense, am I correct in understanding that the \nway this document is drawn, there is a blank check for a defense figure \nthat will be filled in later? Is there a defense number coming later \nthat will simply be slugged into the budget?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is correct. This is a budget with many \nmissing pieces. Not only do we have missing pages, we have missing \nnumbers. The defense buildup that the administration will ask for next \nweek, after we\n\n[[Page S4565]]\n\nfinish with the budget, will ask for a massive defense buildup. So they \nhave created a special reserve fund with a black hole in this budget \nthat says whatever they decide later--whatever the President \nrecommends--they can stick into this budget. They will not have a vote \non it. We will sort of have a vote, we will vote now, before we know \nwhat the number is.\n  Mr. SARBANES. What does this budget do about education? We are voting \non education this week, the President says we will not leave any child \nbehind, and everyone is making terrific speeches about education and \nbeating on their chests about education. But to do a lot of these \nprograms, we need resources. What does the budget do on education?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is interesting, it is mostly speeches. All the \nspeeches that were given, all the votes that were cast when we had the \nbudget resolution on the floor, all the money added for education, all \nof it has been taken out.\n  We are in the middle of a budget debate on the floor of the Senate, \nlast week adding $150 billion. Meanwhile, we are passing a budget with \nno new money for education. The President said his top priority was \neducation. The priority is every place but in the budget. There is no \nnew money for education.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Defense is a missing piece; education is a missing \npiece. And this tax cut will create a problem, as I understand it, with \nthe alternative minimum tax. I am told that there is no provision in \nthis budget for alternative minimum tax reform, and that such reform \nmay cost as much as $300 billion over the 10-year-period; is that \ncorrect?\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Unfortunately, the Senator is correct. In fact, the \nalternative minimum tax that affects now 2 million Americans, if the \nPresident's plan is passed, will affect 35 million American taxpayers, \nnearly 1 out of every 4. Just to fix the part of the alternative \nminimum tax caused by the President's tax bill will cost nearly $300 \nbillion.\n  Mr. SARBANES. That $300 billion is not allowed for in the budget?\n  Mr. CONRAD. That is a missing page.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am told that, while there is some adjustment for \ninflation in this budget, there is no adjustment for a growing \npopulation and the additional stress and strain that places on program \nlevels; is that correct? There is no adjustment for population growth, \nwhich we know will happen?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Not only is there no adjustment for population growth, in \ntruth, there is not a full adjustment for inflation. This was done in \nthe dark of the night in one of these closed rooms when none of us was \nable to be there. They actually took out another chunk of money, nearly \n$60 billion, so they don't even have an inflation-adjusted budget.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Imagine that. It is incredible to come out with a \nfiscal program for the country with all these missing pages and \nvanished pieces.\n  This conference report, which provides for this excessive tax cut, is \npremised on a projected surplus, two-thirds of which is in the last 5 \nyears of the 10-year-period. And now we discover that there is no money \nfor education, and the defense figure will rise by who knows how much? \nClearly, it will rise. It will be slugged into this budget. We don't \neven provide for inflation, let alone a growing population, and there \nis no allowance for the alternative minimum tax fix.\n  I ask my friend from North Dakota, given all these missing pages, \nwon't this budget plan eat into the Medicare trust fund and the Social \nSecurity trust fund? I don't see any other way. Once all the pieces are \nput into place, are we not going to be eating into the trust funds?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I think there is no question that is what will happen. \nThere is no question that is why the budget has been presented the way \nit has. They don't want all the numbers put together in one place so we \ncan add them up because it doesn't add up.\n  They have been presented with a difficult problem. They have a budget \nthat does not add up. How do you avoid making that obvious? You avoid \nmaking it obvious by not having all of the elements of the budget in \nthe budget resolution. That is exactly what we have. It is kind of a \nphantom budget. There is the budget we have been presented with, and \nthen there is the real budget. One of them doesn't add up. That is why \nthey don't want to present it to the membership.\n  Mr. SARBANES. It is absolutely irresponsible to be doing the budget \nthis way. I think we are going to pay the price in the years to come. I \nthank my very able colleague for his constant effort to try to get the \nBudget Committee to come to grips with these problems.\n  We have a budget before the Senate based on projections that may \nnever materialize. They made assumptions about growth and productivity \nwhich have been severely undercut by the report of the productivity \nfigures in the first quarter, which failed to grow. They are assuming a \ngrowth of 2.2 percent in productivity as we project out, which is a \nvery unusual growth. Now all of a sudden, we have a first quarter \nfigure that was negative. Imagine what that will do to the surplus \nprojections.\n  We are running the risk, by this excessive tax cut, that we will not \npay down the debt at the rate we could have done. We won't invest in a \nnumber of important programs for the future strength of the country--\neducation, the environment, health care. All will be undercut. There is \nno money here for education because instead, we give an excessive tax \ncut. It will knock the economy off track, and we will lose this \nmagnificent opportunity we had to move forward in a reasonable, \nsensible, and constructive way.\n  I thank the Senator for his leadership. I regret this document before \nthe Senate. I urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 5, 2001]\n\n                           More Missing Pages\n\n                           (By Paul Krugman)\n\n       It was, if you believe the official story, a case of farce \n     majeure: House Republican leaders had to call off Thursday's \n     planned vote on the budget resolution because two pages that \n     were supposed to be in the document were accidentally \n     omitted. Strangely, the two missing pages happened to contain \n     language crucial to the compromise that had persuaded \n     moderates to agree to the budget. Just as strangely, the \n     budget resolution contained only a 4 percent increase in \n     spending--the amount George W. Bush originally wanted, not \n     the 5 percent he had agreed to.\n       Whatever really happened, the fundamental cause of the \n     mishap was that the Republican leadership was trying to pull \n     a fast one--to rush through a huge tax cut before anyone had \n     a chance to look at the details. Now the case of the missing \n     pages has delayed things for a few days. So may I suggest \n     that Congress--and Senate moderates in particular--check \n     carefully around that Xerox machine? You see, there seem to \n     be a few other pages missing from the budget plan.\n       For starters, we seem to be missing the page that factors \n     in the likely cost of a missile defense system. (The page \n     that explains how missile defense will work in the first \n     place is missing from some other document.) Nobody knows how \n     much this system will cost, but few think it will come in \n     under $100 billion.\n       We also seem to be missing the page that explains how the \n     conventional defense buildup being planned by Secretary of \n     Defense Donald Rumsfeld--reports suggest an extra $25 billion \n     per year on weapons systems alone, that is, $250 billion or \n     more over the next decade--is consistent with a budget that \n     makes no room for increases in defense spending beyond those \n     already proposed by the Clinton administration.\n       Then there's the page about prescription drug coverage \n     under Medicare--a solemn pledge by Mr. Bush during the \n     campaign. Everyone in Congress agrees that the $115 billion \n     allotted by the administration is laughably inadequate, that \n     a realistic program would cost hundreds of billions more. But \n     the extra money doesn't seem to be in the budget plan; maybe \n     the missing page explains the discrepancy.\n       Somewhere near the page on prescription drug coverage we \n     might find an explanation of the administration's position on \n     the Medicare hospital insurance surplus--$400 billion that \n     both parties have promised to put in a ``lockbox,'' but which \n     the administration plans to devote to other uses. Presumably \n     there's a missing page that explains why this isn't a naked \n     plan to raid Medicare to pay for tax cuts.\n       Then there's the puzzle of how the administration plans to \n     maintain government services in the face of a growing \n     population while increasing spending no faster than \n     inflation. Either some unspecified drastic cuts are planned \n     or the spending numbers are at least $400 billion too small. \n     I'm sure there's a page somewhere that explains what's going \n     on.\n       Not all the missing pages involve spending. Everyone \n     familiar with the issue knows that the Bush tax cut will \n     cause a crisis involving the Alternative Minimum Tax, causing \n     the much-hated tax to apply to tens of millions of additional \n     taxpayers. The inevitable fix will reduce revenue by at least \n     $300 billion,\n\n[[Page S4566]]\n\n     but there doesn't seem to be any allowance for that revenue \n     loss in the budget. I guess there must be a missing page that \n     explains why.\n       Finally, there's the page on Social Security reform. \n     Because Social Security has been run on a pay-as-you-go \n     basis, with each generation's taxes financing the previous \n     generation's retirement, the system has a huge ``implicit \n     debt''--the money promised to people whose past contributions \n     were used to support their elders. If Mr. Bush wants to \n     partially privatize the system, he must pay off some of that \n     implicit debt; to make his campaign proposal work would \n     require infusing more than a trillion dollars into the Social \n     Security system. But that money isn't in his budget plan. \n     There must be a missing page with some explanation of the \n     omission.\n       Oh, and there's one more page missing: the one that \n     explains why moderates should support a tax cut that, while \n     slightly smaller than Mr. Bush wanted, is still irresponsibly \n     large--and why they should put their names to a budget \n     resolution that is patently, shamelessly dishonest.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the senior Senator from Maryland, one of the most \nsenior Members of the Senate Budget Committee, who has been a strong \nvoice for fiscal responsibility on the Budget Committee of the \nSenate. He is one of the key reasons that we restored fiscal sanity in \n1993 and put us on a program to reduce the deficits, ultimately \neliminate them and start running surpluses.\n\n  I thank the Senator from Maryland who was named as a conferee on the \nbudget because of the respect with which he is held.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thought when I was named as a conferee I would have \nimportant work to do as a member of the conference committee on the \nbudget. As it turned out, there was nothing to do. We went to one \nmeeting. The chairman told us there was nothing for us to do. He said, \nyou are dismissed, you can leave now. Don't bother to come around \nagain.\n  It was an incredible way to do business--an incredible way not to do \nbusiness, to put it more accurately.\n  Mr. CONRAD. It was a disappointing way to do business. I think the \nresult has suffered.\n  I will follow up on the point the Senator made about slower \nproductivity growth. We saw in the first quarter, instead of 1 percent \nincrease, it was negative one-tenth of 1 percent. If we were to have 1 \npercent less productivity growth per year, the projected surplus of \n$5.6 trillion would be reduced to $3.2 trillion. That is the hard \nreality of how dramatically affected the ultimate results are by very \nsmall changes in the assumptions in these forecasts. That is something \nwe should all understand.\n  How much time is the Senator from Illinois seeking?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator from Illinois wishes 15 minutes. The Senator \nfrom Minnesota?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask I follow the Senator from Illinois, just for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for yielding to me.\n  Mr. President, during the course of this presentation, I would like \nto call on the Senator from North Dakota from time to time.\n  Let me thank the Senator from Maryland for coming to the floor. He \nmade an eloquent statement to put in perspective the issue on which we \nnow have to vote. It may be one of the most important votes we will \ncast this year.\n  People say: A budget resolution? What in the world is a budget \nresolution? What does it mean to my family or my business?\n\n  A budget resolution is basically the blueprint which says this is how \nfar we can go and no further under the rules of the Senate and the \nHouse, in spending. So once you put that blueprint in place, when the \nAppropriations Committee sits down to put the spending bills in place, \nthey look to this blueprint, this budget resolution, as does the \nFinance Committee when it looks to the tax consequences of this same \nbudget resolution. So we have to pay careful attention to this \nblueprint.\n  I salute the Senator from North Dakota. I tell you, we are fortunate \non this side of the aisle. In fact, the Senate is fortunate to have a \nman of his ability and commitment in the midst of this debate.\n  I have just spoken to my colleague from Minnesota. I will gladly \nspeak to others and tell them I have been so proud of the job Senator \nConrad has done. He is good at this. He is extremely good at this. I \nnever want to get on the other side of debate with Senator Conrad when \nthere is a row of numbers up on a page because I am going to lose. He \nunderstands them. He doesn't just see the numbers on the page, he sees \nthe policy behind them. He can think beyond the box we are in many \ntimes, to the ultimate impact of some of these decisions.\n  I would like for a moment to reflect on what we have been doing for \nthe last week and a half or 2 weeks on the Senate floor. We have been \ndiscussing the issue which the American people identify as their single \nhighest priority, not just this month or this year, but for all time. \nAt every level, when it comes to local government, State and Federal \nGovernment, their highest single priority is education--education, our \nschools. I often wonder why do we always keep identifying education as \nour biggest issue? I think the reason is fairly obvious. Education \nreally defines this country. Education says we will give you an \nopportunity as a young child to walk into a classroom and prove \nyourself and improve yourself and then be a better person for it.\n  We happen to believe--I do not think it is uniquely American, but we \nsure believe in this country--if you give kids the right opportunity to \nprove and improve themselves, they will succeed. You are looking at \none. My mother was an immigrant to this country. Neither my mother or \nfather went beyond the eighth grade and I stand here on the floor of \nthe U.S. Senate. That is because when I brought home a report card, it \nwas an event in my house. We stopped everything and they pored over the \nnumbers and the letters. They gave me a frown or a smile.\n  A lot of families in America know the same experience. So when we \ncome to the floor of the Senate and debate education, we are debating \nsomething we know personally to be important, and every American family \nwill identify as their single highest priority. So it is no surprise \nDemocrats and Republicans come to the floor and want to stand up and \ntalk about how to improve schools and education.\n  For the last 2 weeks, that discussion has ranged from accountability \nand standards to teacher improvement, the number of kids in a \nclassroom, the quality of the school, the computers and the technology \navailable to our children, how long the school day will last, will we \ngive the kids an adequate lunch, what will we do after school to \nimprove their lives and keep them safe, what are we going to do during \nthe summer months, how can we recruit new teachers. This floor has just \nbeen alive with this debate on both sides and both parties believe they \nare committed to this.\n  The interesting thing is that debate for the last 2 weeks has been an \nimportant debate, but it may not be as important as the bill on the \nSenate budget resolution on which we are about to vote. Let me tell you \nwhy.\n  When I served in the U.S. House of Representatives, I served with a \nCongressman, still there, from Wausau, WI, by the name of David Obey. \nCongressman Obey used to like to take to the House floor and admonish \nhis colleagues for what he called ``posing for holy pictures.'' In \nother words, efforts made by Members of the House--and it applies as \nwell to the Senate--to be on the side of the angels, to put a halo \nabove their heads, to say they were for all the right things.\n  For the last 2 weeks, there has been a lot of debate about education \nand a lot of effort to be on the side of the angels, on the side of \nAmerican families, when it comes to education.\n  But mark my words, all of that debate is worth nothing, absolutely \nnothing, if tomorrow we vote for this budget resolution because this \nbudget resolution which was proffered by the Republicans provides no \nadditional funding for education--none.\n  You look at it and say, How can this be? President Bush came to \noffice. He invited Senator Kennedy and Congressman Miller and all the \nDemocrats. He wrapped his arms around them. He invited them to movies \nand lunch and gave them all nicknames and he said: I\n\n[[Page S4567]]\n\njust love education. I can't wait to make it the linchpin of my \nPresidency.\n  He convinced a lot of people in this town and a lot of people across \nAmerica that he was genuine. But in this town you have to look beyond \nthe holy pictures. You have to look at the facts. When you look at the \nfacts of this budget resolution, you find there is no money there.\n  All the promises have been made: We are going to test the kids year \nafter year after year; we are going to hold them to high standards, as \nwe should; we are going to demand accountability; we are going to want \nthe very best teachers, the very best technology. Then take a look at \nthis budget resolution.\n  I ask the Senator from North Dakota, if I might, if he will answer a \nquestion. I want to make certain it is clear on the record. In the \nbudget resolution before us, House Concurrent Resolution 83, which \nprojects spending over the next 11 years, would the Senator from North \nDakota, having analyzed this, tell me what commitment is being made by \nthe Republican leadership and the Bush administration to new funding \nfor education to improve the schools and the lives of children across \nAmerica?\n  Mr. CONRAD. There is no increase for education beyond simple \ninflation. I think the most honest direct answer that I can give is \nthat there is no real increase for education, period.\n  In addition to that, the pool of money from which education spending \ncomes is actually below inflation. The cuts are going to have to come \nfrom somewhere.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from North Dakota, so there is clarity \non the record: We have been debating for 2 weeks about education on the \nfloor of the Senate. But it is a debate about authorizations and this \nis a debate about a budget resolution.\n  Will the Senator from North Dakota explain the difference, if we say \nwe are going to commit hundreds of millions of dollars to education as \npart of the elementary and secondary education authorization, will that \nmoney then automatically go to the schools and improve the schools for \nour children?\n  Mr. CONRAD. No. The way it works, authorizations mean nothing without \nappropriations. And the money for appropriations is not available \nunless it is made available by the budget resolution.\n  The hard reality here is all of this talk about money for education \nis just that, it is talk. We can pass 100 amendments that say we are \ngoing to provide money for education, but if the money is not in the \nbudget, it does not get allocated to the Appropriations Committee to be \navailable for actual expenditure. We have a lot of great speeches out \nhere, but without the money in the budget resolution, they don't mean \nmuch.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I draw the analogy: For 2 weeks now we \nhave been out on the floor on this education authorization bill. It is \nlike putting the sides of a box into place. You put the sides of a box \ninto place like this. You build up your education box. But then you \nneed a budget resolution because you need the resources to make this \nwork. You look in the box when the budget resolution comes along after \n2 weeks of putting up these sides, and the box is empty. It is empty. \nThere is nothing in here for education. It is a phony box. People need \nto understand that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask the Senator from \nMinnesota, because he has followed this education debate. He and I may \ndisagree to some extent on this. We believe testing is an important \npart of education. It has proven itself in the city of Chicago with our \npublic schools. But if we in fact agree to test students as we have \ndebated for a long time, and don't provide any resources once we have \nidentified the problems those kids are running into so they can improve \ntheir reading and math scores, what kind of situation are we going to \nbe in when we talk about education reform? We will have the standards \nand the testing, but with this budget resolution we will not have the \nmoney to provide good teachers, good resources, and good class time to \nimprove the kids.\n  Is that how the Senator from Minnesota sees it?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. I thank him for \nthe question.\n  This also goes to what the Senator from Maryland says. It is not just \na question of nothing in the box; it is how it affects the lives of \npeople. I am heartbroken. I don't mean to be melodramatic, but I am \nheartbroken about what is going on here because I say to the Senator \nfrom Illinois that it is quite one thing to have our picture taken with \nchildren--we all love to do that; we all love to be in the schools--it \nis quite another thing to make a real investment to help improve their \nlives.\n  The Senator is quite right. If all you do is tell every school and \nevery school district and every State you will have these tests age 3 \nto 13 every year, and you don't provide the resources, and we don't \nlive up to our commitment, in fact we provide a pittance--next to \nnothing--to give them the tools so the teachers and the schools and, \nmost important of all, the children, do you want to know something? \nThis is cruel. It will be cruel and it will be punitive. It will be \ndownright dishonest. It is symbolic politics, with children's lives, at \nits worst.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The President's motto is ``Leave No Child Behind.'' Only \none out of three kids is currently enrolled in Head Start--that early \nlearning experience which gives kids a chance to be successful in the \nclassroom. Only a third of the kids who are struggling in school \nbecause of poverty in their family and circumstances beyond their \ncontrol receive any help whatsoever from the Federal Government. What \nwe are told by the Senator from North Dakota is there are no additional \nfunds; we will still be stuck at one out of three when this is all \nover. I say to the Senator from Minnesota, two out of three kids are \ngoing to be left behind by the Republican budget resolution which we \nare going to be asked to vote for tomorrow.\n\n  I do not know if the Senator sees it that way. We certainly aren't \ngetting the resources necessary to making sure no child is left behind.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I can say to the Senator from Illinois \nthat at least 100 times I have said on the Senate floor you cannot \nrealize a goal of leaving no child behind if you cut budgets. You \ncan't.\n  Again, think about it for a moment. Then I will promise not to take \nmuch time. We are going to start testing these children. Let's have the \nbest test. Let's make sure it is done the right way so you know how \nthese children are doing. Take 8-year-olds. You have two, and one of \nthem has 4 years of schooling--grades 1, 2 and 3, then also \nkindergarten. The other child is probably receiving 7 years of early \nschooling because he came from a family with a lot more income, and you \ncan count on the home. There was all the intellectual stimulation, with \nreading to them, and where there was really good child care. They came \nto kindergarten ready to learn.\n  If you are going to fund Head Start--not at the 50-percent level--and \nEarly Head Start, grades 1 and 2, at the 3-percent level, and that is \nall, do you know what you are measuring with 1- and 2-year-olds when \nyou do these tests? It is poverty. You are not measuring anything else. \nThis is a really critical time. I hope people in the country will \nrealize that.\n  I thank the Senator for his question.\n  This is all about who we are. It is all about priorities and values. \nThis budget reflects the most distorted and perverted values imaginable \nbecause it is Robin-Hood-in-reverse tax cuts, with over 40 percent of \nthe benefits going to the top 1 percent, and not the investment in \nchildren and education.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute, 10 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from North Dakota for 2 additional \nminutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I have no objection. I would like to make sure that \nunder the current time agreement, when the time agreed upon time has \nexpired, the next Senator to speak from our side, Senator Inhofe, has \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, I believe I was in \norder to follow. To give other Senators time, I have had an opportunity \nto speak. So\n\n[[Page S4568]]\n\nif you want to go to the other side after the Senator from Illinois, \nthat is all right.\n  Mr. CONRAD. After the Senator from Minnesota, because he has time, we \nwill give 2 additional minutes to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. With my 3 minutes remaining, Mr. President, let me say to \nmy colleagues and those who are following this debate that I want to \ngive you a political science 101 introductory course on how you can \nevaluate what politicians say and what they mean.\n  Don't pay attention to the words coming out of our mouths because \nmany times we give speeches that may lead you to conclusions that may \nnot be factual. Instead, look at what we do. Read the conference report \nfor H. Con. Res. 83, the budget resolution. Ignore, if you will, some \nof the great speeches and some of the posing for holy pictures on the \nfloor of the Senate and this commitment to education we have heard \nabout for 2 weeks. Instead, look at the budget resolution we will vote \non tomorrow.\n\n  The budget resolution we will vote on tomorrow has no commitment to \nimproving education in America. The speeches notwithstanding, we have \nwalked away from that rhetoric. We have not backed it up with reality. \nWe have not backed it up with facts. We have given our speeches. We \nhave heard the applause. Many of us have been elected and reelected as \neducation Senators. Then tomorrow, watch the rollcall on H. Con. Res. \n83 and find out how many are voting yes or actually voting against any \nincreases in funding for education.\n  Why? Because this White House and this President have a higher \npriority than education. What is it? A tax cut for the wealthiest \npeople in America. President Bush has proposed a tax cut that gives to \npeople making over $300,000 a year a $46,000 tax break. Imagine. You \nhave $25,000 a month coming in, and the President says you need a tax \nbreak.\n  I will tell you who the people are who need a tax break. It is the \nfolks who are paying for gasoline in the Midwest and heating bills \nduring the winter and families struggling to put their kids through \nschool. We need a commitment in this Congress from Democrats and \nRepublicans to get beyond campaign rhetoric and put money into \neducation.\n  This budget resolution does not deserve the vote of those who claim \nto be standing for education.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the Senator from New Mexico wants to go \nto the Senator from Oklahoma; is that correct?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. That is correct.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I wonder if I might have 3 minutes after the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask for 3 minutes now and then 3 minutes for Senator \nWellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to answer the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois who just spoke.\n  We haven't said very much about who is responsible for gasoline \nprices. The fact is we don't have enough electricity for America. But \nto come down here and talk about it as if this President has anything \nto do with it or this budget has anything to do with it is absolutely \nwrong.\n  What happened is the previous President who was in for 8 years--we \ndon't like to be partisan, but he sure wasn't a Republican--did \nabsolutely nothing to give America an energy policy. It was a nothing \npolicy. It finally caught hold and gave us California, giving us higher \nprices for gasoline. And we are going to have to fix it--this Congress \nand this President--because no one did anything about it during the \nlast 8 years.\n\n  I gather Senator Inhofe is next.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for \nyielding.\n  Let me be the first to say, I am not on the Education Committee. I am \nnot on the committees dealing with this resolution. But I have been \nlistening to some of this debate. I feel compelled to at least share \nsome thoughts that I have as someone who does not serve on all these \ncommittees.\n  First, I want to respond to the distinguished Senator from Illinois, \nwho was talking about the tax cuts for the wealthy. I just wish that \nPresident Kennedy were still around so he could hear this debate \nbecause I can remember so well back in the 1960s when we had new \nprograms. I say to Senator Wellstone, they had decided that they were \ngoing to expand into areas, expand into the Great Society.\n  I remember the exact quote, just from memory, of President Kennedy. \nHe said: We have a desperate need for more revenue. We have to have \nmore revenue to take care of some of the needs that we have. He said: \nThe best way to increase revenue is to reduce marginal rates. And he \ndid it. In fact, the tax reduction during the Kennedy administration \nwas twice the reduction that is being advocated by President Bush right \nnow. And it worked. At the end of that period of time, the increase \nalmost doubled over the next 5 years as a result of cutting marginal \nrates.\n  Let's remember some of those rates. They were cutting down the \nhighest rate from 91 percent down to 70 percent. It did stimulate the \neconomy. And it did increase the revenues that came from that. But that \nis not supposed to be the discussion today. The discussion is supposed \nto be on education.\n  The budget resolution that we are talking about provides a total of \n$661 billion in discretionary spending. It provides an additional $6.2 \nbillion above the President's request for nondefense programs. This \n$6.2 billion can be used for additional spending on our domestic \npriorities. Everyone agrees that education is one of these priorities. \nCertainly we have heard the President say this over and over again, \nboth during the campaign and currently.\n\n  At the bare minimum, this resolution will fully fund the President's \nrequest for education, which is an 11.5-percent increase over last \nyear, the largest of all Federal agencies.\n  Just so Senators understand the minimum in education spending they \nwill be voting for if they vote for this resolution, the President's \nrequest will support the highest ever level of funding for the \neducation of disabled children; a $460 million increase for title I, \nincluding a 78-percent increase in the assistance to low-performing \nschools; a $1 billion increase in Pell grants for low-income college \nstudents; $1 billion for new reading programs, a tripling of current \nfunding; $320 million to ensure accountability with State \nassessments; $2.6 billion for quality teachers, a $400 million \nincrease; a 14-percent increase in Impact Aid; doubling funds for \ncharters schools; $472 million to encourage school choice and \ninnovation; a down payment on increasing aid to black and Hispanic-\nserving colleges and universities by 30 percent by 2005; $6.3 billion \nto serve 916,000 children under Head Start; and under the National \nScience Foundation, $200 million for new K-12 math and science \npartnerships.\n\n  In addition to all of the above, we have up to $6.2 billion for \nfurther increases to high-priority education programs, such as IDEA, \ntitle I, class size, school construction, assessments, and reading--\nwhatever priorities emerge from the current debate on ESEA \nreauthorization.\n  For example, the conference report has singled out IDEA as a \nparticular priority, so we say that an additional $250 million should \nbe added to the President's request of $1 billion for grants to States \nto educate disabled children.\n  I listened to the statements in this Chamber where Senators were \nsaying: We have cut every penny of money to strengthen these programs. \nThat is just not true. We are increasing funding. One of the increases, \nas I have listed, is a 14-percent increase for impact aid. That happens \nto be what my amendment did. In looking at impact aid, I think it is \nvery important that we realize this is a part of this program.\n  Back in the 1950s, we established impact aid. This is a program with \nwhich I heartily agree. It said simply that if the Federal Government \ncomes along with either a military base or Indian lands, something that \nthe Federal Government has required to be taken off of the tax rolls, \nthat impact aid should replenish that portion of the money that would \ngo to education. There is not a Senator who would disagree with that. \nHowever, because we are all kind\n\n[[Page S4569]]\n\nof sneaky, and have been over the years, different politicians have \ngone down, since the 1950s, and taken money out of impact aid. So it \ndropped down to about a 20-percent funding level. In my State of \nOklahoma, I have five major military installations. We have a lot of \nIndian land there. It is something where we should live up to the \nobligation that we said we would live up to back in the 1950s and fully \nfund impact aid.\n  I started lasted year, with the help of some Democrats, and virtually \nall the Republicans, saying: Let's go ahead and fully fund impact aid \nover a period of time. I want to do it over 4 years, but it looks as if \nit is going to be closer to 7 years. I had the amendment last year. I \nhave the amendment this year. It has been very popular.\n  I have some letters that I pulled out of a long stack of letters \ncoming from the various States. I know the Senator from North Dakota \nhas been in this Chamber talking about it. I have a letter from the \nsuperintendent of Garrison Public School district in Garrison, ND, \nsaying:\n\n       Again, thank you for taking on the challenge of putting \n     Impact Aid on a time line that hopefully will get it to a \n     point where the federal obligation of full funding is \n     realized.\n\n  That is from Garrison Public School district in North Dakota.\n  Here is one from the Minot public school system in North Dakota:\n\n       The amendment you offered on the Senate floor to the Fiscal \n     Year 2002 Budget Resolution is appreciated by federally \n     connected school districts all across the country.\n\n  We have another one from Cass School District 63. They are in \nIllinois. I know that the Senator from Illinois has been talking about \nthis. The superintendent writes: Thank you for doing this.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that those three letters be \nprinted at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. I guess what I am saying is, we have letters from every \nState saying this is something that should be done.\n  This budget resolution stays on line to ultimately fully fund the \nimpact aid.\n  I want to share an experience that I am going to abbreviate because I \nknow we are short on time. I do not have that much time.\n  I was having a townhall meeting in Frederick, OK. Frederick, OK, is \nin the southern part of the State. At the meeting, I noticed on the \nsign-in sheet--I know the Senator from North Dakota and Senators from \nall the other States have townhall meetings. People sign in so we know \nwhere they are from.\n  There were two ladies there in Frederick, OK, who were from Texas. I \nsaid: I am glad to have you ladies here. You are certainly welcome to \nstay; however, I am a Senator from Oklahoma. I don't have a lot of say \nabout what goes on in the State of Texas. They said: No, we want to be \nhere because we want to give a testimonial. These two ladies stood up \nand they said: We are Democrats. We are very strong supporters of the \nNEA. When Governor Bush came out with some new programs we were \nviolently opposed to them because they deviated from the programs we \nhave been used to. The values have been increased. And we decided, \nsince we were leading the opposition to what Governor Bush was trying \nto do in Texas, we would now come up here and say to you, in every \nplace we can, that we were wrong, because essentially what we have been \ndoing--and what I hear a lot of these Democrats over here talking \nabout--is taking a failed system, a system that has not worked, and \njust pouring more and more money into it.\n  The criticism I hear on this budget is that we are trying to pour on \nmore and more money without making major changes. I think we ought to \nhave vouchers. We ought to do a lot of things we are not doing. At \nleast we are trying some things that are new and different. That is \nwhat President Bush was doing when he was Governor Bush in the State of \nTexas.\n  These two ladies, these Democrats came up to make their testimonial \nat my public hearing in Frederick, OK. They said: What he has done is \ntry new things. It is having a huge, positive impact on the quality of \neducation, on testing in the State of Texas.\n  We need to try something new and innovative, and we are.\n  I will share an experience. Some of these things that are new and \ninnovative really go back and latch on to things that have been \ndiscarded over a period of time. I happen to have four children and \neight grandchildren. Back when my kids were young, I can remember \ncoming home after I had been out of town. My older son at that time, \nJimmy, who is now in his forties, was 7 years old or something like \nthat. He came up to me and he had a smile across his face. I said: \nJimmy, you look like something good happened.\n  He said: Yes, you know, daddy, I am in the fourth grade.\n  I said: Yes, Jimmy, I know that.\n  He said: Did you know that in reading and in arithmetic I am in the \nfifth grade?\n  I said: No, how does that work?\n  He said: Well, it is something that is brand new and innovative. What \nthey do is, if you excel in one particular area, they move you up a \ngrade so you can compete with those who are at your level, and you are \nnot down there competing with someone who is at a lower level. He said: \nIt is brand new and innovative.\n  I said: That is really great, Jimmy.\n  Then I remembered back. I always remember the timeframe of this \nbecause it was during the bombing of Pearl Harbor. I happened to be \ngoing to a country school. It was called Hazel Dell. And in this school \nthere were eight grades in one room. There was a big potbellied, wood-\nburning stove. The school master's name was Harvey Bean, a giant of a \nman, I thought. Probably he wasn't all that big after all, if I were to \nmeet him again today, if he were still alive. But I remember that they \nhad eight grades in one room.\n  The first row was for the first grade; second row for the second \ngrade, on up. So my brother was in the second row. I was in the first \nrow. My sister was in the eighth row at this country schoolhouse called \nHazel Dell. Every time you missed a spelling word, you would have to go \nup in front of the class and Harvey Bean and you would have to bend \nover. He had a big wooden paddle and he would swat you.\n  I tell my colleagues, I was the best speller in the first row. And so \nI was moved up to the second row so I could spell with the second \ngraders, with my brother and some of the rest of them. So that program \nthat my son called brand new and innovative was alive and well back in \nthe early 1940s.\n  I understand in the State of Texas some of these things that they \nhave tried that deviate from what we are trying to do now is just going \nback and getting things that worked in the past. I have to say that \nthis President is going to do things that are new and innovative. He is \ngoing to try things that haven't been tried before. Our system has not \nworked. Our test scores have not gone up. Rather than just pour more \nmoney on a failed system, we need to try these things that worked in \nTexas. I think they are going to work in our Nation.\n  It is high time we try something new and that we get in a position \nwhere we can actually compete now with some of these other industrial \nnations.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                       Garrison Public School,\n\n                                     Garrison, ND, April 23, 2001.\n     Hon.

Let me say to the Senator, I appreciate his comments. \nIt is good to have somebody who understands the overarching activities \nthat this budget resolution provides, and his constant concern about \noverspending and his concern about the taxpayers has been evident from \nthe day he arrived. I am very pleased because we need to get this \nfinished so we can start down the path of finishing the year, working \nwith a President who is going to try to help us get a tax bill that is \nrepresentative of the Senate.\n  People keep talking about a rich man's bill. Before you arrived, I \nread the names of the members of the Finance Committee. I think you \nknow it has had a lot of changes of late, but clearly they will produce \na tax bill. It is going to be representative of this Senate. It is not \ngoing to be one little faction's bill because of the makeup. So that is \ngoing to be a good thing. That will prove out the contentions in the \nChamber about rich versus poor and what kind of tax cuts we do.\n  Clearly, it is going to have a marriage penalty. Clearly, it will \nhave some rate reductions. Clearly, it is going to have childcare \ncredits. However they do that, they are going to be there for American \nfamilies with children. Obviously, there is going to be some estate tax \nreform of significance because we have already voted on that.\n  Mr. INHOFE. If the Senator will yield, particularly in western \nOklahoma, when I have my townhall meetings, these farmers out there, \nthey work 7 days a week. They are not wealthy people. For 13 townhall \nmeetings in a row in western Oklahoma, at least one person stood up and \nsaid: Our family farm has been in our family now for three generations. \nWe won't be able to do it anymore because maybe on paper, maybe on the \nIRS evaluation it is worth $1 million but not to us.\n  Then when all the corporate farms are buying up this land, 25 cents \non the dollar, that is the greatest thing we could do for the farmers. \nIt is not just in Oklahoma. I am sure it is in New Mexico and North \nDakota, too.\n  Lastly, I hope you didn't miss the point, it was not a Republican but \na Democrat who observed that the best way to increase revenues is to \nhave marginal tax reductions. That was President Kennedy.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Joined by Dr. Alan Greenspan, saying that is the best \nthing for the American economy. I thank the Senator and yield the \nfloor.\n  What would the Senator like to do next?\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time would the Senator from Iowa like?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Fifteen minutes, maybe.\n  Mr. CONRAD. And the Senator from Florida?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Fifteen.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I wonder, could we give 12\\1/2\\ to both? Would that be \nall right? At this point we are starting to run out of time.\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is fine.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield the Senator from Iowa 12\\1/2\\ minutes and I yield \nthe Senator from Florida 12\\1/2\\. And can we lock that in at this \npoint?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will do that. If we have no Senators to go on our \nside, they can go sequentially, the two of them? That is our unanimous \nconsent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Inhofe). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I understand I have been yielded 12\\1/2\\ \nminutes. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for yielding me some \ntime to speak on this budget.\n  I guess you could sum up this budget in very few words. It is bad for \nwhat ails us in this country. It is bad for our people. It is bad for \nour future. It is bad for our kids, and especially bad for our elderly.\n  Hubert Humphrey, one of my great political heroes, once said that the \nmoral test of government is how the government treats those who are in \nthe dawn of life, the children; those who are in the twilight of life, \nthe elderly; those who are in the shadows of life, the sick and the \nneedy.\n  Let's be clear: This conference report flunks the moral test of \ngovernment. It turns its back on far too many of these Americans. And \nto the extent that it implements the Bush tax proposal, it basically \nsays: If you earn $1 million a year, if you are very secure, we are \ngoing to help you get wealthier. But if you are in the dawn of life and \nyou are a child, perhaps, who needs some help because you are in the \nlower socioeconomic strata of America, if you are poor, sick, elderly, \nif you are one of the baby boomers getting ready to go on Medicare, \nwell, they are telling you, so long, sucker, we will see you later. \nThat is what this budget to the extent that we stick to the President's \nplan, says.\n  I think stacking the deck even more against those who already have \nthe deck stacked against them, through no fault of their own, is not \nthe purpose of government. It is not why I came here, and I don't think \nthat is what we ought to be about. I hope we will see a strong shift \nfrom this Bush budget.\n  This budget was fashioned under a plan to make room for huge tax cuts \nthat to far to large an extent go to the wealthiest. In my saying these \nthings, you might say that is just rhetoric. I am just saying those \nthings. I am a Democrat, and the people who put this together are \nRepublicans, so I am just saying these things.\n\n  But let's look at the facts. Don't accept what I say, look at the \nfacts. This\n\n[[Page S4571]]\n\nSenate, by a majority vote, said that we wanted to cut the Bush tax \nproposal by $225 billion and put that into education. That was the \namendment this Senator offered, and it was adopted by the Senate. \nSenator Jeffords and Senator Breaux offered an amendment that also put \n$70 billion into education over the next 10 years. Well, that adds up \nto almost $300 billion--$295 billion--and that was in the Senate-passed \nbudget. The House of Representatives had only provided $21.3 billion \nfor education over those next 10 years. That was what President Bush \nwanted, $21.3 billion.\n  Well, now, you would think that, since we passed $225 billion over 10 \nyears and the House passed $21.3 billion, they would compromise \nsomewhere. Well, they compromised all right--at zero. Not only did they \ntake out the $225 billion over 10 years under my amendment to zero, \nthey took out the Jeffords-Breaux amendment of $70 billion down to \nzero, and the Bush plan of $21.3 billion.\n  They say they put it in a contingency fund. Good luck in getting \nanything out of that contingency fund. Why do I say that? Because also \nlast week the Senate passed, on a bipartisan vote, a unanimous vote--a \nvoice vote, and no one objected to it--we appropriated for the next 10 \nyears about $181 billion to fully fund the Individuals With \nDisabilities Education Act, to move towards and meet our obligation of \n40 percent of the average per pupil expenditure for IDEA over 10 years. \nA welcome sigh of relief echoed from our local school districts and our \nState boards of education. Finally, the Federal Government was going to \nprovide this money for special education. We just did that last week \nhere in the education bill that is in front of us. But this budget, \nwith its projected contingency fund, is not going to allow us to meet \nour obligations in other areas.\n  This is kind of a busy chart. But what this chart really points out \nis that if we pass this budget as it is presented to us, doing the \nthings that are talked about, we are going to raid Social Security and \nwe are going to raid Medicare. The facts are here. If we take the final \nconference and look out over the next 10 years to what we are going to \nspend on defense--we are not going to cut defense; let's not kid \nanybody around here. We are not going to cut defense below this. The \nalternative minimum tax is going to be paid by an ever growing number \nof people exasperated lowering the top tax rates, creating a pressure \nto change the AMT. Look at special education that we passed last week, \nwhich is mandatory. It is mandatory spending. We have to spend this \nmoney if we are to meet a commitment that this Senate has voted without \nobjection to finally meet. Think about the emergencies that will occur. \nWe always have to come up with additional money for emergencies. Then \nthere are the interest payments we have to make.\n  So when you add all of this up, they gave us a $504 billion surplus \nin this budget--they say. OK, it looks like a nice little slush fund we \ncan use for all these things, but when you add up all of the mandatory \nthings we are going to be spending over 10 years, it comes to a deficit \nof minus $552 billion.\n  So that means in order to make up this deficit in each of these \nyears, we are going to have to take money out of Medicare for the first \n3 years and then, from year 4 on, both Medicare and Social Security. \nAgain, this is not rhetoric; the numbers are there.\n  What the House of Representatives gave us, what they voted on in the \nHouse of Representatives--every Congressman and Congresswoman who voted \nfor that budget voted to raid Medicare and to raid Social Security over \nthe next 10 years. Make no mistake about it. That is what they did, and \nthat is what we have in front of us here.\n  So if you vote for this budget, you are voting to take money out of \nMedicare and you are voting to take money out of Social Security, to \npay for what? The House has already passed a set of tax cuts that \ndramatically favor tax break that goes to the wealthiest in our \nsociety.\n  President Bush is always talking about waitresses and the people \nworking out there and how they need a tax break, too. Here is a letter \nwhich appeared in the Des Moines Register on May 3. It was written by \nDeb Stehr of Lake View, IA. She is a waitress. She wrote this. The \nheadline is ``Bush's Tax Cut Won't Help This Waitress Mom.'' I ask \nunanimous consent that this entire letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Des Moines Register, May 3, 2001]\n\n              Bush's Tax Cut Won't Help This Waitress Mom\n\n\n  if he's not going to talk to me, shouldn't he stop talking about me?\n\n                             (By Deb Stehr)\n\n       President Bush has said his tax plan would be great for a \n     waitress with two kids and income of $26,000.\n       I'm a waitress, married, with one child still at home and a \n     family income that's a little lower than $26,000 in most \n     years.\n       If Bush visited the cafe where I work in Lake View, I would \n     tell him that when it comes to my family and folks like us, \n     he has it all wrong.\n       The fact is, we wouldn't get anything from his tax cuts. \n     Instead, they would hurt programs we depend upon and gladly \n     pay taxes to support, such as Medicare and Medicaid. They \n     would kill the chances for programs such as prescription-drug \n     coverage for our parents, which would make all our lives a \n     little easier.\n       I'm the kind of person the politicians woo like crazy when \n     there's an election coming up, and then forget about the rest \n     of the time. So let me explain a little about my life to help \n     them remember moms like me.\n       I am a waitress who has worked in the same local cafe for \n     13 years, and my husband owns a small auto-body repair shop. \n     We don't have private health insurance so, like lots of \n     working families, we have to rely on Medicaid. It has been a \n     lifeline for one family member.\n       Our youngest son, Jonathan, was born with severe cerebral \n     palsy 18 years ago. He receives Medicaid because of his \n     disability, a program that has covered his extensive health-\n     care needs over the years. For now, it also covers the \n     necessary support services that enable us to keep him at \n     home. Jon, like most young adults, looks forward to finishing \n     his education, getting a job and living on his own. He will \n     need Medicaid to help him become independent.\n       We're part of the ``sandwich generation''--baby boomers who \n     care for aging parents as well as our kids. For the past \n     year, my dad has been treated for a rare cancer. Fortunately, \n     Medicare has paid for what would have been tens of thousands \n     of dollars of medical bills. Ironically, the largest out-of-\n     pocket expenses he had to pay were for prescription drugs.\n       That's my story, and when I hear Bush talk about families \n     who would benefit from his tax plan, I know he's not talking \n     about me. He might think he is talking about a waitress mom. \n     But I know better. We pay payroll taxes, sales taxes and \n     other taxes. I make more in tips on a bad day than I would \n     ever get back from his tax cut. I don't think most of the \n     customers who come to the cafe--mostly working people and \n     seniors--would make out any better.\n       I am afraid that we'd lose out because Bush would have to \n     cut programs that help our families survive. When I read that \n     he plans to cut $17 billion from Medicaid over 10 years and \n     ``borrow'' from the Medicare surplus, it makes me scared and \n     angry. What would happen to my son if they cut Medicaid? What \n     would happen to my dad, and many of the seniors I care about, \n     if they cut Medicare?\n       Bush likes to say that the money the government gets from \n     income taxes is the people's money. Some of the money in the \n     Medicare surplus came from my payroll taxes and the taxes of \n     workers in situations similar to mine. I'd just as soon see \n     that money help people like my dad who worked hard and paid \n     taxes all their lives.\n       Worst of all, I'm afraid Bush's tax plan would make the \n     future less hopeful for working families like mine. This is a \n     good country, with a big heart and supposedly a helping hand. \n     Now that we finally have a surplus, we should use some of it \n     to help seniors buy prescription drugs by adding a \n     comprehensive, prescription-drug benefit to Medicare. We \n     should provide health-care coverage for the uninsured and \n     invest in education for all students. It makes more sense to \n     help millions of people than to give millionaires a tax cut.\n       That's what I'd tell Bush if I ever had the chance. Even \n     though he likes to say his plan would help someone like me, \n     he's not likely to visit with a waitress in a small town in \n     northwest Iowa. But if he's not going to talk to me, then \n     shouldn't he stop talking about me?\n\n  Deb said:\n\n       President Bush has said his tax plan would be great for a \n     waitress with two kids and an income of $26,000.\n       I'm a waitress, married, with one child still at home and a \n     family income that's a little lower than $26,000 in most \n     years.\n       If Bush visited the cafe where I work in Lake View--She \n     goes on to say later that she has worked there for 13 years, \n     and she also has a son who was born with severe cerebral \n     palsy and lives at home. She said:\n       If Bush visited the cafe where I work in Lake View, I would \n     tell him that when it comes to my family and folks like us, \n     he has it all wrong.\n\n[[Page S4572]]\n\n       The fact is, we wouldn't get anything from his tax cuts. \n     Instead, they would hurt programs we depend upon and gladly \n     pay taxes to support, such as Medicare and Medicaid. They \n     would kill the chances for programs such as prescription drug \n     coverage for our parents, which would make all our lives a \n     little easier.\n\n  Deb goes on to say that she has been a waitress for 13 years and her \nhusband owns a small auto body repair shop. They don't have private \nhealth insurance. They have to rely on Medicaid because their son \nJonathan was born with severe cerebral palsy 18 years ago. He receives \nMedicaid because of his disability. Medicaid helps him to be \nindependent. She has an elder parent who has cancer, and he relies upon \nMedicare money.\n  Well, she said in the end:\n\n       That's what I'd tell Bush if I ever had the chance. Even \n     though he likes to say his plan would help someone like me, \n     he is not likely to visit with a waitress in a small town in \n     northwest Iowa. But if he is not going to talk to me, then \n     shouldn't he stop talking about me?\n\n  I think that sums it up, Mr. President. If you want to help the \nworking people of America who are out in the small towns and \ncommunities, who have their small businesses and are working hard to \nkeep their families together, this is not the budget you want for their \nfuture. This budget is going to hurt them. This is not the budget you \nwant to help educate our kids and to make sure they are going to have \nthe funds necessary for their future growth and development.\n  If you want to make sure our elderly get the prescription drugs they \nneed so that their lives are healthier and better, this is not the \nbudget you want. If you want to make sure that we secure Social \nSecurity for the baby boomers and that we have the ability to make sure \nthe Social Security System is sound for the next 40 to 50 years, this \nis not the budget you want.\n  This budget has everything in there for people who have everything in \nthis country. The President likes to say he wants to ``leave no child \nbehind.'' I think we have to revise that. What he really is saying is \nhe wants to leave no child in the wealthiest suburbs behind, no child \nwhose parents have a great income; he doesn't want to leave them \nbehind. But if you are poor, black, Hispanic, and you are from the \nlower socioeconomic strata, if you in elementary school, if you nearing \nretirement with an average income, you are left behind with this \nbudget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. President, the other thing I want to say is if you are interested \nin reducing the national debt, because we also put $250 billion in the \nSenate bill through the amendment I proposed to reduce the national \ndebt so that our kids are not saddled with interest payments every year \nof their lives, if you are interested in paying down the national debt, \nthis is not the budget for you because this budget does not pay down \nthe national debt.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nFlorida is recognized for 12\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, a week ago today on May 2, the front page of the \nWashington Post had three significant articles about the debate we are \nconducting tonight.\n  The first says, ``Bush Calls for Missile Shield.''\n  The second says, ``Bush to Unveil Panel on Social Security Change.''\n  And the third says, ``Tax Cut Compromise Reached.''\n  What is the relationship of those three articles? The relationship is \nthat the decisions we are going to be making tonight, tomorrow, and \nnext week on the tax cut compromise which has been reached will have \nsignificant effects on our ability to finance the missile shield and \nthe Social Security changes which, on the same front page, the \nPresident has asked our Nation to consider.\n  Although we do not have a number, we have heard that the Secretary of \nDefense may be asking for as much as $250 billion above the amount in \nthis budget resolution for additional defense expenditures. Whether \nthat includes the national missile defense is a question mark.\n  We do not know the exact number, but the projection is, to pay for \nthe privatization of a portion of Social Security as this Commission \nhas been charged to develop will cost upwards of a trillion dollars \nover the next 10 years in the transition costs.\n  What these three stories show is the need to set priorities and to \nset priorities at the same time so that, just as any family, you would \nknow how much you were going to spend for every component of the \nfamily's budget as you started the new year, as you began the new \nintelligent planning for your family's resources.\n  I suggest one intelligent step to take tonight is not to take one 10-\nyear tax cut based on projections of what the Federal Government \nsurplus will be from this year through the year 2011 but, rather, to \ntake a step-by-step approach. Yes, passing a significant tax bill--and \nI will discuss later what I think its components should be--then \nreviewing what the state of the economy is after that tax cut, \nevaluating what our projected surpluses would be after that first tax \ncut, and deciding whether, when, and for what purpose a second tax cut \nwould be prudent.\n  It has been said that we are engaged in a zero-sum game, and we are. \nMuch attention has been given over the last several weeks to how big a \ntax cut Congress should build into the budget. Much less has been given \nto the fact that these budget decisions are a zero-sum game. Every \ndollar we spend on a tax cut is a dollar we cannot spend for something \nelse. Every dollar we spend for something else is a dollar we cannot \nspend on the tax cut. The greater the tax cut, the fewer dollars are \navailable for other priorities.\n  What are some of those priorities? In my opinion, they would be \npaying down the $5.5 trillion national debt we have developed over the \nlast 20 years and have just started the process of reducing so we do \nnot leave to our children and our grandchildren a credit card bill of \nours to pay; meeting the No. 1 priority, which the President has stated \nand which this Congress has reaffirmed, and that is education; \nproviding prescription drug coverage for older Americans; dealing with \nthe serious issues of energy security and the contractual \nresponsibilities we have for Social Security and providing for an \nadequate national defense.\n\n  In addition to being a zero-sum game, there is also a zero-sum minus \nbecause one of the flaws in this budget resolution that includes using \nthe Medicare trust fund without a question, and arguably also the \nSocial Security surplus trust fund as a means of being able to finance \nthis enormous tax cut.\n  This violates the fundamental spirit of the agreement that we have \nwith Medicare taxpayers, with Medicare beneficiaries, and with our \nSocial Security beneficiaries.\n  Congress, instead of spending those trust funds or making them \nvulnerable to being spent, should use this opportunity to place the \nMedicare trust fund in a protected status and to recommit ourselves to \ndo the same for the Social Security trust fund.\n  Senator Stabenow and I will be offering legislation, to be introduced \nshortly, which will do just that by providing a point of order against \nany attempt to use the Medicare trust funds for any purposes other than \nfor paying current Medicare Part A benefits. So part of this game is \nzero-sum minus, minus the proposal of using the Medicare trust fund and \nthe Social Security trust fund to pay for this.\n  Another part is zero-sum plus, and that is we are looking at the \nworld as if it ends in the year 2011. Taking such a narrow focus \nprevents us from addressing the longer term budget challenges facing \nthis country.\n  I understand that under the Budget Act we look at our Nation's \nfinances for 10 years, but that does not put us in unneeded handcuffs \nto recognize the fact that there are responsibilities just beyond that \nhorizon.\n  A very significant event in world history occurred in late March of \nthis year. My daughter, Suzanne, and her husband, Tom, hosted a sixth \nbirthday party for their triplet daughters, my triplet granddaughters. \nAnsley, Adele, and Kendall Gibson all became 6 years old on the same \nday. What is the significance of that for this debate? The significance \nis they are all going to become 16 10 years from now. If the Gibson \nfamily looked at the life of their triplets and said, let's just plan \nfor the next 10 years, it would be a fairly smooth ride because the \nexpenses from 6 to 16 are not that daunting.\n\n[[Page S4573]]\n\n  The problem is that 2 years later, in the year 2013, those triplets \nare all going to want to go to college at the same time. Anybody who is \nputting one child through college can appreciate what the challenge is \ngoing to be to put through triplets at the same time.\n  That is almost an exact parallel to what our Nation is facing. We are \non the verge of one of the most significant demographic surges in the \nhistory of America, and it can be seen in this chart.\n  If we just use as our amount to pay down the national debt the sums \nin the Social Security surplus, we are going to go back into deficit in \nthe year 2017. The reason we are going to go back into deficit is \nbecause we will be 5 years into the baby boomers reaching their \nretirement age and starting to draw down Social Security.\n  Conversely, if we put all of the unified surplus into paying down the \nnational debt, we will stretch that out to the year 2050 before we will \nbe back into a deficit position. But we are just looking at this narrow \nwindow into which we are now entering and saying things look great for \nthe next 10 years, but it is the period just after the 10 years that is \ngoing to be the challenge for Congress and for this Nation.\n  What are some of the implications of this chart? In the year 2017, \nthe year we are going to go back into deficit, 52 million Americans \nwill be receiving Social Security retirement benefits. That is up from \n36 million in the year 2000, a 16 million increase in the number of \nSocial Security retirees in just a 17-year period. Mr. President, that \nis 44 percent above current beneficiary levels. In addition, 56 million \nAmericans will be eligible for Medicare benefits, up from 39 million in \nthe year 2000.\n\n  Those are some of the challenges in the zero-sum-plus game. We have \nto add a longer vision to our fiscal telescope than just the 10 years \nimmediately ahead.\n  I am also concerned in this approach of one humongous tax bill. We \nare not putting first priorities first in our Nation's economic life. I \nthink the most challenging issue for America today is the fact we are \nfacing the potential of a further and even more serious economic \ndecline. There have been mixed economic figures in the past few weeks. \nThe figures of last week show unemployment has risen to 4.5 percent, \nwith a whole series of major American companies announcing yet another \nround of layoffs. Certainly that sends alarm signals. We ought to be \nusing our energy and using the people's resources to help buy an \neconomic insurance policy to do everything we can on the fiscal side of \nthe American economy as the Federal Reserve Board is doing on the \nmonetary side in order to give the American people the greatest \nconfidence that they will not be facing a hard, perhaps a crash \nlanding.\n  My suggestion is rather than pass the $1.35 trillion, 10-year ``spend \nit all right now'' tax plan, which I think will be seen quickly in \nhistory as being the equivalent of the 1981 tax cut which brought these \nenormous deficits and now a $5.5 trillion national debt, we ought to be \npatient and proceed step by step.\n  I suggest the first step ought to be to buy an economic insurance \npolicy by passing a simple, immediate, broad-based and substantial tax \ncut of approximately $60 billion this year and in the next years, which \nwill go, primarily, to American families in a sufficient amount to \nprovide a $950 per year, or approximately $35 every other week in the \npaycheck, increase in the disposable income of American families so \nthey will have not only the additional dollars to contribute to \nstrengthening the demand side of our American economy but also the \npsychological reassurance that they are going to be that much better \noff on a permanent basis.\n  That is the kind of tax plan this Senate ought to be considering. The \nAmerican people have worked hard for the last few years to get where we \nare. In 1992, we had the largest single deficit in any year in the \nhistory of the United States of America, almost $300 billion. Now we \nare in the happy circumstance of surplus. We are facing the prospect of \nsurpluses for the foreseeable future. We have the potential of making \nthat future stretch all the way to the middle of the 21st century if we \nact prudently tonight, tomorrow, and next week. This is not the time to \ngo back where we have been and where we do not want to go again, a \nnation on its economic knees through deficits and excessive debt.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 12\\1/2\\ minutes to the Senator from Florida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allen). The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the chairman of my committee \nhas given courageous leadership in trying to sort through all of the \nfunny money and the distorted figures as we try to make some sense out \nof this budget resolution. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for \nhis leadership.\n  I strongly support a tax cut that would benefit all Americans fairly, \nbut I support a tax cut that doesn't sacrifice the fiscal discipline \nthat enables us to provide tax relief for this year. I support a tax \ncut that doesn't abandon our commitment to such critical areas as \nSocial Security, Medicare, education, national defense, and the \nenvironment. I was among those voting for such a tax cut when we first \ndebated the budget a few weeks ago. It would have given taxpayers \nsubstantial relief--$900 billion over 10 years--while enabling us to \nmeet our Nation's most pressing needs.\n  With the administration demanding $1.6 trillion instead of $900 \nbillion, that sensible proposal of a balanced way of approaching the \nbudget for all of these different needs that I want to talk about, and \nthat my colleague, my senior Senator from Florida, has already talked \nabout, was rejected. Instead, we are now considering a budget \nresolution calling for a $1.4 trillion tax cut over 10 years that is \ncertain to cost far more if it is carried out.\n  We are about to vote for an illusion, a political head fake, because \nthis budget before the Senate provides none of the additional money we \napproved for educational reform. Every day now we are on the education \nbill, S. 1. We have added needed money for lowering classroom size, as \nwe are about to vote on the amendment from the Senator from Washington. \nWe have added money to bring title I up, fully funded, over the course \nof the next decade. We have put additional money into Head Start, to \nget children ready to start school at the kindergarten and first grade \nlevel.\n  Yet this budget doesn't provide any of that money. This is one of the \nmost inconsistent, legislative decisionmaking times we have ever seen. \nOn the one hand, we are considering a budget resolution that strips out \nall of the additional money we promised our people last year in the \nelection that was going to be invested in education while, at the same \ntime, we are voting on an educational bill that adds all of this \nadditional investment into education.\n  There is no money here for the public school improvements we all \nagreed were critically needed. This budget conveniently overlooks \nanticipated costs for such big ticket items as the President's plans \nfor overhauling the military and the President's plans for building a \nmissile defense system. It is based on distant revenue projections that \nare uncertain in the best of times and, increasingly, revenue \nprojections of surplus that are very unlikely in our slowing economy.\n  My senior Senator from Florida, who is so kind to be here, knows that \nI made promises to our people in Florida. I promised to fight any raids \non Medicare and Social Security trust funds. Instead of strengthening \nMedicare and Social Security, which we must do, this unconscionable \nbudget would raid them.\n  Look at the chart referred to in an earlier speech. With everything \nin this present budget at the end of 10 years, there isn't enough left \nin the present budget projections, to the tune of $\\1/2\\ trillion. At \nthe end of 10 years, where will we get it? We will get it by raiding \nthe Medicare trust fund, $326 billion over 10 years. I promised I \nwasn't going to do that.\n  We are going to get it by raiding the Social Security trust fund, \n$225 billion over 10 years. I promised I would not do that, and I will \nnot.\n  And I promised to give all children a chance for a quality education. \nAnd we are stripping out that money for education.\n  I promised to protect our precious natural resources. There is not \nany money for that.\n\n[[Page S4574]]\n\n  I promised to strengthen our Nation's military. And there is not any \nmoney for that, either.\n  I promised to modernize Medicare with a real prescription drug \nbenefit, and there is no money for that. I promised one of the most \nsacred promises to all of the people of Florida who have labored under \nbudget deficits and who have worried, as they worry about paying off \ntheir mortgages on their homes--I promised to pay down the national \ndebt with this surplus so our economy can grow and prosper. We are not \ndoing that with this budget.\n  No, the budget plan before us would eat up our entire surplus. It \nwould cripple our ability to do all of those things I promised our \npeople in Florida. So I am going to vote against it. Because of the \npromises I made to our people in Florida, I will continue to fight for \nreforms and I will continue to fight for tax cuts in the days and the \nweeks ahead. I will continue to fight for those reforms and tax cuts \nthat will better serve all of our people.\n  I say to the chairman of our committee, my senior Senator, the \ndistinguished Senator from the State of Washington, it has been a \nprivilege to be a part of this process. Thank you for letting me \nexpress some very deeply felt convictions, most of which were discussed \nin detail as I had the privilege of visiting all of the back roads and \ncities, the rural areas, and the backwaters of Florida as I traversed \nthe State last year in the campaign. What a high honor it was to be \nelected to represent the State of Florida. I came here with those \npromises. I intend to keep them.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. If the Senator will yield for just a moment--\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator very much. I \nwould like to say that Senator Nelson of Florida has been a very \nvaluable member of the Senate Budget Committee. Nobody has been more \nserious about the work of the committee. I think nobody is more \ndedicated to fiscal responsibility. His senior colleague as well, who \nsits next to me on the Senate Finance Committee--I think on the \nquestions of fiscal responsibility, they are two of the most sound \nthinkers who come before the Senate. I admire the remarks of both \ntonight.\n  I especially want to say to the junior Senator from Florida, Mr. \nNelson, how much I appreciate the effort he has extended to be involved \nin the budget process. It has been a great help to me, and I will not \nforget the assistance he has provided.\n  I yield the floor. Again, I thank the Senator for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How much time did the Senator ask for?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I haven't asked but 7 minutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield 10 minutes, if you like. Will you yield me 1 \nminute of that time--or let me ask consent that the Senator be \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. And then who is next? Do we have another Senator?\n  Mr. CONRAD. We are ready on our side with Senator Murray.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. How long would she like? Why don't we just set it in \nplace.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 12\\1/2\\ minutes for Senator Murray, and then \nSenator Corzine on our side, 12\\1/2\\ minutes as well.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. We will do that following the Senator from Alabama, and \nif any other Republicans want to speak, any way that is fair. Does the \nSenator yield me 2 minutes?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is just amazing to this Senator. I \ndon't know where they get the numbers. Somebody is giving them to them. \nSomebody is making a lot of assumptions that are not in this budget \nresolution.\n  We do not need a lesson from anyone about whether or not we should \ndip into Social Security trust funds for purposes of spending in this \nbudget. We were the first to put before the Congress of the United \nStates a lockbox concept. By the time we were finished, everybody took \ncredit for it--lock in the Social Security trust fund. That is a \nlockbox. Before we were finished, President Clinton was for it. He had \nnot been for it before. We start it; everybody takes credit.\n  Let me say to the American people, whenever you want to give the \nAmerican people a tax cut of sizable proportions--not as big as the \nKennedy tax cut, not as big as the Reagan tax cut--just try to give the \ntaxpayers some of their money back out of this huge surplus, there is \nno end to excuses as to why we cannot do it.\n  The latest one is: Seniors, you ought to be angry about this tax cut, \neven though it is going to your children and grandchildren and to your \nfriends because, they are saying on that side, we are spending it; we \nare spending part of your trust fund money for tax cuts.\n  Not true. And it should not be a condition precedent to cutting \ntaxes.\n  Next, what do they insist on? You can't touch Medicare. We didn't \nhave to learn that from anyone. We did not, we do not, and wherever \nthose numbers came from, they are not the numbers in the budget. They \nare not what we assume will be spent. They are assuming the alternative \nminimum tax will be passed. They are assuming defense will get $370 \nbillion. They are assuming education will get $146 billion more. How \nare we responsible when we do not even have that in our budget? We \ndon't know what is going to happen there. What is in our budget does \nnot use Medicare, does not use Social Security.\n  I believe every time we have a significant tax cut going to Americans \nso the economy will keep going, that is the best thing for seniors. \nKeep an economy that is booming. What do we boom on? Low tax rates. \nThat is what America's economy expects. So you do that to help over the \nlong run, and you get excuses that you have not done everything yet \nthat is necessary.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am pleased to yield on your time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. This tax cut that you proposed and the analysis that \nhas been made of it, does it have dynamic scoring? Does it provide any \nprojected boost in the economy by virtue of the tax cut?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. No, it does not.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is a very conservative posture to take.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Also, let me say the economy is not booming as much as \nwe like, and there is $100 billion in it that was sought after by \nDemocrats for upfront stimulus between this year and next year. That is \ngoing to go right into the pockets of Americans. It is going to go into \nthe pockets of the neighbors and nephews and grandchildren of the \nseniors whom they are trying to scare in that we cannot keep our faith \nwith Social Security and give people back some of their money. We can. \nWe will. And it will not touch Social Security. So don't get worked up \nabout it, our friends who are seniors. If you want to call our offices, \nwe will give you the numbers.\n\n  Those numbers are invented. Since they use all kinds of invective \nhere on the floor about our budget resolution, they are invented \nnumbers. That is not accusing anyone. They just borrowed them from \nsomewhere. They are not in the budget.\n  I will be pleased to yield the remainder of my time, except I want to \nsay we were asked to balance the budget before we would give any tax \nrelief. We have. It will be. We were asked to reduce the debt. We have. \nIt will be. It will be reduced dramatically.\n  The real numbers are $3.2 trillion in debt. It will be down to $0.8 \ntrillion under this budget resolution, a huge reduction in debt. What \nare we arguing about? It is as big as you can get. Probably you cannot \ndo any more.\n  Go onto everything they ask, that everybody says this budget should \ndo before we give Americans a tax break. We have done them all. We \ntried. They are inventing new ones. Every time we are on the floor, \nthey are inventing new ones.\n  I don't kid anybody. This is not a budget that Senator Harkin would \nput forward. This is not a budget resolution he would write. I don't \nknow what he would write, I don't know what he would support. Clearly, \nhe came and spoke his piece, and that is fine. He didn't vote for it \neven when it left the Senate when 15 Democrats did. Nor did most of the \npeople who are speaking\n\n[[Page S4575]]\n\nagainst it. They didn't even vote for it when it passed the Senate with \n15 Democrats in support of it, with a lower tax number than the \nPresident wanted and that we wanted.\n  So I want to wrap my arguments up very simply. Everything a budget \ncould be asked to do before we give any money back to our American \npeople to grow our economy even better, we have done it all.\n  Every time we try to do a reasonable tax reduction plan, we find new \nconditions and new things we ought to be doing as a Government. What? \nBefore we can give the American people a tax break? Give us a break. \nHow many more conditions? There will be more tonight. We have a couple \nof hours. There will be more tomorrow morning. We have an hour or so. \nThere will be more things we should have been doing before we give the \nAmerican people a tax break. I guarantee you that is what it will be \nabout--more things the Government ought to do and less and less about \nwhat people should get. Give back to them some of their money.\n  I yield the rest of your time. I am sorry I used it. I ask unanimous \nconsent that he have 10 minutes nonetheless.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and the distinguished \nBudget Committee chairman. There is no one who has given more of his \nheart and soul to battling for a sound economy in this country and a \nsound balance between the individual American citizen and our \nGovernment than the chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  We are looking at numbers. They are extraordinary. Money is pouring \ninto our National Government. Even in this time of slowdown, \npreliminary numbers I heard recently indicate that we will still have \nmore money coming into the Government this year than was projected even \nlast year. All the projections for the last 4 years have been below the \nsize of the actual surplus.\n  What are we talking about? We are talking about an unusual period of \ntime in which the Federal Government is growing at an unprecedented \nrate.\n  It is a fundamental period for us to make a decision. Are we going to \ngo down the road of the socialistic economic philosophies of European \nnations and others in the world, or are we going to maintain the great \nAmerican tradition of individual freedom and free enterprise? It is a \nfundamental question. There are Members of this body who either have \nnot thought about that, or have thought about it and won't admit it and \nwant to see us go in that direction because every time a tax cut is \nproposed, they say: No, we can't trust the American people with their \nmoney. We have to take it and spend it on this program, this program, \nthis program, and this program.\n  Are there not families in America and senior citizens in America who \nneed to put a set of tires on their car and need a $75-a-month tax \nreduction to help them do that? Are there not people who will benefit \nfrom that? Aren't children going to benefit from the tax credit that \nfamilies will have with two children with a $1,000-a-year tax credit?\n  I don't mean you get $1,000 and have to pay taxes on it. I mean they \nget to keep $1,000, if they have two children, for the year. It adds up \nto almost $100 a month to help them raise their children, to take care \nof us when we retire, educate their children, and raise them in the \nproper way.\n  But the most important thing for us to know is that in 1992 this \nFederal Government alone took 17.6 percent of the total gross domestic \nproduct in the form of taxes. Mr. President, 17.6 percent of all the \ngoods and services produced in this country were sent to Washington, \nDC. Since 1992, it has grown every single year. We are now at 20.7 \npercent of the gross domestic product going to the Federal Government \nin Washington.\n  Is there any wonder why we have a surplus? There is no doubt about \nit. The Government is taking a larger percentage of America's wealth. \nAre we going to let it go to 22 percent or 25 percent so politicians \ncan spend it and go out and claim they did great things for you, and \nhave buildings named for them that they built with your money? I don't \nthink so. I think this is a defining moment of great historical \nimportance.\n  The bipartisan majority, I am confident, will approve this budget of \n$1.3 trillion in tax reductions over 10 years, with $100 billion in the \nfirst 2 years for an economic stimulus to help get this economy moving \nagain, and to help do something about these high energy prices which \nare a direct result of a no-growth environmental extreme policy that \ndid not allow production of energy sources and left us in a shortage \nand left us with high prices. We do not need that kind of shortsighted \nmentality, in my view.\n  We are in a position to do something very special. We are in a \nposition to allow the American people, vis-a-vis their central \ngovernment, to have a little bit more money, to be able to keep a \nlittle more of what they earn, and to reverse that trend. Because when \nmoney is taken from an individual, a free American citizen, and is sent \nto Washington, Washington is empowered. Washington is enriched. \nWashington is strengthened. And the individual American is diminished. \nHis wealth is diminished; his freedom, his autonomy, his ability to do \nas he or she wishes is diminished.\n\n  I think we are at a point where we are sending enough here. I don't \nbelieve the people who elected me said, Jeff, go up there and preside \nover one of the greatest increases in accumulation of wealth in \nWashington, DC, in the history of our country. I don't believe that is \nwhat I was sent here to do.\n  The 20.7 percent coming to this Government right now as a percentage \nof gross domestic product is the highest figure since the height of \nWorld War II. One year in World War II it hit 20.9 percent.\n  We are drifting into a state-dominated, socialist-type economy, if we \ndon't watch it. The trends are not healthy. Let's slow that down.\n  Compared to the Reagan tax cut, this one is small. Compared to the \nJohn F. Kennedy tax cut, this is small. It is not a breathtaking tax \ncut. We are looking at it over 10 years. But it is significant. I \nbelieve it will help contain that trend of ever increasing \nconcentration of wealth in Washington, with more and more Federal \nprograms--all for the greatest sounding good that seldom produces the \nresults they set out to do.\n  I think we are on the right track. I believe we are going to have a \nstrong vote for this. I think it is the right direction for our country \nto go in. I could not be more excited about it.\n  I have no doubt that we will not cast a more important vote. We will \nnot deal with a more important governmental issue than trying to \ncontain this powerful growth in spending and wealth in this Nation's \nCapital.\n  By the way, we are paying down the debt as fast as it can be paid \ndown without paying penalties on the Treasury bills that are out there. \nIt is a tremendous reduction of wealth. The estimates are that instead \nof paying 14 percent down now to fund our debtload, we will be down to \nunder 2 percent at the end of this budget projection at the rate we are \ngoing. It is a good trend to be on. Less than 2 percent for debt \nservice is a healthy trend for us. In a couple more years, we could \nhave all the debt eliminated. That is a wise economic step for us to \ntake at that time.\n  I certainly believe in paying down debt. I certainly believe we ought \nto lock up the Social Security surplus and not spend it.\n  Senator Domenici is correct. Senator Domenici founded the idea of a \nlockbox, and fought for it on this floor. I supported him. Senator \nSpence Abraham of Michigan supported him. We worked hard on the \nlockbox. We didn't get it passed. The Democrats opposed it. The \nDemocrats opposed that lockbox.\n  Then, stunningly, we were in a political campaign and the Vice \nPresident said he was all for a lockbox. He should have told some of \nhis friends in the Senate.\n  But we are going to do that. We are locking that money up.\n  I will say one thing. I am not voting for a budget that is going to \nspend the Social Security surplus. That debt needs to be paid down. It \nshould be for that purpose and should not be spent. I will oppose any \nspending or any tax program that reduces or spends any of that surplus. \nIt is not going to happen. It is a commitment on both sides of the \naisle not to allow that to happen. We are not going to allow that to \nhappen. That would be wrong. We have done\n\n[[Page S4576]]\n\nthat too long. It is time to end that. In fact, a good frugal \ncongressional battle has resulted in better spending ideas and the \ncontainment of spending which has helped produce this surplus.\n  The budget is pretty good on spending increases. The President wants \nus to hold to 4 percent. It looks like the budget is going to have us \nat a little over 5 percent. We have to watch ourselves. It is so \ntempting to spend. If we can just maintain spending at the rate of \ninflation, or only slightly above the rate of inflation, I think we can \ndo well. But if we go crazy and we spend like we did last year--nearly \nan 8-percent budget increase in spending--and do that every year, we \nare not going to have any Social Security or tax cut possibilities.\n  I am excited about what is happening. I think we will have bipartisan \nsupport for this. I know some people just cannot stand the thought of a \ntax cut. I think it is a great idea. I think it is time, and we have \nthe money to do it. We ought to let the American people keep some of \ntheir money, and quit this unprecedented growth in the accumulation of \nwealth going to Washington, DC.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I thank the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. CONRAD addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask if Senator Murray will yield to me briefly, so I \ncan respond to a number of points that have been made.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Yes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama used some pretty \nstrong language out here. Socialistic? Please. I do not know of a \nsingle socialist in the Senate or anybody that has any thought of \nproposing anything socialistic in this Chamber. That is talk that is a \nlittle beyond the pale.\n  Let's review what has happened in fact--not the rhetoric, the fact. \nThis chart I have here demonstrates what has happened to Federal \nspending as a share of national income since 1966. Ronald Reagan took \nover in 1980. I do not think he was a socialist. But look what happened \nto Federal spending as a share of national income under Ronald Reagan \nand, effectively, Republican control of both the House and the Senate. \nFederal spending as a share of gross domestic product shot up under \nPresident Reagan.\n  Now look what happened when a Democrat took over in 1992. Federal \nspending as share of GDP plunged. We have gone from 22 percent of GDP \ngoing to the Federal Government when Bill Clinton came into office to \nlast year going down to 18 percent--a dramatic reduction of money \ncoming to Washington for the Federal Government as a share of national \nincome. Those are facts. As President Reagan used to say, facts are \nstubborn things.\n  The Senator from Alabama said the Democrats defeated the lockbox. You \nbet we defeated the lockbox they proposed because the lockbox they \nproposed would have prevented us from honoring our national debt. The \nSecretary of the Treasury wrote us and said that would endanger the \nability of the United States to meet its financial obligations. I was \nthe author on this side of the lockbox legislation that passed, with \nthe strongest vote in the Senate on a bipartisan basis. That lockbox \npassed.\n  So when they say the Democrats opposed the lockbox, we opposed a \nfiscally irresponsible lockbox, and we supported the lockbox that with \nbipartisan support passed in the Senate. Facts are stubborn things. \nSenator Domenici said, in answer to Senator Nelson, that Senator Nelson \nput up a chart that had things that were not in their budget. That is \nexactly the point. The defense buildup they are calling for, this \nadministration is calling for, is not in the budget. The strengthening \nof Social Security that this President is calling for are not in the \nbudget. The additional resources for education this President is \ncalling for are not in the budget.\n  That is the problem with this budget: It is not a true accounting of \nwhat is going to happen here. The result is precisely what Senator \nNelson described: We are going to be deep into the Medicare trust fund, \ndeep into the Social Security trust fund, because what we have here is \nnot a real budget.\n  I thank the Senator from Washington for the time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nWashington be given an additional 5 minutes because I used her time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time do I have total at this \npoint?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota used 3\\1/2\\ \nminutes. The Senator had 12\\1/2\\ minutes reserved. So now the Senator \nhas about 16 or 17 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Presiding Officer. And I thank the Senator \nfrom North Dakota for his tremendous leadership on this issue and for \nworking with us who serve on the Budget Committee in one of the best \nways I have ever seen, including, in the process, helping us to \nunderstand the true impact of this budget. I really want to let him \nknow how much I appreciate that.\n  Mr. President, as my colleagues know, the budget resolution before us \nprovides the framework for Federal budget priorities for the coming \nfiscal year. In fact, this debate and this budget are the most \nimportant things the Senate will do this year. The vote we take will \nhave a significant impact on our Nation's ability to meet our \nchallenges and to provide opportunity for America's working families.\n  But this vote isn't just about what happens to Americans a year from \nnow. It is about what happens to our country generations from now \nbecause this budget will have a major impact on the projected surplus \nand on future budgets.\n  Over the last 8 years, we learned what a difference a responsible \nbudget can make. We learned it starts with the basics--such as using \nreal numbers and not ``betting the farm'' on rosy projections. We \nlearned that if we invest in the American people and their needs, our \ncountry and our economy will also benefit. We learned we need to be \nfiscally responsible. That means making tough choices and holding the \nline on deficit spending. And we learned that we have to work together \nto get things done.\n  The last 8 years have shown us that if we follow those lessons--using \nreal numbers, investing in people, meeting our needs, being fiscally \nresponsible, and working together--we can turn deficits into surpluses, \nand we can transform the American economy into a job-creating machine.\n  Today, there is a new President in office. There is a new Congress. \nAnd there are new economic challenges as our economy slows and an \nenergy crisis grows.\n  Mr. President, the times are different, but the lessons are the same.\n  This isn't the time to throw away the handbook we have used for the \npast 8 years. It is time to follow the lessons it offers. \nUnfortunately, the administration and the Republican leadership are \nrunning in the opposite direction. And I fear we are going to repeat \nthe same mistakes of the past--mistakes that we are just now getting \nover. Let me say that again. The Republican budget ignores the lessons \nof the last 8 years. Instead of focusing on real numbers and realistic \nestimates, the Republican budget puts all its faith in projected \nsurpluses that may never materialize.\n  The things we know so far about this budget are disturbing. We know \nit is based on surplus estimates that may not come true. We know that \nit abandons fiscal responsibility in the name of a tax cut primarily \nbenefitting a few. We know that it fails to adequately meet the \npriorities and needs of the American people and the people of my home \nState. We know it fails to invest in our future economic security and \ncompetitiveness. And we know it fails to eliminate the $5.3 trillion in \ndebt that has accumulated over the past 20 years.\n  What we already know about this budget is enough to give us pause, \nbut what we don't yet know about this budget is enough to stop it cold. \nWe don't know what the surplus or the overall economy will look like a \nfew years from now. And today there are very real reasons to be \nconcerned. In my home State, and up and down the West Coast, we are \nexperiencing an energy crisis. Gasoline prices are skyrocketing, \nfactories are closing down,\n\n[[Page S4577]]\n\nand energy bills are up significantly. This energy crisis is having a \nnegative impact on the economy of the country--but this budget \nresolution and its projections do not take any of that into account.\n  This budget resolution is also silent on two major Bush proposals: \ndeveloping an unfettered missile defense system and privatizing Social \nSecurity.\n  Now, what is significant about these announcements is not just that \nthey represent major departures from past policy, but that they came \nwith no price tag. So, we have the President proposing to spend huge \nsums on these initiatives, but they are not accounted for in the budget \nproposal, that he presented, nor in the one being considered by this \nCongress.\n  Why would we as a country pass a budget that we know is based on \nshaky projections, that excludes huge bills we know we are going to \nhave to pay, and that forces cuts in vital services just to fund a tax \ncut that is tilted to just a few? Why are we proceeding down the \nslippery slope of rosy predictions and fiscal irresponsibility? \nFrankly, it is because it is the only way this President can pay for \nhis tax cut.\n  Democrats support a fair tax cut. All of us have been working on \nthat. We want a fair tax cut for middle-class Americans, and we are \nfighting for an immediate tax rebate that would put an average of $600 \nin your family's pocket this year. A tax cut is one of the many things \nAmericans deserve, but it is not the only thing. We also deserve a \nGovernment that stops corporate polluters, that supports the hiring of \nmore police officers and good teachers, and that strengthens Medicare \nwith a real prescription drug benefit. Americans do deserve to get a \ntax cut this year. After all, it is our money. But it is also our \nnational debt, our overcrowded classrooms, our prescription drug costs, \nand our drinking water. And we cannot walk away from those \nresponsibilities.\n  Finally, this budget does not address the needs of the American \npeople. I want to talk about some of those.\n  This budget eliminated the amendment that this Senate passed to \nincrease our investment in education. This budget falls short of our \ntargeted debt reduction goals. It fails to give communities the tools \nthey rely on to prepare for natural disasters and to limit their \ndamage. In fact, President Bush's budget eliminated a program called \nProject Impact, which is a predisaster program that saved lives and \nprevented damage during the February 28 earthquake that occurred in my \nhome State of Washington.\n  The President's budget also cut the Federal share of a program that \nhelps communities rebuild after disasters strike. The Senate passed my \namendment to restore those vital programs, but this budget resolution \ntook them out.\n  This budget eliminates the successful community-oriented COPS Program \nand other law enforcement programs that have helped thousands of \ncommunities achieve some of the lowest crime rates in a generation. The \npolice on our streets have worked to restore a measure of safety and \nsecurity in our communities, and this budget takes away that funding.\n  This budget also cuts the budget for Eximbank which allows our \nNation's industries to compete with highly subsidized foreign \ncompetitors. This budget also jeopardizes the Federal class size \ninitiative which has helped school districts hire 40,000 new qualified \nteachers so our kids can learn in a safe environment.\n  This budget cuts rural health care initiatives, including \ntelemedicine grants that literally provide a lifeline for remote and \nunderserved areas, and it cuts support to our family farmers who need \nit now more than ever. This budget does not invest enough in \nenvironmental restoration and conservation. It cuts research and \ndevelopment of renewable energy sources and energy conservation \nefforts.\n  This budget does not provide adequate funding for veterans programs \nfor which the House and the Senate voted. In fact, both Chambers told \nthe budget conferees to do better than the President's funding level. \nThe Republicans met behind closed doors and stuck us with the \nPresident's insufficient number. Not only did the conferees refuse to \nhonor the increases for veterans programs that were approved by both \nthe House and Senate, but they also discarded an amendment that I \nproudly cosponsored about concurrent receipt. The amendment that was \noffered by Senator Reid would have allowed our military retirees to \ncollect both their retirement pay and their disability benefits. Today, \nwe single out veterans by denying them these benefits.\n\n  The Senate passed an amendment that would have corrected that \ninjustice, but the Republican conferees, behind closed doors, when no \none was looking, dropped that critically important provision. America's \nveterans are big losers in this budget.\n  To me, that is another example of why this process should have been \nbipartisan and open from the start. By closing the door on \nbipartisanship, the conferees have left America's priorities behind.\n  Let me mention two more: prescription drugs for seniors and the \nFederal Government's obligation to clean up nuclear waste. On \nprescription drugs, we all know that the lack of affordable drug \ncoverage is a problem not just for those with low incomes, all seniors \nand the disabled face the escalating costs of prescription drugs and \nlack of affordable coverage. This issue did not go away the day after \nthe election. We know that a prescription drug benefit was estimated to \ncost $153 billion; that was originally. Now estimates show that it will \ntake about twice that amount to provide a real benefit. We know that \nseniors need an affordable drug benefit that is part of Medicare. The \nRepublican budget that we are looking at does not set aside enough \nmoney to provide that budget and that benefit. That is a promise all of \nus made in the last several years.\n  Let me turn to another example. This budget reduces the Federal \nGovernment's responsibility for the cleanup of nuclear materials and \nwaste. In Washington State, we face a tremendous challenge of cleaning \nup the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. Hanford cleanup has always been a \nnonpartisan issue, and I hope we can keep it that way. There were some \npress reports back in February that the Bush budget was going to cut \nthese important critical cleanup funds. I talked to the White House \nbudget Director, Mitch Daniels. He assured me there would actually be \nan increase in funding for the Hanford cleanup.\n\n  The President's proposed budget cut the nuclear cleanup program, \nwhich is assumed, by the way, in this conference report, and that would \nmake it very difficult to meet the Federal Government's legal \noperations in this area. Any retreat from our cleanup commitment will \nresult in a legal action by the State of Washington. To avoid that and \nto meet our legal obligations to clean up the Hanford Nuclear \nReservation, we need an increase of approximately $330 million. The \nprice of America's victory in World War II and the cold war is buried \nin underground storage tanks and in facilities, and we have a \nresponsibility, both morally and legally, to clean it up. That is not \nin the budget we are considering.\n  As you can see, this budget leaves a lot of American priorities \nbehind. It takes rosy projections. It leaves out major bills we know \nwill come due, and it puts a squeeze on hard-working families. We can \ndo a lot better.\n  We ought to be working together to come up with a proposal that is \nfair and balanced, that meets the needs of the American people.\n  This administration came to town and promised to restore \nbipartisanship and promised to reach across party lines to meet the \nchallenges of governing. This budget doesn't do that. As a member of \nthe joint House-Senate conference committee, I can tell my colleagues, \nSenator Conrad and I were not invited to that table. We were told our \npresence was not necessary. This partisan, back room dealing spells \ndisaster for the entire budget process. Adoption of this budget \nresolution is only the first step in a lengthy budget process. It is \nfar too early for this bipartisanship to break down now.\n\n  I am really disappointed in the decision to ignore many of the \nbipartisan amendments that were adopted in the Senate. As a member of \nthe Senate Appropriations Committee, I fear this kind of partisan tone \nwill make past budget battles pretty mild.\n  We have learned a lot about responsible budgeting over the last 8 \nyears. I\n\n[[Page S4578]]\n\nthink those lessons are being ignored in this budget resolution. I fear \nthat it is going to put us on the road to repeating the same costly \nmistakes of yesteryear.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this budget agreement. I hope we can \nsit down and work on a budget agreement that is bipartisan and that \nworks for the needs of the American people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington for \nher contribution tonight and, more importantly, for her contribution on \nthe Senate Budget Committee. She is one of the most valued Members on \nour side of the aisle. I believe she could have made a significant \ncontribution in the conference committee but, of course, we were \nexcluded from the conference committee.\n  Again, I thank Senator Murray for everything she has done as a member \nof the Budget Committee.\n  I believe the Senator from New Mexico wanted to deal with a unanimous \nconsent request.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Would the Senator permit me to talk to Senator Murray \nabout a mutual problem?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Certainly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I know we have an area of mutual concern with reference \nto defense cleanup that has to do with your State and has to do with \ntwo or three others, not as much with my State as other defense issues. \nI told you awhile ago that I was going to do my very best. We are short \na significant amount of money in the President's budget in terms of \ncleanup which will have a big effect on Idaho, your State, and South \nCarolina. I want you to know, I am still working on that.\n  Contrary to what some people would think, we can do it under this \nbudget. We are going to work very hard with you to see that we can.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if I could respond quickly, I thank the \nSenator from New Mexico. He has been a champion for our State in \nassuring that we have the cleanup dollars that are so drastically \nneeded. I know he understands the moral obligation we have to clean up \nthat site. So I thank him for his comments.\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. On behalf of the leader, I have a unanimous consent \nrequest in hand. I ask unanimous consent that all time be used or \nyielded back by the close of business this evening with the exception \nof the following: 40 minutes under the control of Senator Conrad or his \ndesignee, 30 minutes under the control of Senator Byrd or his designee, \nand 40 minutes under the control of Senator Domenici or his designee, \nwith 15 minutes of that time consumed just prior to the vote.\n  I further ask consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of \nthe conference report at 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, tomorrow, the vote \noccur on adoption of the conference report following the use or \nyielding back of the time as described in this unanimous consent \nagreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, in light of this agreement, there will \nbe no further votes this evening. I think most Senators will not be \nsurprised by that announcement. The next vote will occur at 11:30, or \nthereabouts, on Thursday, on the adoption of the budget resolution \nconference report. It is also my understanding, and the Senators should \nnote, that the two leaders would have leader time available for their \nuse prior to the vote. However, we would still expect the vote to occur \nat 11:30, or shortly thereafter, if the leaders use their allotted \ntime.\n  Mr. President, with that, I inquire, how many more Senators might \nspeak tonight?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am pleased to report that Senator Corzine is next for \n12 and a half minutes, and then we have Senator Levin, who has reserved \n12 and a half minutes. We are told by his staff he should be on his \nway. So then we will be able to wrap up quickly thereafter.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Fine. I have no objection to finishing up with two more \nDemocrats in a row. We have no Senators desiring to speak. They may \nspeak as part of my 40 minutes tomorrow.\n  With that, I thank the Senator for his cooperation today and his side \nof the aisle for the way they have handled the use of time, and I thank \nmy side of the aisle for placing so much faith in me that you left it \nall up to me. I wish you could have come down and I could have taken a \nrest.\n  I will have substantially more to say tomorrow with reference to \neducation, and one other item--the $500 billion contingency fund that \nremains in the budget to be used for other items beyond this budget. \nThat will be part of my wrap-up tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 12 and a half minutes to the \nSenator from New Jersey, Mr. Corzine. Before he starts that, I say to \nmy colleague, Senator Domenici, I think we have moved pretty well \ntoday. I thank the Senator very much for his leadership and his \ngraciousness during the day.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nconference report on the budget resolution.\n  Before I make specific comments on the resolution, let me express my \nsincere appreciation to the distinguished senator from North Dakota for \nhis leadership in revealing the hard truth about this budget. He has \ndone a truly outstanding job of analyzing, clarifying and revealing \nthis budget proposal for what it is--a overreaching, transparent \ndefense of a misguided and oversized tax cut.\n  I know all of us on this side of the aisle are grateful for Senator \nConrad's and his staff, disciplined and intellectually honest efforts.\n  I am new to the federal budget process. But I find virtually \neverything about this resolution, and the so-called process by which it \nwas developed, utterly mystifying. It appears to have been produced in \na partisan way with no meaningful input from Democrats--and with little \nregard for the Senate-passed version of the budget resolution. The \nconference report now has been put on the Senate floor with little \nopportunity to study the final numbers and language. And it leaves more \nquestions than it answers.\n  What we do know, is that its numbers are based on surplus projections \nthat are little more than guesses based on assumptions with incredibly \nreal world variability. What we do know, is that the resolution puts no \nnew money into education, the environment or other priorities. What we \ndo know, is that the resolution raids the Medicare Trust Fund.\n  What we do know, it that it does nothing to prepare for the future of \nSocial Security and the retirement of the baby boomers. And if changes \nin productivity and economic growth lead to a reduction in future \nrevenues, and Congress later, as expected, increases defense spending \nsubstantially, we clearly will be invading the Social Security Trust \nFund--an outcome anathema to senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. President, as most of my colleagues know, I used to run a major \ninvestment banking firm. We didn't plan with abstract numbers or set \ninflexible budgets that fixed policies for ten years without review. \nAnd I can tell you that if I ever presented a prospectus or budget plan \nto my management team or the investing public, and gave them 24 hours \nto review and approve it, I'd be opening myself up to an enforcement \naction by the SEC. And if I produced prospectus which ignored major \ncosts or risks that I knew our company would be facing, I could have \nfaced potential criminal liability.\n  Unfortunately, that's what's happening here in the United States \nSenate as we debate this budget resolution. And it's simply wrong.\n  We haven't had time to study it. There are a whole bunch of risks \nthat are ignored, and we are making commitments that go on far too long \nrelative to the priority mix that I think the country needs to address.\n  There are so many unanswered and unaddressed issues in this \nresolution that it's hard to know where to begin. But I'm profoundly \nconcerned that it fails to make needed investments in education. In my \nview, the people of New Jersey believe that nothing is more important \nfor the future of our country than investing in our kids, and\n\n[[Page S4579]]\n\nthey want a real partnership between the federal, state and local \ngovernments to pay for that investment.\n  New Jersey's citizens are fed up with property taxes having to bear \nthe major brunt of the costs of education. They want relief. They \nexpect the unfunded mandate of special education to be paid for by \nthose who create the mandates.\n  Unfortunately, the conferees rejected the Harkin amendment, a \nbipartisan effort to increase the Federal government's investment in a \nvariety of education programs. And the end result is a totally \ninadequate commitment to the many educational needs facing our country, \nfrom dilapidating schools to the need to reduce class sizes, to the \nneed to fully fund IDEA and Title I.\n  Unfortunately, education is just one of many priorities being ignored \nby this conference report. It also does too little to move forward in \nprotecting our environment, to keep our air and water clean, too little \nto provide prescription drug coverage for our seniors, too little to \nexpand health care coverage for the uninsured, and too little to \nstrengthen our national defense.\n  And, incredibly, we are turning our backs on the successful economic \nformula of the last few years: paying down the debt, and keeping \ninterest rates low so that the private sector isn't competing with the \nfederal government for scarce investment dollars.\n  All of these priorities have been sacrificed on the alter of huge tax \nbreaks--tax breaks that, in all likelihood, will be provided \ndisproportionately to the top one percent of taxpayers in our nation--\nthe most fortunate--those who have done the best, and who need help the \nleast.\n  I support cutting taxes--cutting them for the middle class. But the \nproposed mix of tax cuts we are about to debate and the subsequent \nlimitations on priority investments is flatout irresponsible.\n\n  In light of my experience in the private sector, it is hard for me to \ncomprehend why we would make such enormous long-term commitments based \non 10-year projections that nobody accepts as reliable.\n  After all, 1 year ago, CBO's then 10-year projection was lower by \n$2.4 trillion than this year's. Think about that. One year ago, we were \nprojecting $2.4 trillion less than what we are now using as the \nbaseline to make these tax cuts and set our investing priorities.\n  If last year's projection was so far off, for the life of me, I do \nnot understand why we can be so certain about this year's, and we want \nto set all these variables in place.\n  I also think it is remarkable that, even as we vote to establish this \nbudget, many around here already are talking about pushing beyond the \nresolution's limits. This conference report says we should have $1.35 \ntrillion of tax cuts over the next 11 years. I believe that is more \nthan we can afford. Yet many assume that Congress will soon violate \neven that limit with a series of additional tax breaks beyond those \nanticipated in this resolution, sort of the Lego approach to how we \nbuild things.\n  Forgive me for asking the obvious, but what is the point of having a \nbudget if you know you are going to ignore it? I am new around here; I \nadmit it. I am reluctant to cast aspersions based on only a few months \nof Senate service, but the more I see, the more I share Americans' deep \nfrustration with the political rhetoric that does not match the \ndiscipline that I think they expect us to bring to this budget process.\n  No legitimate business, no individual, no family would budget this \nway. None would completely ignore such huge unfunded liabilities. None \nwould rely on speculative 10-year projections to lock itself into vast, \npermanent commitments. None would adopt a budget knowing that it later \nwould be ignored. In the real world, it just would not happen. People \nwould get fired and creditors would just say no.\n  I hope my colleagues will forgive my frustration with this process \nand substance of this budget resolution. Maybe that is the way it works \naround here, but I believe this budget is wrong for our Nation and \nwrong for our future. I suspect it will pass, but for me I think we are \nmaking a very serious mistake--a serious mistake with regard to \npriorities, a serious mistake in locking in on a plan that gives us \nvery little flexibility down the road.\n  Simply put, I hope that many of my colleagues will rethink their \nviews, bring some flexibility to their own thinking and have a truly \nbipartisan approach to putting together this budget resolution.\n  The Senator from North Dakota has done a terrific job of informing \nus. I appreciate his help. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Corzine from New Jersey \nfor his remarks. He brings a special credibility to financial questions \ngiven the fact he was one of the most successful businessmen in America \nbefore he came to this Chamber, and given the fact that he was known \nfor his brilliant financial analysis. I thank him for commenting on \nthis process and outlining to colleagues the extraordinary divergence \nfrom how things would be done in the private sector, the really almost \nbreathtaking decisions that are being made based on a 10-year \nprojection that the people who made the forecast warn us of its \nuncertainty, the people who made the forecast telling us there is only \na 10-percent chance of this number coming true, a 45-percent chance \nthere will be more money, a 45-percent chance there will be less money, \nand we are rushing and betting the farm that it all comes true on a 10-\nyear forecast.\n  If that is conservative, I do not understand the meaning of the word. \nIt is not conservative. I think what is being done here borders on \nradical. I do not think there is a company in America that would make \ndecisions in the way they are being made in this budget.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan was recognized to be the \nnext speaker on our side. Does the Senator from Michigan seek 10 \nminutes?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would appreciate 10 minutes. That will be fine.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the budget resolution before us does not \noffer a fiscally responsible budget, and it should be rejected. It uses \nmost of the projected surplus for tax cuts that not only go mainly to \nupper income people but are also based on surplus projections which are \nhighly speculative.\n  I want to turn the attention of the Senate to this chart for a \nmoment. In 1985, we projected a deficit 5 years hence, in 1990, of $167 \nbillion. It turned out the deficit was much worse--by $50 billion. That \nwas an error rate of 30 percent in this 5-year projection.\n  Every single year in the last 10 years that we looked at these \nprojections, the error rates have averaged over 100 percent, with the \nsmallest error rate being 28.1 percent and the largest error rate being \nthe most recent one, a 268-percent error rate.\n  We talk about speculative projections. This is a 5-year projection. \nThat is how far off these projections have been for the last 10 years \nusing a 5-year projection. The budget resolution before us has a 10-\nyear projection. A 100-percent-plus error rate for the last 10 years \nand we are betting the economy on that kind of a wildly speculative \nprojection of surpluses down the road. To base permanent tax cuts on \nsuch projections is simply fiscally irresponsible.\n  Tax cuts should be based on real surpluses, not on far-off \nprojections. It would be far preferable to use most of the projected \nsurplus for debt reduction and a smaller immediate tax cut which would \ngive our economy a boost. That way, if the surplus projection is wrong, \nwe will not go back into a deficit ditch out of which we just climbed.\n  As for tax cuts beyond this year, we should have a smaller tax cut \nwhich helps middle-income and lower income people more and upper income \npeople less than the Bush tax proposals, and we should also give tax \nrelief to the 25 million working Americans who pay Federal payroll \ntaxes but who get no tax cut at all under the Bush proposal.\n\n  The budget resolution before us is fiscally irresponsible for other \nreasons as well. It is timed to be passed before we receive an expected \nrequest for a huge defense spending increase, which is going to follow \nthe strategic review due to be completed by the Secretary of Defense in \nthe next few months. The request for added defense dollars could well \nbe $250 billion over 10 years. It is going to be in that range, \nreliable reports indicate; $250 billion more for defense is likely to \nbe requested by the administration following the strategic review which \nis going to be completed\n\n[[Page S4580]]\n\nwithin the next few months. It just is simply not sound planning to \nrush to a judgment on a tax cut, as this resolution forces us to do, \nwith its 8-day deadline to the Finance Committee to write a huge Tax \nCode when we know, with reasonable certainty, that the administration \nwill be seeking a huge increase in the defense budget.\n  Because the projected surplus will have been used for the tax cut, \nthe defense increase will dig further into Medicare and Social Security \nsurpluses. I say ``further'' because does anyone here really seriously \ndoubt that there are going to be tax extenders which are going to be \nadded to the tax cut? Does anyone doubt that the tax-writing committees \nare going to avoid pushing additional millions of people into paying \nalternative minimum taxes? Does anyone here really doubt that there is \ngoing to be added interest costs that result from the budget resolution \nand its tax cuts?\n  I think it is clear, almost beyond any doubt, that there are going to \nbe tax extenders, there are going to be further interest costs as a \nresult of this budget resolution and its tax cuts, and that we are \ngoing to force millions of Americans to pay alternative minimum taxes. \nWhen all that happens, we have additional huge raids on Medicare and \nSocial Security. That is before the expected defense increase is \npresented to this Congress by the administration.\n  The budget resolution also violates the pledges to add money for \neducation. For instance, the Senate version of this budget resolution \nincluded the Harkin amendment and the Breaux-Jeffords amendment. Those \ntwo amendments alone projected $300 billion in added spending for \neducation. They were summarily dropped in conference.\n  The budget resolution will result in significant cuts in renewable \nenergy funding. Funds for energy research will be cut. There will be \ncuts in clean water infrastructure. It provides for cuts in clean air \nresearch and investment. All the rhetoric about a prescription drug \nprogram will go up in smoke because other Medicare programs are used in \nthis resolution to pay for the prescription drug benefit.\n  The opportunity to keep our economy sound, keep Social Security \nsound, to keep Medicare sound, to keep education commitments to our \nchildren, and to keep the commitment of a prescription drug program to \nour seniors, to keep our promises of environmental and alternative \nenergy initiatives--they are all thrown out the window in the frenzy of \nthis administration to give big tax cuts to upper income people.\n\n  This budget resolution represents a terrible application of fiscal \nand social responsibility. And it should be defeated.\n  I thank the Chair. I not only thank the ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, but I know that I add my voice to probably every voice on \nthis floor, even those who may vote for this budget resolution, but \nparticularly those of us on this side who rely so heavily on the \nranking member for his tenacious determination to simply get to the \nfacts--just the facts.\n  The good Member of this body from North Dakota has spent a huge \namount of his time and his life looking at numbers and looking at the \nfacts. He has given us some unvarnished information which is of immense \nvalue to this body. And as time goes on, I think we will realize the \ntruthfulness of it, and the honesty of those facts will regard him in \ngreater esteem, even if that is possible, for the courage that he \nbrings to this process, and the determination that this body, before it \nvotes on a budget resolution, understands fully the implications of \nwhat it is voting for and the fundamental underlying numbers which are \neither there or hidden and which are an important part of the future \neconomy of this country.\n  I want to add my personal thanks to him.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a chart setting forth the \nhistory of the unreliability of budget projections over the 10-year \nperiod I referred to be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        HISTORY OF UNRELIABILITY IN BUDGET PROJECTIONS: FIVE-YEAR PROJECTED V.

I thank the Chair and thank my good friend from North \nDakota for his extraordinary effort.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Michigan. Praise from him is high praise indeed. There is nobody \nthat I respect more in this Chamber than the Senator from Michigan. The \nSenator from Michigan is the ranking member on the Armed Services \nCommittee. He is our leader on defense issues.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise with regret to oppose this \nconference report on the budget resolution. I regret this Congress \nappears willing to turn its back on 8 years of fiscal responsibility \nand prudent stewardship of our Nation's resources.\n  The favorable surpluses that we enjoy today did not come quickly or \neasily. Many of our citizens experienced cuts in their benefits, and \nmany Members of Congress took some hard votes to get there. \nRegrettably, this Congress seems all too willing hurriedly to dissipate \nthat achievement.\n  The fiscal responsibility over the last 8 years has allowed the \nGovernment to pay down hundreds of billions of dollars of Federal debt, \nand it has allowed interest rates to remain lower than they otherwise \nwould have been, saving so many Americans billions of dollars on their \nmortgages, car loans, and student loans. We should continue to pay down \nthe debt.\n  Yes, taxpayers deserve tax relief. The surplus does give us a golden \nopportunity to cut taxes. I supported Senator Conrad's proposal to cut \ntaxes by $745 billion over the next 10 years. With its associated \ninterest costs, that package would have devoted roughly $900 billion to \ntax relief.\n  The tax cut in this conference report is too large and not \nresponsible. It seeks to devote $1.35 trillion to this one purpose. \nInterest costs could add another $400 billion to the cost. The budget \nresolution tax cut is thus almost twice the size of Senator Conrad's \nmore measured approach.\n  The budget resolution seeks to commit these resources all in one fell \nswoop before the projections of future surplus dollars have proved \nreal, before we have ensured the long-term solvency of the vital \nMedicare system, before we have brought that program up-to-date with \nneeded prescription drug and long-term-care benefits, and before we \nhave done a single thing to prepare the vital Social Security safety \nnet for the impending retirement of the baby boom generation. This \nbudget resolution addresses the Nation's needs in exactly the wrong \norder.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle have argued that we need to \nengage in this rush to cut taxes because if we don't, then Congress \nwill simply spend the money. I share the concern of many of my \nColleagues that the Government will spend more than it should.\n  But it appears that this massive tax cut is by no means abating the \nGovernment's appetite for spending. Just last Tuesday, for example, the \nWall Street Journal reported that the Pentagon wants $25 billion more a \nyear for new weapons alone a whopping 42 percent jump in the Pentagon's \nprocurement budget. And almost unbelievably, this budget resolution \ngives the Pentagon what amounts to a blank check to spend just what it \nwants. It contains a special reserve fund that allows for increases in \nmilitary spending if the President's National Defense Review just asks \nfor them.\n  Some argue that this tax cut will prevent unconstrained government \nspending. I am concerned that we will end up with both.\n  I share the unease expressed by Senator Sarbanes at a Budget \nCommittee hearing earlier this year, when he said that the powers-that-\nbe here in Washington appear to be taking the lid off of the punch \nbowl. Remembering the party that Washington had with the taxpayers' \nmoney in 1981, I am concerned about the hangover that will follow these \nfestivities today.\n\n[[Page S4581]]\n\n  Recall that back in 1981, they had surplus projections, too. In \nPresident Reagan's first budget, incorporating his major tax cut, the \nadministration projected a $28 billion surplus in the fifth year, 1986. \nIn the actual event, the federal government ran up a $221 billion \ndeficit in 1986. The Reagan budget was thus off by $249 billion in its \nfifth year alone. Over the 5 years covered by the Reagan budget, its \nprojections were off by a total of $921 billion.\n  Expressed relative to the government's total outlays, the first \nReagan budget's surplus projection for 1986 was off by an amount equal \nto fully a quarter of all the government's spending. Expressed as a \nshare of the gross domestic product, the first Reagan budget's surplus \nprojection for 1986 was off by 5.6 percent of the economy.\n  If this budget resolution conference report is off by the same share \nof the economy as President Reagan's budget was, it will miss the mark \nby $744 billion in the year 2006 alone and $2.9 trillion over 5 years.\n  As both Senators Conrad and Byrd have ably pointed out, the people \nwho make the surplus projections, the Congressional Budget Office, say \nin their own report that they regularly miss the mark in their \nprojections. CBO says that over the history of their 5-year \nprojections, they have been wrong in the fifth year by an average of \nmore than 3 percent of the gross domestic product. Thus, CBO says right \nin their own report that just their average error in the past would \nlead you to expect that they will be off by $412 billion in 2006.\n  We should not commit to massive tax cuts of the size in this \nconference report on the strength of these flimsy projections. Rather, \nwe should enact a moderately-sized tax cut now, and revisit the \npossibility of additional tax cuts in a few years if the projected \nsurpluses actually materialize.\n  And this budget resolution conference report also puts the Nation's \nneeds in the wrong order by committing to these massive tax cuts before \nwe have updated and ensured the long-term solvency of the Medicare \nsystem. In their 2001 annual report, concluded under the Bush \nAdministration, the Trustees of the Medicare Hospital Insurance trust \nfund project that its costs will likely exceed projected revenues \nbeginning in the year 2016. The Trustees say: ``Over the long range, \nthe HI Trust Fund fails by a wide margin to meet our test of financial \nbalance. The sooner reforms are made the smaller and less abrupt they \nwill have to be in order to achieve solvency through 2075.''\n  This budget resolution conference report puts the Nation's needs in \nthe wrong order by putting these massive tax cuts before extending the \nsolvency of Social Security. Social Security's Trustees remind us again \nthis year that when the baby-boom generation begins to retire around \n2010, ``financial pressure on the Social Security trust funds will rise \nrapidly.'' The Trustees project that, as with Medicare, Social Security \nrevenues will fall short of outlays beginning in 2016. The Trustees \nconclude: ``We should be prepared to take action to address the OASDI \nfinancial shortfall in a timely way because, as with Medicare, the \nsooner adjustments are made the smaller and less abrupt they will have \nto be.''\n  We know, these are not alarmist projections. These projections were \nsigned by, among others, Secretary of the Treasury Paul O'Neill, \nSecretary of Labor Elaine Chao, and Secretary of Health and Human \nServices Tommy Thompson. If the right hand of this Government knew what \nthe left hand was saying about our future commitments, we would not be \nacting first to cut taxes and only later taking steps to extend the \nlives of Medicare and Social Security.\n  This budget resolution addresses only one side of the Nation's needs. \nIt is a lopsided budget. And we can do better.\n  Let us not neglect our long-term commitments to Medicare and Social \nSecurity. Let us not squander years of efforts to balance the budget in \none great fiscal jubilee.\n  I urge my Colleagues to reject this conference report. And let us \nbegin to address the long-term needs of our Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada, Mr. Ensign.\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 86) to express the sense of the \n     Senate recognizing the important role played by the Small \n     Business Administration on behalf of the United States small \n     business community.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as has been the tradition for the past 38 \nyears, the President of the United States has issued a proclamation \ncalling for the celebration of Small Business Week. Today, we are in \nthe middle of Small Business Week 2001, which is being sponsored by the \nSmall Business Administration. The purpose of this week's celebration \nis to honor over 25 million businesses that make up the U.S. small \nbusiness community. It is very appropriate for us, today, to recognize \nthe importance of America's small businesses, and the significant role \nplayed by the Small Business Administration, SBA, in our Nation's \neconomic growth.\n  Congress established the SBA in 1953 to provide financial and \nmanagement assistance to start-up and growing small businesses. Over \nthe past 48 years, the success of SBA in meeting its missions is \nlegend. It maintains a portfolio of guaranteed small business loans and \ndisaster loans totaling more than $45 billion. And the Agency has \nguaranteed another $13 billion in venture capital investments to small \nbusinesses. To compliment it successful credit programs, the SBA's \nmanagement assistance programs were delivered to more than one million \nsmall businesses during the past fiscal year.\n  Over the past decade of record economic growth and prosperity, U.S. \nsmall businesses have been the engine driving our economy. More than \n99% of all employers in the United States are small businesses, \nproviding nearly 75% of the net new jobs added to our workforce. Small \nbusinesses have proven, year-in and year-out, that they are a potent \nforce in the economy, accounting for 51% of the private sector output. \nAnd their sights are not set just at home; leading the way toward a \nglobal economy, the small business community represents 96% of all U.S. \nexporters.\n  Over the past 6 years I have been the chairman of the Committee on \nSmall Business, and I have witnessed the enormous potential of \nAmerica's small businesses at work. They are flexible; they are \ncreative; they give us jobs; they provide economic growth; and most \nimportantly, they provide hope and a future for millions of families \nand communities across our great nation.\n  The resolution now before the Senate recognizes the critical role \nplayed by small businesses and the Small Business Administration in \nthis business community. It is appropriate that we take a moment from \nour hectic lives to acknowledge the success of small businesses and to \nencourage our federal government to continue to provide its help to \ninsure future successes.\n  I urge each of my colleagues to vote for the Small Business \nresolution as a way to thank the SBA and the small business community \nfor its contributions to our Nation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this legislation reauthorizes the Small \nBusiness Administration's Small Business Technology Transfer Program. \nThe STTR program funds cooperative R projects between small companies \nand research institutions as an incentive to advance the nation's \ntechnological progress. For those of us who were here when Congress \ncreated this program in 1992, we will remember that we were looking for \nways to move research from the laboratories to market. What could we do \nto keep promising research from stagnating in Federal labs and research \nuniversities? Our research in this country is world renowned, so it \nwasn't a question of good science and engineering. We, without a doubt, \nhave one of the finest university systems in the world, and we have \noutstanding research institutions. What we needed was more development, \ndevelopment of innovative technology. We needed a system that would \ntake this research and find ways it could be applied to everyday life \nand national priorities. One such company is Sterling Semiconductor. \nSterling, in conjunction with the University of Colorado, has developed \nsilicon carbide wafers for use in semiconductors that can withstand \nextreme temperatures and conditions. In addition to defense \napplications, these wafers can be used for everything from traffic \nlights to automobile dashboards and communications equipment.\n  With technology transfer, it was not just the issue of the tenured \nprofessor who risked security if he or she left to try and \ncommercialize their research; it was also an issue of creating \nbusinesses and jobs that maximized the contributions of our scientists \nand engineers once they graduated. There simply weren't enough \nopportunities at universities and labs for these bright individuals to \ndo research and development. The answer was to encourage the creation \nof small businesses dedicated\n\n[[Page S4583]]\n\nto research, its development, and ultimately moving that research out \nof the lab and finding a commercial application.\n  We knew that the SBA's existing Small Business Innovation Research \n(SBIR) program had proven to be extremely successful over the previous \nten years, so we established what is now known as the Small Business \nTechnology Transfer program. The STTR program complements the SBIR \nprogram. Whereas the SBIR program funds R projects at small \ncompanies, STTR funds cooperative R projects between a small company \nand a research institution, such as a university or Federally funded \nR lab. The STTR program fosters development and commercialization of \nideas that either originate at a research institution or require \nsignificant research institution involvement, such as expertise or \nfacilities, for their successful development.\n  This has been a very successful program. One company, Cambridge \nResearch Instruments of Woburn, Massachusetts, has been working on an \nSTTR project with the Marine Biological Lab in Woods Hole. They have \ndeveloped a liquid crystal-based polarized light microscope for \nstructural imaging. While that is a mouthful, I'm told that it helps in \nmanufacturing flat screen computer monitors, and even helps improve the \nin vitro fertilization procedure. Together this company and the lab \nexpect to have sales in excess of $1 million dollars next year from \nthis STTR project.\n  As this example illustrates, the STTR program serves an important \npurpose for this country's research and development, our small \nbusinesses, our economy, and our nation. The program is set to expire \nat midnight on Sunday, September 30th. By the way, we absolutely have \nno intention of letting reauthorization get down to the wire, which was \nthe unfortunate fate of the reauthorization of the SBIR program last \nyear. I have worked in partnership with Senator Bond to develop this \nlegislation, and as part of the process we have consulted with and \nlistened to our friends in the House, both on the Small Business \nCommittee and the Science Committee. We do not see this legislation as \ncontentious, and we have every intention of seeing this bill signed \ninto law well before September.\n  Shaping this legislation has gone beyond policy makers; we have \nreached out to small companies that conduct the STTR projects and \nresearch universities and Federal labs. On my part, I sponsored two \nmeetings in Massachusetts on March 16th to discuss the STTR program. At \nmy office in Boston, there was a very helpful discussion with six of \nMassachusetts' research universities expressing what they like and \ndislike about the program, and why they use it, or don't use it more. \nThe meeting included the licensing managers from Boston University, \nHarvard, MIT, Northeastern University, and the University of \nMassachusetts. They said they need to hear more about the STTR program \nand have more outreach to their scientists and engineers so that they \nunderstand when and how to apply for the program. Based on their \nsuggestions, we've included an outreach mandate in our bill. In \naddition, we're trying to provide SBA with more resources in its Office \nof Technology to be responsive to the concerns of STTR institutions and \nsmall businesses.\n  Later that day, my office was part of a meeting in Newton at \nInnovative Training Systems in which about 20 leaders and \nrepresentatives of small high-tech companies talked about the SBIR and \nSTTR programs. They make a tremendous contribution to the economy and \nstate of Massachusetts. They said that the Phase II award for STTR \nshould be raised from $500,000 to $750,000 to be consistent with the \nSBIR program. Otherwise, since a minimum of 30 percent of the award \ngoes to the university partner, it was too little money to really \ndevelop the research.\n\n  As I said, we listened to them. And we also listened to what the \nprogram managers of the participating agencies had to say. Agencies \nparticipate in this program if their extramural R budget is greater \nthan $1 billion. Consequently, there are five eligible agencies: the \nDepartment of Defense, the Department of Energy, the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, and the National Science Foundation. For the STTR \nprojects, they set aside .15 percent of their extramural R budget. \nThat comes to about $65 million per year invested in these \ncollaborations between small business and research institutions.\n  Combining all the suggestions for improvement, the STTR Program \nReauthorization Act of 2001 does the following:\n  1. It reauthorizes the program for nine years, setting the expiration \ndate for September 30th, 2010.\n  2. Starting in two years, FY2003, it raises in small increments the \npercentage that Departments and Agencies set aside for STTR R In \nFY2004, the percentage increases from .15 percent to .3 percent. After \nthree years, in FY2007, the bill raises the percentage from .3 percent \nto .5 percent.\n  3. Starting in two years, FY2003, the legislation raises the Phase II \ngrant award amount from $500,000 to $750,000.\n  4. It requires the participating agencies to implement an outreach \nprogram to research institutions in conjunction with any such outreach \ndone with the SBIR program.\n  5. As last year's legislation did for the SBIR program, this bill \nstrengthens the data collection requirements regarding awards and the \ndata rights for companies and research institutions that conduct STTR \nprojects. The goal is to collect better information about the companies \ndoing the projects, as well as the research and development, so that we \ncan measure success and track technologies.\n  While I believe that these changes reflect common sense and are \nreasonable, I would like to discuss two of the proposed changes.\n  First, I would like to talk about reauthorizing the program for nine \nyears. The STTR program was a pilot program when it was first enacted \nin 1992. Upon review in 1997, the results of the program were generally \ngood and the program was reauthorized that year. A more recent review \nand study of the program shows that the program has become more \nsuccessful as it has had more time to develop. Specifically, the \ncommercialization rate of the research is higher than for most research \nand development expenditures. Further, universities and research \ninstitutions have developed excellent working relationships with small \nbusinesses, and the program has also had good geographic diversity, \ninvolving small companies and research institutions throughout the \ncountry. The nine-year reauthorization will allow the agencies, small \nbusinesses and universities to gradually ramp up to the higher \npercentage in a predictable and orderly manner.\n  Second, I would like to talk about the gradual, incremental increases \nin the percentages reserved for STTR contracts and the increase in the \nPhase II awards. When we reached out to the small businesses and the \nresearch institutions that conduct STTR projects, and the program \nmanagers of the five agencies that participate in the STTR program, we \nheard two recurring themes: one, raise the amount of the Phase II \nawards; and two, increase the amount of the percentage reserved for \nSTTR projects.\n  Speaking to the first issue, we heard that the Phase II awards of \n$500,000 generally are not sufficient for the research and development \nprojects and should be increased to $750,000, the same as the SBIR \nPhase II awards, to make the awards worth applying for the small \nbusinesses and research institutions.\n  As for the second issue, we were told that the percentage of .15 \nreserved for STTR awards needed to be increased in order to better meet \nthe needs of the agencies. Last year, that .15 percent of the five \nagencies' extramural research and development budgets amounted to a \ntotal $65 million dollars available for small businesses and research \ninstitutions to further develop research and transfer technology from \nthe lab to market through the STTR program. Less than a quarter of one \npercent to help strengthen this country's technological progress is not \nextravagant; in fact, it is not adequate support for this important \nsegment of the economy.\n  Nevertheless, we are very conscientious about the needs of the \ndepartments and agencies to meet their missions for the nation and have \nproposed gradual increases that take into full consideration the \nrealities of implementing the changes for the agencies\n\n[[Page S4584]]\n\nand departments that participate in the program. Consequently, the \nlegislation does not increase the percentage for STTR awards until two \nfull years after the program has been reauthorized.\n  We are also conscientious about the fact that we want more research, \nnot less, so we have timed the increase of the Phase II awards to \ncoincide with the initial percentage increase reserved for STTR \nprojects.\n  Overall, we believe this gradual increase will help encourage more \ninnovation and greater cooperation between research institutions and \nsmall businesses. As the program requires, at least 30 percent of these \nadditional funds will go to university and research institutions. Not \nonly do the universities and research institutions that collaborate \nwith small businesses get 30 percent of the STTR award money for each \ncontract, they also benefit in that they often receive license fees and \nroyalties. We are also conscientious about being fiscally responsible, \nthe percentage increases will have no budget implication since it does \nnot increase the amount of the money spent. Rather, it ultimately, \nafter six years, redirects one half of one percent to this very \nsuccessful program which benefits the economy overall.\n  This bill will ensure that this successful program is continued and \nincreased. It will also provide Congress with important information and \ndata on the program and encourage more outreach to small businesses and \nresearch institutions.\n  Mr. President, I want to encourage my colleagues to learn about this \nprogram, to find out the benefits to their state's hi-tech small \nbusinesses and research universities and labs, and to join me in \npassing this legislation in the Senate as soon as possible. To my \nfriend from Missouri, Senator Bond, I want to thank you and your staff \nfor working with me and my staff to build this country's technological \nprogress. I also want to thank all of the cosponsors: Senators Cleland, \nLandrieu, Bennett, Levin, Lieberman, Harkin, Bingaman, Enzi and \nCantwell.\n  Mr. President, I ask that my statement and a copy of the bill be \nincluded in the Record.\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

CONCERNING THE PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE \n                   WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO).\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Good health is important to every citizen of the world \n     and access to the highest standards of health information and \n     services is necessary to improve the public health.\n       (2) Direct and unobstructed participation in international \n     health cooperation forums and programs is beneficial for all \n     parts of the world, especially with today's greater potential \n     for the cross-border spread of various infectious diseases \n     such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis, \n     and malaria.\n       (3) Taiwan's population of 23,500,000 people is larger than \n     that of \\3/4\\ of the member states already in the World \n     Health Organization (WHO).\n       (4) Taiwan's achievements in the field of health are \n     substantial, including one of the highest life expectancy \n     levels in Asia, maternal and infant mortality rates \n     comparable to those of western countries, the eradication of \n     such infectious diseases as cholera, smallpox, and the \n     plague, and the first to eradicate polio and provide children \n     with hepatitis B vaccinations.\n       (5) The United States Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention and its Taiwan counterpart agencies have enjoyed \n     close collaboration on a wide range of public health issues.\n       (6) In recent years Taiwan has expressed a willingness to \n     assist financially and technically in international aid and \n     health activities supported by the WHO.\n       (7) On January 14, 2001, an earthquake, registering between \n     7.6 and 7.9 on the Richter scale, struck El Salvador. In \n     response, the Taiwanese government sent 2 rescue teams, \n     consisting of 90 individuals specializing in firefighting, \n     medicine, and civil engineering. The Taiwanese Ministry of \n     Foreign Affairs also donated $200,000 in relief aid to the \n     Salvadoran Government.\n       (8) The World Health Assembly has allowed observers to \n     participate in the activities of the organization, including \n     the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1974, the Order of \n     Malta, and the Holy See in the early 1950's.\n       (9) The United States, in the 1994 Taiwan Policy Review, \n     declared its intention to support Taiwan's participation in \n     appropriate international organizations.\n       (10) Public Law 106-137 required the Secretary of State to \n     submit a report to the Congress on efforts by the executive \n     branch to support Taiwan's participation in international \n     organizations, in particular the WHO.\n       (11) In light of all benefits that Taiwan's participation \n     in the WHO can bring to the\n\n[[Page S4585]]\n\n     state of health not only in Taiwan, but also regionally and \n     globally, Taiwan and its 23,500,000 people should have \n     appropriate and meaningful participation in the WHO.\n       (b) Plan.--The Secretary of State is authorized--\n       (1) to initiate a United States plan to endorse and obtain \n     observer status for Taiwan at the annual week-long summit of \n     the World Health Assembly in May 2001 in Geneva, Switzerland; \n     and\n       (2) to instruct the United States delegation to Geneva to \n     implement that plan.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 14 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a \n     written report to the Congress in unclassified form \n     containing the plan authorized under subsection (b).\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

Mr. President, I rise today to draw my colleagues \nattention to an on-going problem that impacts our national security--\nparts shortages for the C-5. I know it may surprise some that I say \nthis is a national security problem. Well, it is. My colleagues on the \nArmed Services Committee and on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee \nare not surprised. They know how vital strategic airlift is to national \nsecurity. They also know that C-5s are the backbone of our strategic \nairlift capability. Working with the C-17, the C-5 provides the airlift \nneeded for both wars and for humanitarian missions.\n  For those who have not spent as much time on the issue, let me \nexplain. The C-5 can carry more cargo, farther than any other plane in \nthe American military. It is what brings the big, heavy stuff to the \nfight. For example, C-5s brought precision munitions into our major \nEuropean bases for Allied Force in Kosovo. Once the big loads are \nbrought into a theater, where necessary the C-17 then moves the \nequipment and supplies around the theater. As the Commander in Chief of \nUnited States Transportation Command has said many times, seventy \npercent of the cargo most needed in the first 30 days by the warfighter \ncan only be airlifted on a C-5 or a C-17. And, by the way, this is \nstuff we'll need even if we get lighter and more mobile because time \nwill always matter and the more we can get to the fight quickly, the \nbetter our military position.\n  In addition to our warfighting needs, America uses the C-5 to promote \ngoodwill and to help those made needy by natural disasters. C-5s are \nalmost always involved in providing humanitarian assistance. For \nexample, large desalinization plants to provide drinkable water must go \non the C-5. So must the Fairfax Search and Rescue Team that we heard so \nmuch about after earthquakes in Turkey and Taiwan.\n  To get back to my earlier point, America is a global power that needs \na healthy C-5 fleet. One major factor in low mission capable rates and \nlower airlift capacity has been a lack of parts for the C-5. In short, \nwithout parts, C-5s are not available to the Nation.\n  Because I was seeing the impact of this on a regular basis at Dover \nAir Force Base, in my State of Delaware, I thought it was important to \ntake a closer look at this problem. What I was seeing was maintenance \ncrews being overworked on a regular basis because there were no parts \navailable to repair planes. In order to keep C-5s flying, two or more \nC-5s had to be turned into ``hangar queens'' or ``cann-birds''. Sad \nterms that describe million dollar airplanes that must be used to \nprovide parts for other planes. Parts are taken from that plane and \nthen put into another plane that needs that part. This process, called \naircraft cannibalization, cost the Logistics Groups at Dover over $2.77 \nmillion for Fiscal Year 1999 according to an independent review of \nLogistics cost done for Air Mobility Command.\n  Cannibalization not only wastes money, it also requires significantly \nmore work hours to open up an airplane, remove a part, open up the \nother airplane and install the part, and then eventually install a \nreplacement part in the original airplane. This process also increases \nthe risk that something else on the cann-bird will break or that the \npart itself will break. The end result was that morale was low because \nwithout an adequate supply of spare and repair parts, inefficient \nprocedures had become standard practice. In addition, the overall \nhealth of the C-5 fleet suffered.\n  As I became more aware of the impact this lack of parts was having on \nmorale and the readiness of the C-5 fleet two years ago, I brought then \nSecretary of Defense Bill Cohen to Dover to make him aware of the \nproblem.\n  While I believe that visit was helpful, it was clear to me that \ncontinued attention to the issue was necessary. That led me to write a \nshort report on the issue. I have sent copies of the report to my \ncolleagues in the Senate.\n  The report seeks to explain the important role played by the C-5, the \nextent of the parts problem for the C-5, the impact those parts \nshortages have had on the fleet and those who work on the C-5, and to \ndescribe the failures in logistics system management that\n\n[[Page S4586]]\n\nmade the problem even worse. I hope that my colleagues will take the \ntime to review the report and will reach the same conclusions that I \ndid. In the end, it was clear to me that we must do three things.\n  First, we must continue to increase funding for parts and keep it \npredictable.\n  Second, we must completely modernize the C-5 fleet with new avionics \nand the Reliability Enhancement and Re-engining Program.\n  Third, we must continue to promote smart management reform throughout \nthe defense logistics system.\n  Again, I know that none of this is news to my colleagues on the \ndefense committees who have provided so much leadership and support for \naddressing these challenges, but I hope the report will be helpful to \nthem and their staffs and to other colleagues.\n  I know that spare and repair parts is not glamorous, but it is vital \nto America's ability to protect and promote our national security. For \nthat reason, we must build on the good work done by the defense \ncommittees over the past four years to begin to solve the parts \nshortage problem and ensure that we do not lose sight of what must be \ndone now and in the future to eliminate the problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/09/senate-section/article/S4586-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4586]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I rise to offer a few observations \nregarding the President's speech at the National Defense University \nregarding missile defense and the future security of our nation. The \nPresident was quite correct in describing today's world as one that is \nfar different from the days of the Cold War some thirty years ago. \nHowever, his prescription for how best to ensure our national security \nand achieve a more peaceful world is seriously flawed. The President \nhas assigned the nation's highest military priority to building a \nrobust missile defense that will cost tens of billions of dollars \nduring the coming decade with no assurance that the system of \ninterceptors will work. The primary objective of such a system, in his \nview, is to counteract intercontinental missiles carrying weapons of \nmass destruction from targeting our nation. I would urge the President \nto take a step back; a more effective and higher priority approach \nwould be to cut off weapons of mass destruction at their source, before \nthey are in the hands of our potential enemies. The greatest potential \nsource of those weapons, materials, and technological expertise resides \nin Russia, and therein lies the fundamental key to our national and \nglobal security.\n  The President's view of Russia misunderstands this important point. \nWhile it is true that, in the President's words, Russia is no longer a \ncommunist country and that its president is an elected official, it \ndoes not follow that we needn't worry about the security threat which \nit can pose to the United States and our allies. Indeed, there are very \ndisturbing stories in the press about the internal dynamics of the \nRussian government and its fragile democratic ways. Its economy remains \nin dire straits, unemployment is high, and the future, particularly for \nthose who live outside of Moscow, continues to look grim. I'm certain \nthat many of us were alarmed at the recent mutual recriminations and \ndismissals of dozens of Americans and Russians in an exchange that \nhearkened back to Cold War days.\n  In Russia's weakened state, I believe it poses an even greater threat \nto the United States than the ``nations of concern'' that we hear about \nso often. Why is that? Aside from the United States, Russia is the most \nadvanced nation in the world to possess advanced missile technologies \nand weapons of mass destruction. Its scientific expertise is second \nonly to our own. Weapons of mass destruction, including chemical, \nbiological, and nuclear weapons, number in the tens of thousands, and \nmaterials that go into making those weapons are widely distributed, and \npoorly guarded, around Russia. If countries of concern pose a serious \nthreat to the United States, it is likely that the tools underlying \nthose threats have been or could most easily be gained from the most \nlikely source, a cash-strapped, antagonistic Russia.\n  Senior advisors to the Secretary of Energy, including former Senators \nHoward Baker and Sam Nunn, recently released a report that stated, \n``The most urgent unmet national security threat to the United States \ntoday is the danger that weapons of mass destruction or weapons-usable \nmaterial in Russia could be stolen and sold to terrorists or hostile \nnation states . . . .'' Having reviewed the scope of the WMD threat in \nRussia, the Secretary of Energy's Advisory Board recommended that the \nUnited States spend $30 billion over the next decade to secure those \nweapons and materials, and to prevent Russia's technological expertise \nfrom finding paychecks in the wrong places. Despite that \nrecommendation, the President has submitted a budget request to the \nCongress that cuts funding for those programs by $100 million below \nwhat was appropriated a year ago. In fact, this year's funding request \nis over $500 million below what was planned for FY 2002 just twelve \nmonths ago. I question why the President would choose to cut funding \nfor programs that constitute the nation's ``most urgent unmet threat.'' \nIn light of the imposing costs of a robust missile defense system, it \nappears that the Administration has determined that such \nnonproliferation programs are of secondary importance.\n\n  Listening to the President's speech, I'm concerned that his vision of \nmissile defense has all the characteristics of the boy sticking his \nfinger in the dike. What's really needed is a new and stronger dike. I \nbelieve we must redouble our efforts to support critical \nnonproliferation programs with Russia as the first line of our own \ndefense and national security interest. Investing tens of billions of \ndollars in a missile defense program as an alternative approach \nvirtually insures the acceleration of proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction if the nation reduces funding for nonproliferation programs \nas a result. The President and his advisors are missing the forest for \nthe trees.\n  Let me add one additional thought. Countries of concern that may be \ngenuinely interested in using weapons of mass destruction against us or \nour allies are likely to choose methods that are affordable, effective, \nand unanticipated. An intercontinental ballistic missile could be one \nway to achieve their goal, but there are other, less expensive and more \nprobable ways. Potential enemies seeking to disrupt and destroy the \nU.S. and our friends, for example, could achieve their aims through \nweapons delivered in suitcases, small boats, or delivery vans. If the \nUnited States devotes its attention, resources, and expertise to solve \nthe potential intercontinental missile threat without addressing the \npossibility of low tech applications of weapons of mass destruction, we \nwill have made a very grave error. I urge my colleagues, Mr. President, \nnot to be lulled into a false sense of security regarding plans for a \nrobust missile defense of our nation. As with the case of the dike, \ndeployment of a missile defense system\n\n[[Page S4587]]\n\nmay simply redirect the flow of the threat.\n  That assumes, that we actually have a missile defense system that \nworks. We are a long, long way from that capability, a fact that I hope \nthat we in the Senate and the American people fully understand. I am \npleased that the President did not announce the unilateral abrogation \nof the ABM Treaty in that regard. It would be foolhardy, in my opinion, \nto step back from our legal obligations under that Treaty without \nhaving the means to defend ourselves--a missile defense system that \nworks. Make no mistake, my colleagues, the unilateral abrogation of the \nABM Treaty will have major negative security consequences for the \nUnited States and our allies and friends. I urge my colleagues, \nregardless of how they feel about the ABM Treaty, to join me and other \nsenators to insist that any missile defense system be successfully \ntested in realistic operational conditions before making any decision \nto deploy it. The American taxpayer being asked to provide tens of \nbillions of dollars to support that effort, not to mention the men and \nwomen in uniform who would operate it, deserve nothing less than a \nsystem that works.\n  I applaud the President's desire for building cooperative \nrelationships that should be ``reassuring, rather than threatening . . \n. . premised on openness, mutual confidence and real opportunities for \ncooperation, including the area of missile defense.'' There are many \nimportant ways to achieve those goals that are currently at risk in the \nworsening climate of U.S.-Russian relations, particularly if the \nPresident chooses to abrogate the ABM Treaty either in word or in deed. \nCooperation and reassurance are important byproducts of our \nnonproliferation programs in Russia that have yielded major dividends \nin preventing the loss of weapons and materials of mass destruction to \nthose who would be our enemies. Greater emphasis, not less, is needed \nfor such programs. In addition, we have made important confidence-\nbuilding progress in cooperative approaches regarding early warning of \nmissile attacks through the establishment of a data center and research \nbeing conducted on the Russian American Observation Satellite program. \nI am deeply concerned that such confidence-building programs will be at \nrisk should confrontational relations with Russia continue to increase. \nIf that occurs, the ultimate loser could be ourselves in a less secure \nworld of our own making.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/09/senate-section/article/S4587-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I often rise on the floor of the \nSenate and put on my ``veterinarian hat'' when talking about food \nsafety, animal science or even small business issues. Today, I rise to \nrecognize this week as National Pet Week and say a brief word about the \nrole of pets in our lives. Events taking place all over the Nation this \nweek are designed to remind us of the value of pets.\n  Sponsored by several leading veterinary organizations, principally \nthe American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA), National Pet Week \ngives those of us in the animal health field an opportunity to \ncelebrate the bond between pets and their owners and address the \nimportance of responsible pet ownership. Pets are important members of \nover half the households in America. They can be many different things \nto many different people. A pet can be a hunting companion, someone to \nplay catch with, something warm to curl up on your lap, an additional \nranch hand, a guide, a guardian, or a child's best friend. Indeed, \ncompanionship is often the most important aspect in the relationship \nbetween pet and owner.\n  In the past 25 years, we have come to accept the human-animal bond as \nan important force. We understand that the bond exists, but it is hard \nto define. The AVMA gives us this definition:\n\n       The human-animal bond is a mutually beneficial and dynamic \n     relationship between people and animals that is influenced by \n     behaviors that are essential to the health and well-being of \n     both. This includes but is not limited to, emotional, \n     psychological and physical interaction of people, animals and \n     the environment.\n\n  The fact is, the addition of a pet to someone's life can do amazing \nthings. Studies have shown that the recovery time and survival rate of \npeople with serious illness can be improved when a pet is part of the \nequation. The benefits of pets to the blind and disabled are also well \nknown. All over the world, dogs are trained to complete a variety of \ntasks to assist the disabled in living their lives. Programs to train \ndogs and place them with disabled owners thrive in every State. The \nwork that they do and the good that results should not go unnoticed. \nThese organizations build new bridges using the human-animal bond \nformula and enrich lives in so many ways.\n  Connections between pets and children are well known. Pets can help \nteach children responsibility, respect and compassion. They can add to \na child's growth and development in so many ways. Most of us can \ncertainly remember our first family pet with fond memories. The other \npart of National Pet Week is pet health. It is certainly true that a \nhealthy pet is a happy pet. Regular veterinarian visits are indeed \nimportant and are part of the responsibility as an owner and as a \nfamily member. Nutritional care, adequate exercise and proper attention \nto general health concerns are all necessary in the ownership of a pet \nand can go a long way in increasing the quality of an animal's life.\n  So I would like to ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing \nNational Pet Week, and if you have a pet at home, give it an extra hug, \na pat on the head or a good scratch in that favorite spot when you get \nhome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/09/senate-section/article/S4587-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 NATIONAL DANCE INSTITUTE IN NEW MEXICO\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to commend a friend, \nVal Diker, for her unflagging efforts in support of the National Dance \nInstitute in New Mexico. As many of my colleagues know, the NDI was \nfounded by the renowned dancer, Jacques d'Amboise, to introduce school \nchildren to dance. His dream has been extremely successful in New \nMexico in the eight years since it was started here. This year alone \nthere are 2400 students in 32 schools involved in the program.\n  This weekend, five hundred of these students will appear on the stage \nof the newly-refurbished, historic Lensic Theatre to honor the program \nand Val Diker, the Founding Chairman. Making our state her ``second \nhome,'' Val is a leading contributor with her time, talent and treasure \nto institutions New Mexicans love. Her leadership in NDI, however, is \nparticularly appreciated by all who value those who give and do so much \nto help children. Val has made a difference in lives of children she'll \nnever see, and for that she deserves our heartfelt thanks. She, and \nthis wonderful institute, certainly have mine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/09/senate-section/article/S4587-4", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4587-S4588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN RECOGNITION OF JOE B. MURRAY\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I recently received a copy of To \nBe as Brave, a collection of memoirs of Joe B. ``Bob'' Murray. This \nfine book tells the story of a great American, who evolved from an East \nTexas farm boy\n\n[[Page S4588]]\n\ninto a valiant soldier who defended his nation during World War II. Bob \ngrew up in Spring Hill, Texas, and shortly after his high school \ngraduation in 1944, he left Texas for Europe and the heart of World War \nII. Although he was trained for combat against the Japanese in the \nPacific, Bob was sent to the Alsace region of France to join a regiment \nthat had been devastated by Hitler's counteroffensive.\n  Bob proudly served in B Company of the 157th Infantry Regiment of the \n45th Division. His regiment was given the herculean task of breaching \nthe Siegfried Line and entering Germany. The young men succeeded beyond \nanyone's expectations by breaking the Siegfried Line in less than a \nweek, when the high command predicted that it could take up to three \nmonths. After entering Germany, his regiment continued to move eastward \nto protect General Patton's right flank by clearing the territory of \nenemy troops. The division was so successful that General Patton lauded \nthem as ``one of the best, if not the best, division in the history of \nAmerican arms.''\n  The 45th Division later entered Dachau and liberated tens of \nthousands of prisoners in several concentration camps. Bob was proud to \nbring hope and freedom to thousands of captives. Bob's regiment was \nthen assigned the often difficult task of maintaining law and order in \nMunich, as the war was brought to an end.\n  After World War II, Bob continued to demonstrate his patriotism by \nenlisting as a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division during the \nKorean War. He later had a successful career as an oil and gas \nconsultant in my home state of New Mexico. Bob is married to his \nchildhood sweetheart, Dulcia, and last year, they celebrated their 50th \nwedding anniversary.\n  To Be as Brave is an excellent book and it celebrates the life of an \noutstanding patriotic American, Mr. Joe B. Murray. I thank Joe for my \ncopy of his book and salute his exceptional service to our \nNation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/09/senate-section/article/S4588-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN HONOR OF GLADYS AND ABRAHAM BARRON\n\n Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is a special honor for me today \nto ask all of my colleagues in the United States Senate to join me in \ncommemorating the 60th Wedding Anniversary on April 3, 2001 and the \nBat- and Bar-Mitzvah on May 18, 2001 of Gladys and Abraham Barron of \nCenterville, Massachusetts.\n  Gladys, born in Roxbury, Massachusetts, of immigrant parents on May \n19, 1921, spent her youth in Revere, MA, and graduated from Revere High \nSchool. When she was 20, she married Abraham Barron on April 3, 1941.\n  Abraham had emigrated from Kiev, Russia when he was two-years old and \nsettled in Chelsea with his mother. He graduated from Chelsea High \nSchool and began to learn the welder's trade. Following his marriage to \nGladys in 1941, his father-in law introduced him to the hat-maker's \ntrade. Abe became so proficient and so gifted in the art of fashioning \ncaps and hats that his colleagues bestowed on him the soubriquet \n``Golden Hands.''\n  Eventually, Abe began his own business while Gladys raised their two \nchildren, Melanie and Jeffrey. Gladys' love for painting inspired her \nto enroll in art courses and indeed both she and Abe could be called \nlife-long students not only of the arts but also of their Jewish \nheritage. Gladys was a tireless worker for Hadassah while Abe was a \ndedicated member of the synagogue. Their respect for others led them to \nbecome dedicated to the civil rights movement and to the cause of \nIsrael.\n  On May 18, 2001 they will at long last celebrate their Bat and Bar \nMitzvah, Gladys for the first time and Abe to renew his commitment to \nhis religion. The Bar Mitzvah ceremony; such an essential part of \nJewish life is a distinct honor and Abe and Gladys are to be commended \nfor their continued dedication to the Jewish faith throughout their \nlives. Ordinarily, a rite of passage for young Jewish children about to \nenter their teens, the ceremony has been adapted so that Gladys and Abe \ncan celebrate that which was denied them so long ago.\n  It is a true honor to see Abe and Gladys reach this momentous day. \nCongratulations to you Abe, Gladys and your family as you share in this \nmeaningful and important milestone in your lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/09/senate-section/article/S4588-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4588-S4589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                GOODBYE TO ARCHBISHOP FRANCIS T. HURLEY\n\n Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor someone \nwho has done so much good for his adopted State, it makes any \npolitician blush with envy at his list of accomplishments. I speak of \nRoman Catholic Archbishop Francis T. Hurley, who is retiring on May 16, \n2001 as the Archbishop of Anchorage, after a 25-year career as head of \nthe Roman Catholic Church in Alaska.\n  It is a great honor to speak about the Archbishop. I first met the \nReverend Hurley in late winter of 1970. I and my family were living in \nJuneau, the capital of Alaska, serving as Alaska State Commissioner of \nCommerce and Economic Development, and attending church at the \nCathedral of the Nativity, built on the hillside overlooking downtown \nJuneau and the lovely Gastineau Channel. Reverend Hurley had just been \nnamed in February by Pope Paul VI as the Bishop of Juneau. He arrived \nin town on March 20, 1970.\n  From his first sermon delivered in America's smallest Catholic \nCathedral, it was clear of his admiration for Alaska and of his love \nfor and concern for the physical and spiritual well-being of the people \nof Alaska--not just the 4,000 Catholics of the Diocese of Juneau in the \nPanhandle of my State--or 6 years later, of the tens of thousands of \nCatholics who live in all of the 49th State, but of all Alaskans \nregardless of race or creed who live and work and learn and play in the \nfar north.\n  While Bishop of Juneau, he quickly founded Catholic Community \nServices to help the poor of the Panhandle. He founded St. Ann's \nNursing Home in Juneau to provide health care for the elderly, and \ncenters for senior citizens in Juneau, Ketchikan and Tenakee Springs to \nhelp the elderly deal with the daily concerns of aging. He also began \nthe ``Trays on Sleighs'' program to provide hot meals to senior \ncitizens, Alaska's version of the national Meals on Wheels program.\n  In 1970, after serving on President Richard Nixon's National Advisory \nCommission on Minority Enterprise, the Bishop, with a group of local \nJuneau residents, formed the Alaska Housing Development Corp. to foster \nlow-income housing in the region, a desperate need to this day in \nAlaska.\n  On May 4, 1976, the Bishop was named the second Archbishop of \nAnchorage. Under his leadership for the past 25 years, Catholic Social \nServices has established a day care center for the handicapped, built \nthe Brother Francis Shelter in Anchorage to care for the more than \n1,000 homeless who used to live and seek food in the subfreezing winter \ntemperatures on the streets of Alaska's largest city. He helped develop \nClare House, a shelter for women and children; McAuley Manor, a home \nfor young women; and also helped found Covenant House of Anchorage.\n  In both sectarian and religious ways he has excelled in improving \neducation both in Alaska and nationwide. The Archbishop, a native of \nSan Francisco, Calif., was born on Jan. 12, 1927. He received his \neducation in San Francisco and at St. Patrick's Seminary in Menlo Park, \nCalif. After being ordained to the priesthood on June 16, 1951, he \nserved as assistant pastor in a San Francisco parish and worked as a \nteacher at Serra High School in San Mateo, Calif. He undertook his \ngraduate studies in sociology from The Catholic University of America \nin Washington, D.C. and later at the University of California in \nBerkeley.\n  In 1957, he was assigned to the national coordinating office for the \nCatholic Bishops of the United States, now known as the National \nConference of Catholic Bishops. From 1957 to 1970 he served as \nAssociate General Secretary of the conference and worked long hours to \nhelp craft the national Elementary and Secondary Education Act during \nthe Presidency of Lyndon Johnson, to this day the landmark legislation \ngoverning federal funding for elementary and secondary education in \nAmerica.\n  Given his knowledge of education it was only natural for him to serve \non the board of trustees of Alaska Pacific University, starting in \n1977, and to have worked to establish the Cardinal Newman Chair of \nCatholic Theology at the Anchorage campus of the Methodist institution.\n\n[[Page S4589]]\n\n  The Archbishop, selected yearly as one of Alaska's top 25 most \n``powerful'' citizens since 1996, also became the first religious \nleader in Alaskan history in 1997 to be named ``Alaskan of the Year.'' \nBut his religious achievements are an equal to his sectarian \naccomplishments.\n  Shortly after arriving in Juneau in 1970, the Bishop moved to bring \nthe Catholic faith to the small villages of Alaska. In August 1970 he \nheld the first Mass at Excursion Inlet, a former fish cannery at the \nhead of a fiord near Glacier Bay National Park. ``There are many more \npeople out in those coves and inlet. We priests must become more \nmobile,'' said the Reverend Hurley. And he quickly implemented his \nbelief.\n  A private pilot, and later a member of the Anchorage Civil Air \nPatrol, the Archbishop won grants from the Knights of Columbus and the \nExtension Society in 1970 for two diocesan airplanes so priests could \nvisit small villages to say Mass. He expanded his church initiating the \nconstruction of churches in the Southeast villages of Hoonah and \nYakutat. Over the years he has been responsible for the construction of \nfive churches in Southeast Alaska and seven more statewide, a \nsignificant legacy.\n  The Archbishop, the most senior archbishop in the United States, has \nearned his retirement. When Pope John Paul II accepted his retirement \non March 3, 2001 it speeded the transition of his leadership to \nArchbishop Roger Schwietz, who had moved to Anchorage 13 months earlier \nto begin learning about the uniqueness of Alaska. While the State will \nbe in good hands, it will be hard to follow in The Reverend's shoes.\n  Archbishop Francis T. Hurley has done much for the economic well-\nbeing of the poor, the homeless, the ill and the elderly in Alaska. And \nhe has done even more for the spiritual well being of Alaskans \neverywhere. All of us in public life will miss his wisdom and guidance, \nhis intellect and good humor. And we will miss his energy and patience. \nBut we all are better for his service to the 49th State. Best wishes \nand Godspeed in his future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/09/senate-section/article/S4589-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/09/senate-section/article/S4589-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/09/senate-section/article/S4589-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH RESPECT TO IRAN--MESSAGE FROM THE \n                            PRESIDENT--PM 18\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 401(c) of the National Emergencies Act, 50 \nU.S.C. 1641(c), and section 204(c) of the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1703(c), I transmit herewith a 6-month \nperiodic report on the national emergency with respect to Iran that was \ndeclared in Executive Order 12170 of November 14, 1979.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to limit the \nmisuse of social security numbers, to establish criminal penalties for \nsuch misuse, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased, along with Senator \nGregg, to introduce the ``Social Security Number Misuse Prevention \nAct.'' This legislation combats identity theft by making it harder for \ncriminals to steal another person's Social Security number, our de \nfacto national identifier.\n  The United States faces a growing identity theft crisis. The Federal \nBureau of Investigation estimates 350,000 cases of identity theft occur \neach year. That's one case every two minutes.\n  The Federal Trade Commission, FTC, reports that identity theft is the \nfastest growing crime in the country. If recent trends continue, \nreports of identity theft to the FTC will double between 2000 and 2001, \nto over 60,000 cases.\n\n[[Page S4592]]\n\nFully 40 percent of all consumer fraud complaints received by the FTC \nin the first three months of 2001 involved identity theft.\n  Unfortunately, the State most affected by these complaints is \nCalifornia. Fully 17 percent of the identity theft complaints the FTC \nreceived this past winter came from my home state.\n  What is identity theft? Identity theft occurs when one person uses \nanother person's Social Security number, birth date, driver's license \nnumber, or other identifying information to obtain credit cards, car \nloans, phone plans or other services in the victim's name.\n  Identity thieves can get personal information in a myriad of ways, \nstealing wallets and purses containing identification cards, using \npersonal information found on the Internet, stealing mail, including \npre-approved credit offers and credit statements, fraudulently \nobtaining credit reports or getting personnel records at work.\n  Of all sources of identity theft, the most common trigger of the \ncrime is the misappropriation of a person's Social Security number. \nReports to the Social Security Administration of the Social Security \nnumber misuse have increased from 7,868 in 1997 to 46,839 in 2000, an \nastonishing increase of over 500 percent.\n  Let me give some examples of victims whose identities were stolen \nafter a thief got hold of their Social Security number: An identity \ntheft ring in Riverside County allegedly bilked eight victims of \n$700,000. The thieves stole personal information of employees at a \nlarge phone company and drained their on-line stock accounts. One \nemployee reportedly had $285,000 taken from his account when someone \nwas able to access his account by supplying the employee's name and \nsocial Security number. Three youths robbed a young woman on a San \nFrancisco MUNI bus. The thieves stole her driver's license and social \nsecurity card. While the victim was traveling over the Christmas \nholiday, the thieves represented themselves as her and drained her bank \naccounts, applied for cell phones, credit cards and other accounts. \nThey also redirected her mail to a general delivery post to the \nTenderloin. Amy Boyer, a 20 year-old dental assistant from Maine was \nkilled in 1999 by a stalker who bought her Social Security number off \nthe Internet for $45, and then used it to locate her work address. \nMichelle Brown of Los Angeles, California, had her Social Security \nnumber stolen in 1999, and it was used to charge $50,000 including a \n$32,000 truck, a $5,000 liposuction operation, and a year-long \nresidential lease. While assuming the victim's name, the perpetrator \nalso became the object of an arrest warrant for drug smuggling in \nTexas.\n  This bill proposes concrete measures to get Social Security numbers \nbeyond the reach of criminals.\n  The bill prohibits anyone from selling or displaying a Social \nSecurity number to the general public without the Social Security \nnumber holder's consent.\n  No longer will identity thieves or stalkers, like the man who killed \nAmy Boyer, be able to log anonymously onto a website and obtain another \nperson's Social Security number. Information brokers will no longer be \nable to sell Social Security numbers to anyone who asks for a nominal \nfee.\n  The bill also requires Federal, State, and local governments to take \naffirmative steps to protect Social Security numbers. Before giving out \nrecords such as bankruptcy filings, liens, or birth certificates to the \ngeneral public, government entities will need to redact the Social \nSecurity number.\n  Thus, identity thieves can no longer mine Social Security numbers \nfrom county clerks' offices or state records offices.\n  In addition, the bill prohibits States from using Social Security \nnumbers as identifying numbers on drivers licenses or printing Social \nSecurity numbers on checks.\n  Privacy advocates contend half of all identity theft cases stem from \nlost or stolen wallets. Public entities should not put individuals at \nrisk by requiring them to carry cards which contain Social Security \nnumbers on them.\n  In addition, the bill will empower individuals who wish to keep their \nSocial Security numbers confidential and out of public circulation. \nCompanies will be prohibited from denying an individual a good or \nservice if he refuses to give out his Social Security number.\n  In recognition of the needs of the business community, this \nlegislation permits businesses to use Social Security numbers with \nappropriate safeguards for internal uses or in transactions with other \nbusinesses.\n  I want to state up front that the business-to-business exception is \nan area of significant compromise. As a matter of policy, I believe \nthat a Social Security number, like other sensitive elements of \npersonal information, should be under the control of the person to whom \nit belongs.\n  I also understand that many businesses, unfortunately, rely \nextensively on Social Security numbers to conduct a range of \ntransactions. Some of these transactions include checking databases to \nensure the identity of a customer or purchaser.\n  The cost of changing to other identifiers can be significant. One \nCalifornia health care company, for example, conducted an internal \nstudy on how much it would cost to switch from Social Security numbers \nto another customer identifier. The price tag was over $25 million.\n  The bill directs the Attorney General to implement rules to permit \nlegitimate business-to-business transactions, but prevent abuse. The \nAttorney general must consider several factors in the rulemaking: (i) \nThe need for appropriate safeguards so that employees cannot \nmisappropriate Social Security numbers, and (ii) The need to implement \nprocedures to prevent identity thieves, stalkers, and others with ill \nintent from posing as legitimate businesses to obtain Social Security \nnumbers.\n  In drafting the rule, the Attorney General must ensure that any \nbusiness-to-businesss exception is consistent with other privacy laws, \nincluding Gramm-Leach-Bliley.\n  Thus, the bill would be consistent with a district court ruling \nissued last week that recognized limits on financial institutions' use \nof Social Security numbers. In Individual Reference Services Group v. \nFederal Trade Commission, the court held Gramm-Leach-Bliley requires \nbanks to give consumers the opportunity to opt-out before their Social \nSecurity number is sold. I would like to submit into the record a copy \nof a Los Angeles Times article describing the decision.\n  I would like to thank Senator Gregg for working so hard with me to \ndraft this legislation. I am pleased to report that this bill has \ngarnered the support of the Attorney General of California, Bill \nLockyer, Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, Crimes Victims United of \nCalifornia, the Los Angeles Coalition of Crime Victim Advocates, and \nthe Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau.\n  Over 350,000 people a year are victims of identity theft, and the \nnumbers continue to grow. Passing the ``Social Security Number Misuse \nPrevention Act'' will help curb this crime by restricting criminal \naccess to Social Security numbers.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in getting this common-\nsense bill enacted into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and the article to \nwhich I referred be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 848\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The inappropriate display, sale, or purchase of social \n     security numbers has contributed to a growing range of \n     illegal activities,\n\n[[Page S4593]]\n\n     including fraud, identity theft, and, in some cases, stalking \n     and other violent crimes.\n       (2) While financial institutions, health care providers, \n     and other entities have often used social security numbers to \n     confirm the identity of an individual, the general display to \n     the public, sale, or purchase of these numbers has been used \n     to commit crimes, and also can result in serious invasions of \n     individual privacy.\n       (3) The Federal Government requires virtually every \n     individual in the United States to obtain and maintain a \n     social security number in order to pay taxes, to qualify for \n     social security benefits, or to seek employment. An \n     unintended consequence of these requirements is that social \n     security numbers have become tools that can be used to \n     facilitate crime, fraud, and invasions of the privacy of the \n     individuals to whom the numbers are assigned. Because the \n     Federal Government created and maintains this system, and \n     because the Federal Government does not permit individuals to \n     exempt themselves from those requirements, it is appropriate \n     for the Federal Government to take steps to stem the abuse of \n     this system.\n       (4) A social security number does not contain, reflect, or \n     convey any publicly significant information or concern any \n     public issue. The display, sale, or purchase of such numbers \n     in no way facilitates uninhibited, robust, and wide-open \n     public debate, and restrictions on such display, sale, or \n     purchase would not affect public debate.\n       (5) No one should seek to profit from the display, sale, or \n     purchase of social security numbers in circumstances that \n     create a substantial risk of physical, emotional, or \n     financial harm to the individuals to whom those numbers are \n     assigned.\n       (6) Consequently, this Act offers each individual that has \n     been assigned a social security number necessary protection \n     from the display, sale, and purchase of that number in any \n     circumstance that might facilitate unlawful conduct.\n\n     SEC. 3.

If the decision is \n     upheld, the rule--issued by the FTC last year and set to take \n     effect in July--would work dramatic changes in the way \n     businesses rely upon the credit bureaus' databases for \n     everything from updating junk-mail lists to locating debtors.\n       ``It's going to set a higher barrier for the privacy of \n     this kind of information,'' said Robert Gellman, a privacy \n     consultant in Washington.\n       Credit bureaus and information brokers, who filed suit last \n     year to block the FTC rules, warned that the court decision \n     may have unintended consequences.\n       ``There are many beneficial uses for this information,'' \n     said Clark Walter, a spokesman for Trans Union, the Chicago-\n     based credit bureau. He said the databases are used to find \n     fugitives, parents who owe child support, missing heirs and \n     runaway children. ``How these particular functions would be \n     affected remains to be seen,'' Walter said.\n       At the heart of the dispute is the top portion of consumer \n     credit reports, known as the credit ``header,'' which is \n     typically limited to a person's name, address, birth date and \n     Social Security number. The header does not include financial \n     information about credit history or bank accounts, which can \n     be released only to creditors and others with a legal right \n     to see it.\n       Because it has been considered less sensitive, credit \n     header information has been sold for years. Customers include \n     marketing firms, law enforcement agencies, private \n     investigators and journalists.\n       Last year, the FTC issued rules to prohibit credit bureaus \n     from continuing to sell the information unless consumers had \n     first been given an opportunity to block the practice. The \n     agency said the rule was mandated by Congress as part of a \n     1999 financial modernization law, which called for new \n     privacy\n\n[[Page S4596]]\n\n     protections for consumers' financial information.\n       The Individual Reference Services Group, a trade group of \n     information companies, argued that the FTC had misinterpreted \n     the law. ``We don't think a name and address is `financial \n     information' under the statute,'' said Ronald Plesser, \n     attorney for the trade group. The companies also argued that \n     the rules violated their constitutional right to free speech.\n       The FTC countered that any personally identifiable \n     information provided to financial institutions, even if \n     available from other public sources, should be covered by the \n     law.\n       The disclosure of Social Security numbers, in particular, \n     raised the hackles of privacy advocates, who say the practice \n     has led to an increase in identity theft and other fraud.\n       In her 62-page ruling, dated April 30, Huvelle said the \n     regulations were lawful and constitutional. ``This gives \n     consumer more control over how their information is used,'' \n     said John Daly, assistant general counsel at the FTC.\n       The decision marks the latest defeat for credit bureaus and \n     information brokers, whose operating environment is \n     increasingly hostile.\n       A federal appeals court ruled last month that Trans Union \n     may no longer sell marketing lists based upon certain \n     financial characteristics, such as consumers with three or \n     more credit cards, culled from credit reports.\n       The FTC banned the practice in 1992, saying it violated \n     federal laws prohibiting the use of credit information for \n     marketing purposes. The other two major credit bureaus halted \n     the practice, but Trans Union continued to sell such lists.\n       If credit bureaus are prohibited from selling credit header \n     data, businesses will probably turn to other sources, such as \n     the change-of-address database at the U.S. Postal Service or \n     voter registration records.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, on October 15, 1999, Amy Boyer, a young \nwoman from Nashua, NH, was killed by a man who went on the Internet, \npurchased her social security number for $45, used it to find her place \nof work and kill her.\n  As a result of that tragic event, and countless others I have \nsubsequently become aware of, it became clear to me that the sale of \nsocial security numbers on the Internet was dangerous and needed to be \nstopped.\n  Last year, I introduced Amy Boyer's law to do just that. The purpose \nof that legislation was twofold. First, to ensure that people like Amy \nBoyer's killer would not be able to purchase social security numbers \nand second, to prevent companies like Dogpile, and Docusearch.com from \nbeing able to sell social security numbers without an individual's \nconsent.\n  Amy Boyer's law accomplished both of these objectives but became \nmired down in controversy, frankly from both sides, over how to strike \na balance between legitimate business and other lawful uses of the \nsocial security number which are necessary in many instances to prevent \nfraud and identity theft and a desire on the part of the privacy \norganizations to significantly limit public access to social security \nnumbers.\n  Let's face it, like it or not, the Social Security Number has become \na national identifier of sorts and in many instances, is the only way \nto ensure accurate identification of people. Health care providers use \nthe social security number to maintain our health records to ensure we \nare receiving the services we need; banks and financial institutions \nuse them to prevent fraud--a social security number tells them that a \nloan applicant is exactly who he says he is. The National Center for \nMissing and Exploited Children and the Association for Children for \nEnforcement of Support, ACES, use social security numbers to track down \nkidnappers and deadbeat dads. Big Brothers/Big Sisters of America use \nsocial security numbers to do background checks on volunteers to make \nsure that they are not felons or child molesters. A truly blanket \nprohibition that did not include any exceptions whatsoever would close-\nout the above uses. In reality, nobody wants this.\n  Unfortunately, we were unable to reach a suitable compromise before \nadjourning last session, but I am pleased today to introduce, with \nSenator Feinstein, after many months of very hard work, the Social \nSecurity Number Misuse Prevention Act of 2001.\n  This is indeed a compromise proposal. Both Senator Feinstein and \nmyself have had countless meetings with parties interested in this \nissue and have produced, what I believe to be, a good product. It is \nnot a perfect product, but it is a good first step toward balancing \nsignificant diverging interests. We will, of course, continue to work \nwith interested parties to perfect this legislation, but we have agreed \nin concept to certain key principles.\n  First, the public access to the social security number must be \nlimited because of the significant risk of invasions of privacy and the \npotential for misuse, not the least of which is identity theft. And \nsecond, that there are certain legitimate purposes for which the social \nsecurity number is essential--and we must protect those legitimate \nuses.\n  Let me summarize the bill's main provisions:\n  First, the legislation contains a prohibition against obtaining \nsocial security number with wrongful intent. Persons are prohibited \nfrom obtaining a social security number for the purpose of locating or \nidentifying an individual with the intent to physically injure, harm, \nor use the identity of the individual for any illegal purpose.\n  Second, the legislation prohibits the display, sale and purchase of \nsocial security numbers to and by the general public without the \nindividual's consent, except for certain limited purposes. Those \npurposes include: For purposes permitted, required or excepted under \nthe Social Security Act, section 7 (a)(2) of the Privacy Act of 1974, \nsection 6109(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or section 6(b)(1) \nof the Professional Boxing Safety Act of 1996: for a public health \npurpose, including the protection of the health and safety of an \nindividual or in an emergency situation; for a national security \npurpose; for a law enforcement purpose, including the investigation of \nfraud and the enforcement of child support obligations; for business-\nto-business use, including, but not limited to the prevention of fraud, \nthe facilitation of credit checks or background checks of employees, \nprospective employees, and volunteers, compliance with any requirement \nrelated to the social security program, or the retrieval of other \ninformation from other businesses or commercial enterprises; except \nthat no business may sell or display a social security number to the \ngeneral public. For data matching programs under the Computer Matching \nand Privacy Protection Act of 1988 or any similar data matching program \ninvolving a Federal, State or local agency; or if such number is \nrequired to be submitted as part of the process for applying for any \ntype of Federal, State, or local government benefit or program.\n  Third, an individual may not be required to provide their social \nsecurity number when purchasing a commercial good or service unless the \nsocial security number is necessary: For purposes relating to the Fair \nCredit Reporting Act, for a background check of the individual \nconducted by a landlord, lessor, employer, volunteer service agency, or \nother entity determined by the Attorney General, for law enforcement, \nor pursuant to a Federal or State law requirement; or if the social \nsecurity number is necessary to verify identity and prevent fraud with \nrespect to the specific transaction requested by the consumer and no \nother form of identification can produce comparable information.\n  Fourth, within 3 years after the date of enactment of this \nlegislation, Social Security numbers may not appear on checks issued \nfor payment by Federal, State, or local government agencies.\n  Fifth, within 1 year after the date of enactment of this legislation, \nSocial Security numbers may not appear on any driver's license, motor \nvehicle registration or any other document issued to an individual for \npurposes of identification of such individual. However, State \nDepartments of Motor Vehicles may continue to use social security \nnumbers internally and for purposes of sharing information about \ndriving records with other jurisdictions.\n  Sixth, the legislation prohibits prisoners from gaining access to \nsocial security numbers.\n  Finally, on the issue of Public Records, which was and remains a very \ndifficult issue. In fact, last year, it was one of the issues that \nresulted in our inability to pass Amy Boyer's Law. Amy Boyer's law \nallowed Social Security Numbers to continue to appear in public records \nwith no limitation on access. It did so in recognition of the fact that \nmany states, local governments, and other governmental entities use \nSocial Security Numbers in the same way that many businesses\n\n[[Page S4597]]\n\ndo--to ensure accurate identification of individuals who use their \nservices and to prevent fraud.\n  Many States require social security numbers to be used in documents \nsuch as marriage licenses, bankruptcy records, real estate and tax \nliens, etc. These documents are, under most state laws, a matter of \npublic record, which means the general public can readily gain access \nto them. Were we to make the appearance of social security numbers in \nevery public record illegal, many states and third party beneficiaries \nwhose business is based on providing access to public records to law \noffices and other subscribers would have to redact social security \nnumbers from many hundreds of thousands of public documents. This would \nbe a huge task, and it is unclear whether we would in any significant \nway, further reduce the illegal activity we are trying to prevent. In \nother words, it is unclear whether the administrative burden and cost \nwould outweigh the potential benefit. This was a very real concern.\n  At the same time we recognized the very real harm that could be \ncaused by unlimited public access to public documents containing social \nsecurity numbers--in many cases, right on the face of the document. \nSocial security numbers in public records can be dangerous if a stalker \nknows where to look, and so I made a commitment lasts year to continue \nto look at this problem and to address it in a way that was sound and \nfair, and consistent with the overall principles and goals of the \nlegislation.\n  As with the other provisions in this legislation, Senator Feinstein \nand I reached a compromise.\n  Under our compromise proposal there is no requirement for redaction \nof social security numbers that appear incidentally in public records, \n(i.e. not on the face of a document or in a document in a consistent \nmanner). We are trying to limit access to social security numbers for \nroutinely appear in a public record consistently and predictably, on \nthe same page, in every document.\n  For those records, records where the social security number appears \nnon-incidentally, the number must be redacted before the public \ndocument is sold or displayed to the general public. Individuals \nrequesting the document who are able to provide the social security \nbelonging to the person who is the subject of the document before \nreceiving the document may receive an unrelated copy of the public \ndocument.\n  I believe that the Feinstein-Gregg Social Security Number Misuse \nPrevention Act is a well thought-out, tightly woven piece of \nlegislation that has effectively recognized and balanced the many \nconcerns surrounding the uses of Social Security numbers. Passing this \nlegislation is one of the most important things that Congress can do \nthis year to reduce identity theft and protect individual privacy while \npermitting the continued legitimate and limited uses of the social \nsecurity number.\n  I thank Senator Feinstein and look forward to continuing to work with \nher throughout the legislative process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BOND:\n  S. 849. A bill to amend provisions of law enacted by the Small \nBusiness Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (Public Law 104-\n121 to ensure full analysis of potential impacts on small entities of \nrules proposed by certain agencies, and for other purposes: to the \nCommittee on Small Business.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, we are awaiting the imminent arrival of the \nbudget from the House. We have had many important things going on in \nthis Chamber. The debate on education is tremendously important. Yet I \nthink it is necessary that we take a moment and recognize something \nthat colleagues on both sides of the aisle will find very important, \nand I know support; and that is, the fact that this is Small Business \nWeek.\n  All of us know, particularly those of us who serve on the Small \nBusiness Committee, that small businesses are the dynamic engine which \nkeeps the economy of America growing and provides most of the new jobs \nthat are created. It provides opportunities, for the entrepreneurs and \ntheir families, for people to gain the kind of life they wish. In many \nareas, it also provides tremendous innovations that make our economy \nmore advanced and enhances the livelihoods of not only the workers but \nthe customers of those small businesses.\n  This week I have been working with my colleagues on Small Business. \nMy ranking member, Senator Kerry, and I, and members of the committee \nhave participated in recognition ceremonies for Outstanding Small \nBusinesspersons of the Year. There was White House recognition \nyesterday.\n  I say to all my colleagues, there is a Small Businessperson of the \nYear from your State. I hope you have had the opportunity to \ncongratulate them, to thank them for their work, and also to listen to \nthem on what is important for small business.\n  Since I took over and had the honor of becoming chairman of the \nCommittee on Small Business in 1995, we have made it a point for the \ncommittee to be the eyes and ears of small business. We have listened \nto what small businesses have had to say, small businesses in Missouri \nand Massachusetts and Minnesota and Georgia and all across the Nation. \nIf you ask them, they will tell you.\n  We found out a number of things that are of concern to them. They are \nconcerned about excessive regulation. They are concerned about \ntaxation. They are concerned about the complexity of taxation. They are \nconcerned about getting access to the Government contracting business \nthat is available, unfortunately, too often only to larger businesses.\n  Last year I hosted a national women's small business summit in Kansas \nCity, MO, and getting access to defense contracts and other Federal \nGovernment contracts was high on their list. Working together with \nmembers of the Small Business Committee, we pushed to get rid of \nbundling and make sure that the small businesses get their fair share \nof contracts.\n  I will be introducing a measure, a mentoring and protege bill, to do \nwith other agencies of the Federal Government what the Defense \nDepartment has done, and that is to assign an experienced government \ncontractor to work with small businesses to help them get in line for \nthe contracts so they can participate in and fulfill those contracts.\n  I have, with Senator Kerry, introduced a resolution commending Small \nBusiness Week. Somebody has put a hold on it. I really hope to reason \nwith them and see if we can't get that passed. Almost anything we have \ndone in small business in this body has been on a bipartisan basis. We \nhope to overcome that problem.\n\n  There are a number of tax measures that are pending before the Senate \nnow. I introduced the Small Business Works Act as a tax measure right \nafter this session of Congress convened. It was based upon the tax \npriorities that women business owners had. No. 1 was getting rid of the \nalternative minimum tax. You have to figure out two guides of taxes, \nand then most small businesses are taxed as individuals. Some 21.2 \nmillion of them pay taxes on their personal income tax form. And when \nyou have an AMT, you find out you lose many of the business deductions, \nand the small business person winds up paying a higher tax--certainly a \nhigher tax, in many instances, than a regular C corporation pays.\n  In addition, we would move up and make effective now 100-percent \ndeductibility for health insurance paid for by small businesses. A \nproprietor running a small business should have the same opportunities \nto get health insurance for herself and her family as a large \ncorporation does for its employees. That is in there.\n  On Monday I introduced the Independent Contractor Determination Act. \nOne of the things women business owners told us was, it is particularly \ntroubling and has been a longstanding headache for small businesses to \nfigure out who is an independent contractor and who is not. There is a \n20-factor formula. Nobody understands the 20 factors, but the one thing \nyou do understand is, if an IRS agent comes in 3 or 4 years later and \napplies the test, the IRS agent is going to win because nobody knows \nhow to figure it out. The result is many small businesses have faced \nvery heavy burdens. Some have been put out of business because somebody \nrejiggered them from independent contractor to employee, and this has \nbeen a tremendous problem. The laws ought to be simple enough to \nunderstand. There is a lot of complexity in the law.\n\n[[Page S4598]]\n\n  One of the things we must do, as we reform the Tax Code, is make it \nsimpler. There is no more complex, uninterpretable, undefinable, \nunreasonable provision in the law than the current independent \ncontractor provision. We must change that.\n  The average small business spends 5 percent of its revenues figuring \nout the tax. That is not paying the taxes, that is just figuring out \nhow much they owe. A nickel out of every dollar goes to calculating \ntaxes because we have made it too complex. We need to make it simpler.\n  Today I introduced a measure to build upon the Red Tape Reduction \nAct, also known as the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness \nAct. I was very pleased in 1996 to work with my then ranking member, \nSenator Bumpers, and we presented a bill unanimously out of the Small \nBusiness Committee to provide some relief for small businesses from \nexcessive redtape and regulation. We thought we would have all kinds of \nproblems getting on the floor, but we worked on a bipartisan basis. We \nhad worked with the agencies of government to make sure their concerns \nwere expressed.\n  The only people who came to the floor were people who wished to be \nadded as cosponsors. It passed unanimously, and it has been having an \nimpact.\n  The purpose of the Red Tape Reduction Act was to ensure that small \nbusinesses would be given a voice in the regulatory process at the time \nwhen it could make the difference before the regulation was published. \nThe act has proven to be a regulatory process more attentive to the \nimpact on small business and, consequently, is more fair and more \nefficient.\n  I cite my good friend and constituent Dr. Murray Weidenbaum at the \nCenter for the Study of American Business at Washington University who \ntold me a couple of years ago that the Red Tape Reduction Act was \nperhaps the only--certainly the most--significant regulatory reform \nmeasure passed by Congress in recent history, in the last 20 years or \nso.\n\n  We have seen the impact of this provision. The Red Tape Reduction \nAct, among other things, requires that OSHA and EPA convene panels to \ninvolve small businesses in formulating regulations before the \nregulations are proposed. It gives the agencies the unique opportunity \nto learn upfront what problems their regulation may cause and to \ncorrect the problems with the least difficulty.\n  In one case, EPA totally abandoned a regulation when they recognized \nthat the industry could deal with it much more effectively on its own.\n  Experience with the panel process has proven to be an unequivocal \nsuccess. The former chief counsel for advocacy of the Small Business \nAdministration, Jere Glover, who worked hard to make sure the act \nworked, stated:\n\n       Unquestionably, the SBREFA panel process has had a very \n     salutary impact on the regulatory deliberations of OSHA and \n     EPA, resulting in major changes to draft regulations. What is \n     important to note is that these changes were accomplished \n     without sacrificing the agencies' public policy objectives.\n\n  That is what we had in mind. Many times small businesses get run over \nif they are left out of the process. We had a hearing just a couple \nweeks ago in the Small Business Committee and found out the fisheries \nregulations had worked tremendous hardship on small fishermen along the \nNorth Carolina coast when they decided to change the bag limit, the \ncatch limit, in the fall and wiped out many small businesses. They \nforgot to ask how best to implement the fisheries regulation.\n  Another business in my State was working on a process to replace a \nparticular chemical that the EPA said it was going to phase out. They \nhad invested a great deal of time, money, and interest in the process \nof getting it developed. EPA changed the rule and the regulation and \nthe time limit in midprocess and left them completely out in the dark.\n  These are the kinds of things that Government ought not to be doing. \nGovernment ought not to be running roughshod over people who are trying \nto contribute to the economy, provide good employment opportunities, \nprovide a solid tax base for the community, and provide good wages for \nthe proprietor and employees and their families.\n  We think the Red Tape Reduction Act can be expanded and can be of \neven greater value. It has demonstrated the value of small business \ninput in the regulatory process, but still too many agencies are trying \nto evade the requirements to conduct regulatory flexibility analyses--\nthat is the technical term for seeing how it will impact the small \nbusiness; ``regulatory flexibility'' analysis is the technical term--to \nfigure out how it is going to hurt small business.\n  We now realize that the Internal Revenue Service should also be \nrequired to conduct small business review panels so that their \nregulations will impose the least possible burden on a small business \nwhile still achieving the mission of the agency.\n  I think there is no question we have worked with the new Commissioner \nof the IRS, Commissioner Rossotti. We have seen many steps taken by the \nIRS to relieve the burdens. I don't know anybody who really likes to \npay taxes. We realize that it is an important part of supporting our \nGovernment and our system. But at least we ought to do so in a way that \nis the least confusing and burdensome.\n  So I think it is important that we provide a mechanism so that \nparties will be able to reserve the benefits of their rights to \nparticipate at the earliest stages and have the most impact. We believe \nthe litigation that is available at the end of the process if an agency \nfails to take into account the burden on small business is important \nbecause prior to the Redtape Reduction Act, the law had been on the \nbooks since 1980 that agencies ought to consider the impact on small \nbusiness, and it was absolutely, totally ignored by the agencies; \nwithout judicial enforcement, they didn't get anywhere. So we added \njudicial enforcement and they started paying attention.\n  The Agency Accountability Act, which I introduce today, cures a \nnumber of additional problems that we have identified. Let me run \nthrough quickly what it does. No. 1, it requires agencies to publish \nthe decision to certify a regulation as not having a significant \neconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities separately in \nthe Federal Register. That means, in certain circumstances, the agency \ndoesn't have to consider the impact on small business. That is how most \nof the bad regulations get through. EPA was infamous for doing that and \nsaying it didn't have any impact. The regulation comes down to small \nbusiness, which says we are getting killed. Then they have to fight the \nbattle. Then they go to court and prove that they are impacted and the \nEPA didn't pay any attention to them.\n  This says if you are going to use that escape clause to say the \nregulation doesn't have any impact on a small business, you have to set \nthat out--set out in the Federal Register what you are doing and the \nfact that it does not have an impact. So you can perhaps correct the \nproblems if there are small businesses that can show they are impacted \nbefore the regulation is issued.\n  Second, the Triple A Act requires the agency to publish a summary of \nits economic analysis supporting the certification decision; i.e., if \nyou say it doesn't have any economic impact, don't just grab it out of \nyour hip pocket, or hat. You have to have an analysis to show why it \nwould not. You have to make that available to the public so that \ninterested parties will be able to see whether, in fact, it was pulled \nout of your hat, or whether it is based on sound economic reasoning.\n  The third thing the Triple A does is it allows small entities to seek \njudicial review of this certification decision. They can go to the \nagency and say: Agency, you are trying to get out of the regulatory \nflexibility requirements--you are trying to get out of the requirement \nto see how the impact on small business can be lessened. If they say \nthey disagree with them, the small entity can go to court and get it \nenforced.\n  When I say ``small entity,'' this is not only available to small \nbusinesses, it is available to local governments, to not-for-profit \norganizations, eleemosynary institutions, available for the small \nentities in this country that do not have lobbyists or a presence in \nWashington. Small entities are entitled to use this Redtape Reduction \nAct.\n  Fourth, the measure directs the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the \nSmall\n\n[[Page S4599]]\n\nBusiness Administration to put out a regulation defining the terms that \nthe agency has to use in determining whether they can escape an \nanalysis of how small business will be impacted. These terms are \n``significant economic impact,'' and ``substantial number of small \nentities.'' We found that a number of agencies like to jack around with \nthose terms and skew the facts so that they can sneak out the back door \nwithout having to do what the bill requires. This gives the advocacy \ncounsel the ability to say this is what we mean and this is how you \nhave to abide by it. If they don't follow that, then they are ducking \ntheir responsibilities under SBREFA and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\n\n  The other thing is, Triple A adds the IRS, U.S. Forest Service, \nNational Marine Fisheries Service, and the Fish and Wildlife Service to \nthe list of agencies that must conduct small business review panels \nbefore they can issue proposed regulations.\n  All Federal agencies are covered by the provisions of the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act. If you ignore it, you can get hauled into court and \nhave your regulation overturned if it has a significant economic impact \non a substantial number of small entities. But this is to say that \nbased on their track record and problems in the past, we are going to \nhave you do what OSHA and EPA have been required to do, and that is set \nup panels involving small businesses prior to formulating the \nregulation. If you ask small business how is this regulation going to \naffect you and people like you, you may find out that there are a lot \nbetter ways of doing it. That is what EPA found out in one of the \nregulations it considered.\n  Certainly, an agency is not going to be able to say: Gee, I had no \nidea that it would cause such a hardship on you. It is as important as \nany part of Government service, and it is too bad we have to write it \ninto law. We cannot be good Government servants, either as legislators \nor bureaucrats, or members of the executive branch if we don't listen \nto the voices, the hopes, concerns, and problems of average citizens. \nWe are just saying under this new measure that there are a couple of \nagencies that have to be told by law to listen to the people they are \ngoing to regulate. Pay attention to them. They don't have to like all \nthe regulations but at least listen to their concerns about how the \nregulations affect them and how you may be able to accomplish the \npurpose of the law you are seeking to administer, without putting \nburdens on small agencies.\n  Well, Mr. President, this bill grows out of extensive review of how \nthe Redtape Reduction Act has functioned in the last 5 years. We still \nsee a lot of frustration by small businesses about how agencies \ncontinue to find ways to avoid including small business input in \nrulemakings, and some of the actions that our agencies take confirm the \nworst image of agency bureaucrats who are thought to know what is best \nfor small business throughout the country, and when the small \nbusinesses are actually providing jobs, developing technology and \nkeeping the economy growing. But somebody here in Washington has a lot \nbetter idea how they ought to be running their business.\n  We need to have an interaction so that the people out there who are \ncreating jobs, developing the technology, earning a living for their \nfamilies and themselves can have an input into the agency that is going \nto regulate.\n  The General Accounting Office found recently that the EPA missed \n1,098 small companies in the 32 SIC codes of industries that will be \naffected by their rule lowering the threshold for companies to report \ntheir use of lead. EPA thus concluded that their rule would not have a \nsignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities \ndespite reducing the threshold of lead emissions from 25,000 pounds to \n10 pounds--a reduction of 99.96 percent. EPA, instead, relied on an \naverage revenue compiled from all companies in the manufacturing \nindustries to determine what threshold would be set to trigger the \nsmall business review panel required by the Redtape Production Act. The \naverage included companies such as General Motors, General Electric, \n3M, and others that skewed the average so that it looked as though the \nrule would have no impact on small business.\n\n  But I can tell you that a small business with 11 pounds of lead is \nabsolutely clobbered by this rule.\n  Although EPA claimed to conduct outreach to find firms that would be \naffected, they only contacted nine sources, although some of these \nsources allegedly contacted have no record of EPA contacting them. I \nthink there is no excuse for that type of arrogance and abject \navoidance of their requirements with respect to small business. This \nshoddy economic analysis exposes a loophole through which EPA should no \nlonger be able to drive their trucks, and it will be closed by the \nAgency Accountability Act.\n  I submitted previously, when I introduced the measure this morning, \nthe GAO testimony presented at the hearing. Now I know there will be \nmoans and groans by those who claim that this bill will make the \nregulatory profess more difficult and force agencies to jump through \nhoops and will make it harder to issue new regulations.\n  Let me respond as follows: Had the agencies agreed to comply with the \nintent and spirit of SBREFA, rather than defy SBREFA, the Redtape \nReduction Act, the Agency Accountability Act would not be needed.\n  Frankly, if it were clear that agencies were doing what Congress \nintended for them to do, then this bill would be unnecessary. If they \nare doing adequate analysis in reaching out to small business now, then \nthis act will have no impact on how they promulgate their regulation.\n  I have very simple views on this subject. I want an agency that \nintends to regulate how a business conducts its affairs, to do so \ncarefully and only after it has listened to the small businesses that \nwill be affected to see if there are ways in which to lessen the burden \nand still achieve the objective.\n  Unfortunately, as I said, there is overwhelming evidence that \nagencies are not treating this obligation seriously, and we must tell \nthem in forceful terms that we really meant it when we said 5 years \nago: You have to pay attention to small business.\n  I was very pleased we did so in a tremendous bipartisan, unanimous \nvote. I am hoping we can do the same with this agency accountability \nbill. Let all agencies know firsthand: If you do your job right, then \nthis should be no problem. If you are not doing your job this way, you \nought to be because it will cause less headache, less lawsuits, and \nless problems in the end.\n  Had EPA done what it should have done in the lead TRI rulemaking, \nthere would not be the litigation we are seeing now, and it would have \nsaved businesses and the Government untold sums of taxpayers' dollars.\n  This body has said they want to treat small businesses fairly. The \nAgency Accountability Act is the next step in doing so.\n  As I said earlier, I have introduced with bipartisan support a number \nof measures that I think are going to be very helpful for small \nbusiness. I hope during the course of Small Business Week my colleagues \nwill look at these and particularly take the time to listen to the men \nand women of small business who have come to Washington and continue \nthe work in their home States to find out what their concerns are.\n  I will be cosponsoring a measure that my colleague, Senator Kerry, \nwill be introducing to reauthorize and extend a very important STTR \nbill which is a very important act in terms of transferring technology. \nIt is a small business technology transfer program. I will have a \nstatement that I will add after Senator Kerry introduces the bill. I \nhope this will merit the attention of our colleagues.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the testimony of Hubert Potter, Tim \nKalinowski, and Victor Rezendes of the General Accounting Office before \nthe Committee on Small Business and a Summary of Provisions be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Testimony of Hubert Potter, a Commercial Fisherman From Hobucken, NC, \n       Before the Senate Small Business Committee, April 24, 2001\n\n       Thank you Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee.\n       My name is Hubert Potter. I am a 4th generation commercial \n     fisherman from Hobucken, North Carolina, a fishing community \n     in Pamlico County. I'll be 67 years old this August, and I've \n     been commercial fishing for a living since I was 15.\n\n[[Page S4600]]\n\n       I am a member of the North Carolina Fisheries Association, \n     and have been a Board member of that group for several years, \n     including a stint as Vice-Chairman. As such, I've tried to \n     stay on top of the political and bureaucratic issues \n     affecting us.\n       Just about all of my experience has been aboard a type of \n     fishing vessel called a trawler. My wife and I have owned 5 \n     trawlers over our lifetime, ranging in size from 32 to 75 ft \n     in length. We sold our last one this past September.\n       Like just about everything else, there have been a lot of \n     things that stay the same in our way of life. Things like the \n     weather, fish prices, and fish cycles. Just like any red-\n     blooded American, us fishermen like it when prices are high, \n     fish are plentiful, and the good Lord provides us with fair \n     weather. We might like all these things, but we also know \n     that it just doesn't work that way all the time, or even most \n     of the time.\n       Although we can accept whatever bad weather the Lord gives \n     us, or the natural peaks and valleys of fish cycles put on us \n     by mother nature, it is hard to accept or even understand the \n     lack of sensitivity and sometimes the callousness of our own \n     government. At first it seems funny when we read about that \n     some of the bureaucrats say about the effects of proposed \n     regulations. But, Mr. Chairman, after you've had a chance to \n     sit down and think about what they've said, it can really \n     hurt your feelings. When you get over that, it just plain \n     makes you angry that your own government would say that these \n     regulations will not affect your small business.\n       Commercial fishing is very dependent upon the weather, \n     water temperature, currents, and natural fish cycles. Some \n     years there will be lots of fish in a certain area, and in \n     other years there will be few or none. The difference may be \n     due to weather changes, or just because the cycles are \n     different. That's why diversity is so important to us. For \n     example, it it's possible to fish for summer flounder, that's \n     what I would do. Flounder are not available off our coast \n     year round, so we have to do others things. If I wasn't \n     fishing for summer flounder, I would be shrimping.\n       One of the most regulated fisheries on the East Coast is \n     the summer flounder fishery. Although us fishermen try to \n     stay on top of all of the regulations, most of us had no idea \n     what the Regulatory Flexibility Act was until we got involved \n     with the North Carolina Fisheries Association in a lawsuit \n     against the National Marine Fisheries Service. That's when we \n     found out that NMFS didn't think that summer flounder \n     regulations had any impact on us as small business people.\n       During one of the hearings held in Norfolk, Virginia, over \n     100 fishermen from our state attended at the request of the \n     court. We were all sworn in and I personally took the stand. \n     Allow me to read from the court order: `The federal \n     government did consider three possible quotas for the 1997 \n     fishery, but the government failed to do any significant \n     analysis to support its conclusion that there would be no \n     significant impact. It is evident to this Court from the some \n     100 North Carolina fishermen who appeared to testify that \n     their businesses were significantly affected and that there \n     was a significant economic impact. . . .''\n       The Judge also said, ``. . . this Court will not stand by \n     and allow the Secretary to attempt to achieve a desirable end \n     by using illegal means. Granted, administrative agencies have \n     a substantial amount of discretion in determining how they \n     will follow Congressional mandates. That discretion, \n     however, does not include rewriting or ignoring \n     statutes.''\n       And this quote by Judge Doumar says it all: ``. . . the \n     Secretary has produced a so-called economic report that \n     obviously is designed to justify a prior determination''.\n       Mr. Chairman, although our life has been like a roller \n     coaster ride over the years, Renona and I have done ok. But \n     we really fear for the future of our younger fishing families \n     because of all the regulations and the lack of feeling for \n     hard working people. There was one year when our summer \n     flounder fishery was closed in December due to regulations, \n     when families just didn't have the money for Christmas. \n     That's because shrimping, crabbing, and other fisheries have \n     naturally slacked out in December and many of us depended on \n     the summer flounder fishing for Christmas money. Yet, we find \n     out that our own government says that the regulations have no \n     significant impact.\n       Maybe they think a slack Christmas is not having an impact. \n     In my wildest dreams, it's hard for me to figure how they \n     think.\n       Mr. Chairman, speaking on behalf of commercial fishing \n     families, I want to thank you for scheduling this hearing. \n     Our small businesses are so small that we don't have the time \n     to stay on top of a lot of these kinds of issues. We do know \n     that we are expected to abide by the laws of our land, and we \n     expect that our own government should do that also.\n       It's been discouraging to see our incomes drop as \n     regulations increase, and read reports by the government that \n     the regulations will have no significant impact on us. \n     Although it's hard work, we love what we do, and we would \n     like to be able to continue providing our country with a \n     healthy and tasty source of protein.\n       We really hope that our government wants us to continue \n     doing that too.\n       Thank you, and I would be glad to answer any questions from \n     the Committee.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Testimony of Tim Kalinowski\n\n       Good Morning and thank you for the opportunity to address \n     this distinguished committee. My name is Tim Kalinowski and I \n     am the Vice-President of Operations for Foam Supplies, Inc. \n     (FSI) located in Earth City, Missouri.\n       FSI is a typical, small, mid western family owned business. \n     It is still run by Dave and Karen Keske who founded the \n     business in 1972. They bought the first facility with the \n     help of two small business loans and built their current \n     facility by offering shares in the building and land to their \n     62 employees, who receive monthly rental income for their \n     investment.\n       FSI has always operated in an environmentally responsible \n     manner and we are proud of our reputation. FSI manufacturers \n     rigid non-CFC urethane foams and solvent less urethane \n     dispensing equipment. These products have uses ranging from \n     flotation foam used in boat building to insulation foam used \n     in building construction. Our company has always been a \n     leader in the field. In the 1980's, aware of EPA's plans to \n     phase out CFCs due to its negative effect on the earth's \n     ozone layer, FSI worked aggressively to find suitable \n     substitutes. FSI was the first company to patent an HCFC-22 \n     blown urethane foam, years before the EPA mandated phase-out.\n       Technology development does not occur overnight and it does \n     not come cheap. FSI spends a lot of money to develop new \n     products and is wiling to do so because it is how we compete \n     against the large companies. FSI is a small company with \n     tight margins and we can only be innovative if we are able to \n     spread the costs over time. FSI had the ability to do this in \n     the CFC rulemaking, because the EPA notified us well in \n     advance of the phase out and we had the time to properly test \n     and prepare new formulations.\n       I am here today to take exception to EPA's actions in the \n     July 11, 2000 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding the \n     Significant New Alternatives Policy or SNAP program. The EPA \n     SNAP program was not designed to accelerate the phase out of \n     ozone depleting substances. For example, under the plan \n     developed by EPA and industry in the early 1990's, HCFC-22 \n     may be produced and imported until 2010. Use may continue \n     after that date until stocks are depleted. In this recent \n     SNAP proposal EPA has ignored the current production and \n     manufacturing deadline and has proposed to accelerate the \n     deadline for not only the manufacture, but also the use of \n     these substitutes to 2005. This new deadline would hit \n     small businesses extremely hard because it changes the \n     rules midstream and gives us less time to develop new \n     products and also absorb the costs of research and \n     development. In addition to finding this new deadline \n     unacceptable, it is our position that this action is not \n     within the scope of the SNAP program.\n       While this particular issue is extremely important to my \n     small business, the concern that I bring before this \n     committee has more to do with how the EPA approached this \n     proposed rulemaking. I think everyone would agree that \n     regulation works best when all concerned parties work \n     together to consider all the issues. When the regulatory \n     process is by-passed and rules are broken the resulting \n     regulation can be both harmful and ineffective. Sadly, EPA \n     did not follow the rules when it proposed the SNAP program \n     last year.\n       In late June, 2000 during an unrelated call to EPA, I was \n     informed that EPA was about to publish this proposed rule in \n     the Federal Register. When questioning why the EPA had not \n     contacted manufacturers or end users that this proposal was \n     being considered, I was told that they considered it a \n     success that they were able to keep this proposal quiet, \n     prior to publication.\n       This would have been less of a concern if EPA understood \n     our industry.\n       In the NPRM the EPA stated that: (1) ``EPA believes that \n     today's proposal will not result in a significant cost to \n     appliance manufacturers or consumers''; (2) ``This rule would \n     not have a significant impact on a substantial number of \n     small entities because we expect the cost of the SNAP \n     requirements to be minor''; and (3) ``EPA has determined that \n     it is not necessary to prepare a regulatory flexibility \n     analysis in connection with this proposal.''\n       We take great exception to these remarks.\n       I am here to tell you that this rule will have an affect on \n     thousands of small manufacturers across the country. The only \n     economic study that EPA seems to have done was based on data \n     from a multi-billion dollar appliance manufacturer. If EPA \n     was truly interested in knowing what companies would be \n     impacted by this rule, they only had to make a few phone \n     calls or pull up a few web sites to identify boatbuilders, \n     truck body manufacturers, refrigerator equipment \n     manufacturers, and many other small entities. But they \n     never did. In fact they overlooked our industry. They did \n     not know how much this rule would cost my small business \n     and they did not know how many small businesses would face \n     similar costs.\n       The only phone call that I am aware of to an end-user was \n     made after the rule was proposed. An EPA staff person \n     contacted the National Marine Manufacturers Association and \n     informed them that boat builders never had an extension and \n     were currently violating the law. When the NMMA called me for \n     a clarification, there was panic in the voice on the other \n     end of the phone. They believed that by commenting they had \n     struck\n\n[[Page S4601]]\n\n     a hornet's nest. I faxed them a copy of the initial rule, \n     which clearly stated that boat builders did have an extension \n     and were not in violation of the law. EPA was eventually \n     forced to recognize that indeed boat builders did have an \n     extension and were overlooked in this rulemaking process.\n       Instead of accusing boat builders of operating illegally, \n     EPA should have learned from them and tried to find out how \n     the proposed rule affected them. EPA would have learned that \n     the Coast Guard requires boats under 20 feet to have \n     flotation foam injected or poured into the hull of the boat. \n     EPA would have learned that over 1500 small business boat \n     builders use these products and would be impacted by this \n     rule. EPA would have known that it made a big mistake in \n     overlooking these types of small businesses and that it \n     needed to go back and look, listen, and learn about these \n     impacts.\n       The EPA also stated that ``non-ozone depleting substitutes \n     are now available for all end-users.'' As evidence they cite \n     a 1998 United Nations Technical Options Committee Report. \n     However, one of the authors of that report took exception to \n     EPA's interpretation of the report and commented that, ``the \n     proposed rule incorrectly interprets the UNTOC 1998 report. \n     (Copies of the author's comments are in your handouts)\n       The bottom line is that this rule will affect many small \n     businesses that EPA never considered when the proposal was \n     developed. In addition, it is obvious that the EPA staff did \n     not do their homework, because the proposed alternatives are \n     more expensive, unavailable at this time, less effective or \n     present other VOC or flammability hazards.\n       This rule will severely jeopardize FSI and it's customers \n     who cannot possibly pass on the increased chemical and \n     testing costs to their customers and still hope to be able to \n     compete with the larger corporations.\n       Another very important overlooked casualty of this rule \n     would be the environment itself. Breakthroughs in any \n     industry are commonly a result of the efforts of the little \n     guy who has to stay one step ahead of the big corporations \n     just to stay in business. Our industry is constantly \n     trying to develop new products, which benefit our \n     customers and improve the environment. There are products \n     being tested and developed by FSI and others like us that \n     would have to be abandoned due to this new deadline. These \n     products would not only be better for the environment, but \n     also more cost effective for the small businessman.\n       Dave and Karen Keske's of FSI and other small business \n     entrepreneurs want to be able to continue to dedicate their \n     limited resources to test and develop new products. These are \n     products that they are confident will be better for their \n     customers and for the environment. This will only happen if \n     the issues and concerns of companies directly impacted by the \n     rules are made aware of these rules before they are proposed. \n     This was supposed to happen in this rulemaking. The SBREFA \n     law requires it and in this case the law was ignored. Because \n     this has happened, EPA has put FSI and many other small \n     businesses in serious economic jeopardy.\n       In closing, I would like to make one point very clear, FSI \n     is not looking for special treatment. We only want to be \n     treated in accordance with the law. It is our belief that \n     when the playing field is kept level, FSI and other small \n     businesses prosper.\n       Thank you for your attention.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      Testimony of Victor Rezendes\n\n       I am pleased to be here today to discuss the implementation \n     of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA), as amended, \n     and the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of \n     1996 (SBREFA). As you requested, I will discuss our work on \n     the implementation of these two statutes in recent years, \n     with particular emphasis on a report that we prepared for \n     this committee last year on the implementation of the acts by \n     the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n       The RFA requires federal agencies to examine the impact of \n     their proposed and final rules on ``small entities'' (small \n     businesses, small governmental jurisdictions, and small \n     organizations) and to solicit the ideas and comments of such \n     entities for this purpose. Specifically, whenever agencies \n     are required to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking, the \n     RFA requires agencies to prepare an initial and a final \n     regulatory flexibility analysis. However, the RFA also states \n     that those analytical requirements do not apply if the head \n     of the agency certifies that the rule will not have a \n     ``significant economic impact on a substantial number of \n     small entities,'' or what I will--for the sake of brevity--\n     term a ``significant impact.'' SBREFA was enacted to \n     strengthen the RFA's protections for small entities, and some \n     of the act's requirements are built on this ``significant \n     impact'' determination. For example, one provision of SBREFA \n     requires that before publishing a proposed rule that may have \n     a significant impact, EPA and the Occupational Safety and \n     Health Administration must convene a small business advocacy \n     review panel for the draft rule, and collect the advice and \n     recommendations of representatives of affected small entities \n     about the potential impact of the draft rule.\n       We have reviewed the implementation of the RFA and SBREFA \n     several times during recent years, with topics ranging from \n     specific provisions in each statute to the overall \n     implementation of the RFA. Although both of these reform \n     initiatives have clearly affected how federal agencies \n     regulate, we believe that their full promise has not been \n     realized. To achieve that promise, Congress may need to \n     clarify what it expects the agencies to do with regard to the \n     statutes' requirements. In particular, Congress may need to \n     clearly delineate--or have some other organization \n     delineate--what is meant by the terms ``significant economic \n     impact'' and ``substantial number of small entities.'' The \n     RFA does not define what Congress meant by these terms and \n     does not give any entity the authority or responsibility \n     to define them governmentwide. As a result, agencies have \n     had to construct their own definitions, and those \n     definitions vary. Over the past decade, we have \n     recommended several times that Congress provide greater \n     clarity with regard to these terms, but to date Congress \n     has not acted on our recommendations.\n       The questions that remain unanswered are numerous and \n     varied. For example, does Congress believe that the economic \n     impact of a rule should be measured in terms of compliance \n     costs as a percentage of businesses' annual revenues or the \n     percentage of work hours available to the firms? If so, is 3 \n     percent (or 1 percent) of revenues or work hours the \n     appropriate definition of ``significant?'' Should agencies \n     take into account the cumulative impact of their rules on \n     small entities, even within a particular program area? Should \n     agencies count the impact of the underlying statutes when \n     determining whether their rules have a significant impact? \n     What should be considered a ``rule'' for purposes of the \n     requirement in the RFA that the agencies review rules with a \n     significant impact within 10 years of their promulgation? \n     Should agencies review rules that had a significant impact at \n     the time they were originally published, or only those that \n     currently have that effect?\n       These questions are not simply matters of administrative \n     conjecture within the agencies. They lie at the heart of the \n     RFA and SBREFA, and the answers to the questions can be a \n     substantive effect on the amount of regulatory relief \n     provided through those statutes. Because Congress did not \n     answer these questions when the statutes were enacted, \n     agencies have had to developed their own answers. If Congress \n     does not like the answers that the agencies have developed, \n     it needs to either amend the underlying statutes and provide \n     what it believes are the correct answers or give some other \n     entity the authority to issue guidance on these issues.\n\n\n                         proposed epa lead rule\n\n       The implications of the current lack of clarity with regard \n     to the term ``significant impact'' and the discretion that \n     agencies have to define it were clearly illustrated in a \n     report that we prepared for this committee last year. One \n     part of our report focused on a proposed rule that EPA \n     published in August 1999 that would, upon implementation, \n     lower certain reporting thresholds for lead and lead \n     compounds under the Toxics Release Inventory program from as \n     high as 25,000 pounds to 10 pounds. EPA estimated that \n     approximately 5,600 small businesses would be affected by the \n     rule, and that the first-year costs of the rule for each of \n     these small businesses would be between $5,200 and $7,500. \n     EPA said that the total cost of the rule in the first year of \n     implementation would be about $116 million. However, EPA \n     certified that the rule would not have a significant impact, \n     and therefore did not trigger certain analytical and \n     procedural requirements of the RFA.\n       Mr. Chairman, last year you asked us to review the \n     methodology that EPA used in the economic analysis for the \n     proposed lead rule and describe key aspects of that \n     methodology that may have contributed to the agency's \n     conclusion that the rule would not have a significant impact. \n     You also asked us to determine whether additional data or \n     analysis could have yielded a different conclusion about the \n     rule's impact on small entities. Finally, you also asked us \n     to describe and compare the rates at which EPA's major \n     program offices certified that their substantive proposed \n     rules would not have a significant impact. We did not examine \n     whether lead was a persistent bioaccumulative toxic or the \n     value of the Toxics Release Inventory program in general.\n       EPA's current guidance on how the RFA should be implemented \n     gives the agency's program offices substantial discretion \n     with regard to certification decisions but also provides \n     numerical guidelines to help define what constitutes a \n     significant impact. For example, the guidance indicates that \n     a rule should be presumed eligible for certification as not \n     having a significant impact if it does not impose annual \n     compliance costs amounting to 1 percent of estimated annual \n     revenues on any number of small entities. However, if \n     those compliance costs amount to 3 percent or more of \n     revenues on 1,000 or more small entities, the guidance \n     indicates that the program office should presume that the \n     rule is ineligible for certification.\n       These numerical guidelines establish what appears to be a \n     high threshold for what constitutes a significant impact. For \n     example, an EPA rule could theoretically impose $10,000 in \n     compliance costs on 10,000 small businesses, but the \n     guidelines indicate that the agency can presume that the rule \n     does not trigger the requirements of the RFA as long as those \n     costs do not represent at least 1 percent of the affected \n     businesses' annual revenues. The guidance does not take into \n     account the profit margins of the businesses involved. \n     Therefore, if the profit margin in\n\n[[Page S4602]]\n\n     the affected businesses is less than 5 percent, the costs \n     required to implement a rule could conceivably take one-fifth \n     of that profit and, under EPA's guidelines, still not be \n     considered to have a significant impact. Neither does the \n     guidance take into account the cumulative impact of the \n     agency's rules on small businesses. Therefore, if EPA issued \n     100 rules, each of which imposed compliance costs amounting \n     to one-half of 1 percent of annual sales on 10,000 \n     businesses, the agency could certify each of the rules as not \n     having a significant impact even though the cumulative impact \n     amounted to 50 percent of the affected businesses' revenues. \n     Consideration of cumulative regulatory impact is not even \n     required within a particular area like the Toxics Release \n     Inventory program. Each toxic substance added to the \n     approximately 600 substances already listed in the program, \n     or each change in the reporting threshold for a listed toxin, \n     constitutes a separate regulatory action under the RFA.\n       An agency's conclusions about the impact of a rule on small \n     entities can also be driven by the agency's analytical \n     approach. In its original economic analysis for the proposed \n     lead rule, EPA made a number of assumptions that clearly \n     contributed to its determination that no small entities would \n     experience significant economic effects. For example, to \n     estimate the annual revenues of companies expected to file \n     new Toxics Release Inventory reports for lead, EPA assumed \n     that (1) the new filers would have employment and economic \n     characteristics similar to current filers, (2) different \n     types of manufacturers would experience similar economic \n     effects, and (3) the revenues of the smallest manufacturers \n     covered by the proposed rule could be exemplified by the firm \n     at the 25th percentile of the agency's projected revenue \n     distribution for small manufacturers. As a result of these \n     and other assumptions, EPA estimated that the smallest \n     manufacturers affected by the proposed lead rule had annual \n     revenues of $4 million. Using that $4 million revenue \n     estimate and other information, EPA concluded that none of \n     the 5,600 small businesses would experience first-year \n     compliance costs of 1 percent or more of their annual \n     revenues. Therefore, EPA certified that the proposed lead \n     rule would not have a significant impact.\n       EPA revised these and other parts of the economic analysis \n     for the proposed lead rule before submitting it to the Office \n     of Management and Budget (OMB) for final review in July 2000. \n     According to a summary of the draft revised economic analysis \n     that we reviewed, EPA changed several analytic assumptions \n     and methods, and revised its estimates of the rule's impact \n     on small businesses. Specifically, the agency said that the \n     lead rule would affect more than 8,600 small companies (up \n     from about 5,600 in the original analysis), and as many as \n     464 of them would experience first-year compliance costs of \n     at least 1 percent of their annual revenues (up from zero in \n     the original estimate). Nevertheless, EPA again concluded \n     that the rule would not have a significant impact. During our \n     review, we discovered that the agency's revised estimate of \n     the number of small companies that would experience a 1 \n     percent economic impact was based on only 36 of the 69 \n     industries that the agency said could be affected by the \n     rule. EPA officials said that the other 33 industries were \n     not included in the agency's estimate because of lack of \n     data.\n       We attempted to provided a more complete picture of how the \n     lead rule would affect small businesses by estimating how \n     many companies in these missing 33 industries could \n     experience a first-year economic impact of at least 1 percent \n     of annual revenues. We obtained data from the Bureau of the \n     Census for 32 of these 33 industries and estimated that as \n     many as 1,098 additional small businesses could experience \n     this 1-percent effect. If EPA had used this analytic approach \n     in combination with its own studies, it would have concluded \n     that as many as 1,500 small businesses would experience \n     compliance costs amounting to at least 1 percent of annual \n     revenues. Therefore, using its own guidance, EPA could have \n     concluded that the rule should not be certified, prepared a \n     regulatory flexibility analysis, and convened an advocacy \n     review panel for the rule. However, we ultimately concluded \n     that the agency's initial and revised analyses and the \n     conclusions that it based on those studies were within the \n     broad discretion that the RFA and the EPA guidance provided \n     in determining what constituted a ``significant economic \n     impact'' on a ``substantial number of small entities.''\n       In the final lead rule that EPA published in January 2001, \n     EPA set the new reporting threshold for lead at 100 pounds--\n     up from 10 pounds in the proposed rule. However, just as it \n     did for the proposed rule, EPA concluded that the final rule \n     would not have a significant impact. EPA said that it reached \n     this conclusion because it did not believe the rule would \n     have a significant economic impact (defined as annual costs \n     between 1 and 3 percent of annual revenues) on more than 250 \n     of the 4,100 small businesses expected to be affected by the \n     rule. EPA also illustrated what it viewed as nonsignificant \n     impact in terms of work hours. The agency said that it would \n     take a first-time filer about 110 hours to fill out the form. \n     Because the smallest firm that could be affected by the rule \n     must have at least 20,000 labor hours per year (10 employees \n     times 50 weeks per year per employee times 40 hours per \n     week), EPA said that the 110 hours required to fill out the \n     Toxics Release Inventory form in the first year represents \n     only about one-half of 1 percent of the total amount of time \n     the firm has available in that year.\n       EPA' determination that the proposed lead rule would not \n     have a significant impact on small entities was not unique. \n     Its four major program offices certified about 78 percent of \n     the substantive proposed rules that they published in the \n     2\\1/2\\ years before SBREFA took effect in 1996 but certified \n     96 percent of the proposed rules published in the 2\\1/2\\ \n     years after the act's implementation. In fact, two of the \n     program offices--the Office of Prevention, Pesticides and \n     Toxic Substances and the Office of Solid Waste--certified all \n     47 of their proposed rules in this post-SBREFA period as not \n     having a significant impact. The Office of Air and Radiation \n     certified 97 percent of its proposed rules during this \n     period, and the Office of Water certified 88 percent. EPA \n     officials told us that the increased rate of certification \n     after SBREFA's implementation was caused by a change in the \n     agency's RFA guidance on what constituted a significant \n     impact. Prior to SBREFA, EPA's policy was to prepare a \n     regulatory flexibility analysis for any rule that the agency \n     expected to have any impact on any small entities. The \n     officials said that this guidance was changed because the \n     SBREFA requirement to convene an advocacy review panel for \n     any proposed rule that was not certified made the \n     continuation of the agency's more inclusive RFA policy too \n     costly and impractical.\n\n\n                 Previous Reports On the RFA and SBREFA\n\n       We have issued several other reports in recent years on the \n     implementation of the RFA and SBREFA that, in combination, \n     illustrate both the promise and the problems associated with \n     the statutes. For example, in 1991, we examined the \n     implementation of the RFA with regard to small governments \n     and concluded that each of the four federal agencies we \n     reviewed had a different interpretation of key RFA \n     provisions. We said that the act allowed agencies to \n     interpret when they believed their proposed regulations \n     affected small government, and recommended that Congress \n     consider amending the RFA to require the Small Business \n     Administration (SBA) to develop criteria regarding whether \n     and how to conduct the required analyses.\n       In 1994, we noted that the RFA required the SBA Chief \n     Counsel for Advocacy to monitor agencies' compliance with the \n     act. However, we also said that one reason for agencies' lack \n     of compliance with the RFA's requirements was that the act \n     did not expressly authorize SBA to interpret key provisions \n     in the statute and did not require SBA to develop criteria \n     for agencies to follow in reviewing their rules. We said that \n     if Congress wanted to strengthen the implementation of the \n     RFA, it should consider amending the act to (1) provide SBA \n     with clearer authority and responsibility to interpret the \n     RFA's provisions, and (2) require SBA, in consultation with \n     OMB, to develop criteria as to whether and how federal \n     agencies should conduct RFA analyses.\n       In our 1998 report on the implementation of the small \n     business advocacy review requirements in SBREFA, we said that \n     the lack of clarity regarding whether EPA should have \n     convened panels for two of its proposed rules was traceable \n     to the lack of agreed-upon governmentwide criteria as to \n     whether a rule has a significant impact. Nevertheless, we \n     said that the panels that had been convened were generally \n     well received by both the agencies and the small business \n     representatives. We also said that if Congress wished to \n     clarify and strengthen the implementation of the RFA and \n     SBREFA, it should consider (1) providing SBA or another \n     entity with clearer authority and responsibility to interpret \n     the RFA's provisions and (2) requiring SBA or some other \n     entity to develop criteria defining a ``significant economic \n     impact on a substantial number of small entities.'' In 1999, \n     we noted a similar lack of clarity regarding the RFA's \n     requirement that agencies review their existing rules that \n     have a significant impact within 10 years of their \n     promulgation. We said that if Congress is concerned that this \n     section of the RFA has been subject to varying \n     interpretations, it may wish to clarify those provisions. We \n     also recommended that OMB take certain actions to improve the \n     administration of these review requirements, some of which \n     have been implemented.\n       Last year we convened a meeting at GAO on the rule review \n     provision of the RFA, focusing on why the required reviews \n     were not being conducted. Attending that meeting were \n     representatives from 12 agencies that appeared to issue rules \n     with an impact on small entities, representatives from \n     relevant oversight organizations (e.g., OMB and SBA's Office \n     of Advocacy), and congressional staff from the House and \n     Senate Committees on Small Business. The meeting revealed \n     significant differences of opinion regarding key terms in the \n     statute. For example, some agencies did not consider their \n     rules to have a significant impact because they believed the \n     underlying statutes, not the agency-developed regulations, \n     caused the effect on small entities. There was also confusion \n     regarding whether the agencies were supposed to review rules \n     that had a significant impact on small entities at the time \n     the rule was first published in the Fedeal Register or those \n     that currently have such an impact. It was not even clear \n     what should be considered to ``rule'' under RFA's rule review \n     requirements--the entire section of the Code of Federal \n     Regulations that was affected by the rule, or just the part \n     of the existing rule that was being amended. By the end of \n     the meeting it was clear that, as one congressional\n\n[[Page S4603]]\n\n     staff member said, ``determining compliance with (the RFA) is \n     less obvious that we believed before.''\n       Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement. I \n     reveal would be happy to responded to any questions.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            Agency Accountability Act--Summary of Provisions\n\n\n                         Section 1. Short Title\n\n       This act may be cited as the ``Agency Accountability Act of \n     2001''.\n\n\n                    Section 2. Findings and Purposes\n\n    Section 3. Ensuring Full Analysis of Potential Impacts on Small \n             Entities of Rules Proposed by Certain Agencies\n\n       This section improves the procedure for the conducting \n     Small Business Advocacy Review Panels by requiring the agency \n     to collaborate with the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the \n     Small Business Administration in selecting the small entity \n     representatives. It requires the agency to publish the panel \n     report in the Federal Register and to distribute the report \n     to the small entity representatives.\n\n\n                         Section 4. Definitions\n\n       This section expands the list of agencies required to \n     conduct Small Business Advocacy Review Panels for regulations \n     that will have a significant economic impact on a substantial \n     number of small entities to include the Internal Revenue \n     Service of the Treasury Department, the National Marine \n     Fisheries Service of the Commerce Department, the U.S. Forest \n     Service of the Agriculture Department, and the U.S. Fish and \n     Wildlife Service of the Interior Department. The section also \n     allows organizations that primarily represent small entities \n     to serve as Small Entity Representatives. Finally, this \n     section directs the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small \n     Business Administration to promulgate a rule making to \n     further define the terms ``significant economic impact'' and \n     ``substantial number of small entities'' and to consider the \n     indirect impacts regulations have on small businesses when \n     promulgating these regulations.\n\n\n            Section 5. Collection of Information Requirement\n\n       This section revises the conditions under which the \n     Internal Revenue Service must conduct an initial regulatory \n     flexibility analysis for interpretative regulations. If the \n     IRS is promulgating a temporary regulation, the IRS may avoid \n     this requirement but it must inform the Chief Counsel for \n     Advocacy at the time of the decision and include an \n     explanation of why the temporary regulation is required \n     because using a notice and comment procedure would be \n     impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public \n     interest, and an explanation of the reasons that \n     circumstances warrant an exception from the panel review \n     requirement. This notice and explanation must also be \n     published in the Federal Register.\n\n\n           Section 6. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis\n\n       This sections adds the requirement of conducting a cost/\n     benefit analysis of the regulation to the requirements of the \n     Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis required under the \n     Regulatory Flexibility Act. Agencies are also directed to \n     take into account, to the extent practical, the cumulative \n     cost of their regulations on small businesses and the \n     effect of the proposed regulation on those cumulative \n     costs. Finally, agencies are directed to make an initial \n     certification that the benefits of the proposed rule \n     justify the costs of the proposed rule to small entities.\n\n\n            Section 7. Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis\n\n       This section adds cost/benefit analyses to the requirements \n     of the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis called for under \n     the Regulatory Flexibility Act. It also requires agencies to \n     make a final certification that the benefits of the \n     regulation justify the costs of the regulation to the small \n     entities that will be subject to it. Finally, agencies are \n     required to describe the comments received on the Initial \n     Regulatory Flexibility Analysis and a statement of any change \n     made as a result of those comments.\n\n\n          Section 8. Publication of Decision to Certify a Rule\n\n       This section requires agencies to publish separately in the \n     Federal Register their decision to certify a regulation as \n     not having a significant economic impact on a substantial \n     number of small entities instead of the current requirement \n     of publishing that decision with the proposed rule. This also \n     requires the agency to publish a summary of the economic \n     analysis supporting that decision and indicates what must be \n     in that summary. The complete analysis is to be made \n     available on the Internet to the extent practicable.\n\n\n          Section 9. Judicial review of Certification Decision\n\n       This section makes the agency decision to certify a \n     regulation as not having a singificant economic impact on a \n     substantial number of small entities judicially reviewable \n     and specifies that the remedy shall be voiding of the \n     certification and requiring the agency to conduct the Initial \n     Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, Final Regulatory Flexibility \n     Analysis, and the small business advocacy review panel if \n     required.\n\n\n   Section 10. Exclusion of Agency Outreach to Small Businesses from \n             Certain Collection of Information Requirements\n\n       This section excludes outreach efforts to small businesses \n     to determine the impact of regulations from the requirements \n     for Office of Management and Budget clearance under the \n     Paperwork Reduction Act.\n\n\n                       Section 11. Effective Date\n\n       This act shall take effect 90 days after the date of \n     enactment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CHAFEE (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. \n        Torricelli, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 850. A bill to expand the Federal tax refund intercept program to \ncover children who are not minors; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today by \nSenators Graham, Lincoln, Torricelli, and Kohl in introducing the Child \nSupport Fairness and Tax Refund Interception Act of 2001.\n  The Child Support Fairness and Tax Refund Interception Act of 2001 \ncloses a loophole in current federal statute by expanding the \neligibility of one of the most effective means of enforcing child \nsupport orders, that of intercepting the federal tax refunds of parents \nwho are delinquent in paying their court-ordered financial support for \ntheir children.\n  Under current law, eligibility for the federal tax refund offset \nprogram is limited to cases involving minors, parents on public \nassistance, or adult children who are disabled. Custodial parents of \nadult, non-disabled children are not assisted under the IRS tax refund \nintercept program, and in many cases, they must work multiple jobs in \norder to make ends meet. Some of these parents have gone into debt to \nput their college-age children through school.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will address this inequity \nby expanding the eligibility of the federal tax refund offset program \nto cover parents of all children, regardless of whether the child is \ndisabled or a minor. This legislation will not create a cause of action \nfor a custodial parent to seek additional child support. In will merely \nassist the custodial parent in removing debt that is owed for a level \nof child support that was determined by a court.\n  Improving our child support enforcement programs is an issue that \nshould be of concern to us all as it remains a serious problem in the \nUnited States. According to the most recent government statistics, \nthere are approximately twelve million active cases in which a child \nsupport order requires a noncustodial parent to contribute to the \nsupport of his or her child. Of the $22 billion owed in 1999, only $12 \nbillion has been collected. In 1998, only 23 percent of children \nentitled to child support through our public system received some form \nof payment, despite federal and state efforts. Similar shortfalls in \nprevious years bring the combined delinquency total to approximately \n$47 billion. We can fix this injustice in our federal tax refund offset \nprogram by helping some of our most needy constituents receive the \nfinancial assistance they are owed.\n  While previous administrations have been somewhat successful in using \ntax refunds as a tool to collect child support payments, more needs to \nbe done. The IRS tax refund interception program has only collected \none-third of tardy child support payments. The Child Support Fairness \nand Tax Refund Interception Act of 2001 will remove the current barrier \nto fulfilling an individual's obligation to pay child support, while \nhelping to provide for the future of our nation's children.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation, and ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 850\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Child Support Fairness and \n     Tax Refund Interception Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Enforcing child support orders remains a serious \n     problem in the United States. There are approximately \n     12,000,000 active cases in which a child support order \n     requires a noncustodial parent to contribute to the support \n     of his or her child. Of the $22,000,000,000 owed in 1999 \n     pursuant to such orders, $12,000,000,000, or 54 percent, has \n     been collected.\n       (2) It is an injustice for the Federal Government to issue \n     tax refunds to a deadbeat\n\n[[Page S4604]]\n\n     spouse while a custodial parent has to work 2 or 3 jobs to \n     compensate for the shortfall in providing for their children.\n       (3) The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) program to intercept \n     the tax refunds of parents who owe child support arrears has \n     been successful in collecting a tenth of such arrears.\n       (4) The Congress has periodically expanded eligibility for \n     the IRS tax refund intercept program. Initially, the program \n     was limited to intercepting Federal tax refunds owed to \n     parents on public assistance. In 1984, the Congress expanded \n     the program to cover parents not on public assistance. \n     Finally, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 made \n     the program permanent and expanded the program to cover \n     parents of adult children who are disabled.\n       (5) The injustice to the custodial parent is the same \n     regardless of whether the child is disabled, non-disabled, a \n     minor, or an adult, so long as the child support obligation \n     is provided for by a court or administrative order. It is \n     common for parents to help their adult children finance a \n     college education, a wedding, or a first home. Some parents \n     cannot afford to do that because they are recovering from \n     debt they incurred to cover expenses that would have been \n     covered if they had been paid the child support owed to them \n     in a timely manner.\n       (6) This Act would address this injustice by expanding the \n     program to cover parents of all adult children, regardless of \n     whether the child is disabled.\n       (7) This Act does not create a cause of action for a \n     custodial parent to seek additional child support. This Act \n     merely helps the custodial parent recover debt they are owed \n     for a level of child support that was set by a court after \n     both sides had the opportunity to present their arguments \n     about the proper amount of child support.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish a commission to conduct a study of \ngovernment privacy practices, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Citizens' Privacy Commission Act of 2001.'' This legislation will \nestablish an 11-member commission to examine how Federal, State, and \nlocal governments collect and use our personal information and to make \nrecommendations to Congress as we consider how to map out government \nprivacy protections for the future. The Citizens' Privacy Commission, \nwhose members will include experts with a diversity of experiences, \nwill look at the spectrum of privacy concerns involving Federal, State, \nand local government, from protecting citizens' genetic information, to \nguaranteeing the safe use of Social Security numbers, to ensuring \nconfidentiality to citizens visiting government web sites.\n  As we all know, Americans are increasingly concerned about the \npotential misuse of their personal information. A variety of measures \nintended to address the collection, use, and distribution of personal \ninformation by the private sector have been introduced in Congress. \nRecent events, however, suggest that government privacy practices \nwarrant closer scrutiny. For example, details surfaced last summer \nabout the FBI's new e-mail surveillance system--Carnivore. Civil \nlibertarians and Internet users alike continue to question the \nlegitimacy of this ``online wiretapping.''\n  Also last summer, after the White House Office of National Drug \nControl Policy was found to be using ``cookies'' on Internet search \nengines, I requested that GAO investigate Federal agencies' use of \nthese information-collection devices on their own Web sites. GAO only \nhad time to investigate a small sample of Federal agency sites, but \nthey found a number of unauthorized ``cookies,'' including one that was \noperated by a third-party private company on an agency Web site under \nan agreement that gave the private company co-ownership of the data \ncollected on visitors to the site.\n  As a follow-up to the GAO investigation, Congressman Jay Inslee and I \nworked together on an amendment to require all agency Inspectors \nGeneral to report to Congress on each agency's Internet information-\ncollection practices. Fewer than half of the Inspectors General have \ncompleted their investigations, but the preliminary findings are cause \nfor concern. In audits performed this past winter, sixteen Inspectors \nGeneral identified sixty-four agency Web sites that were violating the \nprivacy policies established by the last Administration by using \ninformation-collection devices called ``cookies'' without the required \napproval.\n  Last fall, Congressmen Armey and Tauzin released a GAO report that \nrevealed that 97 percent of the Web sites of Federal agencies, \nincluding the Federal Trade Commission, weren't in compliance with \nprivacy standards that the FTC was advocating for private sector Web \nsites.\n  On top of all these examples, there is the issue of computer security \nat Federal agencies, which has been notoriously lax for years. GAO and \nFederal agency Inspectors General report time and time again that \nsensitive information on citizens' health and financial records is \nvulnerable to hackers. Just this spring, GAO issued a report which \nexplained how easily their investigators were able to hack into IRS \ncomputers and gain access to citizens' e-filed taxes. Not surprisingly, \na recent poll shows that most Americans perceive government as the \ngreatest threat to their personal privacy, above both the media and \ncorporations.\n  Last year, Senator Kohl and I sponsored the Senate companion bill to \nthe Hutchinson-Moran Privacy Commission Act. This bill would have \ncreated a commission to study privacy issues in both the government and \nthe private sector. The House bill failed a suspension vote by a narrow \nmargin. There was a lack of consensus on whether a commission was \nwarranted for the private sector issues being deliberated by the \nCongress. There was no disagreement, however, on the need for a \ncommission to study the government's management of citizens' personal \nprivacy. Many privacy advocates believe that the Privacy Act of 1974 \nand other laws addressing government privacy practices need to be \nupdated, but we need a better understanding of the extent of the \nproblem and of what exactly needs to be done.\n\n  Federal, State, and local governments collect, use, and distribute a \nlarge quantity of personal information for legitimate purposes. Yet \nbecause governments operate under different incentives and under a \ndifferent legal relationship than the private sector, they may pose \nunique privacy problems. Unlike businesses, governments collect \npersonal information under the force of law. Furthermore, governments \ndo not face the market incentives that can discourage information \ncollection or sharing. With the power and authority of government and \nthe breadth of information it collects comes the potential for mistakes \nor abuse. The risk of privacy violations could also threaten to \nundermine the public's confidence in e-Government, our effort to make \ngovernment more accessible and responsive to citizens through the \nInternet. In fact, according to a recent Pew Internet and American Life \nreport, only 31 percent of Americans say they trust the government to \ndo the right thing most of the time or all of the time.\n  The last Federal privacy commission operated over 25 years ago, from \n1975 to 1977. Since then, there have been enormous leaps in technology. \nToday, a few keystrokes on a computer hooked up to the Internet can \nproduce a quantity of information that was unimaginable in 1975. The \nquestion we must answer today is the same question Congress addressed \nin 1975: ``How can government achieve the correct balance between \nprotecting personal privacy and allowing appropriate uses of \ninformation?'' The technological advances and other changes that have \noccurred since the 1970's, however, demand a reevaluation of the \ngovernment privacy protections that we currently have in place. While \nwe have passed laws laying out a framework for the Federal government, \nit is time to reassess the laws designed to safeguard citizens' privacy \nin light of the current state of technology.\n  The Citizens' Privacy Commission will help us find the balance \nbetween protecting the privacy of individuals\n\n[[Page S4605]]\n\nand permitting specific and appropriate uses of personal information \nfor legitimate and necessary government purposes. The Commission will \nbe directed to study a wide variety of issues relating to personal \nprivacy and the government, including the collection, use, and \ndistribution of personal information by Federal, State, and local \ngovernments, as well as current legislative and regulatory efforts to \nrespond to privacy problems in the government. In the course of its \nexamination of these issues, the Commission will also be required to \nhold at least three field hearings around the country and to set up a \nWeb site to facilitate public participation and public comment. After \n18 months of study, the Commission will submit a report to Congress on \nits findings, including any recommendations for legislation to reform \nor augment current laws. The Commission's report will be available for \nconsideration by the next Congress.\n  It is my hope that we all can work together to pass the Citizens' \nPrivacy Commission Act of 2001 to help us make informed and thoughtful \ndecisions to protect the privacy of the American people. I would like \nto thank Senator Kohl, who has worked with me on a privacy commission \nbill for some time, as well as Senators Voinovich, Levin, Thurmond, \nCollins, and Fitzgerald for joining us as cosponsors. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 851\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Citizens' Privacy Commission \n     Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Americans are increasingly concerned about their civil \n     liberties and the security, collection, use, and distribution \n     of their personal information by government, including \n     medical records and genetic information, educational records, \n     health records, tax records, library records, driver's \n     license numbers, and other records.\n       (2) The shift from a paper based government to an \n     information technology reliant government calls for a \n     reassessment of the most effective way to balance personal \n     privacy and information use, keeping in mind the potential \n     for unintended effects on technology development and privacy \n     needs.\n       (3) Concerns have been raised about the adequacy of \n     existing government privacy laws and the adequacy of their \n     enforcement in light of new technologies.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.\n\n       There is established a commission to be known as the \n     ``Citizens' Privacy Commission'' (in this Act referred to as \n     the ``Commission'').\n\n     SEC. 4.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Citizens' \nPrivacy Commission Act'' with my colleague, Senator Fred Thompson. \nPrivacy has become an issue of paramount importance in this era of \nelectronic commerce, advanced communications, and far-reaching business \nconglomerates. Our challenge is to clearly define privacy concerns and \ndecide how best to protect privacy as technology and the economy move \nforward. However, even as we consider privacy guidelines for the \nprivate sector, the government should follow the highest privacy \nstandards and demonstrate not only that they are preferable, but that \nthey work.\n  The measure we introduce today would create a Commission to examine \nhow the various levels of government collect, use and share information \nabout citizens. Although the recent privacy debate has been focused on \nonline privacy and how the private sector collects and sells personally \nidentifiable information, the government should not be overlooked. All \nlevels of government have their own websites that are as capable of \ncollecting sensitive information. There is also concern that the \nPrivacy Act of 1974, which regulates how the government can collect, \nuse and share personal information, is not being enforced or properly \nadhered to by federal government agencies. Furthermore, there is \nevidence that some government websites continue to collect information \nthrough the use of ``cookies'' in direct violation of former President \nClinton's June 2000 executive order forbidding them to do so absent a \n``compelling reason'' to do so.\n  Our proposal is simple, and its goals are modest and meaningful. \nSpecifically, our measure creates an 11 member, bipartisan panel to \nstudy data collection practices, privacy protection standards, and \nexisting privacy laws that apply to government collection and use of \npersonal information. We also ask the Commission to examine pending \nprivacy initiatives before Congress. Furthermore, we ask the Commission \nto determine if federal legislation is needed, and what impact new \nprivacy laws would be. Finally, we direct the Commission to detail its \nfindings and recommendations in a Final Report to be issued 18 months \nafter enactment.\n  There is ample precedent for this Commission. In the mid-1970's, the \nprivacy debate focused on government collection and misuse of personal \ndata. Ultimately, Congress enacted the Freedom of Information Act, the \nPrivacy Act, and the Privacy Study Commission. Since that time, \nhowever, very little attention has been paid to genuine concerns about \ngovernment use of sensitive personal information. Having passed \ncritical legislation in the 1970s, many people felt satisfied that the \nissue was taken care of. Unfortunately, we have grown lax about \npolicing ourselves in this area. This bill will right the course and \nchange that. In fact, this legislation provides us with the opportunity \nto establish a model of privacy protection. The intellectual capital \ncreated by the work of this Commission will help us set a responsible \nexample for the private sector.\n  Privacy protection is a unique struggle, cutting across the public \nand private sector and involving virtually every sector of our nation's \neconomy. Perhaps there is no possibility of a universal principle \ndefining necessary privacy protections. But the federal government has \nan unparalleled opportunity to try to craft a set of guidelines for \nprivacy protection that can serve as a model. We believe the time\n\n[[Page S4607]]\n\nhas come for Congress to enact reasonable and thoughtful privacy \nlegislation. This legislation is a sensible first step in that process.\n  In closing, let me be clear that this bill is neither a ploy to \nprevent the enactment of more specific privacy proposals, nor a \nstalling tactic to suspend discussion of privacy protection until the \nCommission publishes its final report. Rather, this legislation is a \nboth a genuine effort to gather information on this increasingly \ncomplex topic and a plan to accomplish something positive in this \nfield. This is legislation that can and should be passed by the \nCongress. Therefore, I truly hope we can move quickly to enact this \nmeasure into law, so that the Commission can get to work as soon as \npossible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Thomas, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Levin, Mr. Wellstone, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mr. Akaka, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Murray, and Mr. \n        Torricelli):\n  S. 852. A bill to support the aspirations of the Tibetan people to \nsafeguard their distinct identity; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to address the tragedy \nthat is unfolding in Tibet and, alongside Senators Thomas, Leahy, \nJeffords, Lieberman, Levin, Wellstone, Boxer, Akaka, Feingold, Kennedy, \nMurray, and Toricelli introduce the Tibetan Policy Act of 2001.\n  This legislation is intended to safeguard the legitimate aspirations \nof the Tibetan people in their struggle to preserve their cultural and \nreligious identity, and to encourage dialogue between the Dalai Lama or \nhis representative and the Government of the People's Republic of China \nabout the future of Tibet.\n  As many of my colleagues are aware, I have worked for well over a \ndecade, since before I came to the Senate, to find the right balance \nfor establishing a lasting, constructive dialogue between Chinese and \nTibetan leaders. I have tried to do so with the best interests of both \nsides in mind. For years, I have tried to build trust and improve \ncommunication between Chinese and Tibetan leaders.\n  For me this is very personal. I first met the Dalai Lama in 1978. I \nhave watched him, I have seen him, I have talked with him many, many \ntimes.\n  The Dalai Lama has pledged, over and over again, that what he wants \nis ``one-country, two systems'' approach, whereby Tibetans could live \ntheir life, practice their religion, educate their children, and \nmaintain their language with dignity and respect among the Han Chinese \npeople.\n  I have had the opportunity to speak, at great length, with the \nPresident of China and other senior members of the Chinese leadership \nabout Tibet.\n  For years, I believed compromise, good will, and moderation were the \nright tools for tearing down obstacles and building cooperation between \nthe peoples of China and Tibet.\n  I have even carried messages between the Dalai Lama and the President \nof China seeking to bring the two together.\n  In 1997, for example, I carried a letter from the Dalai Lama to \nPresident Jiang which, in part, stated that ``I have, for my part, \nopenly and in confidence conveyed to you that I am not demanding \nindependence for Tibet, which I believe is fundamental to the Chinese \ngovernment.'' The letter also suggested that the Dalai Lama and \nPresident Jiang meet to discuss relations between the Tibetans and the \nChinese government, and the ``maintenance and enhancement of those \ncultural, civic, and religious institutions that are so important to \nthe Tibetan people and others throughout the world.''\n\n  What I got back was essentially that the Dalai Lama was just a \nsplittist and that his word was not good.\n  I, for one, believe he is sincere, in his non-violence, in his \ndedication to being a monk, in his concern for the Tibetan people, \nheritage, and religion.\n  Yet Beijing has consistently ignored promises to preserve indigenous \nTibetan political, cultural and religious systems. Indeed, Beijing has \nnot kept its commitments made twice by China's paramount leaders--Deng \nXiaoping in 1979 and Jiang Zemin in 1997.\n  I believe that the time has come for the United States government to \nincrease our attention to enhanced Tibetan cultural and religious \nautonomy.\n  And I feel that I can no longer, in conscience, sit quietly and allow \nthe situation in Tibet, the wiping away of Tibetan culture from the \nTibetan Plateau, in fact, to deteriorate further.\n  In many ways, introducing this legislation, especially now, is a very \ndifficult step for me. I have a strong, abiding interest in good \nrelations between the United States and China, and I am fully aware \nthat in the current environment there will be many in China who would \nrather dismiss this legislation out of hand than work together to \naddress the underlying issues.\n  But, the many reasonable overtures made by me, many of my colleagues \nin Congress, and other individuals and organizations throughout the \nworld to work together with China over the past several years to \naddress this issue have thus far failed to persuade Beijing to \nreconsider its approach to Tibet.\n  And there does not appear to be a ``good time'' in U.S.-China \nrelations to introduce this legislation.\n  So I would say this to my friends in China that as they consider this \nlegislation and its intent: I take this action now because I and many \nof my colleagues are at the point where we feel that this legislation \nis necessary to open Beijing's eyes to a simple truth: honoring the \nbasic rights of minorities in China is not a threat to China's \nsovereignty, and running roughshod over its own citizens is not in \nChina's best interest.\n  I say this because many senior Chinese leaders, including Mao Zedong, \nZhou En Lai, Deng Xiaoping, Hu Yaobang, and Jiang Zemin have \nacknowledged as much in the past.\n  And I say this because the aspirations of the Tibetan people are not \nfor independence, but for autonomy and respect for their cultural and \nreligious institutions. As both the letter I conveyed to President \nJiang in 1997 and the Dalai Lama's statement on the 41st Anniversary of \nthe Tibetan National Uprising stated, ``my approach envisages that \nTibet enjoy genuine autonomy within the framework of the People's \nRepublic of China . . . such a mutually beneficial solution would \ncontribute to the stability and unity of China, their two most \nimportant priorities, while at the same time the Tibetans would be \nensured of their basic right to preserve their own civilization and to \nprotect the delicate environment of the Tibetan plateau.''\n  And I say this because I recognize that China is a rising great \nnation, with a rich culture and long history. Careful reading of its \nhistory shows that China, like the United States, draws real strength \nfrom its diversity, from its cultural, religious, and ethnic \nmultiplicity.\n  But, I am now convinced China's leadership will not modify its \nbehavior in Tibet until it becomes crystal clear that China's behavior \nrisks tarnishing its international image and burdening China with \ntangible costs.\n  Unfortnately, the situation in Tibet today is dreadful, and promises \nonly to get worse. Beijing is pursuing policies that threaten the \nTibetan people's very existence and distinct identity, and Chinese \nsecurity forces hold the region in an iron grip.\n  As Secretary Powell stated in his confirmation hearing before the \nForeign Relations Committee. ``It is a very difficult situation right \nnow with the Chinese sending more and more Han Chinese in to settle \nTibet.'' Chinese settlers are flooding into Tibet, displacing ethnic \nTibetans, guiding development in ways that clash with traditional \nTibetan needs and values, and monopolizing local resources.\n  I do not want to debate the complex historical interactions that \ncharacterize the history of relations between China and Tibet. I am not \ninterested in arguing about events in the past. What I am interested in \nis the quality of life and the right to exist as these concepts apply \nto Tibetans and Chinese today.\n  And, without question, a strong case can be made that Tibet has fared \npoorly under Chinese stewardship during the past fifty years: Beijing \nhas consistently ignored promises to preserve indigenous Tibetan \npolitical, cultural and religious systems and institutions, despite \nhaving formally guaranteed these rights in the 1951 Seventeen\n\n[[Page S4608]]\n\nPoint Agreement that incorporated Tibet into China. And, as I stated \nearlier, Beijing has never seriously moved itself to carry through on \npromises to find solutions to the Tibet problem, promises made at least \ntwice by China's paramount leaders, Deng Xiaoping in 1979 and Jiang \nZemin in 1997. Tibet has been the scene of many grassroots movements \nprotesting unwelcome Chinese intrusions and policies since 1956, when \nBeijing first began seriously disrupting Tibetan society by forcefully \nimposing so-called ``democratic reforms'' in the region. China's \nresponse to Tibetan protests has typically been violent, excessive, and \nunrestrained. In 1959, Beijing viciously and bloodily suppressed the \nmassive popular protest known as the Lhasa Uprising. Indeed, it is \nestimated that nearly 1.2 million Tibetans died at the hands of Chinese \nforces during the worst years of violence, between 1956 and 1976. \nInternational commissions and third-party courts of opinion, most \nnotably the International Commission of Jurists and numerous United \nNations resolutions, consistently pointed fingers at China as a \nviolator in Tibet of fundamental human rights and of the basic \nprinciples of international law.\n  According to the 2000 State Department Country Report on Human Rights \nPractices: Chinese Government authorities continued to commit numerous \nserious human rights abuses in Tibet, including instances of torture, \narbitrary arrest, detention without public trial, and lengthy detention \nof Tibetan nationalists for peacefully expressing political or \nreligious views. Tight controls on religion and on other fundamental \nfreedoms continued and intensified during the year.\n  And, as Human Rights Watch/Asia reports, China's activities are \ntargeting not just the present, but Tibet's future as well: Children in \nthe Tibetan capital, Lhasa, are being discouraged from expressing \nreligious faith and practicing devotional activities as part of the \nauthorities' campaign in middle schools and some primary schools. \nChildren aged between seven and thirteen in schools targeted by the \ncampaign are being told that Tibetan Buddhist practice is `backward \nbehavior' and an obstacle to progress. In some schools, children are \ngiven detention of forced to pay fines when they fail to observe a ban \non wearing traditional Buddhist ``protection cords.''\n\n  Corrupt officials. Oppressive police tactics and midnight arrests. \nSeizure and imprisonment without formal charges. Beatings and \nunexplained deaths while in custody. The steady grinding down of \nTibetan cultural and religious institutions. The list of abuses in \nTibet goes on and on. There is no need for me to repeat them here.\n  I say all this as one who wants to work with China's leadership to \nhelp find a solution to this, and other, problems, and see a positive \nrelationship between the U.S. and China, and between the people of \nChina and the people of Tibet.\n  I want to be a positive force for bringing Tibetan and Chinese \nleaders to the table for face-to-face dialogue.\n  It is not my intention with this legislation to merely point fingers \nand lay blame. My intent in introducing the Tibetan Policy Act of 2001 \nis not to stigmatize or chastise China.\n  My intent in introducing the Tibetan Policy Act of 2001 is to place \nthe full faith of the United States government behind efforts to \npreserve the distinct cultural, religious and ethnic autonomy of the \nTibetan people.\n  Specifically, the Tibetan Policy Act of 2001: Outlines Tibet's unique \nhistorical, cultural and religious heritage and describes the efforts \nby the United States, the Dalai Lama, and others to initiate dialogue \nwith China on the status of Tibet. Codifies the position of Special \nCoordinator for Tibetan Issues at the Department of State, assures that \nrelevant U.S. government reports will list Tibet as a separate section \nunder China and that the Congressional-Executive Commission on the \nPeople's Republic of China will hold Beijing to acceptable standards of \nbehavior in Tibet. Authorizes $2.75 million for humanitarian assistance \nfor Tibetan refugees, scholarships for Tibetan exiles, and human rights \nactivities by Tibetan non-governmental organizations. Establishes U.S. \npolicy goals for international economic assistance to and in Tibet to \nensure that ethnic Tibetans benefit from development policies in Tibet. \nCalls on the Secretary of State to make best efforts to establish an \noffice in Lhasa, the Capital of Tibet. Provides U.S. support for \nconsideration of Tibet at the United Nations. Ensures that Tibetan \nlanguage training is available for foreign service officers. Highlights \nconcerns about the lack of religious freedom in Tibet by calling on \nChina to cease activities which attack the fundamental characteristics \nof religious freedom in Tibet.\n  In addition, the Tibet Policy Act expresses the Sense of the Congress \nthat: The President and the Secretary of State should initiate steps to \nencourage China to enter into negotiations with the Dalai Lama or his \nrepresentatives on the question of Tibet and the cultural and religious \nautonomy of the Tibetan people. That the President and the Secretary of \nState should request the immediate and unconditional release of \npolitical or religious prisoners in Tibet; seek access for \ninternational humanitarian organizations to prisons in Tibet; and seek \nthe immediate medical parole of Ngawang Choephel and other Tibetan \nprisoners known to be in ill-health. The United States will seek ways \nto support economic development, cultural preservation, health care, \nand education and environmental sustainability for Tibetans inside \nTibet.\n  The Tibetan Policy Act does not aim to punish anyone. I do not \nbelieve that threats or force will sway Beijing from its present \ncourse.\n  But, I am convinced that we must send a clear message.\n  I am under no illusion that passing the Tibetan Policy Act of 2001 \nwill immediately change the situation in Tibet.\n  Nor am I under any illusion that changing current conditions in Tibet \nwill be an easy process. It will be a long and difficult process \nrequiring patience and perseverance.\n  But I am hopeful that better, more effective efforts on our part and \nbetter coordination with like-minded members of the international \ncommunity will encourage China to change its thinking and modify its \nbehavior towards Tibet.\n  To paraphrase an old Chinese proverb: you have to take a first step \nto start any journey. This legislation, I hope, is a first step in \nbringing together the Dalai Lama or his representative and the Chinese \ngovernment to discuss the future of Tibet and to take action to \nsafeguard the distinct cultural, religious, and social identity of the \nTibetan people.\n  I urge my colleagues here in the Senate, as well as my friends in \nChina, to join with me in taking it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 855. A bill to protect children and other vulnerable \nsubpopulations from exposure to environmental pollutants, to protect \nchildren from exposure to pesticides in schools, and to provide parents \nwith information concerning toxic chemicals that pose risks to \nchildren, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublc Works.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing a bill to protect \nchildren from the dangers posed by pollution and toxic chemicals in our \nenvironment. The Children's Environmental Protection Act, (CEPA), is \nbased on the fact that children are not small adults. Children eat more \nfood, drink more water, and breathe more air as a percentage of their \nbody weight than adults. Children also grow rapidly, and therefore are \nphysiologically more vulnerable to toxic substances than adults. This \nmakes them more susceptible to the dangers posed by those substances.\n  How is this understanding that children suffer higher risks from the \ndangers posed by toxic and harmful substances taken into account in our \nenvironmental and public health standards? Do we gather and consider \ndata that specifically evaluates how those substances affect children? \nIf that data is lacking, do we apply extra caution when we determine \nthe amount of toxics that can be released into the air and water, the \nlevel of harmful contaminants that may be present in our drinking \nwater, or the amount of pesticides that may be present in our food?\n  In most cases, the answer to all of these questions is ``no.'' In \nfact, most of these standards are designed to protect adults rather \nthan children. In\n\n[[Page S4609]]\n\nmost cases, we do not even have the data that would allow us to measure \nhow those substances specifically affect children. And, in the face of \nthat uncertainty, we generally assume that what we don't know about the \ndangers toxic and harmful substances pose to our children won't hurt \nthem. We generally don't apply extra caution to take account of that \nuncertainty.\n  CEPA would change the answers to those questions from ``no'' to \n``yes.'' It would childproof our environmental laws. CEPA is based on \nthe premise that what we don't know about the dangers toxic and harmful \nsubstances pose to our children may very well hurt them.\n  CEPA would require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set \nenvironmental and public health standards to protect children. It would \nrequire EPA to explicitly consider the dangers that toxic and harmful \nsubstances pose to children when setting those standards. Finally, if \nEPA discovers that it does not have specific data that would allow it \nto measure those dangers, EPA would be required to apply an additional \nsafety factor, an additional measure of caution, to account for that \nlack of information. The Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 \nincluded my amendment to require EPA to set drinking water standards at \nsafe levels for children. All of our environmental laws should reflect \nthe special needs of children. CEPA would ensure that children's health \nrisks are properly taken into account.\n  This process would, I acknowledge, take some time. So, while EPA is \nin the process of updating the standards, CEPA would provide parents \nand teachers with a number of tools to immediately protect their \nchildren from toxic and harmful substances.\n\n  First, CEPA would require EPA to provide all schools and day care \ncenters that receive federal funding a copy of EPA's guide to help \nschools adopt a least toxic pest management policy. CEPA would also \nprohibit the use of dangerous pesticides--those containing known or \nprobably carcinogens, reproductive toxins, acute nerve toxins and \nendocrine disrupters--in those areas. Under CEPA, parents would also \nreceive advance notification before pesticides are applied on school or \nday care center grounds.\n  Second, CEPA would expand the federal Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) \nto require the reporting of toxic chemical releases that may pose \nspecial risks to children. In particular, CEPA provides that releases \nof small amounts of lead, mercury, dioxin, cadmium and chromium be \nreported under TRI. These chemicals are either highly toxic, persist in \nthe environment or can accumulate in the human body over many years--\nall features that render them particularly dangerous to children. Lead, \nfor example, will seriously affect a child's development, but is still \nreleased into the environment through lead smelting and waste \nincineration. CEPA would then require EPA to identify other toxic \nchemicals that may present special risks to children, and to provide \nthat releases of those chemicals be reported under TRI.\n  Third, CEPA would direct EPA to create a list of recommended safer-\nfor-children products that minimize potential risks to children.\n  Finally, CEPA would require EPA to create a family right-to-know \ninformation kit that would include practical suggestions to help \nparents reduce their children's exposure to toxic and harmful \nsubstances in the environment.\n  My CEPA bill is based on the premise that what we don't know about \nthe dangers that toxic and harmful substances pose to our children may \nvery well hurt them. It would require EPA to apply caution in the face \nof that uncertainty. And, ultimately, it would childproof our \nenvironmental laws to ensure that those laws protect the most \nvulnerable among us--our children.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Bond, Mr. Cleland, Ms. Landrieu, \n        Mr. Bennett, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Harkin, Mr. \n        Bingaman, Mr. Enzi, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 856. A bill to reauthorize the Small Business Technology Transfer \nProgram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation to \nreauthorize the Small Business Administration's Small Business \nTechnology Transfer, STTR, Program.\n  The STTR program funds cooperative R projects between small \ncompanies and research institutions as an incentive to advance the \nnation's technological progress. For those of us who were here when \nCongress created this program in 1992, we will remember that we were \nlooking for ways to move research from the laboratories to market. What \ncould we do to keep promising research from stagnating in Federal labs \nand research universities? Our research in this country is world \nrenowned, so it wasn't a question of good science and engineering. We, \nwithout a doubt, have one of the finest university systems in the \nworld, and we have outstanding research institutions. What we needed \nwas more development, development of innovative technology. We needed a \nsystem that would take this research and find ways it could be applied \nto everyday life and national priorities. One such company is Sterling \nSemiconductor. Sterling, in conjunction with the University of \nColorado, has developed silicon carbide wafers for use in \nsemiconductors that can withstand extreme temperatures and conditions. \nIn addition to defense applications, these wafers can be used for \neverything from traffic lights to automobile dashboards and \ncommunications equipment.\n  With technology transfer, it was not just the issue of the tenured \nprofessor who risked security if he or she left to try and \ncommercialize their research; it was also an issue of creating \nbusinesses and jobs that maximized the contributions of our scientists \nand engineers once they graduated. There simply weren't enough \nopportunities at universities and labs for these bright individuals to \ndo research and development. The answer was to encourage the creation \nof small businesses dedicated to research, its development, and \nultimately moving that research out of the lab and finding a commercial \napplication.\n  We knew that the SBA's existing Small Business Innovation Research, \nSBIR, program had proven to be extremely successful over the previous \nten years, so we established what is now known as the Small Business \nTechnology Transfer program. The STTR program complements the SBIR \nprogram. Whereas the SBIR program funds R projects at small \ncompanies, STTR funds cooperative R projects between a small company \nand a research institution, such as a university or Federally funded \nR lab. The STTR program fosters development and commercialization of \nideas that either originate at a research institution or require \nsignificant research institution involvement, such as expertise or \nfacilities, for their successful development.\n  This has been a very successful program. One company, Cambridge \nResearch Instruments of Woburn, Massachusetts, has been working on an \nSTTR project with the Marine Biological Lab in Woods Hole. They have \ndeveloped a liquid crystal-based polarized light microscope for \nstructural imaging. While that is a mouthful, I'm told that it helps in \nmanufacturing flat screen computer monitors, and even helps improve the \nin vitro fertilization procedure. Together this company and the lab \nexpect to have sales in excess of $1 million dollars next year from \nthis STTR project.\n  As this example illustrates, the STTR program serves an important \npurpose for this country's research and development, our small \nbusinesses, our economy, and our nation. The program is set to expire \nat midnight on Sunday, September 30th. By the way, we absolutely have \nno intention of letting reauthorization get down to the wire, which was \nthe unfortunate fate of the reauthorization of the SBIR program last \nyear. I have worked in partnership with Senator Bond to develop this \nlegislation, and as part of the process we have consulted with and \nlistened to our friends in the House, both on the Small Business \nCommittee and the Science Committee. We do not see this legislation as \ncontentious, and we have every intention of seeing this bill signed \ninto law well before September.\n  Shaping this legislation has gone beyond policy makers; we have \nreached out to small companies that conduct\n\n[[Page S4610]]\n\nthe STTR projects and research universities and Federal labs. On my \npart, I sponsored two meetings in Massachusetts on March 16th to \ndiscuss the STTR program. At my office in Boston, there was a very \nhelpful discussion with six of Massachusetts' research universities \nexpressing what they like and dislike about the program, and why they \nuse it, or don't use it more. The meeting included the licensing \nmanagers from Boston University, Harvard, MIT, Northeastern University, \nand the University of Massachusetts. They said they need to hear more \nabout the STTR program and have more outreach to their scientists and \nengineers so that they understand when and how to apply for the \nprogram. Based on their suggestions, we've included an outreach mandate \nin our bill. In addition, we're trying to provide SBA with more \nresources in its Office of Technology to be responsive to the concerns \nof STTR institutions and small businesses.\n  Later that day, my office was part of a meeting in Newton at \nInnovative Training Systems in which about 20 leaders and \nrepresentatives of small high-tech companies talked about the SBIR and \nSTTR programs. They make a tremendous contribution to the economy and \nstate of Massachusetts. They said that the Phase II award for STTR \nshould be raised form $500,000 to $750,000 to be consistent with the \nSBIR program. Otherwise, since a minimum of 30 percent of the award \ngoes to the university partner, it was too little money to really \ndevelop the research.\n  As I said, we listened to them. And we also listened to what the \nprogram managers of the participating agencies had to say. Agencies \nparticipate in this program if their extramural R budget is greater \nthan $1 billion. Consequently, there are five eligible agencies: the \nDepartment of Defense, the Department of Energy, the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, and the National Science Foundation. For the STTR \nprojects, they set aside .15 percent of their extramural R budget. \nThe comes to about $65 million per year invested in these \ncollaborations between small business and research institutions.\n  Combining all the suggestions for improvement, the STTR Program \nReauthorization Act of 2001 does the following:\n  1. It reauthorizes the program for nine years, setting the expiration \ndate for September 30th, 2010.\n  2. Starting in two years, FY2003, it raises in small increments the \npercentage that Departments and Agencies set aside for STTR R In \nFY2004, the percentage increases from .15 percent to .3 percent. After \nthree years, in FY2007, the bill raises the percentage from .3 percent \nto .5 percent;\n  3. Starting in two years, FY2003, the legislation raises the Phase II \ngrant award amount from $500,000 to $750,000;\n  4. It requires the participating agencies to implement an outreach \nprogram to research institutions in conjunction with any such outreach \ndone with the SBIR program;\n  5. As last year's legislation did for the SBIR program, this bill \nstrengthens the data collection requirements regarding awards and the \ndata rights for companies and research institutions that conduct STTR \nprojects. The goal is to collect better information about the companies \ndoing the projects, as well as the research and development, so that we \ncan measure success and track technologies.\n  While I believe that these changes reflect common sense and are \nreasonable, I would like to discuss two of the proposed changes.\n  First, I would like to talk about reauthorizing the program for nine \nyears. The STTR program was a pilot program when it was first enacted \nin 1992. Upon review in 1997, the results of the program were generally \ngood and the program was reauthorized that year. A more recent review \nand study of the program shows that the program has become more \nsuccessful as it has had more time to develop. Specifically, the \ncommercialization rate of the research is higher than for most research \nand development expenditures. Further, universities and research is \nhigher than for most research and development expenditures. Further, \nuniversities and research institutions have developed excellent working \nrelationships with small businesses, and the program has also had good \ngeographic diversity, involving small companies and research \ninstitutions throughout the country. The nine-year reauthorization will \nallow the agencies, small businesses and universities to gradually ramp \nup to the higher percentage in a predictable and orderly manner.\n  Second, I would like to talk about the gradual, incremental increases \nin the percentages reserved for STTR contracts and the increase in the \nPhase II awards. When we reached out to the small businesses and the \nresearch institutions that conduct STTR projects, and the program \nmanagers of the five agencies that participate in the STTR program, we \nheard two recurring themes: one, raise the amount of the Phase II \nawards; and two, increase the amount of the percentage reserved for \nSTTR projects.\n  Speaking to the first issue, we heard that the Phase II awards of \n$500,000 generally are not sufficient for the research and development \nprojects and should be increased to $750,000, the same as the SBIR \nPhase II awards, to make the awards worth applying for the small \nbusinesses and research institutions.\n  As for the second issue, we were told that the percentage of .15 \nreserved for STTR awards needed to be increased in order to better meet \nthe needs of the agencies. Last year, that .15 percent of the five \nagencies' extramural research and development budgets amounted to a \ntotal $65 million dollars available for small businesses and research \ninstitutions to further develop research and transfer technology from \nthe lab to market through the STTR program. Less than a quarter of one \npercent to help strengthen this country's technological progress is not \nextravagant; in fact, it is not adequate support for this important \nsegment of the economy.\n  Nevertheless, we are very conscientious about the needs of the \ndepartments and agencies to meet their missions for the nation and have \nproposed gradual increases that take into full consideration the \nrealities of implementing the changes for the agencies and departments \nthat participate in the program. Consequently, the legislation does not \nincrease the percentage for STTR awards until two full years after the \nprogram has been reauthorized.\n  We are also conscientious about the fact that we want more research, \nnot less, so we have timed the increase of the Phase II awards to \ncoincide with the initial percentage increase reserved for STTR \nprojects.\n  Overall, we believe this gradual increase will help encourage more \ninnovation and greater cooperation between research institutions and \nsmall businesses. As the program requires, at least 30 percent of these \nadditional funds will go to university and research institutions. Not \nonly do the universities and research institutions that collaborate \nwith small businesses get 30 percent of the STTR award money for each \ncontract, they also benefit in that they often receive license fees and \nroyalties. We are also conscientious about being fiscally responsible, \nthe percentage increases will have no budget implication since it does \nnot increase the amount of the money spent. Rather, it ultimately, \nafter six years, redirects one half of one percent to this very \nsuccessful program which benefits the economy overall.\n  This bill will ensure that this successful program is continued and \nincreased. It will also provide Congress with important information and \ndata on the program and encourage more outreach to small businesses and \nresearch institutions.\n  I want to encourage my colleagues to learn about this program, to \nfind out the benefits to their state's hi-tech small businesses and \nresearch universities and labs, and to join me in passing this \nlegislation in the Senate as soon as possible. To my friend from \nMissouri, Senator Bond, I want to thank you and your staff for working \nwith me and my staff to build this country's technological progress.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senator John \nKerry, my colleague and ranking member on the Small Business Committee, \nin sponsoring legislation to reauthorize the Small Business Technology \nTransfer, STTR, Program. This program has proven itself to be highly \neffective. The bill we are introducing today acknowledges the success \nof the STTR Program by expanding it during the length of the \nreauthorization so that its benefits will increase in the coming years.\n  The STTR Program was created in 1992 to stimulate technology transfer \nfrom research institutions to small firms while, at the same time, \naccomplishing the Federal government's research and development goals. \nThe program is designed to convert the billions of dollars invested in \nresearch and development at our nation's universities, federal \nlaboratories and nonprofit research institutions into new commercial \ntechnologies. It does this by joining the ideas and resources of \nresearch institutions with the commercialization experience of small \ncompanies.\n  Each agency with an extramural research and development budget of \nmore than $1 billion participates in the program. Currently, the \nDepartment of Defense, the National Institutes of Health, the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration, NASA, the National Science \nFoundation, NSF, and the Department of Energy, DOE, have STTR Programs.\n  To receive an award under the STTR Program, a research institution \nand a small firm jointly submit a proposal to conduct research on a \ntopic that reflects an agency's mission and research and development \nneeds. The proposals are then peer-reviewed and judged on their \nscientific, technical and commercial merit. Similar to the Small \nBusiness Innovation Research Program, awards are provided in three \nphases. Phase one awards are designed to determine the scientific and \ntechnical merit and feasibility of a proposed research idea, with \nfunding for individual awards limited to $100,000. Phase two awards \nfurther develop research from phase one and emphasize the idea's \ncommercialization potential, with individual awards up to $500,000. \nPhase three awards consist of non-Federal funds for the commercial \napplication of the technology, non-STTR Federal funds for the \ncommercialization of products or services intended for procurement by \nthe Federal government, or non-STTR Federal funds for continued \nresearch and development of the technology.\n  The benefits of fostering collaboration between research institutions \nand small firms are numerous. Small firms have shown themselves to be \nexcellent at commercializing research when they are provided the \nopportunity to take advantage of the expertise and resources that \nreside in our nation's universities. A recent Small Business \nAdministration Office of Advocacy report reviewed the rate of return \nfor research and development by large and small firms both with and \nwithout university partners. When these firms do not have university \npartners, their rate of return is 14 percent. When a collaboration is \nformed between universities and small firms, however, the rate of \nreturn jumps to 44 percent. By contrast, the rate of return only \nincreases to 30 percent when large firms and universities collaborate.\n  Moreover, partnerships between small firms and universities have led \nto world-class high-technology economic development. Numerous studies \ncite the emergence of Silicon Valley and the Route 128 corridor in \nMassachusetts as directly resulting from the partnerships and \ntechnology transfer that occurred, and are still occurring, among small \nfirms, Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of \nTechnology. The cooperation between industry and these universities has \nstrengthened considerably our economic competitiveness in the world. \nThe STTR Program seeks to foster this same type of economic development \nin the hundreds of communities around the country that contain \nuniversities\n\n[[Page S4612]]\n\nand federal laboratories. And, the STTR Program has proven to be \nimmensely successful at growing small firms from these types of \npartnerships.\n  The Committee on Small Business has recently received data on the \ncommercial success of small firms that received STTR awards between \n1995 and 1997. The results are truly outstanding. Of the 102 projects \nsurveyed in that time-frame, 53 percent had either resulted in sales or \nthe companies involved in the projects had received follow-on \ndevelopmental funding for the technology. To date, these projects had \nresulted in $132 million from sales and $53 million in additional \ndevelopmental funding. Moreover, the Committee has learned that the \ncompanies who had received these STTR awards are projecting an \nadditional $186 million in sales in 2001 and an estimated additional \n$900 million in sales by 2005. These numbers are even more remarkable \nwhen one considers that it typically takes between 7 to 10 years to \nsuccessfully commercialize new technologies.\n  In addition to proving to be an amazing commercial success, the STTR \nProgram has also provided high-quality research to the Federal \nGovernment. In the most recent published report of the General \nAccounting Office on the STTR Program, Federal agencies rated highly \nthe technical quality of the proposals. The DOE, as an example, rated \nthe quality of the proposed research in the top ten percent of all \nresearch funded by the Department.\n  A good example of the benefits that the STTR Program provides to \nsmall firms and universities is the experience of Engineering Software \nResearch and Development, Inc. in St. Louis, MO. Engineering Software, \nin partnership with Washington University in St. Louis, received a \nphase two award from the Air Force to develop an innovative method of \nanalyzing the stresses placed on composite materials. While this \ntechnology is currently being used in the aeronautics industry, it has \nmany other practical applications.\n  The STTR Program permitted Dr. Barna Szabo, who had originated an \nalgorithm he developed at Washington University, to transfer the \ntechnology to Engineering Software, which had the software \ninfrastructure to transition the technology from an academic to a \npractical commercial application. According to Dr. Szabo, Engineering \nSoftware has received to date at an estimated $1.25 million in sales \nand follow-on developmental funding resulting from the technology \nfunded by the STTR award and that the STTR Program was of great \nassistance in transferring the technology from the academic environment \nto actual use and application.\n  Based on the proven success of the STTR Program to date, this \nlegislation increases the funds allocated for the program. This \nincrease is phased-in through the length of the reauthorization. When a \nprogram is working as well as the STTR Program, it would be a mistake \nif Congress did not build on its success.\n  This is especially true for Federal investment in small business \nresearch and development. Despite report after report demonstrating \nthat small businesses innovate at a greater rate than large firms, \nsmall businesses only receive less than four percent of all Federal \nresearch and development dollars. This number has remained essentially \nunchanged for the past 22 years. Increasing funds for the STTR Program \nsends a strong message that the Federal Government acknowledges the \ncontributions that small businesses have made and will continue to make \nto government research and development efforts and to our nation's \neconomy.\n  I am pleased that my colleague Senator Kerry and I have worked \ntogether on this bi-partisan legislation. It is a good bill for the \nsmall business high-technology community and will ensure that our \nFederal research and development needs are well met in the next decade. \nWhen this bill is debated by the full Senate, I trust that it will \nreceive the support of all of our colleagues.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, research and development has been a \nfundamental driver of the growth of our economy. It is critical that we \ncontinue significant investment in R and improve commercialization of \nthe research undertaken at our non-profit institutions.\n  I thank the Small Business Committee ranking member John Kerry and \nChairman Christopher Bond for taking a leadership role in reauthorizing \nthe Small Business Technology Transfer program. The program is a \ncompanion to the very successful Small Business Innovation Research \n(SBIR) program which funds R projects undertaken by small businesses. \nUnder the STTR program, the U.S. Departments of Defense, Energy, and \nHealth and Human Services, the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration, and the National Science Foundation must set-aside .15 \npercent of their research dollars for award to small high technology \nfirms that partner with non-profit research institutions.\n  The STTR program is scheduled to expire on September 30, 2001. The \nKerry-Bond bill, entitled the Small Business Technology Transfer \nProgram Reauthorization Act of 2001, extends the program until 2010. In \naddition to extending the STTR program it gradually increases the \npercentage of Federal R funding going to the program from .15 percent \nto .5 percent over 9 years. There is also a provision to encourage \nagencies to increase outreach to small business and universities to \npromote the STTR Program.\n  Many of our most successful businesses in the changing economy were \nonly recently small businesses. Going back only 25 years, one of my \nState's largest employers, Microsoft, was a small business. Even today, \nmany of the innovators driving the rapid industrial evolution work in \nsmall businesses. But the risk and expense of conducting serious R \nefforts can be beyond the means of many of these businesses.\n  On the other side of the equation, the commercial value of non-profit \nresearch often remains unrealized because there are not adequate \nopportunities to bring researchers together with those who could best \nmake the research into a marketable product.\n  This program fills a very important need by bringing together the \ncapabilities of our non-profit research institutions with the \nentrepreneurial spirit of our small businesses. The program holds great \npromise as one way to meet the scientific and technological challenges \nof our changing economy. And this program has already been successful \nthroughout the United States. In my state alone over the past 5 years, \n52 grants have been awarded for work in biotechnology, medicine, fluid \nmechanics, chemistry, electronics and computer technologies. I am very \npleased to be able to lend my support to this program and look forward \nto this bill moving rapidly into law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/09/senate-section/article/S4612-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4612-S4613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 85--DESIGNATING THE WEEK OF MAY 6 THROUGH 12, 2001, \nAS ``TEACHER APPRECIATION WEEK'', AND DESIGNATING TUESDAY, MAY 8, 2001 \n                      AS ``NATIONAL TEACHER DAY''\n\n  Mr. WARNER (for himself, Mr. Allen, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \nJeffords, Mr. Craig, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Enzi, Mr. DeWine, Ms. \nMikulski, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Smith of Oregon, and Mr. Stevens) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

For this reason, I introduce \na resolution designating the week of May 6 through 12, 2001, as \n``Teacher Appreciation Week'' and designating Tuesday, May 8, 2001 as \n``National Teacher Day.''\n  All of us know that individuals do not pursue a career in the \nteaching profession for the money. People go into the teaching \nprofession for grander reasons--to educate our youth, to make a lasting \ninfluence.\n  While many people spend their lives building careers, our teachers \nspend their careers building lives. Simply put, to teach is to touch a \nlife forever.\n  How true that is. I venture to say that every one of us can remember \nat least one teacher and the special influence he or she had on our \nlives.\n  By educating today's youth, our teacher's are preparing tomorrow's \nleaders.\n  This week in the Senate, we are considering legislation to \nreauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. How appropriate \nit is that during this debate Teacher Appreciation Week and National \nTeacher Day are upon us.\n  The education legislation before us this week is based on the \nprinciple that our education system must ensure that no child is left \nbehind.\n  As we move towards education reforms to achieve this goal, we must \nkeep in mind the other component in our education system--the teachers. \nIf we forget our teachers in this debate, our children will be left \nbehind.\n  Quality, caring teachers, along with quality, caring parents, play \nthe predominant roles in ensuring that no child is left behind.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing our Nation's teachers \nby passing this resolution designating the week of May 6 through 12, \n2001, as ``Teacher Appreciation Week, and Tuesday, May 8, 2001, as \n``National Teacher Day.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/09/senate-section/article/S4613-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 86--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE RECOGNIZING \n   THE IMPORTANT ROLE PLAYED BY THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION ON \n          BEHALF OF THE UNITED STATES SMALL BUSINESS COMMUNITY\n\n  Mr. BOND (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Burns, Mr. Levin, Mr. Bennett, \nMr. Harkin, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. \nCrapo, Mr. Cleland, Mr. Ensign, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Edwards, Ms. \nCantwell, and Mr. Daschle) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas considered and agreed to:\n\n                               S.

Further, rural areas often cannot \n     support specialized schools, such as magnet or charter \n     schools.\n       ``(2) Technology can offer rural students educational and \n     employment opportunities that they otherwise would not have.\n       ``(3) Schools in rural and small towns receive \n     disproportionately less funding than their urban \n     counterparts, necessitating that such schools receive \n     additional assistance to implement technology curriculum.\n       ``(4) In the future, workers without technology skills run \n     the risk of being excluded from the new global, technological \n     economy.\n       ``(5) Teaching technology in rural schools is vitally \n     important because it creates an employee pool for employers \n     sorely in need of information technology specialists.\n       ``(6) A qualified workforce can attract information \n     technology employers to rural areas and help bridge the \n     digital divide between rural and urban American that is \n     evidenced by the out-migration and economic decline typical \n     of many rural areas.\n       ``(b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this part to give \n     rural schools comprehensive assistance to train the \n     technology literate workforce needed to bridge the rural-\n     urban digital divide.\n\n     ``SEC. 2503.

Such salary is also just $1,924 more than the \n     average salary recorded in 1972, a real increase of only $75 \n     per year.\n       (4) While K-12 enrollments are steadily increasing, the \n     teacher population is aging. There is a need, now more than \n     ever, to attract competent, capable, and bright college \n     graduates or mid-career professionals to the teaching \n     profession.\n       (5) The Department of Education projects that 2,000,000 new \n     teachers will have to be hired in the next decade.

ADEQUACY OF FUNDING OF TARGETED GRANTS TO LOCAL \n                   EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES IN FISCAL YEARS AFTER \n                   FISCAL YEAR 2001.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The current Basic Grant Formula for the distribution of \n     funds under part A of title I of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311 et seq.), often does \n     not provide funds for the economically disadvantaged students \n     for which such funds are targeted.\n       (2) Any school district in which at least two percent of \n     the students live below the poverty level qualifies for \n     funding under the Basic Grant Formula. As a result, 9 out of \n     every 10 school districts in the country receive some form of \n     aid under the Formula.\n       (3) Fifty-eight percent of all schools receive at least \n     some funding under title I of the Elementary and Secondary \n     Education Act of 1965, including many suburban schools with \n     predominantly well-off students.\n       (4) One out of every 5 schools with concentrations of poor \n     students between 50 and 75 percent receive no funding at all \n     under title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     of 1965.\n       (5) In passing the Improving America's Schools Act in 1994, \n     Congress declared that grants under title I of the Elementary \n     and Secondary Education Act of 1965 would more sharply target \n     high poverty schools by using the Targeted Grant Formula, but \n     annual appropriation Acts have prevented the use of that \n     Formula.\n       (6) The advantage of the Targeted Grant Formula over other \n     funding formulas under title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 is that the Targeted Grant \n     Formula provides increased grants per poor child as the \n     percentage of economically disadvantaged children in a school \n     district increases.\n       (7) Studies have found that the poverty of a child's family \n     is much more likely to be associated with educational \n     disadvantage if the family lives in an area with large \n     concentrations of poor families.\n       (8) States with large populations of high poverty students \n     would receive significantly more funding if more funds under \n     title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n     were allocated through the Targeted Grant Formula.\n       (9) Congress has an obligation to allocate funds under \n     title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n     so that such funds will positively affect the largest number \n     of economically disadvantaged students.\n       (b) Limitation on Allocation of Title I Funds Contingent on \n     Adequate Funding of Targeted Grants.--Notwithstanding any \n     other provision of law, the total amount allocated in any \n     fiscal year after fiscal year 2001 for programs and \n     activities under part A of title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311 et seq.) may \n     not exceed the amount allocated in fiscal year 2001 for such \n     programs and activities unless the amount available for \n     targeted grants to local educational agencies under section \n     1125 of that Act (20 U.S.C. 6335) in the applicable fiscal \n     year is sufficient to meet the purposes of grants under that \n     section.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 476.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING TRANSMITTAL OF S. 27 TO \n                   HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n\n       (A) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) on April 2, 2001, the Senate of the United States \n     passed S. 27, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2001, by \n     a vote of 59 to 41;\n       (2) it has been over 30 days since the Senate moved to \n     third reading and final passage of S. 27;\n       (3) it was then in order for the bill to be engrossed and \n     officially delivered to the House of Representatives of the \n     United States;\n       (4) the precedents and traditions of the Senate dictate \n     that bills passed by the Senate are routinely sent in a \n     timely manner to the House of Representatives;\n       (5) the will of the majority of the Senate, having voted in \n     favor of campaign finance reform is being unduly thwarted;\n       (6) the American people are taught that when a bill passed \n     one body of Congress, it is routinely sent to the other body \n     for consideration; and\n       (7) the delay in sending S. 27 to the House of \n     Representatives appears to be an arbitrary action taken to \n     deliberately thwart the will of the majority of the Senate.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the Secretary of the Senate should properly engross and \n     deliver S. 27 to the House of Representatives without any \n     intervening delay.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 478.

PROCEDURES FOR INITIAL CLAIMS FOR BENEFITS AND \n                   PRIOR AUTHORIZATION DETERMINATIONS.\n\n       (a) Procedures of Initial Claims for Benefits.--\n       (1) In general.--A group health plan, or health insurance \n     issuer offering health insurance coverage, shall--\n       (A) make a determination on an initial claim for benefits \n     by a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) regarding payment or coverage for items or \n     services under the terms and conditions of the plan or \n     coverage involved, including any cost-sharing amount that the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee is required to pay with \n     respect to such claim for benefits; and\n       (B) notify a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or \n     authorized representative) and the treating health care \n     professional involved regarding a determination on an initial \n     claim for benefits made under the terms and conditions of the \n     plan or coverage, including any cost-sharing amounts that the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee may be required to make \n     with respect to such claim for benefits, and of the right of \n     the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee to an internal \n     appeal under section 103.\n       (2) Access to information.--\n       (A) Timely provision of necessary information.--With \n     respect to an initial claim for benefits, the participant, \n     beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized representative) and \n     the treating health care professional (if any) shall provide \n     the plan or issuer with access to information requested by \n     the plan or issuer that is necessary to make a \n     determination relating to the claim. Such access shall be \n     provided not later than 5 days after the date on which the \n     request for information is received, or, in a case \n     described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of subsection (b)(1), \n     by such earlier time as may be necessary to comply with \n     the applicable timeline under such subparagraph.\n       (B) Limited effect of failure on plan or issuer's \n     obligations.--Failure of the participant, beneficiary, or \n     enrollee to comply with the requirements of subparagraph (A) \n     shall not remove the obligation of the plan or issuer to make \n     a decision in accordance with the medical exigencies of the \n     case and as soon as possible, based on the available \n     information, and failure to comply with the time limit \n     established by this paragraph shall not remove the obligation \n     of the plan or issuer to comply with the requirements of this \n     section.\n       (3) Oral requests.--In the case of a claim for benefits \n     involving an expedited or concurrent determination, a \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) may make an initial claim for benefits \n     orally, but a group health plan, or health insurance issuer \n     offering health insurance coverage, may require that the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) provide written confirmation of such request \n     in a timely manner on a form provided by the plan or issuer. \n     In the case of such an oral request for benefits, the making \n     of the request (and the timing of such request) shall be \n     treated as the making at that time of a claims for such \n     benefits without regard to whether and when a written \n     confirmation of such request is made.\n       (b) Timeline for Making Determinations.--\n       (1) Prior authorization determination.--\n       (A) In general.--A group health plan, or health insurance \n     issuer offering health insurance coverage, shall make a prior \n     authorization determination on a claim for benefits (whether \n     oral or written) in accordance with the medical exigencies of \n     the case and as soon as possible, but in no case later than \n     14 days from the date on which the plan or issuer receives \n     information that is reasonably necessary to enable the plan \n     or issuer to make a determination on the request for prior \n     authorization and in no case later than 28 days after the \n     date of the claim for benefits is received.\n       (B) Expedited determination.--Notwithstanding subparagraph \n     (A), a group health plan, or health insurance issuer offering \n     health insurance coverage, shall expedite a prior \n     authorization determination on a claim for benefits described \n     in such subparagraph when a request for such an expedited \n     determination is made by a participant, beneficiary, or \n     enrollee (or authorized representative) at any time during \n     the process for making a determination and a health care \n     professional certifies, with the request, that a \n     determination under the procedures described in subparagraph \n     (A) would seriously jeopardize the life or health of the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee or the ability of the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee to maintain or regain \n     maximum function.

and\n       (3) notification of the right to appeal the determination \n     and instructions on how to initiate an appeal in accordance \n     with section 103.\n       (e) Definitions.--For purposes of this part:\n       (1) Authorized representative.--The term ``authorized \n     representative'' means, with respect to an individual who is \n     a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee, any health care \n     professional or other person acting on behalf of the \n     individual with the individual's consent or without such \n     consent if the individual is medically unable to provide such \n     consent.\n       (2) Claim for benefits.--The term ``claim for benefits'' \n     means any request for coverage (including authorization of \n     coverage), for eligibility, or for payment in whole or in \n     part, for an item or service under a group health plan or \n     health insurance coverage.\n       (3) Denial of claim for benefits.--The term ``denial'' \n     means, with respect to a claim for benefits, a denial (in \n     whole or in part) of, or a failure to act on a timely basis \n     upon, the claim for benefits and includes a failure to \n     provide benefits (including items and services) required to \n     be provided under this title.\n       (4) Treating health care professional.--The term ``treating \n     health care professional''\n\n[[Page S4649]]\n\n     means, with respect to services to be provided to a \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee, a health care \n     professional who is primarily responsible for delivering \n     those services to the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee.\n\n     SEC. 103. INTERNAL APPEALS OF CLAIMS DENIALS.\n\n       (a) Right to Internal Appeal.--\n       (1) In general.--A participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     (or authorized representative) may appeal any denial of a \n     claim for benefits under section 102 under the procedures \n     described in this section.\n       (2) Time for appeal.--\n       (A) In general.--A group health plan, or health insurance \n     issuer offering health insurance coverage, shall ensure that \n     a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) has a period of not less than 180 days \n     beginning on the date of a denial of a claim for benefits \n     under section 102 in which to appeal such denial under this \n     section.\n       (B) Date of denial.--For purposes of subparagraph (A), the \n     date of the denial shall be deemed to be the date as of which \n     the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee knew of the denial \n     of the claim for benefits.\n       (3) Failure to act.--The failure of a plan or issuer to \n     issue a determination on a claim for benefits under section \n     102 within the applicable timeline established for such a \n     determination under such section is a denial of a claim for \n     benefits for purposes this subtitle as of the date of the \n     applicable deadline.\n       (4) Plan waiver of internal review.--A group health plan, \n     or health insurance issuer offering health insurance \n     coverage, may waive the internal review process under this \n     section. In such case the plan or issuer shall provide notice \n     to the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) involved, the participant, beneficiary, or \n     enrollee (or authorized representative) involved shall be \n     relieved of any obligation to complete the internal review \n     involved, and may, at the option of such participant, \n     beneficiary, enrollee, or representative proceed directly to \n     seek further appeal through external review under section 104 \n     or otherwise.\n       (b) Timelines for Making Determinations.--\n       (1) Oral requests.--In the case of an appeal of a denial of \n     a claim for benefits under this section that involves an \n     expedited or concurrent determination, a participant, \n     beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized representative) may \n     request such appeal orally. A group health plan, or health \n     insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, may \n     require that the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or \n     authorized representative) provide written confirmation of \n     such request in a timely manner on a form provided by the \n     plan or issuer. In the case of such an oral request for an \n     appeal of a denial, the making of the request (and the \n     timing of such request) shall be treated as the making at \n     that time of a request for an appeal without regard to \n     whether and when a written confirmation of such request is \n     made.\n       (2) Access to information.--\n       (A) Timely provision of necessary information.--With \n     respect to an appeal of a denial of a claim for benefits, the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) and the treating health care professional (if \n     any) shall provide the plan or issuer with access to \n     information requested by the plan or issuer that is necessary \n     to make a determination relating to the appeal. Such access \n     shall be provided not later than 5 days after the date on \n     which the request for information is received, or, in a case \n     described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of paragraph (3), by \n     such earlier time as may be necessary to comply with the \n     applicable timeline under such subparagraph.\n       (B) Limited effect of failure on plan or issuer's \n     obligations.--Failure of the participant, beneficiary, or \n     enrollee to comply with the requirements of subparagraph (A) \n     shall not remove the obligation of the plan or issuer to make \n     a decision in accordance with the medical exigencies of the \n     case and as soon as possible, based on the available \n     information, and failure to comply with the time limit \n     established by this paragraph shall not remove the obligation \n     of the plan or issuer to comply with the requirements of this \n     section.\n       (3) Prior authorization determinations.--\n       (A) In general.--A group health plan, or health insurance \n     issuer offering health insurance coverage, shall make a \n     determination on an appeal of a denial of a claim for \n     benefits under this subsection in accordance with the medical \n     exigencies of the case and as soon as possible, but in no \n     case later than 14 days from the date on which the plan or \n     issuer receives information that is reasonably necessary to \n     enable the plan or issuer to make a determination on the \n     appeal and in no case later than 28 days after the date the \n     request for the appeal is received.\n       (B) Expedited determination.--Notwithstanding subparagraph \n     (A), a group health plan, or health insurance issuer offering \n     health insurance coverage, shall expedite a prior \n     authorization determination on an appeal of a denial of a \n     claim for benefits described in subparagraph (A), when a \n     request for such an expedited determination is made by a \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) at any time during the process for making a \n     determination and a health care professional certifies, with \n     the request, that a determination under the procedures \n     described in subparagraph (A) would seriously jeopardize the \n     life or health of the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     or the ability of the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     to maintain or regain maximum function. Such determination \n     shall be made in accordance with the medical exigencies of \n     the case and as soon as possible, but in no case later than \n     72 hours after the time the request for such appeal is \n     received by the plan or issuer under this subparagraph.\n       (C) Ongoing care determinations.--\n       (i) In general.--Subject to clause (ii), in the case of a \n     concurrent review determination described in section \n     102(b)(1)(C)(i)(I), which results in a termination or \n     reduction of such care, the plan or issuer must provide \n     notice of the determination on the appeal under this section \n     by telephone and in printed form to the individual or the \n     individual's designee and the individual's health care \n     provider in accordance with the medical exigencies of the \n     case and as soon as possible, with sufficient time prior to \n     the termination or reduction to allow for an external appeal \n     under section 104 to be completed before the termination or \n     reduction takes effect.\n       (ii) Rule of construction.--Clause (i) shall not be \n     construed as requiring plans or issuers to provide coverage \n     of care that would exceed the coverage limitations for such \n     care.\n       (4) Retrospective determination.--A group health plan, or \n     health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, \n     shall make a retrospective determination on an appeal of a \n     claim for benefits in no case later than 30 days after the \n     date on which the plan or issuer receives necessary \n     information that is reasonably necessary to enable the \n     plan or issuer to make a determination on the appeal and \n     in no case later than 60 days after the date the request \n     for the appeal is received.\n       (c) Conduct of Review.--\n       (1) In general.--A review of a denial of a claim for \n     benefits under this section shall be conducted by an \n     individual with appropriate expertise who was not involved in \n     the initial determination.\n       (2) Review of medical decisions by physicians.--A review of \n     an appeal of a denial of a claim for benefits that is based \n     on a lack of medical necessity and appropriateness, or based \n     on an experimental or investigational treatment, or requires \n     an evaluation of medical facts, shall be made by a physician \n     (allopathic or osteopathic) with appropriate expertise \n     (including, in the case of a child, appropriate pediatric \n     expertise) who was not involved in the initial determination.\n       (d) Notice of Determination.--\n       (1) In general.--Written notice of a determination made \n     under an internal appeal of a denial of a claim for benefits \n     shall be issued to the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     (or authorized representative) and the treating health care \n     professional in accordance with the medical exigencies of the \n     case and as soon as possible, but in no case later than 2 \n     days after the date of completion of the review (or, in the \n     case described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of subsection \n     (b)(3), within the 72-hour or applicable period referred to \n     in such subparagraph).\n       (2) Final determination.--The decision by a plan or issuer \n     under this section shall be treated as the final \n     determination of the plan or issuer on a denial of a claim \n     for benefits. The failure of a plan or issuer to issue a \n     determination on an appeal of a denial of a claim for \n     benefits under this section within the applicable timeline \n     established for such a determination shall be treated as a \n     final determination on an appeal of a denial of a claim for \n     benefits for purposes of proceeding to external review under \n     section 104.\n       (3) Requirements of notice.--With respect to a \n     determination made under this section, the notice described \n     in paragraph (1) shall be provided in printed form and \n     written in a manner calculated to be understood by the \n     average participant, beneficiary, or enrollee and shall \n     include--\n       (A) the specific reasons for the determination (including a \n     summary of the clinical or scientific evidence used in making \n     the determination);\n       (B) the procedures for obtaining additional information \n     concerning the determination; and\n       (C) notification of the right to an independent external \n     review under section 104 and instructions on how to initiate \n     such a review.\n\n     SEC. 104. INDEPENDENT EXTERNAL APPEALS PROCEDURES.\n\n       (a) Right to External Appeal.--A group health plan, and a \n     health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, \n     shall provide in accordance with this section participants, \n     beneficiaries, and enrollees (or authorized representatives) \n     with access to an independent external review for any denial \n     of a claim for benefits.\n       (b) Initiation of the Independent External Review \n     Process.--\n       (1) Time to file.--A request for an independent external \n     review under this section shall be filed with the plan or \n     issuer not later than 180 days after the date on which the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee receives notice of the \n     denial under section 103(d) or notice of waiver of internal \n     review under section 103(a)(4) or the date on which the plan \n     or issuer has failed to make a timely decision under section \n     103(d)(2) and notifies the participant or beneficiary that it \n     has failed to make a timely decision and that the beneficiary \n     must file an appeal with an external review entity within 180 \n     days if the participant or beneficiary desires to file such \n     an appeal.\n\n[[Page S4650]]\n\n       (2) Filing of request.--\n       (A) In general.--Subject to the succeeding provisions of \n     this subsection, a group health plan, and a health insurance \n     issuer offering health insurance coverage, may--\n       (i) except as provided in subparagraph (B)(i), require that \n     a request for review be in writing;\n       (ii) limit the filing of such a request to the participant, \n     beneficiary, or enrollee involved (or an authorized \n     representative);\n       (iii) except if waived by the plan or issuer under section \n     103(a)(4), condition access to an independent external review \n     under this section upon a final determination of a denial of \n     a claim for benefits under the internal review procedure \n     under section 103;\n       (iv) except as provided in subparagraph (B)(ii), require \n     payment of a filing fee to the plan or issuer of a sum that \n     does not exceed $25; and\n       (v) require that a request for review include the consent \n     of the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (or authorized \n     representative) for the release of necessary medical \n     information or records of the participant, beneficiary, or \n     enrollee to the qualified external review entity only for \n     purposes of conducting external review activities.\n       (B) Requirements and exception relating to general rule.--\n       (i) Oral requests permitted in expedited or concurrent \n     cases.--In the case of an expedited or concurrent external \n     review as provided for under subsection (e), the request may \n     be made orally.

Such written confirmation shall be treated as a \n     consent for purposes of subparagraph (A)(v). In the case \n     of such an oral request for such a review, the making of \n     the request (and the timing of such request) shall be \n     treated as the making at that time of a request for such \n     an external review without regard to whether and when a \n     written confirmation of such request is made.\n       (ii) Exception to filing fee requirement.--\n\n       (I) Indigency.--Payment of a filing fee shall not be \n     required under subparagraph (A)(iv) where there is a \n     certification (in a form and manner specified in guidelines \n     established by the appropriate Secretary) that the \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee is indigent (as defined \n     in such guidelines).\n       (II) Fee not required.--Payment of a filing fee shall not \n     be required under subparagraph (A)(iv) if the plan or issuer \n     waives the internal appeals process under section 103(a)(4).\n       (III) Refunding of fee.--The filing fee paid under \n     subparagraph (A)(iv) shall be refunded if the determination \n     under the independent external review is to reverse or modify \n     the denial which is the subject of the review.\n       (IV) Collection of filing fee.--The failure to pay such a \n     filing fee shall not prevent the consideration of a request \n     for review but, subject to the preceding provisions of this \n     clause, shall constitute a legal liability to pay.\n\n       (c) Referral to Qualified External Review Entity Upon \n     Request.--\n       (1) In general.--Upon the filing of a request for \n     independent external review with the group health plan, or \n     health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, \n     the plan or issuer shall immediately refer such request, and \n     forward the plan or issuer's initial decision (including the \n     information described in section 103(d)(3)(A)), to a \n     qualified external review entity selected in accordance with \n     this section.\n       (2) Access to plan or issuer and health professional \n     information.--With respect to an independent external review \n     conducted under this section, the participant, beneficiary, \n     or enrollee (or authorized representative), the plan or \n     issuer, and the treating health care professional (if any) \n     shall provide the external review entity with information \n     that is necessary to conduct a review under this section, as \n     determined and requested by the entity.

Such \n     notice--\n\n       (I) shall be written (and, in addition, may be provided \n     orally) in a manner calculated to be understood by an average \n     participant or enrollee;\n       (II) shall include the reasons for the determination;\n       (III) include any relevant terms and conditions of the plan \n     or coverage; and\n       (IV) include a description of any further recourse \n     available to the individual.\n\n       (ii) General timeline for determinations.--Upon receipt of \n     information under paragraph (2), the qualified external \n     review entity, and if required the independent medical \n     reviewer, shall make a determination within the overall \n     timeline that is applicable to the case under review as \n     described in subsection (e), except that if the entity \n     determines that a referral to an independent medical reviewer \n     is not required, the entity shall provide notice of such \n     determination to the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     (or authorized representative) within such timeline and \n     within 2 days of the date of such determination.\n       (d) Independent Medical Review.--\n       (1) In general.--If a qualified external review entity \n     determines under subsection (c) that a denial of a claim for \n     benefits is eligible for independent medical review, the \n     entity shall refer the denial involved to an independent \n     medical reviewer for the conduct of an independent medical \n     review under this subsection.\n       (2) Medically reviewable decisions.--A denial of a claim \n     for benefits is eligible for independent medical review if \n     the benefit for the item or service for which the claim is \n     made would be a covered benefit under the terms and \n     conditions of the plan or coverage but for one (or more) of \n     the following determinations:\n       (A) Denials based on medical necessity and \n     appropriateness.--A determination that the item or service is \n     not covered because it is not medically necessary and \n     appropriate or based on the application of substantially \n     equivalent terms.\n       (B) Denials based on experimental or investigational \n     treatment.--A determination that the item or service is not \n     covered because it is experimental or investigational or \n     based on the application of substantially equivalent terms.\n       (C) Denials otherwise based on an evaluation of medical \n     facts.--A determination that the item or service or condition \n     is not covered based on grounds that require an evaluation of \n     the medical facts by a health care professional in the \n     specific case involved to determine the coverage and extent \n     of coverage of the item or service or condition.\n       (3) Independent medical review determination.--\n       (A) In general.--An independent medical reviewer under this \n     section shall make a new independent determination with \n     respect to whether or not the denial of a claim for a benefit \n     that is the subject of the review should be upheld, reversed, \n     or modified.\n       (B) Standard for determination.--The independent medical \n     reviewer's determination relating to the medical necessity \n     and appropriateness, or the experimental or investigation \n     nature, or the evaluation of the medical facts of the item, \n     service, or condition shall be based on the medical condition \n     of the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee (including the \n     medical records of the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee) \n     and valid, relevant scientific evidence and clinical \n     evidence, including peer-reviewed medical literature or \n     findings and including expert opinion.\n       (C) No coverage for excluded benefits.--Nothing in this \n     subsection shall be construed to permit an independent \n     medical reviewer to require that a group health plan, or \n     health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage, \n     provide coverage for items or services for which benefits are \n     specifically excluded or expressly limited under the plan \n     or coverage in the plain language of the plan document \n     (and which are disclosed under section 121(b)(1)(C)) \n     except to the extent that\n\n[[Page

determination.--In making determinations \n     under this subtitle, a qualified external review entity and \n     an independent medical reviewer shall--\n       (i) consider the claim under review without deference to \n     the determinations made by the plan or issuer or the \n     recommendation of the treating health care professional (if \n     any); and\n       (ii) consider, but not be bound by the definition used by \n     the plan or issuer of ``medically necessary and \n     appropriate'', or ``experimental or investigational'', or \n     other substantially equivalent terms that

notices.--Determinations and notices under this \n     subsection shall be written in a manner calculated to be \n     understood by an average participant.\n       (f) Compliance.--\n       (1) Application of determinations.--\n       (A) External review determinations binding on plan.--The \n     determinations of an external review entity and an \n     independent medical reviewer under this section shall be \n     binding upon the plan or issuer involved.\n       (B) Compliance with determination.--If the determination of \n     an independent medical reviewer is to reverse or

may obtain the items or \n     services involved (in a manner consistent with the \n     determination of the independent external reviewer) from any \n     provider regardless of whether such provider is a \n     participating provider under the plan or coverage.\n       (B) Reimbursement.--\n       (i) In general.--Where a participant, beneficiary, or \n     enrollee obtains items or services in accordance with \n     subparagraph (A), the plan or issuer involved shall provide \n     for reimbursement of the costs of such items or services. \n     Such reimbursement shall be made to the treating health care \n     professional or to the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee \n     (in the case of a participant, beneficiary, or enrollee who \n     pays for the costs of such items or services).\n       (ii) Amount.--The plan or issuer shall fully reimburse a \n     professional, participant, beneficiary, or enrollee under \n     clause (i) for the total costs of the items

remedies available \n     under law) to recover only the amount of any such \n     reimbursement that is owed by the plan or issuer and any \n     necessary legal costs or expenses (including attorney's fees) \n     incurred in recovering such reimbursement.\n       (D) Available remedies.--The remedies provided under this \n     paragraph are in addition to any other available remedies.\n       (3) Penalties against authorized officials for refusing to \n     authorize the determination of an external review entity.--\n       (A) Monetary penalties.--\n       (i) In general.--In any case in which the determination of \n     an external review entity is not followed by a group health \n     plan, or by a health insurance issuer offering health \n     insurance coverage, any person who, acting in the capacity of \n     authorizing the benefit, causes such refusal may, in the \n     discretion in a court of competent jurisdiction, be liable to \n     an aggrieved participant, beneficiary, or enrollee for a \n     civil penalty in an amount of up to $1,000 a day from the \n     date on which the determination was transmitted to the plan \n     or issuer by the external review entity until the date the \n     refusal to provide the benefit is corrected.\n       (ii) Additional penalty for failing to follow timeline.--In \n     any case in which treatment was not commenced by the plan in \n     accordance with the determination of an independent external \n     reviewer, the Secretary shall assess a civil penalty of \n     $10,000 against the plan and the plan shall pay such penalty \n     to the participant, beneficiary, or enrollee involved.\n       (B) Cease and desist order and order of attorney's fees.--\n     In any action described in subparagraph (A) brought by a \n     participant, beneficiary, or enrollee with respect to a group \n     health plan, or a health insurance issuer offering health \n     insurance coverage, in which a plaintiff alleges that a \n     person referred to in such subparagraph has taken an action \n     resulting in a refusal of a benefit determined by an external \n     appeal entity to be covered, or has failed to take an action \n     for which such person is responsible under the terms and \n     conditions of the plan or coverage and which is necessary \n     under the plan or coverage for authorizing a benefit, the \n     court shall cause to be served on the defendant an order \n     requiring the defendant--\n       (i) to cease and desist from the alleged action or failure \n     to act; and\n       (ii) to pay to the plaintiff a reasonable attorney's fee \n     and other reasonable costs relating to the prosecution of the \n     action on the charges on which the plaintiff prevails.\n

civil penalty against a person acting in the capacity of \n     authorizing a benefit determined by an external review entity \n     for one or more group health plans, or health insurance \n     issuers offering health insurance coverage, for--\n\n       (I) any pattern or practice of repeated refusal to \n     authorize a benefit determined by an external appeal entity \n     to be covered;

   (I) 25 percent of the aggregate value of benefits shown by \n     the appropriate Secretary to have not been provided, or \n     unlawfully delayed, in violation of this section under such \n     pattern or practice; or\n       (II) $500,000.\n\n       (D) Removal and disqualification.--Any person acting in the \n     capacity of authorizing benefits who has engaged in any such \n     pattern or practice described in subparagraph (C)(i) with \n     respect to a plan or coverage, upon the petition of the \n     appropriate Secretary, may be removed by the court from such \n     position,

this section and standards \n     specified\n\n[[Page S4653]]\n\n     in subparagraph (C), including that it will not conduct any \n     external review activities in a case unless the independence \n

standard-setting \n     organizations.--For purposes of clause (i)(II), the \n     appropriate Secretary may approve a qualified private \n     standard-setting organization if such Secretary finds that \n     the organization only certifies (or recertifies) external \n     review entities that meet at least the standards required for \n     the certification (or recertification) of external

SENSE OF SENATE ON THE PERCENTAGE OF FEDERAL \n                   EDUCATION FUNDING THAT IS SPENT IN THE \n                   CLASSROOM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Effective and meaningful teaching begins by helping \n     children master basic academics, holding children to high \n     academic standards, using sound research based methods of \n     instruction in the classroom, engaging and involving parents, \n     establishing and maintaining safe and orderly classrooms, and \n     getting funds to the classroom.\n       (2) America's children deserve an educational system that \n     provides them with numerous opportunities to excel.\n       (3) States and localities spend a significant amount of \n     education tax dollars on bureaucratic red tape by applying \n     for and administering Federal education dollars.\n       (4) Several States have reported that although they receive \n     less than 10 percent of their education funding from the \n     Federal Government, more than 50 percent of their education \n     paperwork and administration efforts are associated with \n     those Federal funds.\n       (5) According to the Department of Education, in 1998, 84 \n     percent of the funds allocated by the Department for \n     elementary and secondary education were allocated to local \n     educational agencies and used for instruction and \n     instructional support.\n       (6) The remainder of the funds allocated by the Department \n     of Education for elementary and secondary education in 1998 \n     was allocated to States, universities, national programs, and \n     other service providers.\n       (7) The total spent by the Department of Education for \n     elementary and secondary education does not take into account \n     what States spend to receive Federal funds and comply with \n     Federal requirements for elementary and secondary education, \n     nor does it reflect the percentage of Federal funds allocated \n     to school districts that is spent on students in the \n     classroom.\n       (8) American students are not performing up to their full \n     academic potential, despite significant Federal education \n     initiatives and funding from a variety of Federal agencies.\n       (9) According to the Digest of Education Statistics, only \n     54 percent of $278,965,657,000 spent on elementary and \n     secondary education during the 1995-96 school year was spent \n     on ``instruction''.\n       (10) According to the National Center for Education \n     Statistics, only 52 percent of staff employed in public \n     elementary and secondary school systems in 1996 were \n     teachers, and, according to the General Accounting Office, \n     Federal education dollars funded 13,397 full-time equivalent \n     positions in State educational agencies in fiscal year 1993.\n       (11) In fiscal year 1998, the paperwork and data reporting \n     requirements of the Department of Education amounted to \n     40,000,000 so-called ``burden hours'', which is equivalent to \n     nearly 20,000 people working 40 hours a week for one full \n     year, time and energy which would be better spent teaching \n     children in the classroom.\n       (12) Too large a percentage of Federal education funds is \n     spent on bureaucracy, special interests, and ineffective \n     programs, and too little is effectively and efficiently spent \n     on our America's youth.\n       (13) Requiring an allocation of 95 percent of all Federal \n     elementary and secondary education funds to classrooms would \n     provide substantial additional funding per classroom across \n     the United States.\n       (14) More education funding should be put in the hands of \n     someone in a classroom who knows the children personally and \n     frequently interacts with the children.\n       (15) Burdensome regulations, requirements, and mandates \n     should be refined, consolidated or removed so that school \n     districts can devote more resources to educating children in \n     classrooms.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate to \n     urge the Department of Education, the States, and local \n     educational agencies to work together to ensure that not less \n     than 95 percent of all funds appropriated for carrying out \n     elementary and secondary education programs administered by \n     the Department be spent to improve the academic achievement \n     of our children in their classrooms.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 488.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds that--\n       (1) according to the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, \n     there is no county, metro area or state in the country where \n     a full-time minimum wage worker can afford the fair market \n     rent for a 1-, 2- or 3-bedroom home;\n       (2) the national median housing wage is $12.47 an hour, \n     more than twice the Federal minimum wage of $5.15 per hour;\n       (3) 4,900,000 unassisted renter households in 1999 had \n     worst-case housing needs, paying more than half of their \n     income for housing, or living in severely substandard \n     housing;\n       (4) an additional 5,000,000 assisted renter households may \n     also live in substandard housing;\n       (5) as many as 1,000,000 people are homeless in the United \n     States;\n       (6) of the 34,000,000 renter households in the United \n     States, 7,700,000 have extremely low incomes (defined as 30 \n     percent of the area median income or less);\n       (7) besides low-wage workers, the population of extremely \n     low-income rental households includes elderly and disabled \n     people whose only income is from Supplemental Security Income \n     or other fixed income sources;\n       (8) in the aggregate, there are only 4,900,000 units of \n     rental housing that are affordable to these households, thus \n     an absolute shortage of 2,800,000 units;\n       (9) only 2,300,000 of the available 4,900,000 affordable \n     rental units are actually occupied by extremely low-income \n     households;\n       (10) overall, there is a shortage of 5,300,000 units, \n     affordable for the poorest renter households; and\n       (11) the lack of stable housing affects the ability of \n     children to succeed in school, and children who are homeless \n     struggle in school, as evidenced by the facts that--\n       (A) 45 percent of children who are homeless do not attend \n     school on a regular basis while they are homeless; and\n       (B) compared with other children, children who are homeless \n     are 4 times as likely to have development delays, twice as \n     likely to have learning disabilities, and twice as likely to \n     repeat a grade, most often due to frequent absences and moves \n     to new schools.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) many communities across the United States, urban and \n     rural, large and small, are experiencing a severe affordable \n     housing crisis;\n       (2) safe, stable, affordable housing is critical to the \n     well-being of families and children;\n       (3) safe, stable, affordable housing is critical to the \n     ability of children to succeed in school; and\n       (4) this Congress should consider legislation that would \n     begin to address the current affordable housing crisis, \n     including legislation to promote the production of new \n     affordable housing units and legislation to preserve existing \n     affordable housing units.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 490.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       ``(a) Short Title.--This part may be cited as the `Ready to \n     Learn, Ready to Teach Act of 2001'.\n       ``(b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1) In 1994, Congress and the Department collaborated to \n     make a long-term, meaningful and public investment in the \n     principle that high quality preschool television programming \n     will help children be ready to learn by the time the children \n     entered first grade.\n       ``(2) The Ready to Learn Television Program through the \n     Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and local public television \n     stations has proven to be an extremely cost-effective \n     national response to improving early childhood cognitive \n     development and helping parents, caregivers, and professional \n     child care providers learn how to use television as a means \n     to help children learn and develop social skills and values.\n       ``(3) Independent research shows that parents who \n     participate in Ready to Learn workshops are more selective of \n     the programs that they choose for their children, limit the \n     number of hours of television viewing of their children, and \n     use the television programs as a catalyst for learning.\n       ``(4) The Ready to Learn (RTL) Television Program is \n     supporting and creating commercial-free broadcast programs \n     for young children that are of the highest possible \n     educational quality.\n       ``(5) Through the Nation's 350 local public television \n     stations, these programs and other programming elements reach \n     tens of millions of children, their parents, and caregivers \n     without regard to their economic circumstances, location, or \n     access to cable. Public television is a partner with Federal \n     policy to make television an instrument of preschool \n     children's education and early development.\n       ``(6) The Ready to Learn Television Program supports \n     thousands of local workshops organized and run by local \n     public television stations, child care service providers, \n     Head Start Centers, Even Start family literacy centers and \n     schools. These workshops have trained 630,587 parents and \n     professionals who, in turn, serve and support over 6,312,000 \n     children across the Nation.\n       ``(7) The Ready to Learn Television Program has published \n     and distributed a periodic magazine entitled `PBS Families' \n     that contains developmentally appropriate material to \n     strengthen reading skills and enhance family literacy.\n       ``(8) Ready to Learn Television stations also have \n     distributed millions of age-appropriate books in their \n     communities. Each station receives a minimum of 300 books \n     each month for free local distribution. Some stations are now \n     distributing more than 1,000 books per month. Nationwide, \n     more than 653,494 books have been distributed in low-income \n     and disadvantaged neighborhoods free of charge.\n       ``(9) Demand for Ready To Learn Television Program outreach \n     and training has increased from 10 Public Broadcasting \n     Service stations to 133 stations in 5 years. This growth has \n     put a strain on available resources resulting in an inability \n     to meet the demand for the service and to reach all the \n     children who would benefit from the service.\n       ``(10) Federal policy played a crucial role in the \n     evolution of analog television by funding the television \n     program entitled `Sesame Street' in the 1960's.

Video modeling of \n     standards-based lessons, combined with professionally \n     facilitated online learning communities of teachers has been \n     proven to help mathematics teachers adopt and implement \n     standards-based practices. This integrated, self-paced \n     approach breaks down the isolation of classroom teaching \n     while making standards-based best practices available to all \n     participants.\n       ``(2) More than 5,800 teachers have participated over the \n     last 3 years in the demonstration. These teachers have taught \n     more than 1,500,000 students cumulatively.\n       ``(3) Independent evaluations indicate that teaching \n     improves and students benefit as a result of the program.\n       ``(4) The demonstration program should be expanded to reach \n     more teachers in more subject areas under the title of \n     Teacherline. The Teacherline Program will link the digitized \n     public broadcasting infrastructure with education networks by \n     working with the program's digital membership, and Federal \n     and State agencies, to expand and build upon the successful \n     model and take advantage of greatly expanded access to the \n     Internet and technology in schools, including digital \n     television. The Teacherline Program will leverage the Public \n     Broadcasting Service's historic relationships with higher \n     education to improve preservice teacher training.\n       ``(5) Over the past several years tremendous progress has \n     been made in wiring classrooms, equipping the classrooms with \n     multimedia computers, and connecting the classrooms to the \n     Internet.\n       ``(6) There is a great need for high quality, curriculum-\n     based digital content for teachers and students to easily \n     access and use in order to meet State and local standards for \n     student performance.\n       ``(7) The congressionally appointed Web-based Education \n     Commission called for the development of high quality public-\n     private online educational content that meets the highest \n     standards of educational excellence.\n       ``(8) Most local public television stations and State \n     networks provide high-quality video programs, and teacher \n     professional development, as a part of their mission to serve \n     local schools.

FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress finds the following:\n       ``(1) While the families or communities of some gifted \n     students can provide private programs with appropriately \n     trained staff to supplement public educational offerings, \n     most high-ability students, especially those from inner \n     cities, rural communities, or low-income families, must rely \n     on the services and personnel provided by public schools. \n     Therefore, gifted education programs, provided by qualified \n     professionals in the public schools, are needed to provide \n     equal educational opportunities.\n       ``(2) Due to the wide dispersal of students who are gifted \n     and talented and the national interest in a well-educated \n     populace, the Federal Government can most effectively and \n     appropriately conduct research and development to provide an \n     infrastructure for, and to ensure that there is, a national \n     capacity to educate students who are gifted and talented to \n     meet the needs of the 21st century.\n       ``(3) State and local educational agencies often lack the \n     specialized resources and trained personnel to consistently \n     plan and implement effective programs for the identification \n     of gifted and talented students and for the provision of \n     educational services and programs appropriate for their \n     needs.\n       ``(4) Because gifted and talented students generally are \n     more advanced academically, are able to learn more quickly, \n     and study in more depth and complexity than others their age, \n     their educational needs require opportunities and experiences \n     that are different from those generally available in regular \n     education programs.\n       ``(5) Typical elementary school students who are \n     academically gifted and talented already have mastered 35 to \n     50 percent of the school year's content in several subject \n     areas before the year begins. Without an advanced and \n     challenging curriculum, they often lose their motivation and \n     develop poor study habits that are difficult to break.\n       ``(6) Elementary school and secondary school teachers have \n     students in their classrooms with a wide variety of traits, \n     characteristics, and needs. Most teachers receive some \n     training to meet the needs of these students, such as \n     students with limited English proficiency, students with \n     disabilities, and students from diverse cultural and racial \n     backgrounds. However, most teachers do not receive training \n     on meeting the needs of students who are gifted and talented.\n\n     ``SEC. 10403.

Mr. LIEBERMAN submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill S. 1, to extend programs and activities under the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965; which was ordered to \nlie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING STREAMLINING OF \n                   EDUCATION PROGRAMS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1)(A) In 1965, Congress enacted and President Johnson \n     signed into law the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965, taking bold new action with the primary goal of \n     ensuring that low-income children have the same opportunity \n     for a quality public education as their more affluent peers.\n       (B) Today the Federal role embodied in the original \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 is still \n     critical, but the global economy and increasing demands for a \n     more highly skilled workforce require more from the public \n     education system. Although the number of titles and programs \n     in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 have \n     multiplied from efforts to try and address changing times, \n     the underlying philosophy of the Act and methods used in the \n     Act have not been rethought. As a result, the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 has grown into a confusing, \n     unfocused mix of programs.\n       (2) Currently the Federal government's funding for and \n     focus on education programs are dispersed in dozens of \n     directions. More importantly, by dispersing the funding, the \n     Federal government has diluted the impact of Federal \n     investments and diminished the government's ability to cause \n     bold changes in the public education system.\n       (3) The Federal government has a far better chance of \n     spurring far-reaching reforms and improving the quality of \n     schools if the government concentrates on a few, clear \n     national priorities, gives the States and localities room and \n     reason to innovate, and then hold the State and localities \n     responsible for producing results.\n       (4) This Act streamlines numerous titles, with nearly 50 \n     different funding channels for education programs, into 7 \n     performance-based titles, all of which are geared toward the \n     Nation's top priority of raising academic achievement.\n       (5) Congress must uphold a commitment to a new streamlined \n     and focused Federal role in education.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) Congress should uphold the streamlining of education \n     programs achieved in S. 1, 107th Congress, as placed on the \n     calendar of the Senate; and\n       (2) Congress should oppose efforts to create new programs \n     or set asides for elementary school or secondary school \n     education that contradict the goal of concentrating the \n     Federal focus and funding for education programs on a \n     limited, but critical, number of national priorities that are \n     most directly linked to raising student achievement.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 524.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to a 1999 issue brief prepared by the \n     National Center for Education Statistics, the average public \n     school in America is 42 years old, and school buildings begin \n     rapid deterioration after 40 years. In addition, 29 percent \n     of all public schools are in the oldest condition, meaning \n     that the schools were built before 1970 and have either never \n     been renovated or were renovated prior to 1980.\n       (2) According to reports issued by the General Accounting \n     Office (GAO) in 1995 and 1996, it would cost $112,000,000,000 \n     to bring the Nation's schools into good overall condition, \n     and one-third of all public schools need extensive repair or \n     replacement.\n       (3) Many schools do not have the appropriate infrastructure \n     to support computers and other technologies that are \n     necessary to prepare students for the jobs of the 21st \n     century.\n       (4) Without impeding on local control, the Federal \n     Government appropriately can assist State, regional, and \n     local entities in addressing school construction, renovation, \n     and repair needs by providing low-interest loans for purposes \n     of paying interest on related bonds and by supporting other \n     State-administered school construction programs.\n\n     SEC. __03.

As of January 1, 2001, \n     this goal has still not been achieved.\n       (2) Research suggests that a child's early years are \n     critical to the development of the brain. Early brain \n     development is an important component of educational and \n     intellectual achievement.\n       (3) The National Research Council reported that early \n     education opportunities are necessary if children are going \n     to develop the language and literacy skills necessary to \n     learn to read.\n       (4) Evaluations of early education programs demonstrate \n     that compared to children with similar backgrounds who have \n     not participated in early education programs, children who \n     participate in such programs--\n       (A) perform better on reading and mathematics achievement \n     tests;\n       (B) are more likely to stay academically near their grade \n     level and make normal academic progress throughout elementary \n     school;\n       (C) are less likely to be held back a grade or require \n     special education services in elementary school;\n       (D) show greater learning retention, initiative, \n     creativity, and social competency; and\n       (E) are more enthusiastic about school and are more likely \n     to have good attendance records.\n       (5) Studies have estimated that for every dollar invested \n     in quality early education, about 7 dollars are saved in \n     later costs.\n       (c) Early Education.--Title I (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.), as \n     amended in section 151, is further amended by adding at the \n     end the following:\n\n                       ``PART I--EARLY EDUCATION\n\n     ``SEC. 1841.

HELPING CHILDREN SUCCEED BY FULLY FUNDING THE \n                   INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES EDUCATION ACT \n                   (IDEA).\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) All children deserve a quality education.\n       (2) In Pennsylvania Association for Retarded Children vs. \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania (334 F. Supp. 1247)(E. Dist. Pa. \n     1971), and Mills vs. Board of Education of the District of \n     Columbia (348 F. Supp. 866)(Dist. D.C. 1972), the courts \n     found that children with disabilities are entitled to an \n     equal opportunity to an education under the 14th amendment of \n     the Constitution.\n       (3) In 1975, Congress passed what is now known as the \n     Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (referred to in \n     this section as ``IDEA'') (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.) to help \n     States provide all children with disabilities a free, \n     appropriate public education in the least restrictive \n     environment. At full funding, Congress contributes 40 percent \n     of the average per pupil expenditure for each child with a \n     disability served.\n       (4) Before 1975, only \\1/5\\ of the children with \n     disabilities received a formal education. At that time, many \n     States had laws that specifically excluded many children with \n     disabilities, including children who were blind, deaf, or \n     emotionally disturbed, from receiving such an education.\n       (5) IDEA currently serves an estimated 200,000 infants and \n     toddlers, 600,000 preschoolers, and 5,400,000 children 6 to \n     21 years of age.\n       (6) IDEA enables children with disabilities to be educated \n     in their communities, and thus, has assisted in dramatically \n     reducing the number of children with disabilities who must \n     live in State institutions away from their families.\n       (7) The number of children with disabilities who complete \n     high school has grown significantly since the enactment of \n     IDEA.\n       (8) The number of children with disabilities who enroll in \n     college as freshmen has more than tripled since the enactment \n     of IDEA.\n       (9) The overall effectiveness of IDEA depends upon well \n     trained special education and general education teachers, \n     related services personnel, and other school personnel. \n     Congress recognizes concerns about the nationwide shortage of \n     personnel serving students with disabilities and the need for \n     improvement in the qualifications of such personnel.\n       (10) IDEA has raised the Nation's awareness about the \n     abilities and capabilities of children with disabilities.\n       (11) Improvements to IDEA in the 1997 amendments increased \n     the academic achievement of children with disabilities and \n     helped them to lead productive, independent lives.\n       (12) Changes made in 1997 also addressed the needs of those \n     children whose behavior impedes learning by implementing \n     behavioral assessments and intervention strategies to ensure \n     that they receive appropriate supports in order to receive a \n     quality education.\n       (13) IDEA requires a full partnership between parents of \n     children with disabilities and education professionals in the \n     design and implementation of the educational services \n     provided to children with disabilities.\n       (14) While the Federal Government has more than doubled \n     funding for part B of IDEA since 1995, the Federal Government \n     has never provided more than 15 percent of the maximum State \n     grant allocation for educating children with disabilities.\n       (15) By fully funding IDEA, Congress will strengthen the \n     ability of States and localities to implement the \n     requirements of IDEA.\n       (b) Local Educational Agency Eligibility.--Clauses (i) and \n     (ii) of section 613(a)(2)(C) of the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1413(a)(2)(C)) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(i) Notwithstanding clauses (ii) and (iii) of \n     subparagraph (A), for any fiscal year for which amounts \n     appropriated to carry out section 611 exceeds $4,100,000,000, \n     a local educational agency may treat as local funds, for the \n     purpose of such clauses, up to 55 percent of the amount of \n     funds it receives under this part that exceeds the amount it \n     received under this part for fiscal year 2001, except where a \n     local educational agency shows that it is meeting the \n     requirements of this part, the local educational agency may \n     petition the State to waive, in whole or in part, the 55 \n     percent cap under this clause.\n       ``(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), if the Secretary \n     determines that a local educational agency is not meeting the \n     requirements of this part, the Secretary may prohibit the \n     local educational agency from treating funds received under \n     this part as local funds under clause (i) for any fiscal \n     year, and may redirect the use of those funds to other \n     educational programs within the local educational agency.''.\n       (c) Funding.--Section 611(j) of the Individuals with \n     Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1411(j)) is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(j) Funding.--\n       ``(1) In

FINDINGS.\n\n       ``Congress makes the following findings:\n       ``(1) The strength of our democracy rests with the \n     willingness of our citizens to be active participants in \n     their governance. For young people to be such active \n     participants, it is essential that they develop a strong \n     sense of responsibility toward ensuring the common good and \n     general welfare of their local communities, States and the \n     Nation.\n       ``(2) For the young people of our country to develop a \n     sense of responsibility for their fellow citizens, \n     communities and country, our educational system must assist \n     them in the development of strong moral character and values.\n       ``(3) Civic education about our Federal Government is an \n     integral component in the process of educating young people \n     to be active and productive citizens who contribute to \n     strengthening and promoting our democratic form of \n     government.\n       ``(4) There are enormous pressures on teachers to develop \n     creative ways to stimulate the development of strong moral \n     character and appropriate value systems among young people, \n     and to educate young people about their responsibilities and \n     rights as citizens.\n\n[[Page S4765]]\n\n       ``(5) Young people who have economically disadvantaged \n     backgrounds, or who are from other under-served \n     constituencies, have a special need for educational programs \n     that develop a strong a sense of community and educate them \n     about their rights and responsibilities as citizens of the \n     United States. Under-served constituencies include those such \n     as economically disadvantaged young people in large \n     metropolitan areas, ethnic minorities, who are members of \n     recently immigrated or migrant families, Native Americans or \n     the physically disabled.\n       ``(6) The Close Up Foundation has thirty years of \n     experience in providing economically disadvantaged young \n     people and teachers with a unique and highly educational \n     experience with how our federal system of government \n     functions through its programs that bring young people and \n     teachers to Washington, D.C. for a first-hand view of our \n     government in action.\n       ``(7) It is a worthwhile goal to ensure that economically \n     disadvantaged young people and teachers have the opportunity \n     to participate in Close Up's highly effective civic education \n     program.

Mr. HATCH proposed an amendment to the bill H.R. 428, \nconcerning the participation of Taiwan in the World Health \nOrganization; as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. CONCERNING THE PARTICIPATION OF TAIWAN IN THE \n                   WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (WHO).\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Good health is important to every citizen of the world \n     and access to the highest standards of health information and \n     services is necessary to improve the public health.\n       (2) Direct and unobstructed participation in international \n     health cooperation forums and programs is beneficial for all \n     parts of the world, especially with today's greater potential \n     for the cross-border spread of various infectious diseases \n     such as the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), tuberculosis, \n     and malaria.\n       (3) Taiwan's population of 23,500,000 people is larger than \n     that of \\3/4\\ of the member states already in the World \n     Health Organization (WHO).\n       (4) Taiwan's achievements in the field of health are \n     substantial, including one of the highest life expectancy \n     levels in Asia, maternal and infant mortality rates \n     comparable to those of western countries, the eradication of \n     such infectious diseases as cholera, smallpox, and the \n     plague, and the first to eradicate polio and provide children \n     with hepatitis B vaccinations.\n       (5) The United States Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention and its Taiwan counterpart agencies have enjoyed \n     close collaboration on a wide range of public health issues.\n       (6) In recent years Taiwan has expressed a willingness to \n     assist financially and technically in international aid and \n     health activities supported by the WHO.\n       (7) On January 14, 2001, an earthquake, registering between \n     7.6 and 7.9 on the Richter scale, struck El Salvador. In \n     response, the Taiwanese government sent 2 rescue teams, \n     consisting of 90 individuals specializing in firefighting, \n     medicine, and civil engineering. The Taiwanese Ministry of \n     Foreign Affairs also donated $200,000 in relief aid to the \n     Salvadoran Government.\n       (8) The World Health Assembly has allowed observers to \n     participate in the activities of the organization, including \n     the Palestine Liberation Organization in 1974, the Order of \n     Malta, and the Holy See in the early 1950's.\n       (9) The United States, in the 1994 Taiwan Policy Review, \n     declared its intention to support Taiwan's participation in \n     appropriate international organizations.\n       (10) Public Law 106-137 required the Secretary of State to \n     submit a report to the Congress on efforts by the executive \n     branch to support Taiwan's participation in international \n     organizations, in particular the WHO.\n       (11) In light of all benefits that Taiwan's participation \n     in the WHO can bring to the state of health not only in \n     Taiwan, but also regionally and globally, Taiwan and its \n     23,500,000 people should have appropriate and meaningful \n     participation in the WHO.\n       (b) Plan.--The Secretary of State is authorized--\n       (1) to initiate a United States plan to endorse and obtain \n     observer status for Taiwan at the annual week-long summit of \n     the World Health Assembly in May 2001 in Geneva, Switzerland; \n     and\n       (2) to instruct the United States delegation to Geneva to \n     implement that plan.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 14 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit a \n     written report to the Congress in unclassified form \n     containing the plan authorized under subsection (b).\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/09/senate-section/article/S4771-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4771-S4772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               Committee on Energy and Natural Resources\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI.

One of the great problems of this budget is the defense \nbuildup that we all know the administration is going to call for--in \nfact, we are told it is going to come out next week--and the Secretary \nof Defense was asked by the President not to come out with his defense \nnumbers before we passed the tax cut. Why? I suppose reasonable people \ncould conjecture why they didn't want the defense numbers out before \nthe tax cut was agreed to. But I think I know. I think the truth is \nthat they know if you have the defense numbers, and if you have what is \nlikely to happen in education spending, and if you have some commitment \nto strengthening Social Security, which everybody says they are for as \npart of a budget document, then the budget document before us simply \ndoes not add up. That is their problem.\n  When you put all of those numbers together, what you find is that you \nare into the Social Security and the Medicare trust funds.\n  In conclusion, I take my colleagues back to the budget proposal we \nmade on our side because I think it was a fiscally responsible \nproposal, one that took the $5.6 trillion forecast but understood that \nit was a projection, and that it is very unlikely to come true.\n  The Senator from Michigan has just shown how inaccurate these \nforecasts have been year after year. They average being off by 100 \npercent or more. That tells me that we ought to be cautious in what we \ndo.\n  In the budget proposal we made, we reserved all of the Social \nSecurity trust fund money for Social Security, $2.5 trillion, all of \nthe Medicare trust fund money for Medicare, $400 billion, and then with \nwhat was left, we had a proposed tax cut of $745 billion in comparison \nto the $1.3 trillion that is before us.\n  In other words, we had about 60 percent of the tax cut that is being \nproposed. We had $300 billion more of investment on high-priority \ndomestic needs. And the area where there were the big differences was \neducation. We had $139 billion of new money for education. Actually, \nwhat passed the Senate was much more than that. But this conference \ncommittee came back with nothing--no new money for education.\n  I know there are colleagues who believe this conference report has \nmore money for education. It does not. It does not.\n  I have gone over these numbers in great detail. There is only allowed \nin this budget resolution the inflationary increase so that we are not \ncutting the effective amount for education every year. The truth is, \neven with that inflationary adjustment, we are cutting what is \navailable because the student population is growing.\n  With no new money for education in real terms in what can be \ndelivered per student, this budget cuts education, after the President \nhas said education is his top priority.\n\n[[Page S4773]]\n\n  We had a smaller tax cut. We had more resources than is provided in \nthis conference report dedicated to these high-priority needs, \nincluding education, including national defense, and including health \ncare coverage. We set aside $750 billion to deal with this long-term \ndebt that we all know is coming our way about when the baby boom \ngeneration retires. We set aside $750 billion for that purpose because \nwe think it is kind of like the squirrel in the fall. You had better be \nputting some nuts away to prepare for the winter.\n\n  In this conference report there is zero set aside to strengthen \nSocial Security for the long term, to address this long- term debt that \nis coming our way.\n  The fundamental difference between us is that we had about twice as \nmuch money set aside for debt reduction. The other side has about twice \nas much money set aside for a tax cut. We had more new money set aside \nfor education and more money set aside for national defense than is in \nthis conference report.\n  But this conference report isn't the full story because we know the \nSecretary of Defense has said he is going to come out next week and \npropose a huge increase in defense. But they are not in the budget.\n\n  We know the President has a Social Security commission that is going \nto come back and propose privatization. That has a transition cost of \nabout $1 trillion. There is no money in the budget for it, just as \nthere is no money in the budget for the defense buildup they are going \nto ask for, just as there is no new money for education, although the \nPresident says it is his top priority.\n  There is something wrong with a budget that does not have what we \nreally intend to do in it. That is the way we get into financial \ntrouble. There is no private sector enterprise in America that would \nbudget this way. It is profoundly irresponsible.\n  I hope we reject the conference report. I sincerely do. I call on my \ncolleagues to do just that. Let's go back to the drawing board. Let's \nwait until we have that defense number next week. Let's wait until the \nPresident proposes how much he needs to strengthen Social Security for \nthe long term. Let's wait until we finish action on the education bill \nthat is on the floor of the Senate right now and see how much money \nthat is going to require, so that we have a full accounting, a full \nbudget, and make certain that it adds up.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/09/senate-section/article/S4773-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4773]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
