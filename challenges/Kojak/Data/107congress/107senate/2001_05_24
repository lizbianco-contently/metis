Mr. President, I want to speak about something I have \noften spoken about in this Chamber. My colleagues have not heard me \nspeak about this for a couple months. I try to follow on a very regular \nbasis what is going on in the Defense Department because I want to make \nsure our defense dollars are spent wisely.\n  I come to this Chamber today to explain my opposition to a Department \nof Defense nomination. This is the nomination of Dr. David Chu to be \nUnder Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness.\n  On Friday, May 18, I placed a hold on Dr. Chu's nomination. It \nhappens that Dr. Chu is a very talented person. Those people who know \nhim may wonder why I have some question about him filling this position \nbecause he is so highly educated, holding a Ph.D. from Yale University. \nHe has a very impressive resume, and he has an extensive management and \nanalytical background. He is currently vice president at the \nprestigious Rand Corporation.\n  In most ways, he is qualified for the position for which he has been \nnominated. I emphasize, he is qualified in most ways, but in a most \nimportant one--the matter of integrity--I am not 100-percent certain.\n  I have some unresolved questions about Dr. Chu's approach to telling \nit like it is--one might say his honesty. I am hoping these can be \ncleared up through negotiations.\n  My questions about Dr. Chu's integrity go back 20 years, I am sorry \nto say, to 1982, an incident I had that involved the Director of the \nOffice of Program Analysis and Evaluation. this is commonly called \nPA, analysis, and evaluation.\n  PA was a very important office in the Pentagon in those days, and \nit was staffed with a very impressive cast of characters. It was set up \nin the 1960s to act as a devil's advocate for the Secretary of Defense.\n  PA was supposed to help the civilian Secretary of Defense separate \nthe wheat from the chaff. PA was supposed to ferret out questionable \nprograms and help the Secretary eliminate those that were not \nnecessary.\n  From time to time, PA has to tangle with the brass at the Pentagon, \nand it took a very special person to do that. I think Secretary \nRumsfeld is coming to grips with that very same problem right now.\n  Over the years, PA developed a ruputation for being very hardnosed, \nbut also being very smart. In the old days, PA put the fear of God in \nthe harts and minds of admirals and generals worried about their pet \nprojects.\n  Over the years, PA earned a solid reputation and well-deserved \nrespect. That is how it came to be known as the home for the famous \nPentagon ``whiz kids.'' One of the modern-day whiz kids is one I came \nto know quite well--Franklin C. Spinney, Chuck Spinney for short.\n  Chuck Spinney worked for Dr. Chu in PA's tactical air division, \nwhere he still works this very day. Chuck Spinney's immediate boss was \nTom Christie. Tom Christie is another distinguished PA \nalumnus. President Bush has just nominated him to be the next Director \nof Operational Test and Evaluation.\n\n  Tom Christie deserves a lot of credit for protecting Chuck Spinney. \nHe provided a sanctuary where Chuck Spinney could speak freely. He \nprovided an environment where Chuck Spinney could do the kind of work \nthat PA had always done. Unfortunately, this kind of work became \nincreasingly unpopular during the Reagan defense build-up.\n  That's when I met Chuck Spinney--in the early stage of the Reagan \ndefense build-up. I came to know him as the author of a very \ncontroversial report entitled ``The Plans/Reality Mismatch.''\n  The Plans/Reality Mismatch was an explosive piece of work. It was so \nexplosive because it undermined the credibility of the Reagan defense \nbuild-up.\n  Chuck Spinney's Plans/Reality Mismatch set the stage for an \nunprecedented hearing held in February 1983. This was a joint hearing \nbetween the Armed Services and Budget Committees that was held largely \nat my request.\n  And Chuck Spinney, his Plans/Reality Mismatch, and stack of famous \nspaghetti charts were the centerpiece of the hearing. This was a \nhearing characterized by high drama. It was held in the Senate Caucus \nRoom under the glare of television lights and intense media coverage.\n  Chuck Spinney gained instant notoriety as the ``maverick Pentagon \nanalyst.'' He appeared on the cover of the March 7, 1983 issue of Time \nmagazine.\n  My questions about Dr. Chu's integrity grew out of Chuck Spinney's \nPlans/Reality Mismatch.\n  Leading up to the hearing, Dr. Chu withheld information about the \nSpinney report. He didn't tell us the whole story. He tried to keep it \nfrom me, Senator Gorton, and Senator Kassebaum.\n  Mr. President, that's the bottom line: Dr. Chu was not forthright and \nhonest with me.\n  I laid out the entire matter in much greater detail in a letter I \nwrote to the chairman of the Budget Committee, my friend from New \nMexico, Senator Pete Domenici.\n  My letter to Senator Domenici is dated January 19, 1995.\n  I wrote the letter because Dr. Chu was being considered as a possible \nDirector of the Congressional Budget Office. I opposed his appointment \nto that position.\n  My letter about Dr. Chu has remained a closely guarded secret for the \npast six years. Until recently, only Senator Domenici had seen the \nletter--and no one else.\n  When I heard that Dr. Chu was being considered for a top-level post \nin the Pentagon, I shared the letter with the Director of White House \nPersonnel. That was on March 8.\n  Clearly, the existence of this letter has caused some heartburn in \nboth the White House and Pentagon. It has generated a number of phone \ncalls to my office.\n  I continue to have strong reservations about Dr. Chu's nomination.\n  When I was contacted by the White House about Dr. Chu, I made my \nposition crystal clear:\n  If Secretary Rumsfeld wants to make Dr. Chu the Under Secretary of \nPersonnel and Readiness, then Secretary Rumsfeld will need a strong, \nindependent Inspector General (IG).\n  That's my position on the Chu nomination.\n  One of the IG's toughest jobs is the investigation of allegations of \nmisconduct by senior Pentagon officials. He will need a hard-nosed \nindividual with plenty of hands-on experience to succeed at that job.\n  I don't see the Pentagon moving in that direction--yet.\n  Mr. President, I may have much more to say about Dr. Chu at a later \ndate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I take a few minutes this morning to talk \nabout a topic to which we will soon be moving. We have properly spent a \ngood deal of time on the budget. We spent a good deal of time on taxes, \nalthough that is not finished yet. I congratulate the chairman on his \nexcellent work on the tax bill. It sounds as if we will be able to \npresent that to the President and successfully give tax relief to the \nAmerican people.\n  We also have been heavily involved in education. We have not finished \nthat area yet. We will soon be returning to it.\n  Those have been the most current topics and perhaps, indeed, among \nMembers the most important topics.\n  There is another topic that is very important to everyone and one to \nwhich we are moving, and that is energy and energy policy. After having\n\n[[Page S5573]]\n\nan energy policy, we will begin to implement that policy so we can make \nsure we can provide the necessary energy in a way that is careful and \nwatchful about the environment. I think we can do this.\n  One of the important things that has happened is there is now an \nenergy policy from the White House that will be open, of course, to \ngreat debate and great discussion in the Congress and in the whole \ncountry.\n  The fact is we have not had a policy on energy for a very long time. \nThat is one of the reasons we find ourselves in the position we are in \nnow. We have not looked ahead and we have not responded to the market \nmessages that were sent in California. When we have consumption rising \nand production going down, there is a problem.\n  In the case of energy, as is the case of most other industries, it \ntakes a good deal of time to implement some change. I am very pleased \nwe are moving in that direction and we will continue to move. I applaud \nthe President and Vice President Cheney for the emphasis put by the \nWhite House on the energy issue and, specifically, the White House task \nforce that completed its work in a rather short time. Of course, we \nhave that energy package now. I think it will be the basis of our \nactivities over the next several months, a very extensive booklet of \nissues pertaining to energy and the maintenance of our energy \navailability.\n  I applaud particularly the Vice President for working in this working \ngroup and including more than energy. The involvement of the Department \nof the Interior and the involvement of the Environmental Protection \nAgency are equally important, as in the involvement of the Energy \nDepartment itself. The things they do, the land they manage, the rules \nthey promulgate certainly are as important as anything else that \naffects energy.\n  One of the real problems we have had is we have become more and more \ndependent on imported oil and foreign countries to produce what we \nneed. Obviously, there will be an effort to increase domestic \nproduction. That is certainly the proper goal.\n  There has been some criticism that this study was not a public \naffair. However, the Vice President did talk to 265 different groups. \nThis was not a public decisionmaking; this was the White House putting \nit out. How the Congress and the public will be involved. That is the \nproper way for the President to handle policy.\n  Chairman Murkowski, from the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nor which I am member, has a broad bill that deals with many issues. \nThere is a hearing going on as we speak, and the Secretary of Energy is \ntalking to the committee about this report and his ideas for \nimplementation.\n  The recommendations are extremely interesting and extremely \nimportant. Task force recommendations encourage fuel diversity--\nsomething we clearly need--and to utilize all of our domestic resources \nrather than relying on a particular resource. We need to talk about \ncoal, which is now producing 52 percent of the electricity used in this \ncountry. Our reserves of coal are greater than probably any other \nfossil fuel. There is great opportunity for their use in the future.\n\n  There is also in this proposition, I think properly, a good deal of \neffort and money oriented towards continued developing technology and \nresearch in clean coal. I think that is something we ought to do.\n  There is also recognition and support for renewables, whether it is \nwind energy or solar energy or, in fact, hydro. We do that now. We have \nbeen working at that for some time. Frankly, renewables now produce \nonly about 1 percent of our energy requirements but, nevertheless, \nthere are opportunities for them to be a much larger part as we do \nresearch.\n  I come from the State of Wyoming. We have the highest coal production \nof any State and I think the largest resources of coal. We also have a \nconsiderable amount of wind and have some wind farms producing energy. \nProbably there will be a great deal more.\n  I remember, a number of years ago, a meeting in Casper, WY, on \nenergy. This was 10 or 15 years ago. A speaker--I think from Europe--\npointed out we have never run out of a fuel; we changed because we \nfound one that was more efficient or more effective. We didn't run out \nof wood. We started using coal. We didn't run out of coal; we moved on \nto other things. I am confident we will move on, whether it is to \nhydrogen or solar or whatever, but I think we will be looking in that \ndirection.\n  As we look at our automobiles and our travel plans for this holiday \nweekend, oil and gas has to be one of the things most important to us. \nThose volumes need to be improved. Our biggest problem at the moment is \nnot crude oil amounts; it is really refining. We are up to 98 percent \nof capacity. So we need to do some things in that area.\n  I mentioned hydro. Along with that clean energy source, of course, is \nnuclear. Interestingly enough, most people do not recognize about 20 \npercent of our electric generation right now is nuclear. It is the most \nclean source, certainly of electric generation. It has difficulties. \nOne of them is the waste, what to do with nuclear waste. We have been \ntrying to deal with that for some time. We have the question of \npermanent storage out at Yucca Mountain, NV. We have spent billions \ngetting into that place and have more to spend. We now find resistance \nfrom the State. They didn't resist spending the billions of dollars \nthere, I might add. In any event, we have to do something there, \nperhaps take advice from France and Scandinavia, where they recycle \nthis and have less waste than we do.\n  With Hydro, again, there are some paradoxes. Some of the \nenvironmental groups are critical if there is not enough emphasis on \nhydro but, interestingly enough, those are the same people who, a \ncouple of years ago, were talking about tearing down the dams, the ones \nthat generate the hydro. So there is always conflict in these things.\n  We have to take into account, on the economic end, environmental \nfactors. We need to find a way to produce more clean energy and more \nsecure energy in our future. So our strategy ought to be, and generally \nis here in this policy book, to repair and expand the Nation's \nantiquated infrastructure.\n  That is difficult. There is always a great deal of concern about \nelectric transmission lines, of course. I suppose nobody really wants \none in their backyard. On the other hand, if you are going to have \nelectricity in California, you have to have a transmission line to get \nit there. We need to find a way to do that more expediently. We need to \nfind a way to do that, frankly, with more respect for people's private \nproperty. The same with gas pipelines, we have to have an \ninfrastructure to do that.\n\n  We are still often dealing with outdated equipment, particularly in \nthe area of gasoline refineries. There have not been any new refineries \nbuilt for a very long time, so the ones we have, of course, are old. \nThere have been some rules from EPA that have made it difficult to \nupgrade refineries. They have the new source rule, which says if you \nmake it more efficient, or update the old refinery, you have to meet \nthe environmental standards of a new plant. That has discouraged \nupgrading the plants we have now.\n  Another thing we ought to be doing--and, again, it is in this \nreport--is conservation. That is a choice you and I have to make. There \nis no question but what we can conserve. Look around your house. There \nare lots of times when we can be using less electricity than we are. \nThe same is true, of course, with gasoline. We have to find more \nefficient use of this resource, and we can do that. I don't know if it \nalways has to be a legislative question. I think we have some personal \nresponsibility in that area of conservation.\n  Boost supply, of course, alternative sources, encourage new \ntechnology--those are things we can do and must do.\n  In the West, one of our greatest challenges is access to public lands \nand care for those public lands. In my State of Wyoming, about 50 \npercent of the State belongs to the Federal Government. In some States, \nit is even higher than that. I think Nevada is almost 86-percent \nfederally owned lands. So there are rules and regulations about access \nto those lands. Indeed, there should be. But the fact is, they are a \nresource that belongs to the American people and there ought to be an \nopportunity for access to these lands for all kinds of uses, whether it \nis hiking, hunting, grazing, mineral exploration. I think\n\n[[Page S5574]]\n\nwe can do that in a way that is consistent with preserving these \nresources. Indeed, we should.\n  We have been developing energy for a very long time in Wyoming. For \nthe most part, it has turned out quite well. We reclaim coal mines and \nthe land recovers. When they are through, the land probably is more \nproductive than it was before they started. You can see the deer and \nantelope come around to those places because there is more grass than \nthere was before. We can do that.\n  We have to recognize there are different kinds of public lands. There \nis a great deal of difference between a national park, which is limited \nin its uses, and should be--we are not going to produce energy in \nYellowstone National Park unless it is out of hot water or something; \nwe are not going to do that and should not.\n  Wilderness--wilderness is set aside for singular uses. But most of \nthe public land in Bureau of Land Management land that was never set \naside for anything. It was there. It was there after they closed down \nthe Homestead Act and these lands were unclaimed so they became Bureau \nof Land Management lands. They are available, in my view, and in most \ncases they are for multiple uses. We need to ensure that is happening.\n  However, since 1983, access to mineral reserves in the West has \ndeclined by about 65 percent. Less than 17 percent of the total mineral \nestate is leased as compared to 72 percent in 1983. I do not suggest we \nreturn to that, but we do have to take a look at accessibility. We have \nto take a look at good environmentally sound ways of exploring and \nextracting minerals. We can do that. The Bush-Cheney plan addresses \nthis problem. Not only how to do it, but it talks about renewables. It \ntalks bout the environment and issues we need to talk about.\n\n  We have a great deal to do, but we have some great opportunities to \ndo it. Here are a few of the things that are in the Bush-Cheney \nnational energy policy. We help consumers in the short run. We increase \nLIHEAP funding to $1.7 billion. LIHEAP is for low-income people whose \nhome energy bills went up. We double the weatherization funding, work \nwith Governors to encourage regional energy planning, and work with \nFEMA so the emergency agency can respond to energy emergencies.\n  There is a good deal of emphasis on conservation, increasing \nefficiency. Indeed, it is made a national priority in this book.\n  We need to expand DOE's appliance standards programs to make \nstandards higher. We need to take a look at the mileage standards on \nvehicles, and this plan provides incentives for fuel-efficient \ntechnologies. These things are all in this plan, and I think are a very \nimportant part of it.\n  We need to increase the supply of conventional fuels. We can do that. \nI know there is great controversy about ANWR. Whether or not we end up \nin ANWR is not the issue; the issue is whether there is access to those \nlands that should be available for exploration and production. There \nare a great many of those lands. We have already extensive gas \nproduction. We need to increase the infrastructure there and have a \nnatural gas pipeline; provide royalty relief for deep water and enhance \nthat recovery, as well as low production wells. We can do that which \nwould increase considerably production of energy here.\n  There are a lot of things to do. We need to extend renewables and \nalternative fuels. This is a good one. As I mentioned, it currently \nonly produces less than 2 percent--a little over 1 percent--of the \ntotal, but it has the potential to do a great deal more. And it is very \nclean energy. That is what a lot of people would like to do.\n\n  It streamlines the hydroelectric licensing process. It expands tax \ncredits, again, for the production of electricity from renewable \nsources.\n  We hear from environmentalists that all that is talked about is more \nproduction of oil. That is not true. This book contains all these \nareas, with a considerable amount of emphasis on conservation, and with \na considerable amount of emphasis on renewables. So we can do that.\n  Obviously, one of the difficult things to do is strengthening and \nincreasing the infrastructure so we can move energy. There is a good \ndeal of talk in my State, again, about mine mouth generation. It is \nvery efficient. But then you have to move it. You have to move it on a \ntransmission line or a gas pipeline. We can do that. I think we have \ndone some research to reduce the line loss that is in that kind of \ntransportation. But that is probably our most available source of \nelectric generation. It needs to be moved to where the market will be. \nWe can do that.\n  There needs to be a considerable amount of work done on refining. One \nhappy thought is that there is a surplus of gas that is beginning to \nbuild up. I think we see a leveling off of the price. I met with some \nrefiners the other day, and they say there is likely to be a turnaround \nhere, probably after this weekend. It will not be a great rush, but we \nwill see it at least not move up as it has in the past.\n  Finally, I am a strong proponent of the environment. I grew up in a \nplace right outside Yellowstone Park, where the environment is very \nclose. In our plan, as we look forward to where we want this country to \nbe in the next 20 years, in the next 50 years, we need a strong \neconomy. And if we want a strong economy, we need jobs.\n  We also need energy so we can provide for this economy and do the \nthings we need to do, which includes the military and military defense. \nAt the same time, we want to have an environment with a certain amount \nof open space protecting this environment so that we end up preserving \nthe mountains in Teton Park, so that we end up preserving the open \nspaces in Nevada, so that we end up preserving the trees and the \nmountains and the hills in Vermont because those are very close to all \nof us and very important.\n  So I think we have a great opportunity now. We have to move quickly \nbecause it is something that affects everyone. And it is starting to \naffect us now, of course.\n  There is always this question of needing to do something today. We \nneed to put in price caps. We need to do this. It is very difficult. \nObviously, price caps have not been an asset in terms of causing things \nto happen over the long term, to cause investments to take place so \nthat we do solve the problems.\n  We took oil out of SPR, out of storage last time, and it had no \noverall impact. So we are going to have to sit down, probably look for \nconservation in the short term, and take a look at what we can do with \ninfrastructure, with sources to develop our fuels for the future.\n  I thin we have a great opportunity to do that. We have guidelines for \ndoing it in President Bush's and Vice President Cheney's national \nenergy policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/24/senate-section/article/S5574-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5574-S5577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   VETERANS OPPORTUNITIES ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 801 \nand that the Senate then proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Chafee). Without objection, it is so \nordered. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 801) to amend title 38, United States Code, to \n     improve programs of educational assistance, to expand \n     programs of transition assistance and outreach to departing \n     servicemembers, veterans, and dependents, to increase burial \n     benefits, to provide for family coverage under \n     Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 790\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, Senators Specter and Rockefeller have an \namendment at the desk, and I ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming (Mr. Thomas), for Mr. Specter, for \n     himself and Mr. Rockefeller, proposes an amendment numbered \n     790.\n\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record under \n``Amendments Submitted and proposed.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe ``Veterans' Survivor Benefits Improvement Act of 2001,'' a measure \nwhich I\n\n[[Page S5575]]\n\nask be approved by the Senate as a substitute amendment to H.R. 801. \nH.R. 801 is a bill which was passed by the House of Representatives on \nMarch 27, 2001, and subsequently referred to the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs. In my capacity as Chairman of the Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, I am pleased to offer this amendment with my colleague, the \nRanking Member of the Committee, Senator Rockefeller.\n  In keeping with the spirit of the upcoming Memorial Day holiday--a \nday intended to memorialize the service of those who lost their lives \nwhile in service to the Nation--the Veterans' Survivor Benefits \nImprovements Act of 2001 would retroactively increase insurance \nbenefits provided to, and guarantee additional health coverage for, the \nsurvivors of service members killed in the line of duty. The Act would \nalso expand health care coverage to the spouses of veterans who have \npermanent and total disabilities due to military service, as well as \nthe spouses of veterans who have died as a result of wounds incurred in \nservice. Further, the Act extend life insurance benefits to service \nmembers' spouses and children, and would authorize, and direct, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to conduct outreach efforts to contact \nthese survivors, and other eligible dependents, to apprize them of the \nbenefits to which they are entitled. Finally, the Act would make \ntechnical improvements to Montgomery GI Bill education benefits, and \nmake other purely technical amendments to title 38, United States Code.\n  As part of the ``Floyd D. Spense National Defense Authorization Act \nfor Fiscal Year 2001'' (Public Law 106-398), Medicare-eligible military \nretirees and their spouses became eligible for lifetime health care \ncoverage under the Department of Defense (DOD) TRICARE program. Under \nthe new law, TRICARE acts as a ``Medigap'' policy, paying for those \nhealth care services, such as prescription drugs, not covered under \nMedicare. Prior to enactment of Public Law 106-398, military retirees \nlost TRICARE eligibility upon becoming eligible for Medicare.\n  Mr. President, we can do no less for the survivors of service members \nwho have died wearing our Nation's uniform than we have already done \nfor spouses of military retirees. Therefore, Section 3 of the Act--\nbuilding on legislation introduced by Senator Rockefeller (S. 564) and \nconsistent with the principles set out in the ``TRICARE-for-life'' \nprogram expansion for military retirees--would extend lifetime health \ncoverage under the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the VA \n(CHAMPVA) program. That program--similar to TRICARE--provides medical \nservices to the surviving spouses of service members who died while on \nactive duty, to the surviving spouses of veterans who died after \nservice from injuries sustained while on active duty, and to the \nspouses of veterans who have survived service but who had service-\nrelated injuries which are permanent and total in nature.\n  Under the Act--similar to provisions applicable under the TRICARE \nexpansion enacted in Public Law 106-398--CHAMPVA benefits will be \nextended to spouses even after they gain Medicare eligibility, and \nCHAMPVA will pay for what Medicare does not. Full CHAMPVA benefits will \nbe extended to eligible survivors who were eligible for Medicare on the \ndate of enactment, and for those survivors who became Medicare-eligible \nafter enactment, full CHAMPVA benefits will be extended upon enrollment \nin Medicare Part B.\n  As part of the ``Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act of \n2000'' (Public Law 106-419), signed into law on November 1, 2000, \nCongress authorized an increase, from $200,000 to $250,000, in the \nmaximum amount of Servicemembers Group Life Insurance (SGLI) coverage \navailable to participating service members. However, Congress did not \nmake the increased maximum death benefit effective until April 1, 2001. \nSadly, the Nation's Armed Forces have suffered a series of tragic \nlosses over the past several months. From the terrorist attack on the \nU.S.S. Cole on October 12, 2000, to the accidental bombing of our own \nservice members in Kuwait on March 12, 2001, many brave Americans have \nlost their lives in defense of freedom during the period between \nenactment and the effective date of these increased benefits. As a \nsymbol of gratitude to the survivors of those killed in the performance \nof duty, section 5 of the Act would allow retroactive application of \nthe increased SGLI amount for those service members who died in the \nperformance of duty between October 1, 2000, and March 31, 2001, and \nwho had the maximum amount of available SGLI coverage in effect at the \ntime of death. This would amount to a $50,000 payment for eligible \nbeneficiaries, a small token of thanks for a sacrifice so large. I \nthank my colleague from Virginia, Senator Warner, who authorized the \nlegislation (S. 546) from which this provision was derived.\n  Another provision in the Act would enhance SGLI benefits for the \nspouses and dependent children of active duty service members. The \nprovision would permit service members to purchase a maximum of \n$100,000 in SGLI coverage for their spouses and would extend $10,000 of \nlife insurance coverage automatically to their children. These added \nenhancements to the SGLI program are common features provided by many \ncommercial policies; they should be made available to our fighting men \nand women. A similar provision was approved by the Senate during the \n106th Congress, but was not acted upon by the House.\n  In order to ensure that veterans' family members are made aware of \nthe various VA benefits to which they are entitled, section 6 of the \nAct authorizes and instructs VA to conduct enhanced outreach efforts to \nveterans' spouses, surviving spouses, children, and dependent parents. \nThe Act also specifies that such efforts are to be undertaken with the \nuse of the internet, media, and veterans' publications to reach as wide \na beneficiary audience as possible. Awareness of available benefits is \ncritical if VA is to meet its statutory responsibilities.\n  Lastly, the Act makes several technical improvements to the \nMontgomery GI Bill (MGIB) education program. The first improvement \nwould clarify eligibility requirements for MGIB benefits. Current law, \nas amended under the ``Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement \nAct of 2000'' (Public Law 106-419), could be interpreted as requiring \nmore active duty service than is actually necessary to qualify for MGIB \nbenefits. The clarifying language removes any ambiguity as to the \nservice obligation required for eligibility.\n  A second improvement would change the method by which a veteran's \nMGIB entitlement is charged in cases where an active duty service \nmember uses a portion of his or her MGIB benefit entitlement during \nservice to supplement costs not covered under Tuition Assistance \nReimbursement programs run by the armed service branches. The new \nmethod would be simpler for VA to administer, easier for veterans to \nunderstand, and more beneficial for a veteran wishing to maximize his \nor her utilization of the MGIB benefit.\n  A third improvement would simplify administration of the new MGIB \n``buy-up'' opportunity created by the ``Veterans Benefits and Health \nCare Improvement Act of 2000'' (Public Law 106-419). Under that law, a \nservice member who contributes up to $600 while in service may receive \nan additional $150 per month in additional monthly MGIB benefits for a \ntotal of 36 months. The improvement would set minimum monthly in-\nservice contribution amounts of $20 and would limit the frequency of \ncontributions to once per month. DOD requested these modifications to \nensure the smooth and efficient operation of the ``buy-up'' program.\n  A fourth improvement would clarify and extend current provisions of \nlaw providing for the reimbursement of contributions made to secure \neligibility for MGIB benefits in cases where the service member has \ndied before he or she could utilize those benefits. Current law \nneglects to specify explicitly that the reimbursement provision applies \nin certain circumstances. This provision remedies that oversight.\n  Finally, a fifth improvement would clarify that service members who \nwish to convert from Veterans Educational Assistance Program (VEAP) \nbenefits to MGIB eligibility--an option made possible by a provision of \nthe ``Veterans Benefits and Health Care Improvement Act of 2000'' \n(Public Law 106-419)--need only contribute $2,700 to exercise that \noption. Due to a drafting error, current law could be read as requiring \nthat a\n\n[[Page S5576]]\n\nservicemember interested in converting pay $3,900, an additional \ncontribution amount that was not intended.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of the \n``Veterans' Survivor Benefits Improvement Act of 2001.'' In doing so, \nwe honor the memories of our fallen heroes by providing for those loved \nones left behind. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate is \nconsidering the Veterans' Survivor Benefits Improvements Act of 2001.\n  It is fitting that we will enact this bill in time to commemorate \nMemorial Day, the day we, as a nation, remember and pay tribute to the \nbrave members of the American military who died to ensure our freedom. \nThat is why the theme of the bill is especially appropriate. Although \nnot broad in scope, H.R. 801 attempts to improve the ways in which we \nrelate to the survivors of servicemembers and veterans, the families of \nthose who have sacrificed so much for their country.\n  I am enormously pleased that the bill before us contains my \nlegislation to extend health care protections to CHAMPVA beneficiaries \nover the age of 65.\n  Last year, Congress finally enacted legislation to restore the \npromise of providing lifetime health care to military retirees, by \nallowing military retirees to retain coverage through TRICARE, rather \nthan having to shift to Medicare at age 65. TRICARE for Life, as it is \nknown, was a great benefit for retirees, but CHAMPVA beneficiaries were \nnot included in this new benefit.\n  The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, CHAMPVA, provides health care coverage to several categories \nof individuals: Dependents of veterans who have been rated by VA as \nhaving a total and permanent disability; survivors of veterans who died \nfrom VA-rated service-connected conditions; and survivors of \nservicemembers who died in the line of duty. As such, CHAMPVA provides \na measure of security to a group of persons who have undeniably already \nsacrificed a great deal for our country. Under current law, CHAMPVA \nbeneficiaries lose their eligibility for coverage when they turn 65 and \nhave to shift to Medicare.\n  The TRICARE for Life law passed last year specifically allows \nmilitary retirees and their dependents to remain in the TRICARE program \nafter they turn age 65, as long as they are enrolled with Part B of \nMedicare. TRICARE will cover those expenses not covered under Medicare. \nit also provides for retail and mail-order pharmaceutical coverage for \nMedicare-eligible military retirees.\n  Title 38, United States Code, reflects the view that TRICARE and \nCHAMPVA should operate in similar ways. However, with the enactment of \nTRICARE for Life, that linkage was broken and a modification in law is \nneeded to make CHAMPVA consistent with TRICARE.\n  The provisions in this bill simply clarify that the CHAMPVA and \nTRICARE programs should continue to operate in a similar manner, with \nsimilar eligibility. This would mean that Medicare-eligible CHAMPVA \nbeneficiaries who enroll in Part B of Medicare would retain secondary \nCHAMPVA coverage and receive the same pharmacy benefit as CHAMPVA \nbeneficiaries who are under age 65.\n  The failure of Congress to enact prescription drug coverage under \nMedicare only magnifies the need to enact this CHAMPVA reform. \nIncredible advances in drug therapy, combined with staggering inflation \nin prescription drug costs, have made the need for affordable \nprescription drug coverage absolutely critical. CHAMPVA beneficiaries \nwho have sacrificed so much already should not be forced to forego \nother necessities of life to purchase needed prescription drugs.\n  I recently heard from a couple from Alderson, WV, who represent a \nclassic example of why this legislation is so necessary. The husband is \na veteran of the Korean war. They wrote to me when they learned that \nthe wife lost all of her CHAMPVA benefits when she turned 65. As a \nresult, she was forced to pay more than $300 per month for her diabetes \nand heart medications, in addition to all the other new costs for care \nnot covered by Medicare. With Social Security and disability \ncompensation as their only income, this couple is struggling to absorb \nthis enormous new expense in their modest budget. My bill would relive \nthem of that burden.\n  I thank the Gold Star Wives Association and the Consortium for \nCitizens with Disabilities for their dedication in bringing this issue \nto my attention. We must never forget that the costs of military \nservice are borne not by the servicemember alone, but by their families \nas well.\n  Section 4 of H.R. 801 addresses a shortcoming in the current \ninsurance coverage provided to servicemembers, the Servicemembers' \nGroup Life Insurance, SGLI. Currently, dependents, spouses and \nchildren, are not eligible for insurance coverage under the \nservicemember's policy and must secure outside commercial coverage. \nThis bill would extend coverage to dependents, giving great peace of \nmind to servicemembers with many other worries as they train and \nprepare for deployment, and especially when they are sent into harm's \nway.\n  Servicemembers can elect to participate in a VA-administered group \nlife insurance program, SGLI. Government insurance for servicemembers \nwas created in 1917 to provide insurance to soldiers going off to war, \nbecause they were unable to purchase commercial life insurance that \nwould cover death resulting from an act of war. That need still exists \ntoday.\n  Coverage is available in $10,000 increments up to a maximum of \n$250,000 unless the servicemember declines coverage or elects coverage \nat a reduced amount. Veterans can opt to continue VA insurance, VGLI, \nafter leaving the service, although generally the rates are not \nas competitive as commercial policies. As of last September, the SGLI \npremium was $.08 per month per $1,000 of coverage, and there was \n2,307,000 SGLI policies in force. However, there is no VA or DoD \nsponsored insurance for the families of these servicemembers, who are \noften overseas, which makes securing U.S. commercial insurance \ndifficult.\n\n  Last year, the Senate passed S. 1810, which would have provided an \nopportunity to provide similar coverage to spouses and children to \nSGLI-insured servicemembers. The House did not accept this provision in \nconference, and it was dropped from the final omnibus veterans bill.\n  This year, the House passed a provision that essentially mirrors last \nyear's Senate provision to allow coverage for dependents. Dependents' \ncoverage would be automatic unless it is declined. The amount of \ncoverage for a spouse would be equal to the coverage of the insured \nservicemember, up to a maximum of $100,000. The lives of a covered \nservicemember's dependent children would be insured for $10,000. \nPremiums are to be set by VA to cover the costs of providing the \ninsurance coverage.\n  Section 5 of H.R. 801 also addresses an apparently small discrepancy \nthat may make a great different in the lives of some servicemembers' \nsurvivors. In Public Law 106-419, Congress increased the maximum \ncoverage for servicemembers' group life insurance from $200,000 to \n$250,000, but delayed the effective date to the ``first day of the \nfirst month that begins more than 120 days after the date of the \nenactment of [this] Act.'' The bill was signed by the President on \nNovember 1, 2000.\n  However, between passage of the law in Congress and the prospective \nimplementation of the increase, the nation has been shocked by several \nhigh profile incidents resulting in loss of servicemembers' lives, such \nas the tragic bombing of the U.S.S. Cole.\n  This provision would make the increase retroactive back to October 1, \n2000, to cover those servicemembers who died in the line of duty in the \nlast several months. There are no costs associated with this provision, \nnor will there be any increase in premiums to the insured. It is simply \nthe right thing to do for our men and women in uniform.\n  Finally, section 6 of H.R. 801 would require VA to expand outreach \nefforts to veterans' dependents and survivors, by requiring the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs to ensure that the availability of \nservices and assistance for eligible dependents is made known through a\n\n[[Page S5577]]\n\nvariety of means, including the Internet, announcements in veterans' \npublications, and announcements to the media.\n  The most recent survey conducted by VA indicated that less than half \nof the veterans contacted were aware of certain benefits they were \nentitled to receive. For survivors of veterans, there is even a lower \nlevel of awareness. Currently, VA is mandated to perform outreach to \nservicemembers and veterans, but not to eligible dependents, a spouse, \nsurviving spouse, child, or dependent parent of a person who served on \nactive duty.\n  It is critical that we reach out to these survivors and dependents. \nThey should know that VA has many services to assist them in the \ndifficult time following a servicemember's death and in transitioning \nthrough that period with insurance, compensation, education, and health \ncare.\n  In closing, I urge all my colleagues to support H.R. 801 as a tribute \nto our deceased servicemembers, not just on the day we have selected to \nhonor them, but on every day throughout the year.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask unanimous consent the amendment be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 790) was agreed to.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I ask unanimous consent the bill be read a third time and \npassed, as amended, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nand that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 801), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard).

Mr. President, this is a historic day in the Senate. The \nannouncement this morning by Senator Jim Jeffords of Vermont that he is \ngoing to become an Independent and organize the Senate with the \nDemocratic caucus means a change in leadership in this important \ninstitution of government. It is not the first time that a Member of \nthe Senate has changed political parties. I reflected as I came to the \nfloor that there were four Members on the Republican side who were \nformerly Democrats at some point in their career. Senator Thurmond was \na Democrat from South Carolina and made a decision to become a \nRepublican, I believe, in the 1970s. Senator Phil Gramm was a \nDemocratic Congressman from Texas who changed his party allegiance and \nran for reelection before he was elected to the Senate as a Republican. \nSenator Ben Nighthorse Campbell switched parties from Democrat to \nRepublican and now sits on the Republican side. In addition, Senator \nRichard Shelby of Alabama made the same transition from Democrat to \nRepublican.\n  Of course, it is different in this circumstance in a 50/50 Senate. \nAny change of party has historic consequences. The decision of Senator \nJeffords to organize with the Democratic caucus means there will be a \nrather substantial change in terms of the leadership of the Senate.\n  For the last several months, since the election of President Bush, \nmany have given speeches and made statements about the need for \nbipartisanship. Now we will be put to the test if we have a Democrat-\norganized Senate, a Republican House, and, of course, a Republican in \nthe White House. Literally, the agenda for the country and the fate of \nour country will be in the hands of bipartisanship. I think we can rise \nto that challenge. I hope we will.\n  I have the greatest confidence in the man who will be the Democrat \nmajority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota. I have worked with him \nfor almost 20 years in public life, in both the House and the Senate. \nHe is not only very talented; he is an honest person, as hard working \nas any Member of this Chamber, and his word is good. President Bush, as \nwell as Speaker Hastert, I am sure, will find him to be an excellent \nperson with whom to work.\n  I also hope we can develop a common agenda, a bipartisan agenda for \nthe Senate. We have dealt with important budget and tax matters. There \nare other issues that need to be resolved, not just the 13 spending \nbills that fund our Federal Government but important issues which, \nfrankly, have not received the attention they deserve. One of those is \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights, to make certain the families across \nAmerica can have peace of mind that they can go to the best doctors and \nthe best hospitals and rely on medical decisions being made by medical \nprofessionals rather than by insurance company clerks. Too often, good \nmedical decisions are being overridden by those who work for insurance \ncompanies who have a profit motive in mind rather than the best \ninterests in a person's health. I think a Patients' Bill of Rights \nshould be high on our agenda.\n  Second, of course, we will move into the area of education. This is \nan area we were debating before the tax bill arrived, and that most \nAmericans agree is absolutely critical to the future of our country. We \nhave to make a commitment in our agenda to public education and the \neducation of all children across America. The schools of today face \nextraordinary challenges which my generation could not have even \nimagined. Children are coming to school now with greater problems than \nthey have had in the past, and we are expecting more out of the school \nin terms of training and education than we ever did in the past. We \nhave to make the investment in quality teachers and accountability, in \nsafe classrooms, in modern classrooms, and technology so our kids have \na fighting chance to lead America into the 21st century. That should be \nhigh on our list of priorities.\n\n  In addition to that, the President has asked us to look at questions \nrelated to energy. That is an important issue in my home State of \nIllinois where people have gone from recordbreaking heating bills \nbecause of the cost of natural gas to the recordbreaking cost for \ngasoline at the pump. It is important to not only find new sources of \nenergy that are environmentally sound and make certain they are \ndelivered to the people who need them but to also talk about \nconservation, a responsibility that is not only one we have as \nindividuals but as the Government. We have to do our part as consumers \nto buy more fuel-efficient vehicles. Government has to do its part to \nencourage Detroit to catch up with Japan which already has these duel-\nuse, duel-energy vehicles on the street that are in great demand. \nUnfortunately, Detroit has not come up with an alternative to compete. \nThey should.\n  In addition, we have to look at the marketplace for energy in \nAmerica. Some people think it is simply a supply-and-demand market. It \nis hard to imagine there is real competition of supply and demand when \nyou drive around Chicago or Springfield, IL, and see all of the prices \nat the gasoline stations going up in lockstep and coming down, \ntrickling down, in lockstep to believe there is real competition. It is \nhard to find anybody who is selling at a low price in order to entice \nconsumers.\n  Sadly, despite the high energy prices and the fact some say it is a \nmarket situation, these energy companies are having the highest profits \nin many years. It is one of the industries that can guess wrong for \nconsumer demand and make higher profits. That is something that has \noccurred.\n  We also need to address the question of the minimum wage for workers \nacross America. There was a tax bill passed yesterday that leaves \nbehind over 70 million Americans who do not get a reduction in their \ntax rate, those at the 15-percent rate, the lowest rate, and those are \nthe same people in many cases who are working for a minimum wage. We \nhave not touched the minimum wage in years in this country.\n  We have in my State over 400,000 people who go to work every single \nday at the minimum wage. If we are serious about giving mothers and \nfathers more time at home with their kids so they can have some leisure \ntime and an opportunity to work with their kids on education, taking a \nlook at the minimum wage is an important element so\n\n[[Page S5578]]\n\nthey don't have to work two or three jobs to try to make end's meet.\n  There is an important agenda ahead of us. I have touched on only a \nfew items I hope we will consider. Now that we have this change in \nleadership in the Senate, it is important we address it on a bipartisan \nbasis. It is a unique day in the history of the Senate. It is a unique \nchallenge to all to rise above partisanship and put our country first.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, pursuant to the provisions of S. Res. 8, I \nnow move to discharge the Judiciary Committee of the nomination of Ted \nOlson, to be Solicitor General of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the provisions of S. Res. 8, the motion \nis limited to 4 hours of debate, to be equally divided between the two \nleaders.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I note that the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Hatch, is here and ready to proceed. Therefore, I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, as you know, we have been trying to make \nsure that the Justice Department has its full complement of leaders \nbecause if there is a more important Department in this Government, I \ndon't know which one it is. There may be some that would rate equally \nbut that Department does more to help the people of this country than \nany other Department.\n  One of the most important jobs in that Department is the Solicitor \nGeneral's job. The Solicitor General is the attorney for the people. He \nis the attorney for the President. He is the attorney for the \nDepartment. He is the attorney who is to argue the constitutional \nissues. He is the attorney who really makes a difference in this \ncountry and who makes the primary arguments before the Supreme Court of \nthe United States of America.\n  In addition, he has a huge office with a lot of people working to \nmake sure this country legally is on its toes.\n  In the case of Ted Olson, I am very pleased that we are able to have \nthis motion up at this time. I am pleased that we have colleagues with \ngood faith on the other side who are willing to see that this is \nbrought to a vote today because we should not hold up the nomination \nfor the Solicitor General of the United States of America.\n  We have had all kinds of Solicitors General. We have had some who \nhave been very partisan but have been great Solicitors General, and we \nhave had some who have hardly been partisan at all and have been weak \nSolicitors General. We have had some not very partisan at all who have \nbeen great Solicitors General. You would have to make an analysis \nyourself to determine how your own personal philosophy fits.\n  But in terms of some great ones, there was Archibald Cox, who was \nnever known for conservative politics. He was not very partisan by most \nRepublicans' standards, but he turned out to be an excellent Solicitor \nGeneral of the United States. We could go on and on.\n  But let me just say this, that it is interesting to me that Ted Olson \nhas the support of some of the leading attorneys and law professors in \nthis country who have the reputation of being active Democrats.\n  Let me just mention a few. And I really respect these gentlemen for \nbeing willing to come to bat for Ted Olson. Laurence Tribe, the \nattorney for former Vice President Gore, in Bush v. Gore, on March 5, \n2001, said:\n\n       It surely cannot be that anyone who took that prevailing \n     view--\n\n  He is referring to Bush v. Gore--\n\n     and fought for it must on that account be opposed for the \n     position of Solicitor General. Because Ted Olson briefed and \n     argued his side of the case with intelligence, with insight, \n     and with integrity, his advocacy on the occasion of the \n     Florida election litigation, as profoundly as I disagree with \n     him on the merits, counts for me as a plus in this context, \n     not as a minus. If we set Bush v. Gore aside, what remains in \n     Ted's case is an undeniably distinguished career as an \n     obviously exceptional lawyer with an enormous breadth of \n     directly relevant experience.\n\n  I have known Laurence Tribe for a long time. I have a great deal of \nrespect for him. I do not always agree with him, but one time he asked \nme to review one of his books. Looking back on that review, I was a \nlittle tough on Larry Tribe to a degree. But I spent time reading his \nlatest hornbook just this last week, read it through from beginning to \nend--I think it was something like 1,200 pages--it was very difficult \nreading, and I have to say I came away after reading that hornbook with \na tremendous respect for the legal genius of Larry Tribe.\n  Although I disagree with a number of his interpretations of \nconstitutional law, there is no doubt about the genius and \neffectiveness of this man, and I think it is a tribute to him that he \nwas willing to stand up for Ted Olson and write it in a letter.\n  Walter Dellinger is the former Clinton Solicitor General. He is one \nof the great lawyers of this country. He is a liberal and some thought \nhe was extremely partisan, although I questioned that personally, just \nlike I question those who say Ted Olson is partisan. No question that \nWalter Dellinger is a very strong and positive Democrat, a very \naggressive Democrat. But he also is a man of great intelligence and \nintegrity.\n  On February 5, 2001, Mr. Dellinger said that when Olson served in the \nJustice Department as the head of the Office of Legal Counsel, he ``was \nviewed as someone who brought considerable integrity to the \ndecisionmaking.''\n  Virtually everybody who worked with Ted Olson at the Office of Legal \nCounsel--in fact, all that I know of--said he was a man of integrity \nwho called them the way he saw them, who abided by the law and did not \nallow partisan politics to enter into any thinking. There are two \noffices where partisan politics could work to the detriment of our \ncountry.\n  One is the Office of Legal Counsel, which he handled with \ndistinction, with ability, with fairness, in a nonpartisan way. The \nother is the Office of the Solicitor General, which I assert to this \nbody he will handle in the same nonpartisan way. He will certainly try \nto do what is constitutionally sound and right. And he will represent \nthe Congress of the United States in these battles. He may not always \nagree with the Congress of the United States when we are wrong, but you \ncan at least count on him doing what is right and trying to make the \nbest analysis and do what he should.\n  Now, Beth Nolan is a former Clinton White House counsel and Reagan \nDepartment of Justice, Office of Legal Counsel attorney. Beth is a \nconsiderable Democrat, and she is someone I respect. We have had our \ndifferences, but I have to say that she deserves respect. In a \nSeptember 25, 1987, letter signed by other Department of Justice \nlawyers she had this to say:\n\n\n[[Page S5579]]\n\n\n       We all hold Mr. Olson in a very high professional and \n     personal regard because we believe he made his decisions with \n     integrity after long and hard reflection. We cannot recall a \n     single instance in which Mr. Olson compromised his integrity \n     to serve the expedience of the Reagan administration.\n\n  That is high praise coming from Beth Nolan, a strong Democrat who has \nserved both in the White House Counsel's office and at Justice in the \noffice of Legal Counsel.\n  One of the most esteemed first amendment lawyers in the country, a \nstrong Democrat, one of the men I most respect with regard to first \namendment interpretations and first amendment constitutional \nchallenges, is Floyd Abrams--again, I submit, a liberal Democrat.\n  On March 4, 2001, he had this to say about Ted Olson:\n\n       I have known Ted since we worked together on a Supreme \n     Court case, Metro Media v. San Diego, 20 years ago. I have \n     always been impressed with his talent, his personal decency, \n     and his honor. He would serve with distinction as a Solicitor \n     General.\n\n  This is one of the greatest lawyers in the country, a man of \ndistinction himself who has great judgment, who is a leading trial \nlawyer in this country.\n  And that is what Floyd Abrams had to say about Ted Olson.\n  These are all Democrats. How about Harold Koh, former Clinton \nadministration Assistant Secretary of State. On February 28, 2001, he \nhad this to say:\n\n       Ted Olson is a lawyer of extremely high professional \n     integrity. In all of my dealings with him I have seen him \n     display high moral character and a very deep commitment to \n     unholding the rule of law.\n\n  That is high praise from a former Clinton administration high-level \nemployee. All of these are Democrats, leading Democrats, some partisan \nDemocrats, but who have found Ted Olson to be a man of honor and \nintegrity.\n  One of the greatest lawyers in the country is Robert Bennett, \nattorney for former President Clinton. Robert Bennett is known by \nvirtually everybody in this body for having been an independent counsel \nhimself, and having done his jobs with distinction. Nobody doubts he is \none of the greatest lawyers in this country. Nobody doubts that the two \nBennett brothers are personalities about as compelling as you can find.\n  Well, Robert Bennett happens to be a Democrat, and a leading \nDemocrat, one of the great attorneys in this country. And here is what \nthe attorney for former President Clinton had to say on May 15, 2001:\n\n       While I do not have any personal knowledge as to what role \n     if any Mr. Olson played in the Arkansas Project or the full \n     extent of his relationship with the American Spectator, what \n     I do know is that Ted Olson is a truth teller and you can \n     rely on his representations regarding these matters. He is a \n     man of great personal integrity and credibility and should be \n     confirmed.\n\n  I am submitting to this body that people of good will, that people \nwho want good government, people who want the best of the best in these \npositions at the Justice Department, ought to vote for Ted Olson \nregardless of their political affiliation, regardless of the fact that \nTed Olson handled Bush v. Gore and won both cases before the Supreme \nCourt--something that some of my colleagues bitterly resent. They \nshould vote for him regardless of the fact that, yes, he has been a \nstrong Republican--some think too partisan of a Republican. But he has \na reputation of being a person who calls them as he sees them, an \nhonest man of integrity. This is backed up by these wonderful \nDemocratic leaders at the legal bar, Laurence Tribe, Walter Dellinger, \nBeth Nolan, Floyd Abrams, Harold Koh, Robert Bennett, just to mention \nsix terrifically strong Democrats. If anybody wants to know, they ought \nto listen to people in the other party who have every reason to be \npartisan on nominations in some ways, but who are not allowing \npartisanship to enter into hurting the career or hurting the \nopportunity of Ted Olson to serve as Solicitor General.\n  I personally know Ted Olson. I have known him for many years. I have \nseen him courageously take on client after client across the \nideological spectrum and do a great job in each case for his clients. \nThis is an exceptional lawyer. He is one of the exceptional people in \nour country. He has the capacity and the ability to be a great, and I \nrepeat great, Solicitor General of the United States. He is respected \nby the Supreme Court before whom he has appeared at least 15 times.\n  And for those who might not remember, he was the attorney for George \nW. Bush in Bush v. Gore, and made two arguments before the Supreme \nCourt, both of which he handled with dexterity, with skill, with \ndecency, and with intelligence.\n  I have to say he deserves this job, he deserves not having people \nplay politics with this position. In my opinion, he will make a great \nSolicitor General of the United States. Let me just dispel some of the \nallegations surrounding this nomination and explain why I believe \nfurther delay is unwarranted.\n  First, there have been allegations that Mr. Olson has misled the \ncommittee concerning his involvement in something called the Arkansas \nProject and his representation of David Hale. Let me say that I \nlistened to my colleagues on the committee when the Washington Post \narticle first appeared, and delayed a vote, against my better judgment \nactually, until we weighed the allegations because it was fair to do \nso.\n  My colleagues wanted that, they deserved that, and we delayed it so \nwe could weigh those allegations. Then I took several days and \nextensively reviewed the testimony during the hearings, his answers to \nwritten questions, and his subsequent letter. I am convinced that those \nresponses showed no inconsistencies or evidence that Mr. Olson misled \nor was less than truthful to the committee anyway. Rather, they show \nhim to be forthright and honorable.\n  Although I have not seen any discrepancies or inconsistencies in Mr. \nOlson's testimony and answers, I have tried to respect the concerns of \nother members of this committee and joined the distinguished ranking \nDemocratic member in looking further into this matter and asking \nfurther clarifying questions from the Office of the Independent \nCounsel. We look into some insinuations against Mr. Olson concerning \nhis involvement with the Arkansas Project and his legal representation \nof David Hale.\n  In order to verify Mr. Olson's statements, the committee has had \naccess to a great volume of materials, including all relevant portions \nof the Shaheen Report that could be provided by law, letters from key \nindividuals involved with the Arkansas Project, and just yesterday, at \nSenator Leahy's request, a copy of David Hale's testimony at another \ntrial, and more information from the Office of Independent Counsel. \nThese together simply confirm Mr. Olson's statements and show that \nthere is no need for additional investigations.\n  Now, I would like to relate some of my findings in investigating the \nrecord and alleged inconsistencies. With regard to the Arkansas \nProject, Mr. Olson repeatedly stated that he learned about the project \nwhile he was a member of the board of directors and that he did not \nknow about it prior to his service on that board. He also consistently \nstated that he learned of the project in 1997. In an early response he \nstated that he became aware of it in ``1998, I believe.'' He later \nclarified that it was in 1997 and has consistently maintained that he \nlearned of the project in 1997. Each of the quotations used by Senator \nLeahy in his so-called ``summary of discrepancies'' confirms this fact \nand does not provide, despite the title of the document, any real \ndiscrepancies in Mr. Olson's testimony.\n  Key individuals intimately involved with the Arkansas Project have \nwritten letters to the committee confirming Mr. Olson's account of \nevents. These individuals include James Ring Adams, Steven Boynton, \nDouglas Cox, Terry Eastland, David Henderson, Michael Horowitz, \nWladyslaw Pleszczynski, and R. Emmett Tyrell.\n  From their different positions, each person corroborates the fact \nthat Mr. Olson was not involved with the origination or management of \nthe Arkansas Project. R. Emmett Tyrell, the editor-in-chief of the \nmagazine, stated unequivocally that Mr. Olson's statements with regard \nto his involvement with the project are ``accurate and thus truthful.''\n  Terry Eastland, former publisher of the American Spectator, conducted \na review of the project and stated he ``found no evidence that Mr. \nOlson was involved in the project's creation or its\n\n[[Page S5580]]\n\nconduct.'' Other letters make similar statements about Mr. Olson's lack \nof involvement before 1997. All of them are consistent with his \ntestimony, and they are not rebutted by any other credible evidence.\n  Mr. President, let me summarize for my colleagues. We have Mr. \nOlson's sworn testimony along with the statements of key players in the \nproject and numerous letters by Democrats and Republicans who praise \nMr. Olson's integrity and honesty, against the luke-warm allegations of \none former staffer who has recently backed away from his remarks. Even \nif Mr. Brock's factual allegations were true, they do not contradict \nMr. Olson's testimony.\n  Now the second possible allegation against Mr. Olson is that, \ncontrary to his testimony, he might have received payment for his \nrepresentation of David Hale. Mr. Olson has repeatedly answered \nquestions about this representation. He testified that he received no \nmoney for this representation, although he had expected to be paid.\n  Then in a letter of May 9, 2001, in response to further questions, he \nagain stated that he received no payments for his representation of \nDavid Hale. He wrote, ``Neither I nor my firm has been compensated by \nany other person or entity for those services--although I am not aware \nof any legal prohibition against another person or entity making such a \npayment.'' He have this report and I urge my colleagues to read it. I \nhave extra copies of this and other recent material with me, if any \ncolleague cares to further review it.\n  Now, I have seen no, let me repeat, no evidence suggesting this \ntestimony is not accurate. Mr. Olson responded to questions about these \nissues at his hearing and in three sets of written questions--each time \nhis answers have been clear and consistent.\n  But you don't just have to take Mr. Olson's word for it. His answers \nare clearly supported by the conclusions reached by Mr. Shaheen and \nreviewed independently by two respected retired federal judges. Under a \nprocess jointly approved by the Independent Counsel and Attorney \nGeneral Janet Reno, Mr. Shaheen was appointed to review the allegations \nconcerning alleged payments to David Hale.\n\n  In order to get all the facts, Mr. Shaheen was given authority to \nutilize a grand jury to compel production of evidence and testimony. In \naddition, another important element of this independent review process \nwas that the results of the investigation were to receive a final \nreview--not by the Independent Counsel or Attorney General Reno--but by \ntwo former federal judges Arlin Adams and Charles Renfrew. At the \nconclusion of their review, they issued a statement on July 27, 1999, \nin which they concurred with the conclusions of the Shaheen Report that \n``many of the allegations, suggestions and insinuations regarding the \ntendering and receipt of things of value were shown to be \nunsubstantiated or, in some cases, untrue.''\n  And if the Shaheen Report was not sufficient, Senator Leahy requested \na transcript of David Hale's testimony at the trial of Jim Guy Tucker \nand Jim and Susan McDougal, apparently because of accounts of that \ntestimony in Joe Conason and Gene Lyons' book, ``The Hunting of the \nPresident.'' The Office of the Independent Counsel has graciously made \nDavid Hale's trial transcript available to the committee in response to \nSenator Leahy's May 14, 2001 letter. A review of the transcript clearly \nshows further that Mr. Olson's testimony was accurate.\n  In the transcript, David Hale testified that Ted Olson was retained \nto represent him before a congressional committee. When asked, ``Who \npays Mr. Olson to represent you?'' Mr. Hale replied, ``I do.'' Mr. Hale \ndid not say that he or anyone on his behalf actually paid Mr. Olson.\n  The transcript of the trial is fully consistent with Mr. Olson's \ntestimony regarding the Hale representation--namely that he never \nreceived payment for the representation, that Mr. Hale intended to pay \nfor these services, and that no one else was responsible for the \npayments. Mr. Hale also testified that he first contacted Mr. Olson in \n1993 in connection with a possible congressional subpoena, and that \nOlson did represent him in 1995-1996. Mr. Olson wrote in his letter \n(May 9, 2001) that he was ``ultimately engaged by Mr. Hale and \nundertook that representation sometime in late 1995 or early 1996.''\n  Thus, with regard to David Hale, there is no evidence from any source \nthat Mr. Olson received payment for this representation. Mr. Olson's \ntestimony, David Hale's testimony, the Independent Counsel report, and \nreview of the matter by two former federal judges all confirm that Mr. \nOlson received no payment for his brief representation of David Hale. I \nshould also note that we send further questions on this matter to the \nOffice of the Independent Counsel, whose responses have been completely \nconsistent with Mr. Olson's testimony.\n  Again, let me say that I appreciated and respected the need for \nmembers of this committee to satisfy themselves about the integrity of \nexecutive branch nominees. That is why I had delayed an initial \ncommittee vote. The committee had ample opportunity to verify the \nstatements of Mr. Olson--no discrepancies have appeared, nor is there \nany credible evidence to refute any part of his testimony.\n  We have the statements of individuals involved with the Arkansas \nproject. Staff members of the committee have been able to view the \nShaheen report and the trial testimony of David Hale. I know that \ninternal information has been requested from the American Spectator \nmagazine, but I am concerned that such demands may tread on precious \nfirst amendment prerogatives of the press that we should all be careful \nto protect, even though it frustrates all of us from time to time. And \nI know that Democratic staff have interviewed Mr. Brock.\n  I believe that the extensive and decisive record before us shows that \nMr. Olson has been truthful and forthright on all counts.\n  The facts and conclusions I have just discussed--that there are no \ndiscrepancies between Ted Olson's statements and Senator Leahy's \nallegations--beg the question: What is all this fuss really about?\n  Perhaps it is because some may believe that Mr. Olson is too partisan \nto serve as the Solicitor General. Nothing could be further from the \ntruth. Ted Olson's career has been as broad as it has been deep. Mr. \nOlson has advocated for a wide variety of organizations and has \nassociated with people of many different political ideologies.\n  While it is true that Mr. Olson has performed legal work for the \nconservative American Spectator, to focus myopically on that is to \nignore Mr. Olson's distinguished work for many other media \norganizations including the New York Times, the Washington Post, Times-\nMirror, the Los Angeles Times, Dow Jones, LA magazine, NBC, ABC, CNN, \nFox, Time-Warner, Newsday, Metromedia, the Wall Street Journal, and \nNewsweek. What does this list show about Ted Olson? Is this the kind of \nclientele that would seek after a single-issue zealot? No way. This \nlist demonstrates clearly that smart people with a variety of views on \npublic matters turn to--and trust--Ted Olson.\n  Similarly, it is possible to pay too much attention to one person's \napparent dissonant opinion when there is a chorus of other harmonized \nvoices. Now, I have to concede that Ted Olson's supporters include a \nlot of well-known partisans.\n  For example, President Clinton's lawyer, Bob Bennett, said that ``Ted \nOlson is a truth-teller'' and he is ``confident that [Ted Olson] will \nobey and enforce the law with skill, integrity and impartiality.'' A \nsimilar sentiment was expressed by President Clinton's White House \nCounsel, Beth Nolan. And Vice President Al Gore's lawyer, Laurence \nTribe, has publically announced his support for Ted Olson's \nconfirmation as Solicitor General. Floyd Abrams, who has known Ted \nOlson for 20 years, and who is no right-wing conspirator, said he has \n``always been impressed with [Ted Olson's] talent, his personal decency \nand his honor.'' President Clinton's Assistant Secretary of State for \nDemocracy, Human Rights and Labor, Harold Koh, called Ted Olson ``a \nlawyer of extremely high professional integrity.'' And William Webster \nsaid Ted Olson is ``honest and trustworthy and he has my full trust.''\n  These names demonstrate that Ted Olson's experience, character and \nassociations have a tremendous breadth and depth. It is time for this \nbody to do the right thing and favorably vote to confirm Mr. Olson as \nthe Solicitor General.\n\n[[Page S5581]]\n\n  Mr. President, I would also like to make a few more brief comments on \nMr. Olson's nomination to set the record straight.\n  First, there has been repeated insinuation and accusation that Mr. \nOlson has misled the committee concerning his involvement with the so-\ncalled Arkansas Project and his representation of David Hale.\n  I, responding to concerns by some Democrats, listened and delayed the \nvote May 10 until the committee reviewed the record and weighted the \nallegations.\n  Since the Washington Post story broke, I and my staff have \nextensively reviewed Mr. Olson's testimony during his hearing, his \nanswers to writen questions, and his subsequent letters. I am convinced \nthat these responses show no inconsistencies or evidence that Mr. Olson \nmisled or was less than truthful to the committee in any way. Rather \nthey show him to be forthright and honest.\n   In order to verify Mr. Olson's statements, the committee has had \naccess to a great volume of materials, including all relevant portions \nof the Shaheen Report that could be provided by law, letters from key \nindividuals involved with the Arkansas Project, and at Senator Leahy's \nrequest, a copy of David Hale's testimony at another trial.\n  We have had access to more material from the Office of the \nIndependent Counsel, a number of questions that Senator Leahy and I \njointly asked that office and have received the responses. All of these \nmaterial, and the overwhelming evidence already on the record, continue \nto support Mr. Olson's veracity and complete candor before the \ncommittee. There are none, nor has there been, any specific evidence \nsupporting allegations against Mr. Olson.\n  Key individuals intimately involved with the Arkansas Project have \nwritten letters to the committee confirming Mr. Olson's account of \nevents. A host of respected and distinguished lawyers, judges, private \nand public figures who have worked with Ted Olson have written in and/\nor called the committee with their support for Mr. Olson's nomination \nand have vouched for his integrity and candor. These include the two \nrespected attorney's who argued against Mr. Olson in each of the two \nSupreme Court arguments in Bush v. Gore.\n  From their different positions, each person corroborates the fact \nthat Mr. Olson as not involved with the origination or management of \nthe Arkansas Project. R. Emmett Tyrell, the editor-in-chief of the \nmagazine, stated unequivocally that Mr. Olson's statements with regard \nto his involvement with the project are ``accurate and thus truthful.'' \nTerry Eastland, former publisher of the American Spectator, conducted a \nreview of the project and stated he ``found no evidence that Mr. Olson \nwas involved in the project's creation or its conduct.''\n  The only evidence that appears to have any possible conflict with Mr. \nOlson's sworn testimony and the written communications of the key \nplayers in the Arkansas Project comes from David Brock, a former writer \nfor the American Spectator, who in last Wednesday's New York Times, \nappeared to tone down his original account, saying, ``It was my \nunderstanding that all of the pieces dating back to 1994 that dealt \nwith investigating scandals pertaining to the Clintons, particularly \nthose that related to his time in Arkansas, were all under the Arkansas \nProject.'' He did not say that he was sure, or that Mr. Olson knew \nabout the project. Indeed, on a television program last Thursday \nevening, Mr. Brock said he had no specific recollection about speaking \nspecifically about the Arkansas Project in the presence of Mr. Olson.\n  Moreover, Mr. Brock apparently suggested to one paper that James Ring \nAdams would have a similar view, But Mr. Adams, one of the lead writers \nfor the project, wrote the committee that ``Mr. Olson had absolutely no \nrole in guiding my development of stories for the magazine or in \nmanaging my work.''\n\n  So, we have Mr. Olson's sworn testimony along with the statements of \nkey players in the project and numerous letters by Democrats and \nRepublicans who praise Mr. Olson's integrity and honesty, against the \nluke-warm allegations of one former staffer who has recently backed \naway from his remarks. Even if Mr. Brock's factual allegations were \ntrue, they do not contradict Mr. Olson's testimony.\n  The other allegation against Mr. Olson is that, contrary to his \ntestimony, he might have received payment for his representation of \nDavid Hale. He testified that he received no money for this \nrepresentation, although he had expected to be paid.\n  There is no evidence suggesting this testimony is not accurate. Mr. \nOlson responded to questions about these issues at his hearing and in \nthree sets of written questions--each time his answers have been clear \nand consistent.\n  His answers are clearly supported by the conclusions reached by Mr. \nShaheen and reviewed independently by two respected retired federal \njudges. Under a process jointly approved by the Independent Counsel and \nAttorney General Janet Reno, Mr. Shaheen was appointed to review the \nallegations concerning alleged payments to David Hale. At the \nconclusion of their review, they issued a statement noting ``many of \nthe allegations, suggestions and insinuations regarding the tendering \nand receipt of things of value were shown to be unsubstantiated or, in \nsome cases, untrue.'' I released the redacted portion of this Shaheen \nreport which relates to Mr. Olson to the public. Read the report and \nits conclusions--and the Independent Counsel's responses to the \nnumerous questions we have sent him regarding the report--it speaks for \nitself. This is not even a case revolving on the definition of what \n``is'' is. There simply is no ``there'' there.\n  As I have noted before, we are at a period where we need to rebut the \npublic's beliefs that we only engage in politics and don't care about \nthe merits of nominee qualifications. We need to gain the public's \ntrust in our government back. I am deeply concerned that what has been \nhappening here might appear to be an effort to paint Mr. Olson's \noccasional political involvement as the entirety of his career and \ncharacter, and as reported in the press, possibly as retribution for \nthe man who argued and won the Supreme Court case in Bush v. Gore.\n  Now, I don't think that that is true. I know my colleagues and \nrespect their views. But, I hope that we can begin debating the merits \nof this nomination and take all of the support and testimony on this \nman's obvious and overwhelming qualifications and his high integrity \ninto account as we determine our votes for his confirmation.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to judge the record. Judge the \nman for his qualifications and integrity. And I urge my colleagues to \nlisten to Lawrence Tribe, to David Boies, to read the Shaheen report \nand responses from the Office of the Independent Counsel, to listen to \nRobert Bennett--President Clinton's lawyer, to everyone who has worked \nwith and known Ted Olson. I urge you to vote to confirm our next \nSolicitor General.\n  Mr. President, let me say a few words about Mr. Olson's \nqualifications.\n  Ted Olson is one of the most qualified people ever nominated to be \nSolicitor General. He has had an impressive 35-year career as a \nlawyer--including four years as the Assistant Attorney general in \ncharge of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Policy under Ronald \nReagan.\n  The job of the Solicitor General is to make litigation policy \ndecisions. The Solicitor General represents the United States in all \ncases before the United States Supreme Court, and it is up to the \nSolicitor General to approve all appeals taken by the United States \nfrom adverse decisions in the lower federal courts. It is important to \nhave a skillful and competent advocate in that position.\n  Ted Olson has argued 15 cases in the U.S. Supreme Court. For most \nlawyers, a single Supreme Court argument would be considered the zenith \nof their career.\n  Ted Olson has a reputation for considering all viewpoints before \nmaking decisions. Walter Dellinger, who served as acting Solicitor \nGeneral under President Clinton, told the Washington Post that, ``If \nTed runs the SG's office the way he ran OLC, he will give deference to \nviews other than his own in making his final decision.''\n  Ted Olson's Supreme Court arguments concerned issues of great \nimportance to our country, including limits on excessive jury verdicts, \nthe effect of\n\n[[Page S5582]]\n\nstatutes of limitations, caps on punitive damages, the meaning of the \nFederal False Claims Act, racial and gender classifications, and \nwhether telecommunications companies must provide surveillance \ncapabilities to law enforcement agencies.\n  In addition to his role representing clients, Ted Olson has also \nworked to reform our civil justice system by writing and speaking on \nvarious topics, and he helped advise the government of Ukraine on \ndrafting a new Constitution in the mid-1990's.\n  Ted Olson also has superb academic qualifications. He graduated from \nthe Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California at \nBerkeley, where he earned a spot in the prestigious Order of the Coif \nand was a member of the law review.\n  I have no doubt that Ted Olson will prove to be one of the best \nSolicitor Generals our country has ever had. Given the extraordinary \nquality of the people who have held that post, this is no small \ncompliment.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nUtah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  If I can have the chairman's attention just for a moment, I assume we \nare not looking for specific times and speakers on this matter but will \ngo back and forth in the usual fashion as people arrive. Is that \nagreeable?\n  Mr. HATCH. That is agreeable. It is my understanding we have 4 hours \nequally divided. Mr. President, how much time have I used?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 29 minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, for anybody who wants to speak, following \nthe normal unofficial procedure, as people are available, we can go \nback and forth, side to side.\n  I note that I have no objection to proceeding to the motion to \ndischarge the nomination of Ted Olson to be Solicitor General. I \nmention this because I want Senators to understand. We had a divided \nvote in the committee, and with a divided vote in the committee, \nbecause of the procedures of the Senate, I am sure we could have either \nbottled it up for some time in committee or for some time here. I do \nnot want to do that. I think there should be a vote one way or the \nother. We have had too many examples in the past few years of \nnominations being bottled up that way.\n  On this one, I have concerns about Mr. Olson, but I am agreeable to \nhaving a vote up or down on his nomination. In fact, I say to my \nfriend, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nthat we also have before us the nominations of Mr. Dinh to be head of \nthe Office of Policy Development of the Justice Department and Mr. \nChertoff to be head of the Justice Department's Criminal Division. I am \nperfectly agreeable to rollcall votes on them, too, and will, to notify \nSenators, vote for them as I did in committee. Of course, that is \nsomething that has to be scheduled.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes.\n  Mr. HATCH. I, for one, am grateful because they are good people. I \nmissed what the Senator said. He wants to have a vote?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I want to have a vote on all three of these. I realize \nthat is entirely up to the body. I am perfectly willing to have votes \non all three of them. I point out, with respect to Mr. Dinh and Mr. \nChertoff, I voted for them in committee, even though, as everybody \nknows, they are very conservative Republicans and were heavily involved \nin a congressional investigation of the former President and of matters \nin Arkansas.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, I do not mean to keep \ninterrupting, I want to express my gratitude that he is willing to go \nhead with this and the Senate can vote on these nominees because I want \nto get that Justice Department--and I know the distinguished Senator \nfrom Vermont does also--up and running in the fullest sense we can. \nThat is my only interest in this, other than I do like all three of \nthese nominees. I thank my colleague. Forgive me for interrupting.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I appreciate the compliment.\n  Mr. Dinh and Mr. Chertoff were heavily involved in what I thought was \na misguided investigation, not by them but by Members of Congress who \nconducted it against former President Clinton and others in Arkansas. \nHowever, I believe they followed the directions of Members of Congress, \nmany of whom are no longer here, for a number of reasons. I will vote \nfor them and urge their confirmation when the time comes.\n\n  I mention this because there seems to be some in the public, some \namong what I call the more conservative editorialists, who think there \nis going to be some kind of payback on the Democrats' part for the \nnumber of nominees who were held up during the Clinton administration \nby the Republican majority. I think it makes far more sense to look at \nnominations one by one on the merits.\n  There is no question if the roles were reversed, if somebody of Mr. \nDinh's and Mr. Chertoff's background had been appointed by the last \nadministration following their investigations of Republican Presidents \nand my understanding and what I have seen in the last few years, they \nwould have been held up. I do not believe in doing that.\n  I told Attorney General Ashcroft--in fact, I told him earlier today-- \nwe intend to move these forward. We are moving forward most of the \nnominations in the Department of Justice a lot faster than they were 4 \nyears ago in the Clinton administration by the same Senate but under \ndifferent control.\n  I hope this may be an indication that things will move forward on \ntheir merits and not on partisanship. I urge all Senators who wish to \ndebate to come to the floor without delay and participate.\n  After the motion to discharge and proceed to the nomination, I expect \nthe Senate will proceed to vote promptly on the Olson nomination. I \nknow Senator Lott and Senator Daschle have been working toward that \ngoal. I agree with them on it.\n  I will, however, express, as every Senator has a right to express his \nor her feelings towards or against each of these three nomination \nnominees, why I will vote against Ted Olson.\n  The Solicitor General fills a unique position in our Government. The \nSolicitor General is not merely another legal advocate whose mission is \nto advance the narrow interests of a client or merely another advocate \nof the President's policies. The President has people appointed on his \nstaff or in his Cabinet to advance his policies. That is absolutely \nright. That is the way it should be. Whoever is President should have \nsomebody who can advance his positions no matter whether they are \npartisan or not, and there are positions provided--in fact, hundreds of \nmillions of dollars' worth of positions are provided to the President \nto do that.\n  The Solicitor General is different. The Solicitor General is not \nthere to advance the partisan position of anybody, including somebody \nwho is President. The Solicitor General is there to advance the \ninterests of the United States of America, of all of us--Republican, \nDemocrat, or Independent.\n  The Solicitor General must use his or her legal skills and judgments \nto higher purposes on behalf of the laws and the rights of all the \npeople of the United States.\n  The Solicitor General does not advance a Republican or Democratic or \nIndependent position. The Solicitor General advances the positions of \nthe United States of America. In fact, at his hearing, Mr. Olson \nacknowledged--and I will use his words:\n\n       The Solicitor General holds a unique position in our \n     government in that he has important responsibilities to all \n     three branches of our government. . . . And he is considered \n     an officer of the Supreme Court in that he regularly and with \n     scrupulous honesty must present to the Court arguments that \n     are carefully considered and mindful of the Court's role, \n     duty, and limited resources. As the most consistent advocate \n     before the Supreme Court, the Solicitor General and the \n     lawyers in that office have a special obligation to inform \n     the Court honestly and openly. The Solicitor General must be \n     an advocate, but he must take special care that the\n\n[[Page S5583]]\n\n     positions he advances before the Court are fairly presented. \n     As Professor Drew Days said to this committee during his \n     confirmation hearing 8 years ago, the Solicitor General has a \n     duty towards the Supreme Court of ``Absolute candor and fair \n     dealing.''\n\n  Those words of Ted Olson's are words that I totally agree with. He \nhas stated the position of the Solicitor General. He has stated it \naccurately. We must look at his record to see, having talked the talk, \nwhether he walked the walk.\n  The Senate must carefully review nominations to the position of \nSolicitor General to ensure the highest levels of independence and \nintegrity, as well as legal skills. Indeed, the Solicitor General is \nthe only government official who must be, according to the statute, \n``learned in the law.'' We appoint a lot of people, we confirm a lot of \npeople, but nothing in the law says they have to be ``learned in the \nlaw,'' but for the Solicitor General it says that. The Solicitor \nGeneral must argue with intellectual honesty before the Supreme Court \nand represent the interests of the Government and the American people \nfor the long term, and not just with an eye to short-term political \ngain.\n  The Senate must determine whether a nominee to the position of \nSolicitor General understands and is suited to this extraordinary role.\n  It is with the importance of this position in mind that I approached \nthe nomination of Ted Olson to serve as Solicitor General of the United \nStates. From my initial meeting with him in advance of the April 5, \n2001, hearing and thereafter, I have been assessing this nomination \nagainst the responsibilities of that important office.\n  At the outset, I raised with Mr. Olson my concern that his sharp \npartisanship over the last several years might not be something that he \ncould leave behind. After review of his testimony both orally and in \nanswers to written questions, I have become doubly concerned that Mr. \nOlson has not shown a willingness or ability to be sufficiently candid \nand forthcoming with the Senate so that I would have confidence in his \nabilities to carry out the responsibilities of the Solicitor General \nand be the voice of the United States before the United States Supreme \nCourt. In addition, I am concerned about other matters in his \nbackground.\n  I will lay out in a much more lengthy statement for the Record, my \nconcerns, but let me talk more briefly now about my concerns about Mr. \nOlson's candor before the committee about his involvement with the \nAmerican Spectator and the Arkansas Project. His initial responses to \nmy questions at his hearing prompted concern that the committee might \nnot have heard a candid and complete accounting from Mr. Olson.\n  Rather than respond directly and say all that he did do in connection \nwith those matters, Mr. Olson chose to respond by misdirection and say \nwhat he did not do. Frankly, in this case, and under the questions he \nwas asked, there is a world of difference between what he did not do \nand what he did do. He initially described his role as extremely \nlimited as a member of the board of directors of the American Spectator \nEducational Foundation and implied that he was involved only after the \nfact, when that board conducted a financial audit and terminated the \nArkansas Project activities in 1998.\n  Mr. Olson has modified his answers over time, his recollection has \nchanged, and he has conceded additional knowledge and involvement. His \ninitial minimizing of his role appears not to be consistent with the \nwhole story. Because his responses over time left significant questions \nand because of press accounts that contradicted the minimized role to \nwhich he initially admitted, I wanted to work with Senator Hatch before \nthe Judiciary Committee voted on this nomination to have the committee \nperform the bipartisan factual inquiry needed to set forth the facts \nand resolve all questions and concerns about Mr. Olson's answers.\n  I wanted to have us do the bipartisan fact finding that we always do \nwhen such issues come up.\n  Indeed, Senator Hatch postponed one committee vote on Mr. Olson's \nnomination on May 10 and admitted that ``some legitimate questions'' \nhave arisen and that ``legitimate issues'' were involved. He said that \nafter an article in the Washington Post indicated that Mr. Olson's role \nat American Spectator and the activities of the Arkansas Project were \nmore than just as a member of the board of directors in 1998 to which a \nfinancial audit was provided.\n  My friend from Utah did not agree to that limited inquiry before the \ncommittee voted on Mr. Olson's nomination, but with the constructive \nassistance of the leaders and their staff, we were able to make \nprogress over the last week.\n  Let me describe just a few of the discrepancies in Mr. Olson's \nevolving statements to this committee. These are discrepancies that \ngive me pause.\n  First, Mr. Olson has minimized his knowledge of the Arkansas Project \nand its activities through--well, word games and definitional ploys. At \nthe hearing, I asked him the direct question: ``Were you involved in \nthe so-called Arkansas Project at any time?'' Mr. Olson responded by \nsaying what he did not do, and with reference to his membership on the \nboard of directors:\n\n       As a member of the board of directors of the American \n     Spectator, I became aware of that. It has been alleged that I \n     was somehow involved in that so-called project. I was not \n     involved in the project in its origin or its management. . . \n     . I was on the board of the American Spectator later on when \n     the allegations about the project were simply that it did \n     exist.\n\n  A carefully crafted answer, like somebody spoiling or somebody \nmaneuvering a kayak through the rocks in a whitewater rapids.\n  Over the past several weeks and several rounds of questions, Mr. \nOlson has expanded his initial response to admit that he and his firm \nprovided legal services in connection with the matter, that he had \ndiscussions in social settings with those working on Arkansas Project \nmatters, and that he himself authored articles for the magazine paid \nfor out of Scaife's special Arkansas Project fund.\n  Mr. Olson and his supporters then began to engage in a word game over \nwhat the meaning of ``Arkansas Project'' is. His law partner Douglas \nCox told the Post that Olson testified that he, ``did not know there \nwas this special fund set up by Scaife to finance this Arkansas fact \nwork.''\n  That might have explained Mr. Olson's testimony if he had said that \nat the time he was writing the articles and giving legal advice and \ntalking about these matters with the staff, he had been unaware that \nthose conversations were in connection with what came to be known as \nthe Arkansas Project. In other words, writing and giving legal advice \nand talking about it, he didn't know what it was for. I think he is far \ntoo good a lawyer for that. But that is not what Mr. Olson testified. \nIn fact, he admitted that he became aware of the Arkansas Project at \nleast by 1998, and then changed that testimony to sometime in 1997.\n  He said he was a member of the board that received an audit of the \nScaife funds. So by 2001, his knowledge of the Arkansas Project and the \nfunding by Scaife was undeniable.\n  Second, evidence uncovered during the committee's limited bipartisan \ninquiry following the committee vote, raises serious question about \nwhether Mr. Olson accurately denied any role in the ``origin'' of the \nArkansas Project by failing to respond correctly to direct questions \nabout a meeting in his law office held in late December, 1993 when this \nproject was getting organized. Not in 2001 but 1993.\n  Third, Mr. Olson has apparently downplayed his involvement in the \ndevelopment and direction of Arkansas Project stories, perhaps to avoid \nany inconsistency with his initial representation to the committee that \nhe was not involved in the management of this project.\n  According to a published report in the Washington Post on May 20, \n2001, the report to which Senator Hatch referred when he indicated that \n``legitimate questions'' had been raised, David Brock told Post \nreporters that ``Olson attended a number of dinner meetings at the home \nof R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr., president and chairman of the Spectator, \nwhich were explicitly brainstorming sessions about the Arkansas \nProject.\n  While Mr. Olson refused to respond to this allegation, his law \npartner, Douglas Cox, who worked on the Spectator account, conceded \nthat Olson attended such dinners, but that ``did not mean that he was \naware of the scope of the Arkansas Project and the Scaife funding.''\n\n[[Page S5584]]\n\n  David Brock has also indicated that Mr. Olson was ``directly involved \nin the Arkansas Project, participating in discussions about possible \nstories and advising the magazine whether to publish one of its most \ncontroversial stories, about the death of Clinton White House deputy \ncounsel Vincent Foster.'' According to the account in the Post, Mr. \nOlson told Mr. Brock that, ``while he didn't place any stock in the \npiece, it was worth publishing because the role of the Spectator was to \nwrite Clinton scandal stories in hopes of `shaking scandals loose.' ''\n  That is an interesting position for a lawyer to take: Print a story \nyou know not to be true, hoping that by printing untruths you will \nsomehow bring forward truths. That is not what I was taught in law \nschool, certainly not in our legal ethics courses.\n  In his response to Senator Hatch, Mr. Olson did not deny Mr. Brock's \naccount head on.\n  Instead, he wrote that he told Mr. Brock that the article did not \nappear to be libelous or to raise any legal issues that would preclude \nits publication, and that he was not going to tell the editor-in-chief \nwhat should appear in the magazine.\n  The Washington Post also reported that others said that project story \nideas, legal issues involving the stories, and other directly related \nmatters were discussed with Mr. Olson by staff members and at dinner \nparties of Spectator staff and board members. The reaction from Mr. \nOlson's supporters was swift. On May 15, 2001, Chairman Hatch shared \nwith the committee a letter he obtained from the two men quoted denying \nthe specific words in the Post story but not denying that they talked \nto the Post reporters.\n  In a blatant effort to undermine Mr. Brock's powerful, first hand \nrecollection of Mr. Olson's participation in and contributions to the \nactivities of the Arkansas Project, Mr. Tyrrell also submitted a \nstatement that Mr. Brock was not a part of the Arkansas Project.\n  Mr. Brock, in reply, submitted strong contradictory evidence to the \nTyrrell statement and supplied the committee with multiple Arkansas \nProject expense reports, expense reports, I might note, which remain \nunrefuted and which Mr. Brock states, ``clearly show that I was \nreimbursed thousands of dollars by the Project for travel, office \nsupplies, postage, and the like.''\n  Taken as a whole, Mr. Olson was clearly involved and participating \nboth professionally and socially in the work of the American Spectator \nand its Arkansas Project. There is absolutely nothing illegal about \nthis involvement and participation, which makes me wonder, why not be \nforthcoming and honest about it? But it shows a larger role in these \nactivities than Mr. Olson initially portrayed.\n\n  Mr. Olson also minimized his role in the Arkansas Project and the \nAmerican Spectator by failing to give complete information about the \namount of remuneration he has received for his activities on their \nbehalf when he was first asked. He told us on April 19 that he was paid \nfrom $500 to $1,000 for his articles that appeared in the American \nSpectator magazine. Yet, we find out in the Washington Post on May 10 \nthat his firm was paid over $8,000 for work that was used in just one \nof those articles.\n  In addition, the Post reported that over $14,000 was paid to Mr. \nOlson's law firm and attributed to the Arkansas Project.\n  When he was asked during his hearing about an article he had \ncoauthored that was published under the pseudonym--I want to make sure \nI get this right--``Solitary, Poor, Nasty, Brutish and Short'' in the \nmagazine he did not indicate that ``the magazine hired [his] firm to \nprepare'' such materials and to perform legal research on the \ntheoretical criminal exposure of the President and Mrs. Clinton based \non press accounts of their conduct. I, for one, thought Mr. Olson had \ndefended his writings as matters of personal first amendment political \nexpression, an absolute right that he and all of us have. Certainly, I \nhad no idea from his testimony at his confirmation hearing that this \narticle was part of his and his firm's ongoing legal representation of \nAmerican Spectator Educational Foundation, that it was a commissioned \npiece of legal writing, paid for by a grant from conservative \nbillionaire Richard Mellon Scaife.\n  I am now left to wonder whether his article that was so critical of \nthe Attorney General and the Justice Department was as he described \nthem at his hearing the ``statements of a private citizen,'' or another \nrichly paid for political tract.\n  Again, he, like all of us, can write any kind of a political tract he \nwants. He, like all of us, can make statements critical of anybody he \nwants. He can even make outlandish charges. But let's be honest about \nwhat we have done when testifying under oath before the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  His supporters repeat the mantra that even if he was paid with \nArkansas Project funds, Mr. Olson would not have known that. What they \nleave out is a necessary qualifier ``at the time he received the \npayment.'' By the time he came to the committee and testified, in \nanswer to direct questions, he had become privy to the internal audit \nof the Arkansas Project. In fact, he says he became privy to that 3 \nyears ago in 1998. That audit and his knowledge as a board member of \nthe extent of the Arkansas Project that it revealed rendered Mr. \nOlson's testimony in April, 2001, less than complete.\n  Having now conceded his involvement in these matters, something he \ndid not do initially, the question arises: How extensive was that \ninvolvement as a lawyer? That is why I asked at least for production of \nhis firm's billing records for legal services rendered to the American \nSpectator, but I was stonewalled on that request. Mr. Olson asserted \nattorney-client privilege; but he did not offer to cooperate by \nproducing nonprivileged copies of those records.\n  Every lawyer in this place knows what is privileged and what is not, \nwhat falls under attorney-client privilege and what does not. And he \ndid not even want to produce those things that clearly fall outside the \nattorney-client privilege. In fact, such nonprivileged records have \nbeen produced in connection with other Government inquiries. Certainly \nin the last 6 years, documents have been produced by the bushel to the \nsame Judiciary Committee during other investigations.\n  As part of the bipartisan inquiry undertaken after the committee vote \non this nomination, we became aware of this fact. The independent \ncounsel review and report we were able to read--that was only a small \npart of it--indicates that requests were made to Mr. Olson and his law \nfirm for billing records for any client that had received Scaife \nfoundation grants between 1992 and 1998 in order to ascertain whether \nthere had ``been an indirect method to compensate (the law firm) for \nits unpaid representation of Hale.'' That would be David Hale.\n  Just as here, Mr. Olson's law firm initially invoked attorney-client \nprivilege but realized that ultimately they had to give what were \nnonprivileged billing records for Mr. Olson. And they showed Mr. \nOlson's representation of both David Hale and the American Spectator. \nBut the independent counsel was unable to forward those records in \nresponse to the bipartisan, joint request for them by Senator Hatch and \nmyself.\n  So Senator Hatch and I then sent a joint request to Mr. Olson's firm \nrequesting information about the total amount of fees paid by the \nAmerican Spectator to the firm. Remember, the implication was there \nreally was not anything there. Today, we were informed that the amount \npaid was not $500 to $1,000 per article the committee was first told by \nMr. Olson. Instead, it was for legal services performed $94,405.\n  I am not a bookkeeper. I was a middling math student. But like most \nVermonters, I can count. There is quite a bit of difference between \n$500 to $1,000 and $94,405.\n  Mr. Olson has tried to distance himself from the most controversial \naspects of the Arkansas Project in its activities to publicize \nallegations of wrongdoing about the Clintons in Arkansas. Mr. Olson \nstated that he ``represented the American Spectator in the performance \nof legal services from time to time beginning in 1994 * * * those legal \nservices were not for the purpose of conducting or assisting in the \nconduct of investigations of the Clintons.''\n  Yet, we find out he was paid over $8,000 to prepare a chart outlining \nthe Clintons' criminal exposure as research for a February 1994 article \nMr. Olson\n\n[[Page S5585]]\n\nco-authored against the Clintons entitled, ``Criminal laws Implicated \nby the Clinton Scandals: A partial list.''\n  Finally, Mr. Olson has testified he simply does not recall who \ncontacted him to represent David Hale.\n  This is a man who has as sharp a mind as just about anybody I have \nmet around here, but he does not recall who contacted him to represent \nDavid Hale, a central part of this whole inquiry.\n  So when I asked Mr. Olson at his April 5 hearing how he came to \nrepresent Mr. Hale he started by saying, ``[t]wo of [Hale's] then \nlawyers contacted me and asked . . .'' A few seconds later Mr. Olson \nsaid:\n\n       [o]ne of his lawyers contacted me--I can't recall the man's \n     name--and asked whether I would be available to represent Mr. \n     Hale in connection with that subpoena here in Washington, \n     D.C. They felt that they needed Washington counsel with some \n     experience dealing with a congressional investigation. I did \n     agree to do that. Mr. Hale and I met together.\n\n  Even in his May 9 letter, Mr. Olson asserts that he, ``cannot recall \nwhen [he] was first contacted about the possibility of representing Mr. \nHale.'' He indicates that he believes, ``that [he] was contacted by a \nperson or persons whose identities [he] cannot presently recall \nsometime before then regarding whether I might be willing to represent \nMr. Hale if he needed representation in Washington.''\n  The Washington Post reported that David Henderson said that he \nintroduced Hale to Olson. Interestingly, David Henderson apparently \nsigned a statement on May 14 indicating that in his view he broke no \nlaw while implementing the Arkansas Project. But what he does not say \nand what he does not deny is that he was the person who introduced \nDavid Hale to Mr. Olson.\n  The role that David Henderson played in introducing David Hale to Mr. \nOlson is apparently corroborated by several other witnesses who have \nspoken to the American Prospect in a story released today.\n  It now strikes me as strange that a man as capable as Mr. Olson with \nhis vast abilities of recall could not remember the name of David \nHenderson, if Mr. Henderson was, in fact, involved in setting up that \nrepresentation.\n  And it strikes me as doubly strange when the bipartisan inquiry \nconducted after the committee vote on this nomination uncovered \nevidence that Mr. Olson was able to recall who introduced him to David \nHale just a couple of years ago when he was asked the same question.\n  The Hale independent counsel report indicates that in 1998 Mr. Olson \ncould supply the name of the person who referred David Hale to him for \nlegal representation.\n  It leads one to easily wonder whether Mr. Olson's failure to recall \nthe name, David Henderson, in the year 2001 had something to do with \nhim not wanting to indicate the connection to such a central figure in \nthe Arkansas project.\n  Some would say, what importance is there to this? Does it really \nmatter whether Mr. Olson accurately and fully described his role in the \nAmerican Spectator and the Arkansas project? This nomination is for the \noffice of Solicitor General. It is important for two reasons, both of \nwhich go to the fitness of the nominee to serve as Solicitor General.\n  The principal question raised by the nomination of Mr. Olson to this \nparticular position--remember, this is a position that is supposed to \nbe nonpolitical, nonpartisan, representing all Americans of whatever \npolitical allegiance they have, or whether they have none. The question \nis whether his partisanship over the last several years in connection \nwith so many far-reaching anti-Clinton efforts to mark Mr. Olson as a \nthorough-going partisan who will not be able to check his partisan \npolitical instincts at the door to the Office of the Solicitor General.\n  Now, the reason I ask that is we have another nominee before us, \nMichael Chertoff, and we asked some of these same questions about \nMichael Chertoff. In that case, the questions were answered, the doubts \ndissipated. Instead of a 9-9 vote, Mr. Chertoff, had a rollcall vote in \ncommittee and it was unanimous; Republicans and Democrats across the \npolitical spectrum voted for him. There were Doubts, but the questions \nabout Mr. Chertoff disappeared. But the doubts and questions about Mr. \nOlson have grown over time.\n  Had Mr. Olson been straightforward with the committee, had he \nconceded the extent of his involvement in anti-Clinton activities and \ngiven the kinds of assurances that Mr. Chertoff did about his upcoming \nresponsibilities, I could very easily be supporting his confirmation.\n  Actually, when I first met with Mr. Olson, and even at his hearing \nbefore we had a chance to go through all of his answers and see the \nareas where they didn't show consistency, I had hoped and expected to \nbe supporting him. In fact, I remember saying to someone in my office \nat that time that I assumed I would be supporting him. I expected to be \nable to give him the benefit of the doubt.\n  In light of the deference I normally accord a President's executive \nbranch nominees, I fully expected to be voting for this nomination, \njust as I voted for so many by the five previous Presidents, both \nRepublican and Democrat.\n  In the wake of the hearing, the series of supplemental responses we \nhave received, and the unanswered questions now in the public record \nabout Mr. Olson's involvement in partisan activities like the Arkansas \nproject, I have many doubts.\n  We also have a question of candor and straightforwardness. I have not \nhad the sense from his hearing onward that Mr. Olson has been truly \nforthcoming with either me or with the committee. My sense is that for \nsome reason he chose from the outset to try to minimize his role in \nconnection with the activities of the American Spectator, that he has \nsought to characterize it in the most favorable possible light, that he \nhas sought to conclude for us rather than provide us with the facts and \nlet us conclude how to view his activities.\n  As I review the record and the initial nonresponsiveness, lack of \nrecall, corrections when confronted with specifics, I am left to wonder \nwhat happened to ``absolute candor and fair dealing,'' the touchstone \nthat Mr. Olson himself says is necessary for a Solicitor General. In \nconcluding my May 4, 2001, letter to Mr. Olson, I noted:\n\n       The credibility of the person appointed to be the Solicitor \n     General is of paramount importance. When arguing in front of \n     the Supreme Court on behalf of the United States Government, \n     the Solicitor General is expected to come forward with both \n     the strengths and weaknesses of the case, to inform the Court \n     of things it might not otherwise know, and to be honest in \n     all his or her dealings with the Court. I expect that same \n     responsiveness and cooperation from nominees before this \n     Committee.\n\n  My expectation had been to support him. Please understand, this is \nnot the role of a lawyer advocate in our legal system. I have been an \nadvocate of the court, both at the trial level and at the appellate \nlevel. I have been there both for the prosecution and for the defense. \nIn private practice, I was there both for the plaintiffs and \ndefendants. You fight like mad. You make as strong a case for your \nclient as you can. That is fine.\n  The Solicitor General is different. The Solicitor General is \nsometimes referred to as the tenth justice. He is expected to tell the \nCourt these are the strengths of my case, but let me tell you also \nwhere the weaknesses are of my case. If a matter is left out, or there \nmight be a weakness in the case, he is duty-bound to bring it forward \nto the Court's knowledge because, if confirmed, Mr. Olson is not a \nlawyer advocate for just one client because that client is the United \nStates of America--all 270 million of us. I want to be sure that our \nNation's top lawyer will see the truth and speak the truth fully to the \nSupreme Court and represent all of our best interests in the matters \nover which the Solicitor General exercises public authority.\n  I have confidence that Mr. Olson is an extremely capable lawyer. Of \ncourse, I do. Do I have confidence that he can set aside partisanship \nto thoroughly and evenhandedly represent the United States of America \nbefore the Supreme Court? I do not have such confidence, and I cannot \nvote for him.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains for the Senator from Vermont?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 76 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Solicitor General fills a unique \nposition in our Government. The Solicitor General is not merely another \nlegal advocate whose mission is to advance the narrow interests of a \nclient, or merely another advocate of his President's policies. The \nSolicitor General is much more\n\n[[Page S5586]]\n\nthan that. The Solicitor General must use his or her legal skills and \njudgment for higher purposes on behalf of the law and the rights of all \nthe people of the United States.\n  At his hearing, Mr. Olson acknowledged that:\n\n       The Solicitor General holds a unique position in our \n     Government in that he has important responsibilities to all \n     three branches of our Government. . . . And he is considered \n     an officer of the Supreme Court in that he regularly and with \n     scrupulous honesty must present to the Court arguments that \n     are carefully considered and mindful of the Court's role, \n     duty, and limited resources. As the most consistent advocate \n     before the Supreme Court, the Solicitor General and the \n     lawyers in that office have a special obligation to inform \n     the Court honestly and openly. The Solicitor General must be \n     an advocate, but he must take special care that the positions \n     he advances before the Court are fairly presented. As \n     Professor Drew Days said to this committee during his \n     confirmation hearing 8 years ago, the Solicitor General has a \n     duty towards the Supreme Court of ``absolute candor and fair \n     dealing.''\n\n  Republicans and Democrats have carefully reviewed nominations to the \nposition of Solicitor General to ensure the highest levels of \nindependence and integrity, as well as legal skills. Indeed, the \nSolicitor General is the only government official who must be, \naccording to the statute, ``learned in the law.'' The Solicitor General \nmust argue with intellectual honesty before the Supreme Court and \nrepresent the interests of the Government and the American people for \nthe long term, and not just with an eye to short-term political gain. I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a recent article by \nProfessor Lincoln Caplan on the role of the Solicitor General.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, May 18, 2001]\n\n                The President's Lawyer, and the Court's\n\n                          (By Lincoln Caplan)\n\n       New Haven.--The job of solicitor general is one of the most \n     eminent in American law. Part advocate, the S. G. as he is \n     called, represents the United States before the Supreme \n     Court, where the federal government is involved in about two-\n     thirds of all cases decided on the merits (as opposed to \n     procedural grounds). Part judge, he chooses when the \n     government should appeal a case it has lost in a lower court, \n     file a friend-of-the-court brief, or defend an act of \n     Congress. Most S.G.'s have influenced rulings in landmark \n     cases; many have become judges; four have risen to the \n     Supreme Court. Yet for most of this tiny office's history \n     since it was created in 1870, the S.G. drew little public or \n     even scholarly attention.\n       Today, however, the nomination of Theodore Olson to be S.G. \n     is headline news, as is evident from the attention to the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee's 9-9 vote on it yesterday, a \n     split along party lines. In the past 40 years, the courts \n     have become forums for resolving social questions, and the \n     docket of the Supreme Court has become defined by the most \n     divisive issues. During the past 15 years, especially, as the \n     line between law and politics has been increasingly hard to \n     draw, the choice of a solicitor general has become more \n     important politically than that of any legal figure except \n     for the attorney general or a Supreme Court justice.\n       The choice of Mr. Olson makes this point sensationally \n     because his legal accomplishments are so marked by ideology. \n     As a young Justice Department official under Ronald Reagan, \n     he made his name as an adamant defender against Democrats in \n     Congress who were trying to probe a Republican environmental \n     scandal. He has litigated matters like a major anti-\n     affirmative-action case in Texas, brought by conservative \n     activists to overturn liberal precedents. He has served on \n     the board of the conservative American Spectator magazine, \n     for which he wrote biting, anonymous criticism of Bill and \n     Hillary Clinton. He has helped lead the Federal Society, a \n     conservative legal organization that is now a formidable \n     force in the Bush Administration. Most significantly, he was \n     the winning attorney in the Supreme Court case of Bush v. \n     Gore. During Mr. Olson's Senate confirmation hearing, Richard \n     Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, said to him, ``I can't find any \n     parallel in history of anyone who was as actively involved in \n     politics as you and went on to become solicitor general.''\n       For the S.G.'s office, the Olson nomination frames a debate \n     that was sparked during the Reagan years and remains \n     undecided.\n       The traditional view holds that the solicitor general has a \n     unique role in American law and functions as ``the 10th \n     justice.'' Justice Lewis Powell, for example, argued that the \n     S.G. has a ``dual responsibility''--to represent the \n     president's administration but also to help the Supreme Court \n     develop the law in ways that serve the long-term interests of \n     the United States. (To some experts, the S.G.'s duty to \n     defend federal statutes amounts to a third responsibility, to \n     Congress.) Rex Lee, the first solicitor general in the Reagan \n     administration, was an unequivocal conservative. Yet he was \n     forced to quit by colleagues who thought he was too \n     restrained in his advocacy of the president's social agenda. \n     Famously, he said that it would have been wrong for him to \n     ``press the administration's policies at every turn and \n     announce true conservative principles through the pages of my \n     briefs.'' He was, he stated, ``the solicitor general, not \n     the pamphleteer general.''\n       A more recent view is that the S. G. should act as a \n     partisan advocate for policies of the president, not as the \n     legal conscience of the government. Rather than defending a \n     position of independence within the administration, Mr. Lee's \n     successor, Charles Fried, told the Senate that ``it would be \n     peevish and inappropriate for the solicitor general to be \n     anything but cheerful'' while supporting the views and \n     interests of the president who appointed him.\n       The latter outlook is much easier to defend. The separation \n     of powers among the three branches of government makes it \n     simplest to regard the solicitor general as a spokesman for \n     the executive branch: the concept of a dual responsibility \n     (or a triple one) confounds the notion of checks and \n     balances.\n       Yet for decades the former outlook prevailed, and it is \n     supported in the only official statement about the S. G.'s \n     role, issued in 1977 by the Justice Department. The Supreme \n     Court has bestowed on the solicitor general a special \n     status--seeking the S. G.'s advice in many cases where the \n     government isn't even a party. And the S. G. has reciprocated \n     by fulfilling a special role in court. If a private lawyer \n     wins a case he thinks he should have lost, he accepts his \n     victory in judicious silence. But when the solicitor general \n     prevails on grounds that he considers unjust (for example, \n     when evidence supporting a criminal verdict is slight), he \n     may ``confess error'' and recommend that the Supreme Court \n     overturn the decision. To Archibald Cox, one of the country's \n     admired S. G.'s, surrendering victory in some cases helps \n     justify the reliance that the Supreme Court places on the \n     solicitor general: this practice demonstrates that the \n     solicitor general's approach to arguing the government \n     position is likely to be developed with the nation's long-\n     term interests in mind.\n       Both views of the role require candor in the S. G. That's \n     why last week the Senate Judiciary Committee postponed its \n     vote on Mr. Olson after reports surfaced that he had given \n     misleading testimony, during his confirmation hearing, about \n     his role in a project run by The American Spectator to find \n     damaging information about the activities of the Clintons in \n     Arkansas. The question of misleading testimony is reminiscent \n     of a rebuke to Mr. Olson by an independent counsel who \n     investigated whether he had lied to Congress in testimony \n     during his days as a Reagan defender. While ``literally \n     true,'' the counsel stated, that testimony was ``potentially \n     misleading.''\n       Whether he is approved as solicitor general by the full \n     Senate or the Bush administration must choose someone else \n     for the post, a deeper question endures: Is it now acceptable \n     to define the job as that of an outright partisan? Or should \n     the S. G. remain an advocate for the nation's long-term \n     interests whose duty to the rule of law goes beyond \n     allegiance to the political views of the administration?\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senate must determine whether a nominee to the \nposition of Solicitor General understands and is suited to this \nextraordinary role. From Benjamin Bristow in 1870, to William Howard \nTaft and Charles Evans Hughes, Jr., from Robert Jackson to Archibald \nCox, Thurgood Marshall and Erwin Griswold, we have had extraordinary \npeople serve this country as our Solicitors General. It is with the \nimportance of this position in mind that I approached the nomination of \nTed Olson to serve as Solicitor General of the United States. From my \ninitial meeting with him in advance of the April 5, 2001, hearing and \nthereafter, I have been assessing this nomination against the \nresponsibilities of that important office.\n  Initial Concerns. At the outset, I raised with Mr. Olson my concern \nthat his sharp partisanship over the last several years might not be \nsomething that he could leave behind. After review of his testimony \nboth orally and in answers to written questions, I have become doubly \nconcerned that Mr. Olson has not shown a willingness or ability to be \nsufficiently candid and forthcoming with the Senate so that I would \nhave confidence in his abilities to carry out the responsibilities of \nthe Solicitor General and be the voice of the United States before the \nUnited States Supreme Court. In addition, I am concerned about other \nmatters in his background.\n  I will detail below the source of my concerns about Mr. Olson's \ncandor before the Committee about his involvement with the American \nSpectator and the ``Arkansas Project.'' His initial responses to my \nquestions at his hearing prompted concern that the Committee might not \nhave heard a candid and complete accounting from Mr. Olson. Rather than \nrespond directly and say all that he did do in connection with\n\n[[Page S5587]]\n\nthose matters, Mr. Olson chose to respond by misdirection and say what \nhe did not do. He initially described his role as extremely limited as \na member of the Board of Directors of the American Spectator \nEducational Foundation and implied that he was involved only after the \nfact, when that Board conducted a financial audit and terminated the \n``Arkansas Project'' activities in 1998.\n  Need for Committee Inquiry. Mr. Olson has modified his answers over \ntime, his recollection has changed, and he has conceded additional \nknowledge and involvement. His initial minimizing of his role appears \nnot be consistent with the whole story. Because his responses over time \nleft significant questions and because of press accounts that \ncontradicted the minimized role to which he initially admitted, I \nwanted to work with Senator Hatch before the Judiciary Committee voted \non this nomination to have the Committee perform the bipartisan factual \ninquiry needed to set forth the facts and resolve all questions and \nconcerns about Mr. Olson's answers.\n  Indeed, Senator Hatch postponed one Committee vote on Mr. Olson's \nnomination on May 10 and admitted that ``some legitimate questions'' \nhave arisen and that ``legitimate issues'' were involved. He said that \nafter a May 10 article in the Washington Post indicated that Mr. \nOlson's role at American Spectator and the activities of the ``Arkansas \nProject'' were more than just as a member of the Board of Directors in \n1998 to which a financial audit was provided.\n  When I did not hear from Senator Hatch about how he wished to proceed \nto resolve those legitimate questions, I sent him a letter on May 12 \nproposing a course of action to avoid any undue delay. After I spend my \nproposal, Senator Hatch and I talked about it. He said he would be \ngetting back to me and I held out hope that we would be able to proceed \nin a fair and bipartisan way to get to the facts and let all Members of \nthe Committee make their own assessment before they voted upon the \nnomination.\n  Instead, Senator Hatch was apparently just waiting for a letter from \nMr. Olson, which arrived accompanied by short, solicited statements \nfrom a few selected supporters so that he could unilaterally declare \nthe matter closed. None of these statements could serve as a substitute \nfor the Committee doing its job, and, instead of playing catch-up to \nthe press, exercising the due diligence that the American people expect \nfrom the Judiciary Committee in our review of a nominee for a position \nsometimes called the ``Tenth Supreme Court Justice.'' In essence, the \nquestion I wished to examine was whether Mr. Olson fully informed the \nCommittee in response to direct questions about his role in the \nAmerican Spectator and the ``Arkansas Project.'' This was never a \nquestion of whether there was illegal conduct.\n  Committee Vote. Rather than proceed in a bipartisan way to establish \nthe factual record needed to evaluate Mr. Olson's characterization of \nhis activities, Senator Hatch rejected even an inquiry of limited \nduration that would have involved jointly interviewing seven \nindividuals, who had already been quoted or referred to by the press, \nwith contemporaneous knowledge from the time in question, and gathering \nrelevant background documents, which had also been referred to in the \npress. He pressed forward with a vote in Committee on this nomination \nthat resulted in a 9-9 tie vote.\n  While usually a nomination on such a vote would not be reported to \nthe Senate, circumstances have changed that prompt me to give my \nconsent for Mr. Olson's nomination to be considered. With the \nconstructive assistance of both Leaders and their staffs, we were able \nover the past week to conduct a limited, bipartisan inquiry on the \nmatters of concern raised by Mr. Olson's responses to the Committee.\n  Limited Bipartisan Inquiry: Following the 9-9 vote on this nomination \nin the Judiciary Committee on May 17, 2001, Senator Hatch and I \nreleased a joint statement the next day indicating that we were \ndiscussing how to move forward on the nomination and to address \nspecific concerns that Members might have prior to the confirmation \nvote. As part of this inquiry, Committee staff reviewed, on a \nbipartisan basis, a heavily-redacted version of the report of the \nOffice of Special Review (OSR), prepared by Michael Shaheen and May 21, \n2001 responses by Independent Counsel Robert W. Ray, including to \nquestions posed jointly by Senators Hatch and me. One of these letters \nis in response to a query from Senator Hatch sent unilaterally and \nwithout notice to me. On May 22, Senator Hatch and I jointly released \nfor review by all the members of the Senate the two May 21 letters \nreceived from Mr. Ray and the redacted OSR report--with additional \nredactions to remove the names of specific individuals other than the \nnominee.\n  In addition, Senator Hatch released a May 22 letter to colleagues \nthat included 71-pages of American Spectator-related records, which \nwere anonymously delivered to my Judiciary Committee and which shed \nlight on how the ``Arkansas Project'' came about. I should note that \nwithin minutes of discovery of these documents, copies were made and \ndelivered to Senator Hatch's Judiciary Committee office.\n  Finally, the Committee staff made efforts to conduct an interview of \nRonald Burr, the former publisher of the American Spectator and a key \nwitness to the events in question. In fact, Mr. Burr was the person at \nthe magazine instrumental in obtaining the grant funds from \nconservative billionaire Richard Mellon Scaife. Among the anonymous-\nsource documents released by Senator Hatch is a December 2, 1993 letter \nfrom Richard M. Scaife to R. Emmett Tyrrell, as President and Chairman \nof the American Spectator Educational Foundation, stating the ``[t]his \ngrant is in response to Ron Burr's October 13, 1993 letter and various \nconversations with us.'' In addition, Mr. Burr was the person to whom \nMr. Olson sent his February 18, 1994 letter confirming the terms of his \nrepresentation of the American Spectator and his January 30, 1996 \nletter confirming his acceptance of a membership on the board of the \nAmerican Spectator Educational Foundation. Unfortunately, Committee \nstaff were unable to speak to Mr. Burr, despite his willingness to do \nso because the American Spectator refused to release him from the \nconfidentiality provision in his severance agreement for purposes of \nMr. Burr's cooperation with the Committee's inquiry.\n\n  Contradictions and Discrepancies. Let me describe just a few of the \ndiscrepancies in Mr. Olson's evolving statements to this Committee. \nThese are discrepancies that give me pause.\n  First, Mr. Olson has minimized his knowledge of the ``Arkansas \nProject'' and its activities through word games and definitional ploys. \nAt the hearing, I asked him the direct question: ``Were you involved in \nthe so-called Arkansas Project at any time?'' Mr. Olson responded by \nsaying what he did not do, and with reference to his membership on the \nBoard of Directors: ``As a member of the board of directors of the \nAmerican Spectator, I became aware of that. It has been alleged that I \nwas somehow involved in that so-called project. I was not involved in \nthe project in its origin or its management. . . . I was on the board \nof the American Spectator later on when the allegations about the \nproject were simply that it did exist.'' (Tr. at pp. 200-01).\n  Why is there reason to suspect that Mr. Olson's role was not limited \nto that of a Member of the Board to which a financial audit was \nprovided in 1998? A good deal of the basis is provided by subsequent \nanswers provided by Mr. Olson himself. In April, 2001, his testimony \nwas initially that he was not involved, except as a Member of the \nBoard. Over the past several weeks and several rounds of questions, Mr. \nOlson has expanded his initial response to admit that he and his firm \nprovided legal services in connection with the matter, that he had \ndiscussions in ``social'' settings with those working on ``Arkansas \nProject'' matters, and that he himself authored articles for the \nmagazine paid for out of Scaife's special ``Arkansas Project'' fund.\n  Compare, for example, Mr. Olson's initial response with his \nsubsequent responses in which he modified his original answer. In his \nMay 9, 2001 letter to me, he stated: ``First, I will address again your \nquestions concerning my involvement in the `Arkansas Project.' My only \ninvolvement in what has been characterized as the `Arkansas Project' \nwas in connection with my service to\n\n[[Page S5588]]\n\nthe Foundation as a lawyer and member of its Board of Directors.'' \n[Underlining added for emphasis.] Mr. Olson initially left out any \nreference to his role a lawyer.\n  Mr. Olson and his supporters then began to engage in a word game over \nwhat the meaning of ``Arkansas Project'' is. His law partner Douglas \nCox told the Post that Olson testified that he, ``did not know there \nwas this special fund set up by Scaife to finance this Arkansas fact \nwork.'' That might have explained Mr. Olson's testimony if he had said \nthat at the time he was writing the articles and giving legal advice \nand talking about these matters with the staff, he had been unaware \nthat those conversations were in connection with what came to be known \nas the ``Arkansas Project.'' But that is not what Mr. Olson testified. \nIn fact, he admitted that he became aware of the ``Arkansas Project'' \nat least by 1998, and then changed that testimony to sometime in 1997. \nHe said he was a Member of the Board that received an audit of the \nScaife funds. So by 2001, his knowledge of the ``Arkansas Project'' and \nthe funding by Scaife was undeniable.\n  On this particular definitional point, Mr. Olson has minimized his \nrole in and his knowledge of how the Scaife money was spent by the \nFoundation, even though he was on the board. It strains credulity that \nhe did not know given the size of the Scaife grants--especially when \nanother board member has described briefings to the board on the \nArkansas Project and its financing as ``routine.'' [Peter Hannaford, \nWashington Post, May 15, 2001]. Moreover, board minutes for a meeting \non May 19, 1997, which were included in the anonymous-source documents \nreleased by Senator Hatch on May 22, indicate that the board--at least \nat that meeting--discussed a number of financial matters, such as the \nfoundation's equity holdings, operating reserves, employment contracts, \nand commitments from the Scaife Foundation. (Doc. pp. 44-46).\n  This is certainly not the first occasion that Mr. Olson has played \nthis word game. Independent Counsel Robert W. Ray notes in response to \na request from Senator Hatch, that in a memoranda of interview, Mr. \nOlson acknowledged that ``he may have been asked questions by [names \nredacted] about things that they were doing in Arkansas, but Olson did \nnot know anything about the ``Arkansas Project'' and ``he was not \ninvolved in the direction of funding of that project.'' Mr. Olson was \nprecise in his denial of knowledge and involvement to refer to the term \n``Arkansas Project.'' One unnamed person interviewed by the OSR \ninvestigation stated, however, that ``the `Arkansas Project' was not a \nterm used by [name redacted] or anyone else at the American Spectator \nto his knowledge.'' (May 21 Ray Letter, n. 2).\n  But even accepting Mr. Olson's strict definition of the ``Arkansas \nProject,'' which apparently requires knowledge of the Scaife funding \nsource, rather than the broader use of the term to describe the general \nactivities of Clinton scandal mongering underway at the American \nSpectator from 1993 through 1998, his involvement was more than he \ndescribed. On Friday, May 11, 2001, the New York Times reported that \nMr. Olson said that when he joined the Board of Directors of the \nAmerican Spectator the ``Arkansas Project'' was underway and that when \nhe found out about it, he helped shut it down. In fact, Mr. Olson's \ntestimony to the Committee was that he was on the Board, ``when the \nallegations about the project were simply that it did exist. The \npublisher at the time, under the supervision of the board of directors, \nhired a major independent accounting firm to conduct an audit to report \nto the publisher and therefore to the board of directors with respect \nto how that money was funded. . . . As a result of that investigation, \nthe magazine, while it felt it had the right to conduct those kind of \ninvestigations, decided that it was not in the best interest of the \nmagazine to do so. It ended the project. It established rules to \nrestrict that kind of activity in the future. . . .''\n  In a subsequent written response, Mr. Olson wrote: ``Neither the \nreport by Mr. [Terry] Eastland nor the Board found anything unlawful \nabout the manner in which funds had been spent, which as I recall, had \nall been for the purpose of investigating and reporting information of \nlegitimate public interest regarding a high level public official. \nHowever, because of the controversy surrounding the matter, and issues \nregarding whether the journalistic products that resulted had been \nworth the amount spent, the project was ended and the Board adopted new \nguidelines to govern investigative journalistic efforts in the \nfuture.''\n\n  The letter is interesting on these points, but only adds to the \nquestions rather than resolving what in fact happened. Mr. Eastland \nadds another perspective and indicates a much more active role for Mr. \nOlson than had previously been acknowledged in representations to the \nCommittee. Mr. Eastland writes that in June, 1997, disagreements arose \nbetween the magazine's ``then publisher'' and Richard Larry, the \nexecutive director of the Scaife foundations.\n  Mr. Eastland continues: ``At that time, Mr. Tyrrell, who was also \nchairman of the board, asked Mr. Olson, a board member since 1996, for \nhis assistance in resolving the dispute.'' This role has never \npreviously been acknowledged by Mr. Olson or Mr. Tyrrell. Mr. Eastland \nthen asserts that ``Mr. Olson agreed that a review of the project was \nnecessary.'' He continues: ``Throughout my review, which included an \naccounting of the monies spent on the project as well as an examination \nof its management, methods, and results, I had Mr. Olson's strong \nsupport.'' So, according to Mr. Eastland, Mr. Olson had a much more \nextensive role in deciding how the American Spectator would ``resolve'' \nthe dispute, contributed to the decision to conduct a review and played \na strong supportive role in the review.\n  If Mr. Olson is now taking credit for finding out about the \n``Arkansas Project'' and for shutting it down, as reported by the New \nYork Times on May 11, 2001, that would be a modification of those \nresponses and his initial response that he was not involved in the \nproject, ``in its origin or its management,'' to his later formulation \nthat he did, ``not recall giving any advice concerning the conduct of \nthe `Project' or its origins or management,'' to his later formulation \nthat he was not involved in its, ``inception, organization or ongoing \nsupervision,'' or alternatively, that his, ``only involvement in what \nhas been characterized as the `Arkansas Project' was in connection with \nmy service to the Foundation as a lawyer and member of its Board of \nDirectors.''\n  Of course, there is much left unsaid by Mr. Eastland on this and \nother topics. For example, he does not indicate how he came to be the \npublisher of the American Spectator and replaced Ronald Burr in \nNovember 1997 or whether Mr. Olson had a role in his recruitment or in \nthat action of replacing the publisher. In this regard, Mr. Olson did \nnot indicate to the Committee in his submitted responses to our \nquestionnaire that he had been an officer at the American Spectator \nEducational Foundation. In written follow up questions, I drew his \nattention to passages in The Hunting of the President (Id.) in which \nthe authors of that published work indicate that Mr. Olson was named an \nofficer of the organization on October 1997. Mr. Olson's response is \nuncertain and equivocal indicating that he had a, ``vague recollection \nthat [he] served as a temporary secretary for the purpose of that \nmeeting, and perhaps a subsequent one, something that I did not recall \nat the time I answered the initial written questions.''\n  Second, evidence uncovered during the Committee's limited bipartisan \ninquiry following the Committee vote, raises serious question about \nwhether Mr. Olson accurately denied any role in the ``origin'' of the \n``Arkansas Project'' by failing to respond correctly to direct \nquestions about a meeting in his law office held in late December, 1993 \nwhen this project was getting organized.\n  The anonymous-source documents released by Senator Hatch reveal that \nfollowing requests by the American Spectator as early as October 13, \n1993, Richard M. Scaife on December 2, 1993 ``approved a new grant to \nThe American Spectator Educational Foundation, Inc.'' and forwarded the \nfirst installment of the grant. (Doc. p. 19). Thus, by late December \n1993, the Scaife funding was in place at the American Spectator to \nsupport the activities\n\n[[Page S5589]]\n\nthat would come to be called the ``Arkansas Project.''\n  With the Scaife funding secured, the OSR Report confirms that Mr. \nOlson met in his office in late December 1993 with people associated \nwith the American Spectator--Ronald Burr, maybe David Henderson, \nStephen Boynton and David Hale. (OSR Report, pp. 78, 82, 90; May 21, \nJoint Q. 5). ``[A]t least seven individuals were identified as having \npossibly been in attendance.'' (Id.) Mr. Olson recalled this meeting in \n1998 during the OSR investigation, stating that ``in approximately \nDecember 1993'' he hosted a meeting in his office, that the meeting was \n``about the possibility that he provide counsel to the magazine,'' that \nDavid Hale attended this meeting, and that ``the participants may have \ndiscussed Hale's need for a `Washington lawyer' to represent him if he \nwas called to testify before any congressional committees.'' (OSR \nReport, pp. 28, 78).\n  While the description of what discussions may have taken place at \nthis meeting is ``incomplete and inconsistent'' with ``inconsistencies \nnot resolved by the Shaheen investigation'' (May 21 Ray Response to \nJoint Q. 5), the OSR report contains the following descriptions from \nother participants in the meeting: ``while Hale may have been a topic \nof conversation during this meeting, no one requested Olson to \nrepresent Hale'' (p. 82); ``[Redacted] recalled meeting with attorneys \nTheodore Olson and [redacted] to discuss the representation of David \nHale, . . .'' (P. 90). Mr. Ray has identified these references likely \nto be to the same December 1993 meeting. (May 21 Ray Response to Joint \nQs. 5, 7, 9).\n  In addition to these limited descriptions in the OSR Report, \nIndependent Counsel Ray reviewed the underlying memoranda of interviews \nof three participants in the December 1993 meeting in Mr. Olson's \noffice and summarized their statements in a May 21 letter responding to \na question sent unilaterally by Senator Hatch. According to Mr. Ray, \nwhose cooperation during this bipartisan inquiry has been exemplary and \nhelpful, Mr. Olson admitted that at this meeting David Hale's need for \ncounsel was discussed and that this meeting was ``the commencement of \n[my] relationship with the American Spectator magazine'' but he \ndeclined to describe the substance of that discussion, claiming the \nattorney/client privilege.'' (Id., p. 2). It is difficult to see, \nhowever, how the meeting could be covered by attorney/client privilege \nwhen David Hale, who had no formal affiliation with the Spectator, was \npresent.\n  One unnamed participant confirms part of Mr. Olson's recollection, \nstating, ``the purpose of the meeting was to get Olson to represent \nHale.'' Another unnamed participant appears to confirm the other part \nof Mr. Olson's recollection regarding the second purpose of the meeting \nabout American Spectator activities, stating: ``The subject of this \nmeeting was Bill and Hillary Clinton and the need for the Spectator to \ninvestigate and report on numerous alleged Clinton scandals.'' \n(Emphasis supplied).\n\n  Having seen the OSR Report and a statement submitted by Michael \nHorowitz, I am led to wonder whether the account of a late 1993 or \nearly 1994 meeting in the Washington law office of Gibson, Dunn & \nCrutcher attended by David Henderson, Steve Boynton, John Mintz, Ronald \nBurr, Ted Olson and Michael Horowitz in The Hunting of the President \n(J. Conason & G. Lyons, 2000) is more accurate than we have been led to \nbelieve by Mr. Olson. At his hearing, I had asked Mr. Olson whether \nthere had been any meetings of the ``Arkansas project'' in his office \nand he responded without reservation: ``No, there were none.''\n  I followed up with a written question asking in particular about the \ntime frame of 1993 and 1994, and Mr. Olson answered that he was, ``not \naware of any meeting organizing, planning or implementing the `Arkansas \nProject' in my law firm in 1993 or 1994.'' I then followed up by \ndrawing his attention to a passage out of The Hunting of the President \n(Id.) in which the authors of that book wrote that a meeting did take \nplace at which the topic was using Scaife funds and the American \nSpectator to, ``mount a series of probes into the Clintons and their \nalleged crimes in Arkansas.'' in response to that written question, Mr. \nOlson was less assertive and categorical. He did not deny that a \nmeeting took place but disputed the characterization of the topic of \nthe meeting. Hedging his testimony, he noted that he did, ``not recall \nthe meeting described.''\n  With respect to Mr. Olson's initial categorical denial of meeting at \nGibson Dunn's offices, in response to another written follow up \nquestion derived from a passage in The Hunting of the President (Id.), \nI asked whether there had, in fact been meetings not only in 1993 and \n1994 but also in July 1997 at the offices of Mr. Olson's law firm to \ndiscuss allegations that money for the ``Arkansas Project'' had been \nmisallocated. Confronted with the specific reference to the public \nrecord, Mr. Olson modified his earlier categorical denial by conceding: \n``I do recall meetings, which I now realize must have been in the \nsummer of 1997 in my office regarding allegations regarding what became \nknown as the `Arkansas Project' and questions concerning whether \nexpenditures involved in that project had been properly documented.''\n  Third, Mr. Olson has apparently down-played his involvement in the \ndevelopment and direction of ``Arkansas Project'' stories, perhaps to \navoid any inconsistency with his initial representation to the \nCommittee that he was not involved in the management of this project.\n  Yet, according to a published report in the Washington Post on May \n10, 2001, the report to which Senator Hatch referred when he indicated \nthat ``legitimate questions'' had been raised, David Brock told Post \nreporters that ``Olson attended a number of dinner meetings at the home \nof R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr., president and chairman of the Spectator, \nwhich were explicitly `brainstorming' sessions about the Arkansas \nProject.'' While Mr. Olson refused to respond to this allegation, his \nlaw partner, Douglas Cox, who worked on the Spectator account, conceded \nthat Olson attended such dinners, but that ``did not mean that he was \naware of the scope of the `Arkansas Project' and the Scaife funding.''\n  David Brock has also indicated that Mr. Olson was ``directly involved \nin the Arkansas Project, participating in discussions about possible \nstories and advising the magazine whether to publish one of its most \ncontroversial stories, about the death of Clinton White House deputy \ncounsel Vincent Foster.'' Washington Post, May 11, 2001. According to \nthe account in the Post, Mr. Olson told Mr. Brock that, ``while he \ndidn't place any stock in the piece, it was worth publishing because \nthe role of the Spectator was to write Clinton scandal stories in hopes \nof `shaking scandals loose.' '' In his response to Senator Hatch, Mr. \nOlson did not deny Mr. Brock's account head on. Instead, he wrote that \nhe told Mr. Brock that the article did not appear to be libelous or to \nraise any legal issues that would preclude its publication, and that he \nwas not going to tell the editor-in-chief what should appear in the \nmagazine.\n  The Washington Post also reported that both R. Emmett Tyrrell and \nWladyslaw Pleszczynski said that project story ideas, legal issues \ninvolving the stories, and other directly related matters were \ndiscussed with Mr. Olson by staff members and at dinner parties of \nSpectator staff and board members. The reaction from Mr. Olson's \nsupporters was swift. On May 15, 2001, Senator Hatch shared with us a \nletter he obtained from Messrs. Tyrrell and Pleszczynski denying the \nspecific words in the Post story but not denying that they talked to \nthe Post reporters. Indeed, the Post story quotes Mr. Tyrrell, a quote \nhe does not disavow, as saying he did not recall, but it was a \npossibility that he talked to Ted Olson about the stories about the \nClintons. ``I would say it was a possibility, just as it was a \npossibility that Roosevelt would have discussed Pearl Harbor on \nDecember 8 with his secretary of state.'' Tyrrell and Pleszczynski also \nsay that Mr. Olson's carefully worded disclaimer was technically \naccurate as far as it went.\n  In a blatant effort to undermine Mr. Brock's powerful, first-hand \nrecollection of Mr. Olson's participation in and contributions to the \nactivities of the ``Arkansas Project,'' Mr. Tyrrell also submitted a \nstatement that Mr. Brock was not a part of the ``Arkansas Project.'' \nMr. Brock, in reply, submitted strong contradictory evidence\n\n[[Page S5590]]\n\nto the Tyrrell statement and supplied the committee with multiple \nArkansas Project expense reports which remain unrefuted and which Mr. \nBrock states, ``clearly show that I was reimbursed thousands of dollars \nby the Project for travel, office supplies, postage, and the like.''\n  Over the course of the past few weeks, Mr. Olson has downplayed any \nsignificance of discussions in social settings about the stories that \nwere the product of the ``Arkansas Project.'' In his May 9, 2001, \nletter, Mr. Olson acknowledged: ``Your previous questions asked about \ncontacts that I may have had with people involved in the project. My \nanswer was and is that I had dealings with the editors of the magazine \nand some of its reporters and staff, some social, some in connection \nwith legal work. This was during a time when those persons were \ninvolved in one form or another with the investigative journalistic \nefforts which the magazine was contemporaneously pursuing. I was, of \ncourse, aware, along with the public generally, that the magazine was \nwriting articles about the Clintons, but I did not know that there was \na special source of funding for these efforts.''\n\n  In his May 14, 2001, letter to Senator Hatch, he writes: ``It was \nalso true that in social settings, the magazine's editorial staff and \nwriters spoke of the articles that they were involved in writing and \npublishing. I was among scores of people from time to time included in \nsuch social events, but nothing about these social discussions involved \norganizing, supervising or managing the project--they were simply \ndiscussions of subjects of contemporaneous interest to the magazine's \neditors and writers.''\n  Yet, taken as a whole, Mr. Olson was clearly involved and \nparticipated both professionally and socially in the work of the \nAmerican Spectator and its ``Arkansas Project.'' There is absolutely \nnothing illegal about this involvement and participation, but it shows \na larger role in these activities than Mr. Olson initially portrayed.\n  Fourth, Mr. Olson minimized his role in the ``Arkansas Project'' and \nthe American Spectator by failing to give complete information about \nthe amount of remuneration he has received for his activities on their \nbehalf when he was first asked. He told us on April 19 that he was paid \nfrom $500 to $1,000 for his articles that appeared in the American \nSpectator magazine. Yet, we find out in the Washington Post on May 10 \nthat his firm was paid over $8,000 for work that was used in just one \nof those articles. In addition, the Post reported that over $14,000 was \npaid to Mr. Olson's law firm and attributed by American Spectator to \nthe ``Arkansas Project.''\n  When he was asked during his hearing about an article he had \ncoauthored that was published under the pseudonym ``Solitary, Poor, \nNasty, Brutish and Short'' in the American Spectator magazine he did \nnot indicate that ``the magazine hired [his] firm to prepare'' such \nmaterials and to perform legal research on the theoretical criminal \nexposure of the President and Mrs. Clinton based on press accounts of \ntheir conduct. I, for one, thought Mr. Olson had defended his writings \nas matters of personal First Amendment political expression. I had no \nidea from his testimony at his confirmation hearing that this article \nwas part of his and his firm's ongoing legal representation of American \nSpectator Educational Foundation, that it was a commissioned piece of \nlegal writing, paid for by a grant from conservative billionaire \nRichard Mellon Scaife. I am now left to wonder whether his article that \nwas so critical of the Attorney General and the Justice Department was \nas he described them at his hearing the ``statements of a private \ncitizen,'' or another richly paid for political tract.\n  Mr. Tyrrell and Mr. Pleszcynski do not deny that Mr. Olson was paid \nfor the chart speculating on the Clintons' potential criminal exposure. \nInstead, they merely repeat the mantra that even if he was paid with \n``Arkansas Project'' funds, Mr. Olson would not have known that. What \nthey leave out is a necessary qualifier, ``at the time he received the \npayment.'' They and Mr. Olson became privy to the internal audit of the \n``Arkansas Project'' by 1998. That audit and his knowledge as a Board \nMember of the extent of the ``Arkansas Project'' it revealed render Mr. \nOlson's testimony in April, 2001, less than complete.\n  I have inquired of Mr. Olson what his and his firm's legal \nrepresentation of the American Spectator entailed. In response he has \nbeen extremely general, vague and unspecific and, at times, has cloaked \nhis nonresponsiveness in allusions to the attorney-client privilege. In \nfact, his law partner, Douglas Cox, has acknowledged that he and Mr. \nOlson worked on legal matters for the American Spectator, including \nlegal research that was incorporated into the article that was \npublished in 1994 in the American Spectator, under a fictitious name, \nthat argues that the President was facing up to 178 years in prison and \nMrs. Clinton had a criminal exposure of 47 years in prison. He then \nproceeds to undercut any claim of attorney-client privilege for these \nactivities by indicating that they did not rely on any communications \nwith anyone at American Spectator.\n  Having now conceded his involvement in these matters, something he \ndid not do initially, the question arises: how extensive was that \ninvolvement as a lawyer? That is why I asked at least for production of \nhis firm's billing records for legal services rendered to the American \nSpectator, but was stonewalled on that request. Mr. Olson asserted \nattorney-client privilege; he did not offer to cooperate by producing \nnon-privileged copies of those records. (April 25 Response, Q.4; May 9 \nResponse, p. 3). Such records have been produced in connection with \nother government inquiries.\n  As part of the bipartisan inquiry undertaken after the Committee vote \non this nomination, we became aware of this fact. The May 28, 1999 \ntransmittal letter for the December 9, 1998 OSR Report indicates that \nrequest were made to Mr. Olson and his law firm, Bigson Dunn & Crutcher \n(GD) for billing records for any client that had received Scaife \nfoundation grants between 1992-1998 in order to ascertain whether there \nhad ``been an indirect method to compensate GD for its unpaid \nrepresentation of Hale.'' Just as here, GD initially invoked \nattorney-client privilege but ultimately non-privileged billing records \nfor Mr. Olson's and GD's representation of both David Hale and the \nAmerican Spectator were produced. (May 21 Ray Response to Joint A. 1). \nHowever, the independent counsel was unable to forward those records in \nresponse to the bipartisan, joint request for them from Senator Hatch \nand myself.\n  Accordingly, Senator Hatch and I then sent a joint request to Mr. \nOlson's firm requesting information about the total amount of fees paid \nby the American Spectator to the firm. On May 24, Mr. Cox informed us \nby letter that the amount paid over the course of five and one-half \nyears for legal services performed is $94,405. That is a far different \nnumber than the $500 to $1,000 per article the Committee was first told \nby Mr. Olson.\n  Fifth, Mr. Olson has tried to distance himself from the most \ncontroversial aspects of the ``Arkansas Project'' in its activities to \npublicize allegations of wrongdoing about the Clintons in Arkansas. Mr. \nOlson stated that he ``represented the American Spectator in the \nperformance of legal services from time to time beginning in 1994 . . . \nthose legal services were not for the purpose of conducting or \nassisting in the conduct of investigations of the Clintons.'' (April \n25th Responses, Q. 4). Yet, we find out he was paid over $8,000 to \nprepare a chart outlining the Clintons' criminal exposure as research \nfor a February 1994 article Mr. Olson co-authored against the Clintons \nentitled, `Criminal laws Implicated by the Clinton Scandals: A partial \nlist.'\n\n  Finally, Mr. Olson has testified he simply does not recall who \ncontacted him to represent David Hale. When I asked Mr. Olson at his \nApril 5 hearing how he came to represent Mr. Hale he started by saying, \n``[t]wo of [Hale's] then lawyers contacted me and asked . . . .'' A few \nseconds later Mr. Olson said, ``[o]ne of his lawyers contacted me--I \ncan't recall the man's name--and asked whether I would be available to \nrepresent Mr. Hale in connection with that subpoena here in Washington, \nD.C. They felt that they needed Washington counsel with some experience \ndealing with a congressional investigation. I did agree to do that. Mr. \nHale and I met together.''\n  Even in his May 9 letter, Mr. Olson asserts that he, ``cannot recall \nwhen\n\n[[Page S5591]]\n\n[he] was first contacted about the possibility of representing Mr. \nHale.'' He indicates that he believes, ``that [he] was contacted by a \nperson or persons whose identities [he] cannot presently recall \nsometime before then regarding whether I might be willing to represent \nMr. Hale if he needed representation in Washington. As I recall, I \nindicated at the time that I might be able to do so, but only in \nconnection with a potential congressional subpoena, not with respect to \nlegal matters pending in Arkansas. . . . I believe that this meeting \nwas inconclusive because Mr. Hale did not at that time need \nrepresentation in Washington.''\n  The Washington Post reported that David Henderson said that he \nintroduced Hale to Olson when Hale came to Washington to find a lawyer \nwho could help him deal with a subpoena from the Senate Whitewater \ncommittee, and sat in on a meeting between the two men. Interestingly, \nDavid Henderson apparently signed a statement on May 14 indicating that \nin his view he broke no law while implementing the ``Arkansas \nProject.'' What he does not say and what he does not deny is that he \nwas the person who introduced David Hale to Mr. Olson. The role that \nDavid Henderson played in introducing David Hale to Mr. Olson is \napparently corroborated by several other witnesses who have spoken to \nthe American Prospect in a story released on May 24.\n  It now strikes me as strange that a man as capable as Mr. Olson with \nhis vast abilities of recall could not remember the name of David \nHenderson, if Mr. Henderson was, in fact, involved in setting up that \nrepresentation. It strikes me as doubly strange when the bipartisan \ninquiry conducted after the Committee vote on this nomination uncovered \nevidence that Mr. Olson was able to recall who introduced him to David \nHale just a couple of years ago when asked the same question.\n  The OSR Report indicates that in 1998 Mr. Olson recalled who referred \nDavid Hale to him for legal representation, stating: ``Hale became a \nclient of Olson's firm around November 1995. Olson believes that Hale \nmay have been referred to him by [redacted].'' (OSR Report, p. 79).\n  It leads one to wonder whether Mr. Olson's failure to recall the name \nDavid Henderson had something to do with his not wanting to indicate \nthe connection to such a central figure in the ``Arkansas Project.'' \nIndeed, it has been reported that when Mr. Olson became a Member of the \nBoard of Directors of the American Spectator his January 1996 letter \naccepting the position was addressed to the publisher Ronald Burr with \ncopies sent to Messrs. Tyrrell and Henderson. Mr. Henderson says in his \nrecent statement that he served for a while on the Spectator Board. But \nwhy was he, in particular, sent a copy? One explanation is that Mr. \nOlson has a selective memory and that he did not recall Mr. Henderson \nas the person who contacted him to represent David Hale because that \nwould simply be another tie to the ``Arkansas Project.'' But we may \nnever know for sure.\n  On this point regarding how Mr. Olson came to represent Mr. Hale, and \nMr. Olson's testimony to the Committee about it, Michael J. Horowitz \nsubmitted a statement that says that he, Mr. Horowitz, ``attended one \nmeeting in Mr. Olson's presence at which the matter discussed was legal \nrepresentation for David Hale, who was facing Congressional testimony \nand was in need of distinguished Washington counsel. At that meeting--\nat which no mention I know of was made of the `Arkansas Project' or any \nterm like it--the subject under discussion was whether Mr. Olson's firm \nwould serve as counsel to Mr. Hale.''\n  It is entirely unclear in what capacity Mr. Horowitz was attending \nsuch a meeting, but it may not have been quite as simple as one or two \nlawyers then representing Mr. Hale approaching a high profile \nWashington lawyer and his instantaneous agreement to accept the \nrepresentation for a client without a retainer and without much \nprospect of being paid after. According to Mr. Olson, he and Mr. Hale \n``met together'' and Mr. Hale agreed to pay [Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher's] \nfees.'' In the end, Mr. Hale could not pay the $140,000 in legal fees \nhe owned Mr. Olson.\n  Fitness to be Solicitor General. Some have said, why is this \nimportant? Does this matter whether he accurately and fully described \nhis role in the American Spectator and the ``Arkansas Project''? It is \nimportant for two reasons, both of which go to the core of the fitness \nof the nominee to serve as Solicitor General. The principle question \nraised by the nomination of Mr. Olson to this particular position is \nwhether his partisanship over the last several years in connection with \nso many far reaching anti-Clinton efforts mark Mr. Olson as a \nthoroughgoing partisan who will not be able to check his partisan \npolitical instincts at the door to the Office of the Solicitor General. \nSimilar questions were raised by the nomination of Michael Chertoff. In \nthat case the questions were answered and the doubts dissipated. In \nconnection with the Olson nomination, those doubts have grown over \ntime.\n  Had Mr. Olson conceded the extent of his involvement in anti-Clinton \nactivities and given the kinds of assurances that Mr. Chertoff did \nabout his upcoming responsibilities, I would be supporting his \nconfirmation. Indeed, when I met with Mr. Olson and at his hearing, I \nhoped and expected that to be my position. I expected to be able to \ngive him the benefit of the doubt and, in light of the deference I \nwould normally accord a President's Executive Branch nominees, I fully \nexpected to be voting for this nomination.\n  In the wake of the hearing, the series of supplemental responses we \nhave received and the unanswered questions now in the public record \nabout Mr. Olson's involvement in partisan activities like the \n``Arkansas Project,'' I still have my doubts.\n  Second is the question of candor and straightforwardness. I have not \nhad the sense from his hearing onward that Mr. Olson has been truly \nforthcoming with me or with the Committee. My sense is that for some \nreason he chose from the outset to try to minimize his role in \nconnection with the activities of the American Spectator, that he has \nsought to characterize it in the most favorable possible light, that he \nhas sought to conclude for us rather than provide us with the facts and \nlet us conclude how to view his activities.\n  I will cite another example of nonresponsiveness from the record. I \nasked Mr. Olson in light of his testimony at the hearing that he was \nnot involved in the origins or management of the `Arkansas Project': \n``Were you involved in advising anyone who was involved in the origins \nor management of the project? If so, what advice did you provide? Were \nyou at meetings or social events with anyone involved in the project as \nan originator, manager, reporter, or source for the project? If so, \nwhat role did you play at these meetings or social events?''\n  Mr. Olson's response was, as follows:\n\n       ``I did not realize that a Project of any sort was underway \n     except to the extent that I have indicated. I was in contact \n     at social events with reporters for the magazine and members \n     of the editorial staff, individuals whom I regard as personal \n     friends. I have been at countless social events at which one \n     or more of such persons may have been present. I have not \n     kept records of such meetings, or the nature of the \n     conversations that may have occurred at such meetings that \n     might have involved President Clinton or his contemporaneous \n     or past conduct. I was not playing any particular role at \n     those social events, except that I was probably a host of \n     events at which persons who wrote for or performed editorial \n     services for the American Spectator may have been present. To \n     the extent that it is relevant to your inquiry, I was the \n     best man at the wedding of the editor-in-chief of the \n     American Spectator. I recall that he was also present at my \n     wedding. He is a personal friend and we have had numerous \n     social meetings. He has written at least two books about \n     former President Clinton. I do not interpret your inquiry as \n     asking for the substance of conversations at social events. \n     And I do not recall giving any advice concerning the conduct \n     of the `Project' or its origins or management.\n\n  Literally true? Probably. Responsive? Hardly. At the time of his \nhearing and his answer, Mr. Olson was well aware of the activities of \nthe ``Arkansas Project,'' which was operated by the organization for \nwhich he acted as lawyer, author and contributor, Board Member and \nofficer. He had been presented with an audit and played a pivotal role \nin reviewing the examination of its management, methods and results, \naccording to Mr. Eastland. His answer, however, steers clear of perjury \nwithout responding to the concerns being raised. It relies on a lack of \nrecollection and is an attempt at distraction.\n\n[[Page S5592]]\n\n  Conclusion. As I review this record and the initial \nnonresponsiveness, lack of recall, corrections when confronted with \nspecifics, I am left to wonder what happened to ``absolute candor and \nfair dealing.'' In concluding my May 4, 2001, letter to Mr. Olson I \nnoted: ``The credibility of the person appointed to be the Solicitor \nGeneral is of paramount importance. When arguing in front of the \nSupreme Court on behalf of the United States Government, the Solicitor \nGeneral is expected to come forward with both the strengths and \nweaknesses of the case, to inform the Court of things it might not \notherwise know, and to be honest in all his or her dealings with the \nCourt. I expect that same responsiveness and cooperation from nominees \nbefore this Committee.'' My expectations have been disappointed.\n  I understand the role of a lawyer-advocate in our legal system, and I \ndid not intend to oppose this nomination merely because of Mr. Olson's \nclients and his clients' activities. If confirmed, however, Mr. Olson's \nnext client will be the United States of America--and all of us. I want \nto be sure that our nation's top lawyer will see the truth and speak \nthe truth fully to the Supreme Court and represent all of our best \ninterests in the weighty matters over which the Solicitor General \nexercises public authority. Based upon what I have seen I do not have \nthe requisite confidence in Mr. Olson to be able to support his \nnomination. I will vote no.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I agree with my colleague from Vermont that \nthe Solicitor General must be a person of the highest integrity. This \nis very important if the Solicitor General is to represent the \ninterests of all Americans and to be a valuable assistant to the \nSupreme Court. Mr. Olson himself acknowledged this high standard in his \ntestimony to the committee.\n  I believe that Mr. Olson has exemplified this high level of candor \nand integrity in all of his dealings with the committee.\n  Some of my colleagues have alleged that Mr. Olson misdirected the \ncommittee in his answers. But this is simply untrue. Mr. Olson told us \nwhat he did with the American Spectator and the Arkansas Project. He \nwrote several articles for that magazine--copies of these articles were \nall provided to the committee with Mr. Olson's questionnaire. Mr. Olson \nalso told us that he was on the board of the magazine and became aware \nof the Arkansas Project in 1997. He has not attempted to hide any of \nthese activities from the committee. Rather he has cooperated fully, \nsubmitting numerous responses to questions from members of the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  Mr. Olson enjoys the support of many prominent liberal scholars and \nlawyers, as I have detailed already. Many of his colleagues at the \nOffice of Legal Counsel have attested to his fairness and his \nconsummate ability to serve as a government lawyer in a nonpartisan \nmanner.\n  Indeed, many of the allegations against Mr. Olson have arisen from \nreports in The Washington Post. But the Post has advocated the \nconfirmation of Mr. Olson.\n  Mr. Olson is one of the most qualified nominees ever for the position \nof Solicitor General. I hope that this body will confirm him today so \nthat he can begin his important work litigating on behalf of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe following letters we have received in support of Mr. Olson. These \ninclude letters from Robert Bennett, Larry Simms, Michael Horowitz, \nJames Ring Adams, Terry Eastland, Floyd Abrams, Laurence Tribe, William \nWebster, R. Emmett Tyrell, Wladyslaw Pleszczynski, Douglas Cox, David \nHenderson, and Stephen Boynton. These letters demonstrate the depth and \nbreadth of the support for Mr. Olson's nomination.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher\n\n\n                                                   & Flom LLP,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 2001.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I write this letter in support of the \n     appointment of Ted Olson as Solicitor General of the United \n     States.\n       Our country is blessed with many wonderful lawyers of all \n     political persuasions. In making judgments about their \n     selection for high office, we must look beyond their \n     political labels and pick the best qualified. The Ted Olson \n     that I know and respect would be a great Solicitor General. I \n     am confident that he will obey and enforce the law with \n     skill, integrity and impartiality. The American people would \n     be most fortunate to have such a skillful and honest advocate \n     representing the United States before the Supreme Court.\n       Several years ago when I was the State Chair of the \n     American College of Trial Lawyers for the District of \n     Columbia, it was my responsibility to help select for \n     admission to the College the very best advocates--those who \n     were the most skilled, dedicated and honest. At the top of my \n     list was Ted Olson. Ted, because of his stellar \n     qualifications and reputation for integrity, sailed through \n     the selection process. Those who supported him were liberals, \n     moderates and conservatives of all stripes.\n       While I do not have any personal knowledge as to what role, \n     if any, Mr. Olson played in the ``Arkansas Project'' or the \n     full extent of his relationship with the American Spectator, \n     what I do know is that Ted Olson is a truth-teller and you \n     can rely on his representations regarding these matters. \n     Moreover, I agree with Senator Leahy that the credibility of \n     the individual appointed to be Solicitor General is of \n     paramount importance. In my view, based on the many years I \n     have known him, Ted Olson is such an individual. He is a man \n     of great personal integrity and credibility and should be \n     confirmed.\n           Sincerely,\n     Robert S. Bennett.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, LLP,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 2001.\n     Re the nomination of Theodore B. Olson to be the Solicitor \n         General of the United states\n\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Hatch and Leahy: This letter is being sent to \n     the Committee in connection with the nomination of Theodore \n     B. Olson to become the Solicitor General of the United \n     States. It is written in the context of an apparent \n     controversy regarding the truthfulness of particular \n     testimony given by Mr. Olson at his confirmation hearing \n     before the Committee. I have had no involvement whatsoever in \n     Mr. Olson's preparation for that hearing, I have not reviewed \n     a transcript of that hearing, and I have not discussed the \n     substance of this controversy with Mr. Olson or anyone who \n     may be assisting Mr. Olson in this matter. Indeed, my \n     universe of asserted facts regrading this controversy is \n     limited to my review of two or possibly three articles \n     printed recently in The Washington Post that were brought to \n     my attention by a former associate of Gibson, Dunn in a \n     purely social communication. This letter has not been, nor \n     will it be, reviewed or seen by anyone other than word \n     processing personnel before it is delivered to the \n     Committee, although I am providing a copy of it to Mr. \n     Olson as a matter of courtesy.\n       I understand the central concern of the Committee to be the \n     truthfulness and integrity that Mr. Olson would bring to the \n     presentation of the position of the United States in cases \n     brought before the Supreme Court or other cases within the \n     ambit of the authority of the Solicitor General. I share the \n     view that there should be no doubt about the ability and \n     integrity of any nominee to this position to present the \n     Government's position with honesty and integrity. When this \n     sort of issue arises in this town, it is customary for the \n     record to be filled, often to overflowing, with letters \n     extolling the integrity of the nominee whose ability to serve \n     with the requisite integrity has been challenged. I doubt \n     that such testimonials are particularly helpful to the \n     Committee, I would, instead, like to bring to the attention \n     of the Committee three instances in which I worked with Mr. \n     Olson on matters that demanded precisely the kind of \n     intellectual integrity that should be displayed by any \n     Solicitor General and in which Mr. Olson displayed that \n     integrity under what can only be characterized as battlefield \n     conditions. First, I should provide the Committee with some \n     relevant information about myself.\n       I graduated from the Boston University School of Law in \n     1973, having spent four years as an officer in the U.S. Navy \n     after my graduation from Dartmouth College in 1966. I grew up \n     in Tennessee, campaigned for the late Senator Albert Gore, \n     Sr. in his last campaign in 1970, and I am a Democrat. In \n     1973-74, I served as a law clerk to Circuit Judge James L. \n     Oakes of the Second Circuit. In 1974-75, I served as law \n     clerk to Associate Justice Byron R. White of the Supreme \n     Court. In 1975-76, I served as Counsel to the Reporters \n     Committee for Freedom of the Press and began teaching a First \n     Amendment seminar as a adjunct professor of the Georgetown \n     Law Center, a course I taught until 1985. In June 1976, I was \n     hired by Antonin Scalia, then the Assistant Attorney General \n     in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of \n     Justice (``OLC''), as an attorney-adviser. In 1979, I was \n     appointed Deputy Assistant Attorney\n\n[[Page S5593]]\n\n     General in OLC by Attorney General Bell. I was the only \n     remaining Deputy Assistant in OLC when the first Reagan \n     Administration took office in January, 1981, and I continued \n     to serve in that capacity until February 1985. Mr. Olson was \n     the Assistant Attorney General in charge of OLC from his \n     confirmation in 1981 through the fall of 1984. We worked \n     closely together on many issues, and I came to know him well \n     both at the professional and personal level. I joined Gibson, \n     Dunn as an associate in February 1985, became a partner in \n     1988 and have practiced appellate law with the firm for \n     sixteen years.\n       Mr. Olson's handling of three major issues during his \n     tenure as the head of OLC stands out as exemplary of his \n     intellectual integrity. First, and as this Committee is well \n     aware, the courts had not at that time determined the \n     constitutionality of the legislative veto device. In \n     addition, the Republican plank endorsed by President Reagan \n     openly supported the legislative veto device. When he became \n     head of OLC, Mr. Olson studied the question of the \n     constitutionality of the legislative veto device, discussed \n     that question at great length with me and other OLC lawyers, \n     and concluded that legislative veto devices were, root and \n     branch, unconstitutional. He so advised Attorney General \n     Smith, who in turn advised President Reagan and members of \n     the President's staff--many of whom were strongly \n     supportive of legislative veto devices. Mr. Olson \n     convinced the Attorney General that the issue involved was \n     a legal issue, not a political issue, and that the law, \n     not the plank of the Republican Party, had to be followed \n     by everyone involved, including the President himself. \n     This story is chronicled in Chadha: The Story of an Epic \n     Constitutional Struggle by Professor Barbara Hankinson \n     Craig of Wesleyan University, and I strongly commend that \n     book to the Committee as it considers Mr. Olson's \n     nomination.\n       Second, and as this Committee is also aware, there was much \n     discussion in the early years of the first Reagan \n     Administration about the enactment of legislation to curb the \n     jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States. Much \n     of that discussion was initiated by the new Republican \n     majority on this Committee. Once again, Mr. Olson was put \n     under substantial pressure to ``play ball'' with the \n     Administration and clear the Administration to endorse such \n     legislation. Once again, he studied the issue, discussed it \n     extensively with me and other OLC lawyers, and concluded that \n     such legislation would probably be held unconstitutional. \n     That opinion was reduced to writing and served as the \n     Administration's response. No such legislation, so far as I \n     can recall, was ever seriously considered after the \n     Administration's position was communicated to Congress.\n       Third, in late 1981, I was preparing to travel to The Hague \n     on business when I was asked by Mr. Olson for my views on the \n     substantive issues raised in what ultimately became the \n     famous Bob Jones case. Although I did not have much time to \n     study those substantive issues, I advised Mr. Olson orally \n     that I feel that the Government's position taken in that case \n     was correct and would be vindicated by the Supreme Court. I \n     also advised Mr. Olson that I felt strongly that the Office \n     of the Solicitor General had an obligation to defend the \n     statute involved in that case in the Supreme Court. By the \n     time I returned from The Hague, the Bob Jones fiasco was \n     playing itself out, with a decision having been made--over \n     Mr. Olson's strong objections--that the statute would not be \n     defended by the Solicitor General. The Supreme Court \n     ultimately appointed William Coleman to defend the statute in \n     that court, and Mr. Olson's position was vindicated by, as I \n     recall, an almost unanimous decision.\n       This letter is written off the top of my head, so the \n     Committee will have to forgive me for any error in any of the \n     facts stated above that I may have made, but there is no \n     error in my conclusion that these three examples paint the \n     portrait of a lawyer scrupulously devoted to the law and \n     having the personal and intellectual integrity to place the \n     law above the politics of Washington at considerable personal \n     risk. It is that quality, after all, that it seems to me one \n     should look for in considering the nomination of any person \n     to be the Solicitor General of the United States. Mr. Olson \n     is a fierce advocate, but he is an honest advocate and a \n     person whose integrity and devotion to the law and the rule \n     of law have survived challenges to which very few public \n     servants are ever subjected.\n           Very truly yours,\n     Larry L. Simms.\n                                  ____\n\n\n   Statement of Michael J. Horowitz to the Senate Judiciary Committee\n\n       I am a Senior Fellow and Director of the Project for Civil \n     Justice at the Hudson Institute. I served as General Counsel \n     of OMB under President Reagan. I have known Ted Olson for 20 \n     years and have the highest regard for him and for his \n     professionalism, intelligence and integrity.\n       In fact, I have always found Mr. Olson's word to be \n     absolutely reliable. I have disagreed with Mr. Olson from \n     time to time on issues of policy, but I have never met a \n     person more meticulously scrupulous on matters of principle \n     or honesty.\n       Never.\n       I have read Mr. Olson's testimony in response to Senator \n     Leahy's question regarding the ``Arkansas Project,'' \n     delivered during Mr. Olson's confirmation hearing. His \n     testimony to Senator Leahy was, in all respects that I am \n     aware, wholly accurate. Specifically, I know of no respect in \n     which Mr. Olson was involved in the Project's ``origin or its \n     management.''\n       I attended one meeting in Mr. Olson's presence at which the \n     matter discussed was legal representation for David Hale, who \n     was facing Congressional testimony and was in need of \n     distinguished Washington counsel. At that meeting--at which \n     no mention I know of was made of the ``Arkansas Project'' or \n     any term like it--the subject under discussion was whether \n     Mr. Olson's firm would serve as counsel to Mr. Hale. Put \n     otherwise, I have never heard Mr. Olson discuss or imply that \n     he was involved in managing or directing either anything \n     called the Arkansas Project or any of the investigative \n     journalistic inquiries of his client, the American Spectator \n     Magazine.\n       In making the above statement, I note that I am aware of \n     nothing to suggest that the American Spectator violated the \n     law. Likewise, I believe it clear that the American \n     Spectator's journalistic and investigative activities were \n     and are fully protected by the First Amendment.\n                                  ____\n\n       I was hired in late 1993 by the American Spectator to be \n     the lead writer for what has come to be known as the \n     ``Arkansas Project.'' I originally started as a free-lance \n     writer, but was hired onto the staff of the magazine in 1994, \n     where I remained until January 1, 1999. My numerous articles \n     in the Spectator, based largely on my personal reporting in \n     Arkansas, analyzed many different aspects of Whitewater and \n     related controversies. Over the four years or so that I \n     worked for the Spectator, I traveled to Arkansas on roughly a \n     monthly basis.\n       I understand that David Brock, who for a period was another \n     writer for the magazine, has alleged that Mr. Theodore Olson \n     directed or supervised the ``Arkansas Project.'' As stated \n     above, I was the lead writer on the Project, and Mr. Olson \n     had absolutely no role in guiding my development of stories \n     for the magazine or in managing my work. Indeed, I believe I \n     only spoke to Mr. Olson once during the years in question, at \n     the end of a widely attended dinner at a Washington, D.C. \n     hotel, sometime in 1998, I believe. I sought him out to ask a \n     general question about recent, publicly reported developments \n     in the Webster Hubbell legal case. It was my impression at \n     the time that he did not recognize me, and I had to explain \n     who I was; we spoke only for about five minutes. Given that \n     we had no other meetings, conversations or other \n     communications about my work, it is false and wrong to assert \n     that Mr. Olson had any role whatsoever in managing or \n     directing what is referred to as the ``Arkansas Project.''\n       May 14, 2001.\n     James Ring Adams.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         McLean, VA, May 14, 2001.\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: I am writing to comment on matters of \n     possible relevance to President Bush's nomination of Theodore \n     B. Olson to be Solicitor General.\n       I became publisher of The American Spectator in November \n     1997. I was authorized by the board of directors to conduct a \n     review of what has been called the ``Arkansas Project.'' I \n     completed the review in 1998 and reported my findings to the \n     board. I also assisted investigators working under the \n     Whitewater independent counsel, who were charged with looking \n     into certain issues involving the project.\n       As I discovered soon after I began my review, the project \n     was conceived in the fall of 1993 by Editor-in-Chief R. \n     Emmett Tyrrell, Jr., and Richard Larry, then the executive \n     director of the Scaife foundations. The point of the project \n     was to place in Arkansas individuals who would look into \n     allegations involving then Governor Bill Clinton and relate \n     their findings to the magazine's editors and writers for \n     their review. The project contemplated the publication of \n     investigative pieces. Two Scaife foundations were prepared to \n     underwrite the project, which in grant correspondence was \n     called ``the editorial improvement project.''\n       The project was commenced in November 1993. Individuals \n     were duly retained to conduct the ``on-the-ground'' \n     researches in Arkansas, and the first editorial result of the \n     project was an article on an aspect of Whitewater, which was \n     published in February 1994. The project continued through the \n     early fall of 1997, and it produced a total (by my count) of \n     eight articles. The Scaife foundations contributed a total of \n     approximately $2.3 million, more than $1.8 million of which \n     underwrote the work of the individuals in Arkansas.\n       In my review, I found no evidence that Mr. Olson was \n     involved in the project's creation or its conduct. My own \n     sense is that Mr. Olson did not become aware of the project \n     until June 1997, when disagreements arose between the \n     magazine's then publisher and Mr. Larry over project \n     expenditures. At that time, Mr. Tyrrell, who was also \n     chairman of the board, asked Mr. Olson, a board member since \n     1996, for his assistance in resolving the dispute. When I \n     came aboard as publisher, Mr. Olson agreed that a review of \n     the project was necessary. Throughout my review, which \n     included an accounting of the monies spent on the project as \n     well as an examination of its management, methods, and \n     results, I had Mr. Olson's strong support.\n       Finally, I should add that, based upon my knowledge of the \n     magazine's financial\n\n[[Page S5594]]\n\n     records in general and those of the Scaife-funded project in \n     particular, Mr. Olson never received any payments from The \n     American Spectator for his representation of David Hale.\n       I hope these observations are of assistance.\n           Sincerely yours,\n     Terry Eastland.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                      Gahill Gordon & Reindel,\n\n                                      New York, NY, March 4, 2001.\n     Re Ted Olson\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Wahsington, DC.\n       Dear Pat: I'm not sure if Ted Olson needs a boost from the \n     other side or not for Solicitor General, but I did want to \n     offer one. Ted is just as conservative as his writings and \n     clientele suggest. But on the assumption that Larry Tribe is \n     not high on the appointment list for this Administration, I \n     did want to say that I've known Ted since we worked together \n     on a Supreme Court case--Metromedia v. San Diego--20 years \n     ago and that I've always been impressed with his talent, his \n     personal decency and his honor. He would serve with \n     distinction as Solicitor General.\n           Sincerely,\n     Floyd Abrams.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Harvard University Law School,\n\n                                     Cambridge, MA, March 5, 2001.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Pat: As one who knows Ted Olson and disagrees with him \n     on many important issues, I nonetheless write in support of \n     his confirmation as Solicitor General.\n       An explanation may be called for. After all, Ted was the \n     oral advocate who opposed me in the United States Supreme \n     Court in the first of the two arguments between Vice \n     President Gore and now President (then-Governor) Bush, and \n     Ted's were the briefs that I sought to defeat in the briefs I \n     wrote and filed for Vice President Gore in both of the two \n     Bush v. Gore cases. Ted's views of equal protection, of \n     Article II, and of 3 U.S.C. Sec. 5, were views I believed, \n     and continue to believe, are wrong. Although his views of \n     Article II and of 3 U.S.C. Sec. 5 ultimately convinced only \n     three Justices, his overall approach to the case won the \n     presidency for his client. It surely cannot be that anyone \n     who took that prevailing view and fought for it must on that \n     account be opposed for the position of Solicitor General. \n     Because Ted Olson briefed and argued his side of the case \n     with intelligence, with insight, and with integrity, his \n     advocacy on the occasion of the Florida election litigation--\n     profoundly as I disagree with him on the merits--counts for \n     me as a ``plus'' in this context, not as a minus. That his \n     views coincide with those of a current Court majority on a \n     number of vital issues as to which my views differ deeply \n     should not rule him out.\n       I am willing to believe that the five Justices who in \n     essence decided the recent presidential election thought they \n     were genuinely acting to preserve the rule of law and to \n     protect the constitutional processes of democracy from being \n     undermined by a post-election recount procedure that they \n     viewed as chaotic, lawless and essentially rigged. I believe \n     that view was profoundly misguided and that the Court's \n     majority deserves severe criticism not only for its \n     misconception of reality but also for its breathtaking \n     failure to explain its legal conclusions in terms that could \n     at least make sense to an informed but detached observer. But \n     I do not lay that failing at Ted Olson's feet; he acted as a \n     responsible (if also misguided) advocate. The blunder was the \n     Court's own doing.\n       If we set Bush v. Gore aside, what remains in Ted's case is \n     an undeniably distinguished career of an obviously \n     exceptional lawyer with an enormous breadth of directly \n     relevant experience. Although part of that career has been \n     devoted to causes with which I disagree, his briefs and \n     arguments have treated the applicable law and the underlying \n     facts honestly and forthrightly, not disingenuously or \n     deceptively. Ted seems to me capable of drawing the clear \n     distinction that any Solicitor General who has been on the \n     ramparts on various contentious issues must draw between his \n     or her own aspirations for the directions in which the law \n     should be pushed, and his or her best understanding of where \n     the law presently is and where the Supreme Court ought to be \n     nudging it, applying criteria less personal and more \n     inclusive than those driving any individual advocate. Put \n     simply, I write this letter in Ted Olson's support in the \n     expectation, and on the understanding, that his testimony \n     during his confirmation hearing, and the other evidence \n     that the Senate Judiciary Committee will gather, will show \n     him to be both able and willing not simply to articulate \n     the Administration's or his own legal philosophy but to \n     represent well the United States of America as his \n     ultimate client before the Supreme Court, keeping a firm \n     grip on what is best for that client and for the \n     Constitution, not simply for the President's philosophical \n     agenda.\n       Of course, any Solicitor General must speak for the \n     Administration he or she represents and must, within limits, \n     espouse its views. And any advocate must, to some degree, \n     draw on his or her own views in deciding what to argue and \n     how. But the special responsibility of the Solicitor General, \n     both to the Court and to the country, requires an advocate \n     with the capacity and the character, on crucial occasions, to \n     rise above his or her Administration's pet theories and to \n     advise the Court in ways that may not always advance the \n     political priories of the government. Sometimes the Solicitor \n     General must defend the actions of Congress even when those \n     actions were opposed by the Executive Branch. Sometimes the \n     Solicitor General must decline to defend the actions of \n     Congress, even when supported by the Executive, when they \n     plainly conflict with the Constitution. Myriad examples could \n     be given, but the general point is simple: Some advocates are \n     too bound up in their own views, and in their duty to their \n     immediate clients narrowly conceived, to act as counsel in \n     this broader and higher sense. Some are too blinded by their \n     own perspectives to see beyond them. Having observed Ted \n     Olson in a number of situations, and having watched his \n     career from afar, I would not expect him to be in that \n     troublesome category. I would expect him, rather, to have the \n     open-mindedness and breadth of perspective to meet the higher \n     standard I am articulating here. My letter of support, at any \n     rate, is premised on that expectation, and on the belief that \n     the confirmation hearings will bear out that optimistic \n     prediction.\n       In the end, only Ted Olson's performance in the role of \n     Solicitor General will prove whether I am right or wrong in \n     this hopeful evaluation. My strong sense, however, based on \n     what I now know, is that, as Solicitor General, Ted Olson \n     will perform his role with honor, and with distinction.\n           Best wishes always,\n     Laurence H. Tribe.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2001.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     Chairman, Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hatch and Ranking Minority Member Leahy: I \n     write in support of the nomination of Theodore B. Olson by \n     President Bush to be Solicitor General of the United States. \n     I do so having the utmost confidence in his ability, his \n     loyalty to country, his fidelity to the Constitution and his \n     personal integrity.\n       My professional and personal association with Ted Olson \n     began 20 years ago when he joined the Reagan administration \n     and served as Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal \n     Counsel under Attorney General William French Smith. I was, \n     at that time, Director of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation. Few positions in our government are more \n     sensitive or important to our government and the \n     administration of justice than is the O.L.C. Ted carried out \n     his responsibilities with a calm and steady hand, reflecting \n     legal acumen and common sense, both important attributes for \n     the ``Attorney General's lawyer''. In staff meetings his \n     input and advice seemed consistently sound.\n       In private practice I have had occasion to work with Ted on \n     some matters of common interest and have found the same high \n     level of competence and judgment. He is one of our nation's \n     foremost appellate advocates and has earned widespread \n     admiration for his analytical and advocacy skills. If he is \n     confirmed, he will serve his country and the cause of equal \n     justice under law with great dedication.\n       Ted has been a member of the Legal Advisory Committee of \n     the National Legal Center for the Public Interest, which I \n     chair. His periodic review of the work of the Supreme Court \n     has been insightful and helpful.\n       On a more personal note, I have known Ted as a thoughtful \n     and caring friend for many years. I believe him to be honest \n     and trustworthy and he has my full trust. He is the kind of \n     person I would want to turn to for help, professional or \n     otherwise, in time of need.\n       Having survived five Senate confirmations of my own, I have \n     a full awareness of the Senate's solemn responsibility to \n     advise and consent in these matters. I do hope you will give \n     some weight to the opinions of those who know and respect Ted \n     Olson. The President's choice is a very good one. I would not \n     have written this letter if I did not firmly believe this to \n     be true.\n           Respectfully,\n     William H. Webster.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                       The American Spectator,\n\n                                      Arlington, VA, May 14, 2001.\n     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hatch: Contrary to the Washington Post's May \n     11 story by Thomas B. Edsall and Robert G. Kaiser, we never \n     ``said that [Arkansas] project story ideas, legal issues \n     involving the stories produced by the project and other \n     directly related matters were discussed with Olson by staff \n     members, and at dinner parties of Spectator staffers and \n     board members.'' Apparently they got the idea from David \n     Brock. Edsall's main source on the Olson matter, and an \n     individual who has repeatedly acknowledged his deep bias \n     against Olson and his former employer The American Spectator. \n     In quoting him, the reporters might have mentioned his \n     compromised credentials.\n       Although Mr. Brock has lately claimed to have been part of \n     the so-called Arkansas Project, he was not. The record on \n     that is indisputable. During his time at the magazine\n\n[[Page S5595]]\n\n     it was clear to everyone concerned--he was very public about \n     this--that he was not part of the project. His well-known \n     ``Troopergate'' story originated and was completed before any \n     such project existed. If he spoke to Mr. Olson during those \n     years it was as a reporter pursuing his own stories and not \n     as a representative of a ``project'' he distanced himself \n     from. Pleszczynski made that clear to Edsall. Brock's present \n     claim that he was calling Olson as part of the ``project'' is \n     a deceit.\n       What is more, if Mr. Olson's firm, Gibson, Dunn and \n     Crutcher, was paid from project funds (like all recipients of \n     checks from The American Spectator), the firm would not have \n     known which internal account the magazine used for its \n     payments. For all Gibson, Dunn and Crutcher knew, the \n     magazine was paying it from funds derived from general \n     income.\n       Mr. Olson's statements that he was ``not involved in the \n     project in its origin or its management'' and that he was \n     ``not involved in organizing, supervising or managing the \n     conduct of [the magazine's investigative] efforts'' are \n     accurate and thus truthful.\n       One final point, the precedent set by politicians seeking \n     to probe the methods of payment and of reportage practiced by \n     journalists has a chilling effect on the First Amendment. We \n     would hope other journalists would recognize this danger to \n     journalistic endeavors.\n           Sincerely,\n     R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr.,\n       Editor-in-Chief.\n     Wladyslaw Pleszczynski,\n       Editor, The American Spectator Online.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a partner in the law firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher \n     LLP. I became affiliated with the firm, originally as an ``of \n     counsel'' employee, in 1993. Starting in 1994, I worked with \n     Theodore Olson on certain legal matters for the firm's \n     client, the American Spectator. That legal work included \n     legal research regarding criminal laws potentially implicated \n     by allegations of certain conduct by public officials, \n     including President and Mrs. Clinton, as reported in the \n     major media. That research was incorporated into an article \n     that the American Spectator published in 1994. The magazine \n     published the article under the by-line of ``Solitary, Poor, \n     Nasty, Brutish and Short,'' an obviously fictional law firm \n     drawn from the famous quote from Hobbes, that the magazine \n     had listed for many years on its masthead as its legal \n     counsel. It was, however, widely known that Mr. Olson and I \n     had prepared the material in the article.\n       In addition to periodic legal work for the client, Mr. \n     Olson and I over the years co-wrote similar satiric pieces \n     involving legal aspects of various matters involving the \n     Clinton Administration. Some, but not all, of those pieces \n     appeared under the ``Solitary, Poor'' by-line.\n       During my work with Mr. Olson for the American Spectator, I \n     never heard the phrase ``Arkansas Project'' until it had \n     become the subject of media reporting. I am not aware of any \n     fact that would support or in any way credibly suggest that \n     Mr. Olson was involved in the origin, management or \n     supervision of the investigative journalism projects funded \n     by one of the Scaife foundations that became know as the \n     ``Arkansas Project.'' In drafting our articles, I never spoke \n     with anyone at the American Spectator to obtain any facts, \n     relying instead on already-published media reports, and legal \n     resources such as statutes, congressional reports, and the \n     like.\n       I met David Brock years ago, and in the early 1990s on \n     occasion I would see and speak to him at parties in the \n     Washington, DC area. I have not spoken to Mr. Brock for \n     years. Starting some time ago, Mr. Brock developed a marked, \n     publicly-expressed animus toward Mr. Olson and his wife.\n       I chose to become affiliated with Gibson, Dunn primarily \n     because of Mr. Olson. Although I did not know Mr. Olson \n     personally before I interviewed with the firm, he has a \n     reputation as one of the best lawyers in Washington, a \n     rigorous and demanding lawyer with a record of unflinching \n     devotion to principle. In the years since I became affiliated \n     with the firm, I have worked closely with Mr. Olson, \n     including participation on numerous cases for the firm's \n     clients. I can personally vouch for his extremely high \n     professional standards; for his refusal to accept second-best \n     efforts from himself or anyone around him; and for his \n     fairness. I can also vouch, without reservation, for his \n     great integrity.\n       In my view, he will make an excellent Solicitor General, \n     and the Members of the Judiciary Committee should vote to \n     confirm him with confidence.\n     Douglas R. Cox.\n                                  ____\n\n       We were the two individuals charged by the American \n     Spectator with implementing what has come to be called the \n     ``Arkansas Project,'' an effort to support investigative \n     journalism in Arkansas that was specially funded by Richard \n     Mellon Scaife. (Dave Henderson also served for a while on the \n     Spectator Board.)\n       In connection with our investigative research for this \n     journalistic project, we made numerous trips to Arkansas and \n     elsewhere to speak first-hand to witnesses. Nothing that we \n     did in connection with the ``Arkansas Project'' broke the \n     law. Mr. Shaheen, a special counsel, reached the same \n     conclusion after an extended investigation. Rather, we were \n     conducting the same kind of investigative journalism, talking \n     to witnesses, reviewing documents, that many journalists do \n     every day. Such activities were not only lawful, but \n     encouraged in an open and free democracy, and fully protected \n     by the First Amendment. There was nothing at all improper \n     about the investigative fact work that we performed for the \n     American Spectator.\n       In performing our investigative work for the American \n     Spectator, we were not directed or managed in any way by \n     Theodore Olson. He did not participate, nor was he asked to \n     participate, in either the planning or conduct of the \n     ``Arkansas Project.'' Contrary assertions, made by those \n     lacking personal knowledge and with a political or personal \n     agenda, are simply false.\n       May 15, 2001.\n                                               David W. Henderson.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Hatch, I yield time \nto the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Alabama for \nyielding time to me. I have sought recognition to support the \nnomination of Theodore Olson to be Solicitor General of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. Olson comes to this position with an excellent academic and \nprofessional background. He received his law degree from the University \nof California at Berkeley in 1965 after having received a bachelor's \ndegree from the University of the Pacific in 1962. He practiced law \nwith the distinguished firm of Gibson, Dunn, and Crutcher from 1965 to \n1971 as an associate, and then as a partner for almost a decade, until \n1981. And then from 1984 to the present time--he was Assistant Attorney \nGeneral, legal counsel, for the Department of Justice from 1981 to \n1984. He came in with the administration of President Reagan.\n  I was elected in the same year, and I knew of his work, having served \non the Judiciary Committee beginning immediately after taking my oath \nof office after the 1980 election.\n  He is a real professional. He has argued some of the most important \ncases before the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  On December 11, 2000, he argued the landmark case of Gov. George W. \nBush v. Vice President Albert Gore where the decision of the Supreme \nCourt of the United States essentially decided the conflict on the \nFlorida election. I was present that day to hear that historic argument \nand can attest personally to his competency and his professionalism.\n  There have been some concerns about his partisanship. I am confident \nMr. Olson can separate partisanship from his professional \nresponsibilities as Solicitor General of the United States. It is not \nsurprising that President Bush would appoint a Republican to be \nSolicitor General, nor is it surprising that President Bush would \nappoint Ted Olson to this important position in light of Mr. Olson's \naccomplishments, his demonstration of competency, and his assistance to \nPresident Bush on that major case.\n  Some questions have been raised as to some answers Mr. Olson gave at \nthe confirmation hearing. A request was made to have an investigation \nof some of what Mr. Olson did. I took the position publicly in \ninterviews and then later in the Judiciary Committee executive session \nwhen we considered Mr. Olson's nomination, saying I was prepared to see \nand support an investigation if there was something to investigate but \nthat there had not been any allegation of any impropriety on Mr. \nOlson's part in terms of any specification as to what he was supposed \nto have said that was inconsistent or what he was supposed to have said \nthat was not true.\n  I am not totally without experience in investigative matters. But a \nstarting point of any investigation has to be an allegation, something \nto investigate. That was not provided. I called at that hearing for \nsome specification. If you make a charge, even in a civil case, there \nhas to be particularity alleged, there has to be some specification as \nto what the impropriety was, let alone wrongdoing in order to warrant \nan investigation.\n  I said at the hearing, although there was a certain amount of \ninterest in moving the nomination ahead last\n\n[[Page S5596]]\n\nThursday, that I would support an investigation and would not rush to \njudgment if there was something to investigate. But nothing was \nforthcoming to warrant an investigation. One of the Judiciary Committee \nmembers said, well, Mr. Olson was not forthcoming at the Judiciary \nCommittee hearing. I attended that hearing in part, and there were very \nfew Senators there. But if there was some concern that Ted Olson wasn't \nforthcoming, the time to go into it was at the hearing or, if not at \nthe hearing, Mr. Olson was available thereafter.\n  I asked the Senator who raised the question about his not being \nforthcoming if he had talked to Mr. Olson, and the answer was that he \nhad not. So based on the record, it is my conclusion that any of the \ngeneralized charges as to Mr. Olson haven't been substantiated at all, \nhaven't been raised to the level of specification to warrant any \nproceeding or any investigation.\n  I dare say that if those on the other side of the aisle had sought to \nblock this nomination from coming up today, there were ample procedural \nopportunities for them to do just that.\n  So on this state of the record, on the state of Ted Olson's excellent \nacademic and professional record, and his established expertise as an \nadvocate before the Supreme Court of the United States, and \nunderstanding the difference between partisanship when he is in a \npartisan context as opposed to professionalism when he is representing \nthe United States of America before the Supreme Court, I intend to \nsupport this nomination and vote aye.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Alabama, the distinguished \nSenator from Alabama. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for his \noutstanding remarks. He does, indeed, have a passion for truth and he \npursues those he believes are not telling the truth aggressively in his \nexamination and defends those he thinks are being unfairly accused. I \nhave seen his skill in committee hearings many times. Senator Specter \nraised a number of questions about the allegations that were made about \nMr. Olson. But his questions concerning the merit of the allegations \nagainst Mr. Olson were never answered. In fact, he simply asked: \n``Precisely what is it you say he was testifying falsely about?'' And I \ndon't believe a satisfactory answer to this day has been given to that \nquestion.\n  Mr. President, I support Ted Olson's nomination to be the next \nSolicitor General. I commend Senators Leahy, Daschle, Hatch, and Lott \nfor reaching an agreement to have the Olson nomination voted on today. \nCertain charges were made, but they have been investigated and, in my \nview, have been found wholly without merit. The charges were raised in \na newspaper article in the Washington Post the day that the vote was \nscheduled on Mr. Olson's nomination. Some of the Senators questioned \nthe article.\n  Subsequently, after the facts were examined, the Washington Post \nendorsed Ted Olson for this position. Nonetheless, Senator Hatch agreed \nto delay further and allow the matter to be examined even more \nthoroughly. That is why we are here today. Now that most of the \npartisan rhetoric has receded, I am glad the Senate will follow the \nmoderate and wise voices of Professor Laurence Tribe, Robert Bennett, \nBeth Nolan, Floyd Abrams, and Senator Zell Miller in moving this \nnomination to confirmation.\n  The Solicitor General is the most important legal advocate in the \ncountry. The job has been called the greatest lawyer job in the world. \nAs U.S. attorney for almost 15 years, I had the honor of standing up in \ncourt on a daily basis to say: ``The United States is ready, Your \nHonor.'' I spoke for the United States in its Federal district court \nnormally in the Southern District of Alabama. But what greater thrill \ncould there be, what greater honor than to stand before the great U.S. \nSupreme Court and represent the greatest country in the history of the \nworld and be the lawyer for that country in that great Court? Ted Olson \nis worthy of that job. He and his subordinates will shape the arguments \nin cases that come before the Federal appellate courts and, most \nimportantly, before the Supreme Court of the United States. In this \nfashion, law is shaped slowly and carefully one case at a time over a \nperiod of years.\n\n  I note, however, that I have a slight disagreement with my \ndistinguished colleague from Vermont on the question of this being an \nextraordinarily more sensitive a position than others. While it is a \nposition that requires great skill and legal acumen, the truth is that \nthe Solicitor General does not do a lot of things independently. \nBasically, the Solicitor General asks the Supreme Court, or perhaps \nsome other lesser court if he chooses, to rule one way or the other. He \nis not making decisions independently about policies or procedures such \nas an FBI Director would make or the Deputy Attorney General or the \nAttorney General. He is basically in court constrained by the justices \nbefore whom he appears. And it is, as everyone knows, critical that a \nSolicitor General maintain over a period of years credibility with the \nSupreme Court. Ted Olson, as a regular practitioner before the Supreme \nCourt of the United States, understands that and will carefully husband \nhis credibility with that Court as he has always done.\n  The Solicitor General must be a constitutional scholar of the first \norder, a lawyer and legal advocate with broad and distinguished legal \nexperience, and must possess unquestioned integrity. Ted Olson excels \nin each of these categories.\n  First, Mr. Olson is a constitutional scholar of the highest order. He \nhas studied and written about the Federalist Papers, the Framers, and \nthe Constitution. He earnestly believes in the Constitution's design of \nlimited and separated powers. He sincerely and deeply believes that the \nStates cannot deny any person equal protection of the laws. He \nunderstands that history and theory of our fundamental law. There is no \ndoubt about that, in my opinion. And he has been involved with it all \nof his professional career--in Government and out of Government, \nincluding many successful years as a partner in one of the great law \nfirms in the country: Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.\n  Second, Mr. Olson's distinguished experience as a lawyer demonstrates \nhis understanding that the Constitution has real and meaningful impact \non the lives of ordinary Americans. He has applied constitutional \ntheory as an Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal \nCounsel. That is a critical position in the Department of Justice that \nprovides legal counsel in the Department of Justice and to all \ngovernmental agencies, usually including the President of the United \nStates. He held that office in previous years. He has done this in his \nown practice when advocating before the courts, including the Supreme \nCourt of the United States.\n  In Aetna Life Insurance Company v. Lavoie, he advocated the due \nprocess rights of litigants who faced a judge who had a conflict of \ninterest in the case but would not recuse himself. He represented those \nlitigants to ensure that they would get a fair judge. In Rice v. \nCayetano, he advocated the voting rights of those excluded because of \ntheir race. And in Morrison v. Olson, he advocated the position that \nthe separation of powers principle required prosecutors to be appointed \nby the executive branch, a position that this entire Congress has now \ncome to embrace many years later. That was a courageous position he \ntook. Ultimately, Mr. Olson won because his position was validated by \nsubsequent events.\n  Mr. Olson had a legal career which has, to a remarkable degree, \nplaced him as a key player in many of the important legal battles of \nour time. It is remarkable, really. These cases, many intense, have \nenriched him. They have enhanced his judgment and wisdom. I can think \nof no one better prepared to help the President of the United States \nand the Attorney General deal with complex, contentious, and important \ncases that are surely to come as the years go by.\n  When he was before the Judiciary Committee, I asked him: ``Mr. Olson, \nare you prepared to tell the President of the United States no?''\n  Presidents get treated grandly, like corporate executives and \nGovernors, and they want to do things, and they do not want a lawyer \ntelling them they cannot do it. But sometimes there has to be a lawyer \ncapable of telling the President ``no.'' ``No, sir, you cannot do that. \nThe law will not allow that. I am\n\n[[Page S5597]]\n\nsorry, Mr. President, we will try to figure out some other way for you \nto do what you want to do; you cannot do that.''\n  I believe, based on Ted Olson's experience, his closeness to the \nPresident, the confidence the President has in him, he will be able to \ndo that better than any person in America.\n  Finally, Mr. Olson is a man of unquestioned integrity. For example, \nwhen asked on numerous occasions to criticize the justices of the \nFlorida Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore litigation, he always declined. \nHe always respected the justices and their court, and even if he \ndisagreed with their legal opinion--and his position was later \nvalidated by the U.S. Supreme Court. Mr. Olson's conduct in the most \nfamous case of this generation, as well as his reputation, won him the \nendorsement of his adversary, Professor Laurence Tribe the famed and \nbrilliant advocate for Al Gore.\n  Indeed, a President assembles an administration, and he is entitled \nto have around him people in whom he has great confidence, people whom, \nin the most critical points of his administration, he trusts to give \nhim advice on which he can rely and make decisions.\n  What greater validation is there than perhaps the greatest lawsuit of \nthis century for the Presidency of the United States, to be decided by \nthe Court, and whom did President Bush, out of all the lawyers in \nAmerica, choose? Did he want someone who was purely a political hack, \nsomeone who was a political guru, or did he want the best lawyer he \ncould get to help him win the most important case facing the country \nmaybe of the century? Whom did he choose? Isn't that a good reflection \non Ted Olson's reputation that the President chose him, and it is not \nsurprising that Al Gore chose someone of the quality of Laurence Tribe, \ntwo great, brilliant litigators in the Supreme Court that day.\n  Mr. Olson has written and he has thought deeply about constitutional \nlaw. He is not professor, however, as many of our Solicitors General \nhave been. He has been a lawyer involved in Government in all kinds of \nissues. During that time, he has gained extraordinary insight, skill, \nand knowledge about how Government works. He has incredibly unique and \nvaluable qualities to bring to this office.\n  There is simply no better lawyer and no better person to fulfill the \nawesome responsibilities of the Solicitor General of the United States \nthan Ted Olson. It is my privilege to support him and advocate his \nnomination.\n  I know there are a number of questions people will raise and have \nraised, but I believe, as Senator Specter pointed out in our hearings, \nwe have to see where the beef is, what is the substance of the \ncomplaints against him.\n\n  One of the issues that came up was that he minimized his involvement \nin the ``Arkansas Project'' and that he did not tell the truth before \nthe committee. I have the transcript of the testimony he gave.\n  This is what happened at the committee. He was sitting right there in \nthe room testifying before us. Senator Leahy went right to the heart of \nthe matter, as he had every right to do. This was his question: ``Were \nyou involved in the so-called Arkansas Project at any time?''\n  The answer:\n\n       Mr. Olson: As a member of the board of directors of the \n     American Spectator, I became aware of that. It has been \n     alleged that I was somehow involved in that so-called \n     project. I was not involved in the project in its origin or \n     its management.\n\n  No one found fault with that. That statement has not been disputed to \nthis day. There is certainly no evidence to say otherwise.\n  He stated:\n\n       I was not involved in the project in its origin or its \n     management. As I understand it, what that was was a \n     contribution by a foundation to the Spectator to conduct \n     investigative journalism. I was on the board of the American \n     Spectator later on when the allegation about the project was \n     simply that it did exist. The publisher at that time, under \n     the supervision of the board of directors, hired a major \n     independent accounting firm to conduct an audit to report to \n     the publisher and, therefore, to the board of directors with \n     respect to how that money was funded. I was on the board at \n     that time.\n\n  Mr. Olson was on the board when they conducted an investigation that \nthe board decided to do.\n  Mr. Olson continued his answer in Committee:\n\n       As a result of that investigation, the magazine, while it \n     felt it had the right to conduct these kinds of \n     investigations, decided that it was not in the best interest \n     of the magazine to do so. It ended the project. It \n     established rules to restrict that kind of activity in the \n     future.\n\n  Senator Leahy interrupted him there. If he did not say enough, \nSenator Leahy had every opportunity to ask him more questions. He was \nstill talking about it when Senator Leahy interrupted him and stopped \nhim. The transcript shows:\n\n       . . . to restrict activities of the kind in the future and \n     put it--\n       Senator Leahy:\n       And Senator Leahy asked some other questions about the same \n     matter which Mr. Olson answered and that I do not think have \n     been credibly disputed either. I submit that the man told the \n     truth absolutely, indisputably.\n\n  I really believe, as Senator Specter said in Committee, we ought to \nbe responsible around here. We ought to be careful about alleging that \na nominee for a position such as Solicitor General of the United States \nis not being honest or is somehow being dishonest about what he says. I \ndo not believe there are any facts to show that. That is why I care \nabout how we proceed, and I am glad an agreement was reached that the \nmatter could come forward.\n  On the question of Mr. Olson's integrity, we have a number of people \nwho vouch for him. Let's look at these Democrats.\n  Laurence Tribe, the professor who litigated against him in Bush v. \nGore, said:\n\n       It surely cannot be that anyone who took the prevailing \n     view [in Bush v. Gore] and fought for it must on that \n     account be opposed for the position of Solicitor General. \n     Because Ted Olson briefed and argued his side of the case \n     with intelligence, with insight, and with integrity, his \n     advocacy on the occasion of the Florida election \n     litigation--profoundly as I disagree with him on the \n     merits--counts for me as a ``plus'' in this context, not a \n     minus. If we set Bush v. Gore aside, what remains in Ted's \n     case is an undeniably distinguished career of an obviously \n     exceptional lawyer with an enormous breadth of directly \n     relevant experience.\n\n  I certainly agree with that. That is from Al Gore's lawyer.\n  Walter Dellinger, former Solicitor General under President Clinton, \nsaid when Ted Olson was at the Office of Legal Counsel he ``was viewed \nas someone who brought considerable integrity to the decision-making.''\n  Beth Nolan, former Clinton White House counsel and Reagan Department \nof Justice Office of Legal Counsel attorney in a letter said:\n\n       [W]e all hold Mr. Olson in a very high professional and \n     personal regard, because we believe that he made his \n     decisions with integrity, after long and hard reflection. We \n     cannot recall a single instance in which Mr. Olson \n     compromised his integrity to serve the expedients of the \n     [Reagan] administration.\n\n  Floyd Abrams, esteemed first amendment lawyer, stated in March 2001:\n\n       I've known Ted since we worked together on a Supreme Court \n     case--Metromedia v. San Diego--20 years ago and . . . I've \n     always been impressed with his talent, his personal decency \n     and his honor. He would serve with distinction as Solicitor \n     General.\n\n  Harold Koh, former Clinton Administration Assistant Secretary of \nState in February of this year:\n\n       Ted Olson is a lawyer of extremely high professional \n     integrity. In all of my dealings with him, I have seen him \n     display high moral character and a very deep commitment to \n     upholding the rule of law.\n  Robert Bennett, attorney for former President Bill Clinton during a \nlot of this litigation and impeachment matters also supports Mr. \nOlson's nomination. He is a well-known defense lawyer and certainly \nvery close to President Clinton. He came to the markup when we voted on \nthis in committee and sat throughout the markup. This is what he wrote \nto the Committee:\n\n       While I do not have any personal knowledge as to what role, \n     if any, Mr. Olson played in the ``Arkansas Project'' or the \n     full extent of his relationship with the American Spectator, \n     what I do know is that Ted Olson is a truth-teller and you \n     can rely on his representations regarding these matters. . . \n     . He is a man of great personal integrity and credibility and \n     should be confirmed.\n\n  So, then-Governor Bush chose a man to represent him in the biggest \ncase in his life. He chose a man who had a reputation of this kind \namong opposing lawyers, lawyers who do not agree with him politically. \nThat is what they say about him.\n  He is uniquely qualified for the job, and he has the unique \nconfidence of the\n\n[[Page S5598]]\n\nPresident of the United States. This is what we ought to do: We ought \nto give the President whomever he wants in his administration if we can \njustify doing so. If there is some serious problem, we have a right to \ninquire into that. That has been inquired into and no legitimate basis \nhas been developed on which to oppose the nomination.\n  Then the question is: ``Should a nominee be confirmed?'' And the \npresumption is that he should unless there is a problem.\n  There were a number of ``charges'' suggested. I will mention briefly \nthat Mr. Olson wrote articles for the American Spectator and received \nsome pay for some of them. He admitted that before the hearings. When \nhe was asked to produce what he published, he submitted those articles \nto the Committee. Everybody knew that. After the hearing, Senator \nKennedy said he was going to vote for him. He was satisfied. There was \nno dispute about his involvement with the magazine.\n  His opponents said Mr. Olson played word games. Mr. Olson clearly \nresponded that he wasn't involved in the management or the origin of \nthis so-called Arkansas Project, but that when he was at dinners and he \ntalked about the public Clinton scandals over dinner. Anybody knows if \nyou are at a luncheon and you are talking, or at a dinner with an \neditor and he is writing political articles of this kind, you are going \nto talk about it. But it doesn't mean he originated the project or \nmanaged the project in any way, and that is what he said, ``I did not \ndo.''\n  With respect to Mr. Olson's representation of David Hale, he plainly \nsaid that he was not compensated for that work. He said he had helped \nHale from the beginning, but that he was never paid for it--he never \ngot paid for representing him. He never denied representing David Hale, \nbeing asked by another lawyer, I believe he said, to help him. This was \nsupported by the Independent Counsel Ray who has stated that the \nShaheen Report on whether Mr. Hale was paid to testify found no \nevidence of any improprieties here.\n  With respect to an American Spectator article on Vince Foster's \ndeath, Mr. Olson did not write it. He told the magazine employees that \nhe didn't put much stock in it, but it was all right for the magazine \nto publish it. The First Amendment generally protects the press when it \npublishes articles on public figures. It is a free country. I do not \nbelieve that the magazine was sued over it. Mr. Olson didn't put much \nstock in it, but if the magazine wanted to publish it, fine. That is \nwhat I understood his statement to be. That is very different from the \nnominee writing the article or submitting it in a brief to a court.\n\n  There were questions raised about a chart that he prepared that \nshowed the federal and state criminal offenses that the Clintons could \nhave violated if public allegations were proven in a court of law. He \ngave the chart to the Committee before we even had the hearing. That \nwas something he had written and produced. We all knew about that.\n  I would just say this. A man's professional skill, his integrity, is \ndetermined and built up over a period of years. We in this body, as \nSenators, know we can make a speech here and we can misspeak, and we \nhave one of our staff, if they have a little time, go back and read it \nand correct the record.\n  A nominee cannot do that. What Ted Olson said, he said under oath. I \ndon't see he made a mistake at all. We never apologize around here. We \nmake mistakes. We misstate facts. I have done it. I try not to. As a \nformer prosecutor, I always try not to misstate the facts. I work at it \nvery hard. I still find when I leave the floor sometimes I have \nmisspoken. But are you going to call a press conference and try to \napologize? We just do it and get away with it. This man told the truth. \nI don't see where he told anything that was a lie.\n  I know there are some activists who do not want to see the man who \nhandled the Bush v. Gore case confirmed. They don't want to see \nconfirmed a man who gave legal advice to the American Spectator, who \nthought there was something rotten in Arkansas and went out and \ninvestigated it. How many of them went to jail over it? Some of them \nare still in the bastille, perhaps for crimes they committed that this \nmagazine investigated. What is wrong with that? Isn't this America? I \ndon't see anything wrong with Mr. Scaife giving money, legally, to \ninvestigate a stinking mess. That is what we had in Arkansas.\n  The Independent Counsel investigations and the impeachment were tough \ntimes for this country. Those matters are behind us. We are at a point \nnow where we have a new administration that is building its team. It is \ntime that the President be able to have his top constitutional adviser \non board, be able to do his duty.\n  I am glad we can have this debate. Some see this nomination \ndifferently. I respect their views. Ultimately, however, there is no \ndispute based on facts in the record. I am glad this nomination is \nbeing moved forward and that we can have an up-or-down vote on it.\n  I believe Mr. Olson will be confirmed. I think he should be. I am \nhonored to cast my vote for him. I urge others to do so likewise.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any time \nused in the quorum call subsequent to this be charged against both \nsides equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Hatch and Senator \nLeahy for bringing the nomination of Ted Olson to be Solicitor General \nto the floor of the Senate. I am delighted we are going to have a vote \non Mr. Olson. I know him well. I think he will be an outstanding \nSolicitor General not only for this President and this administration \nbut for our country as well.\n  Mr. Olson's qualifications are beyond reproach. He was an \nundergraduate at the University of the Pacific and received his law \ndegree from the University of California at Berkeley. He has been a \npartner at Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher, one of the nation's leading law \nfirms, from 1965 to 1981, and also from 1984 until the present time. He \nserved as Assistant Attorney General from 1981 to 1984, providing legal \nadvice to President Reagan and Attorney General William French Smith \nand other executive branch officials.\n  He has handled a lot of very important cases. Probably the best known \ncase was Bush v. Gore. No matter which side of that case you supported, \nyou had to admire the skill with which he argued a very complicated \nand, needless to say, very important case. In addition, he has argued \nnumerous other very significant cases before the Supreme Court and \nother federal and state courts. I will include for the Record a \nhighlight of seven of these important cases.\n  Ted Olson has been on both sides of the courtroom battles. He has \ndefended the Government and counseled the President. As Assistant \nAttorney General, he dealt with limiting government power as well. In \nprivate practice, he has defended private interests against the \nGovernment. In his arguments on both sides of the courtroom, he has \npresented factual cases and positions in both Federal and state courts, \narguing for the government and against the Government. That type of \nexperience is almost unequaled in a nominee for Solicitor General.\n  He will be an outstanding credit to the administration and to the \ncountry. His nomination is supported by liberals and conservatives, by \nindividuals such as Robert Bork, Robert Bennett and Laurence Tribe. \nDifferent people with different viewpoints have reached the same \nconclusion I have reached: Ted Olson will be an outstanding Solicitor \nGeneral, and he should receive our very strong support. I am delighted \nwe will be confirming him as the next Solicitor General of the United \nStates.\n\n[[Page S5599]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the list of cases to which I \nreferred in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     Leading Cases Ted Olson Argued\n\n       Ted Olson has argued or been the counsel of record in some \n     of the leading cases before the Supreme Court:\n       Rice v.

Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Theodore Bevry \nOlson, of the District of Columbia, to be Solicitor General of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof a Virginian, Theodore ``Ted'' Olson, to serve as the Solicitor \nGeneral of the United States.\n  Article II, Section 2 of the Constitution provides that the \nPresident:\n\n     shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the \n     Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the Supreme Court, and \n     all other Officers of the United States. . . .\n\n  Thus, the Constitution provides a role for both the President and the \nSenate in this process. The President has the power to nominate, and \nthe Senate has the power to render advice and consent on the \nnomination.\n  In fulfilling the constitutional role of the Senate, I have, \nthroughout my career, tried to give fair and objective consideration to \nboth Republican and Democratic Presidential nominees at all levels.\n  It has always been my policy to review nominees to ensure that the \nnominee has the qualifications necessary to perform the job, to ensure \nthat the nominee will enforce the laws of the land, and to ensure that \nthe nominee possesses the level of integrity, character, and honesty \nthat the American people deserve and expect from public office holders.\n  Having considered these factors, I have come to the conclusion that \nTed Olson is fully qualified to serve as our great Nation's next \nSolicitor General.\n  The Solicitor General's Office supervises and conducts all Government \nlitigation in the U.S. Supreme Court. The Solicitor General helps \ndevelop the Government's positions on cases and personally argues many \nof the most significant cases before the Supreme Court.\n  Given these great responsibilities, it is no surprise that the \nSolicitor General is the only officer of the United States required by \nstatute to be ``learned in the law.''\n  Mr. Olson's background in the law is impressive. He received his law \ndegree in 1965 from the University of California at Berkeley where he \nwas a member of the California Law Review and graduated Order of the \nCoif.\n  Upon graduation, Mr. Olson joined the firm of Gibson, Dunn, & \nCrutcher in 1965, becoming a partner in 1972. During this time, Mr. \nOlson had a general trial and appellate practice as well as a \nconstitutional law practice.\n  In 1981, Mr. Olson was appointed by President Reagan to serve as \nAssistant\n\n[[Page S5600]]\n\nAttorney General, Office of Legal Counsel in the U.S. Department of \nJustice. During his 4 years in this position, Mr. Olson provided \ncounsel to the President, Attorney General, and heads of the executive \nbranch departments.\n  After serving in the Reagan administration, Mr. Olson returned to \nprivate practice. He has argued numerous cases before the Supreme \nCourt, including one that we are all familiar with related to this past \nelection and the Florida election results. His vast experience in \nlitigating before the Supreme Court will serve him well as Solicitor \nGeneral.\n  Based on this extensive experience in the law, it goes without saying \nthat Mr. Olson is ``learned in the law.'' Mr. Olson is obviously \nextremely well-qualified to serve as our next Solicitor General.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I am very pleased to support Mr. Ted \nOlson today to be Solicitor General.\n  Mr. Olson is one of the most qualified people ever nominated for this \nposition. He has had an extensive and impressive legal career, \nspecializing in appellate law. He has argued many cases of great \nsignificance in the Federal courts, including 15 cases before the U.S. \nSupreme Court. He also has written extensively and testified before the \nCongress on a wide variety of legal issues.\n  In addition, he served admirably as Assistant Attorney General in the \nOffice of Legal Counsel under President Reagan. He provided expert, \nnonpartisan advice based on the law. I am confident he will do the same \nas Solicitor General. For example, he has assured the Judiciary \nCommittee that he will defend laws of Congress as long as there is any \nreasonable argument to support them.\n  Over the years, he has earned a distinguished reputation in the legal \ncommunity. In fact, he has been endorsed for this position by a wide \nvariety of people in the profession, including Harvard Law Professor \nLaurence Tribe.\n  Mr. Olson is a decent, honorable man, and a person of high character \nand integrity. He is one of the most capable and distinguished \nattorneys practicing law today.\n  Many allegations have been raised about Mr. Olson, but there is no \nmerit to these charges. The fact that allegations are raised does not \nmean they are true or that they have any significance. Based on \nreservations raised by Democrats, the Judiciary Committee has closely \nreviewed these matters. Throughout the process, Mr. Olson has been very \ncooperative and straightforward with the committee. It is true that he \nwrote in the American Spectator about the scandals of the Clinton \nadministration, and spoke with people involved with the magazine about \nthese matters. After all, the Clintons were a major focus of the \nmagazine, and there were many scandals to report about. This does not \nmean that Mr. Olson misled the committee about his knowledge of the \nArkansas Project or anything else. There is nothing to show that he has \ndone anything wrong, and there is no reason to keep searching.\n  The Washington Post, which is the primary newspaper in which the \nallegations were raised and is not known for conservative editorials, \nconcluded that Mr. Olson should be confirmed. It stated that ``there's \nno evidence that his testimony was inaccurate in any significant way.''\n  As chairman of the Constitution Subcommittee, I know that the Justice \nDepartment needs the Solicitor General to be confirmed as soon as \npossible. The representative for the United States to the Supreme Court \nis an extremely important position that has been vacant for months. For \nthe sake of justice, it is critical that the Senate acts on this \nnomination.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Olson today. He deserves our \nsupport. I recognize that members have the right to vote against a \nnominee for any reason. But, if they do, I firmly believe they will be \nvoting against one of the finest and most able men we have ever \nconsidered for Solicitor General.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have so far voted for all of President \nBush's nominees for positions in the Department of Justice and other \nexecutive branch departments. As I have explained before, I believe \nthat the President's choices for executive positions are due great \ndeference by the Senate. I am very reluctant to vote against a \nqualified nominee for such a position. I have been criticized for some \nof my votes on this President's nominations, including my vote for \nAttorney General Ashcroft, and I'm sure I will take criticism for some \nof my votes in the future.\n  But, I have never said I will vote for every executive branch \nnominee, and today I must vote ``No'' on the nomination of Theodore \nOlson to be Solicitor General of the United States.\n  I am disappointed that the Senate is moving so quickly to a vote on \nthis nomination. I believe that serious questions exist about Mr. \nOlson's candor in his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. \nAlthough there has been some further inquiry about these matters in the \npast week, after the Judiciary Committee voted 9-9 on Mr. Olson's \nnomination, the Senate has not had time to review and digest even the \nlimited additional information that the inquiry uncovered. Without \nfurther time to resolve the questions that our committee's work has \nraised, I cannot in good conscience vote for Mr. Olson.\n  Simply put, I am concerned that Mr. Olson was not adequately \nforthcoming in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee \nparticularly on the issue of his involvement with the so-called \n``Arkansas Project,'' which was an effort to unearth scandals involving \nformer President Clinton and his wife, undertaken by the American \nSpectator magazine with funding from Richard Mellon Scaife. Let me \nemphasize that I am not alleging that Mr. Olson committed perjury or \ntold an out and out lie. But it seems to me that Mr. Olson was \nattempting to minimize his participation in the Arkansas Project and \nportray it in the least objectionable light to those of us on the \nDemocratic side, rather than simply answering the questions \nforthrightly and completely. As the dispute developed, Mr. Olson's \nsupporters have gone to great lengths to argue that he answered \ntruthfully when he said: ``I was not involved in the project in its \norigin or its management.'' But Senator Leahy did not ask if he was \ninvolved in the origin or management of the Arkansas Project. He asked: \n``Were you involved in the so-called Arkansas Project at any time.'' \nMr. Olson was not adequately forthcoming in his answer to that \nquestion.\n  The Solicitor General of the United States is an extremely important \nposition in our government. It is not only the third ranking official \nin the Justice Department, it is the representative of the executive \nbranch before the Supreme Court of the United States. I want the person \nin that position to be not just technically accurate and truthful in \nanswering the questions of the Justices, but to be forthcoming. I want \nthe Solicitor General to answer the Justices' questions not as a \nhostile witness would, narrowly responding only to the question asked \nand revealing as little information as possible, but as a trusted \ncolleague would, trying to give as much relevant information as \npossible in response not only to the question as framed, but to the \nsubstance of the question that the Justice might have been asking, but \nmight not have precisely articulated.\n  That is also how I want nominees before Senate committees to answer \nquestions. Our questions at nominations hearings are not a game of \n``gotcha.'' We are not trying to trap nominees. We are attempting to \nelicit information that is relevant to our decision as to whether a \nnominee should serve in the office to which he or she has been \nnominated. We deserve forthcoming and complete answers, not just \ntechnically truthful answers. We shouldn't have to frame our questions \nso precisely as to preclude an evasive or disingenuous answer. We are \nnot in a court of law. We don't ask leading questions of nominees in \norder to pin them down to ``yes'' or ``no'' answers. We want and expect \nnominees to give us complete and open answers, to put on the record all \nthe information they have at their disposal that will help us exercise \nour constitutional duty to advise and consent.\n  Many Senators were concerned about Mr. Olson's highly partisan \nwritings about the previous Administration, and particularly about the \nDepartment of Justice under the previous Attorney General. They were \nconcerned about Mr. Olson's association with an organized and well-\nfunded attempt to dig up dirt on the President of the United\n\n[[Page S5601]]\n\nStates. They asked questions to find out what Mr. Olson did, and what \nhe knew. It was not just a question of whether Mr. Olson did something \nillegal or improper. Each Senator was and is entitled to make his or \nher own judgment about whether Mr. Olson's involvement with the \nArkansas Project, whatever it was, is relevant to his fitness to serve \nas Solicitor General. We were entitled to complete and forthcoming \nanswers to the questions that were asked. We did not get them.\n  Mr. Olson's failure to be forthcoming in his testimony has led me to \nhave concern about his ability to serve as Solicitor General, \nespecially given the special duties of that office. I would not vote \nagainst him simply because of his conservative views and record. I am \nconcerned about his fitness to be Solicitor General.\n  Mr. Olson testified that the Solicitor General owes the Supreme Court \n``absolute candor and fair dealing.'' I think that nominees owe Senate \ncommittees that same duty when they testify at nominations hearings. I \ndo not think that Mr. Olson met that standard and I don't think the \nprocess surrounding this nomination has allowed Senators adequately to \nconsider this important exercise of their duty to advise and consent. I \ntherefore, with regret, must oppose his nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as I stated at the beginning of this \ndebate, of course I respect the will of the Senate and the vote of \nevery Senator.\n  I hope now that Mr. Olson has been confirmed as Solicitor General, he \nwill listen very carefully to the debate and handle that position with \nthe nonpartisanship and candor the office requires.

DINH TO BE AN ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Viet D. Dinh of the \nDistrict of Columbia to be an Assistant Attorney General.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I strongly support the nominations of \nMichael Chertoff to be Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal \nDivision and Viet Dinh to be Assistant Attorney General for the Office \nof Policy Development.\n  Both nominees have outstanding qualifications. Mr. Chertoff graduated \nwith honors from both Harvard College and Harvard Law School, then \nserved as a law clerk for Justice Brennan of the U.S. Supreme Court. He \nalso served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of \nNew York, and as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. In \n1994, Mr. Chertoff served as Special Counsel for the U.S. Senate \nSpecial Committee to Investigate Whitewater and Related Matters. Most \nrecently he has worked as a partner at the prestigious law firm of \nLatham & Watkins, where he is national chair of the firm's white collar \ncriminal practice. He was also appointed Special Counsel by the New \nJersey Senate Judiciary Committee in its inquiry into racial profiling \nby state police. As his distinguished career illustrates, Mr. Chertoff \nis well suited to lead the Department of Justice Criminal Division--\nwhich explains why his nomination has received significant bipartisan \nsupport.\n  Viet Dinh is likewise eminently qualified for the position of \nAssistant Attorney General for the Office of Policy Development. As Mr. \nDinh told us during his confirmation hearing, he came to this country \nfrom Vietnam when he was ten years old under extraordinarily difficult \ncircumstances. He went on to graduate from Harvard College and then \nHarvard Law School with honors. Mr. Dinh completed two federal \nclerkships, one for Judge Laurence Silberman on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the D.C. Circuit, and the other for Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor on the Supreme Court. He then served as Associate Special \nCounsel to the Senate Special Committee to Investigate Whitewater. In \n1996, he became a professor at Georgetown University Law Center, where \nhe received tenure last year. His academic writings evince a sharp \nlegal mind and keen judgment--attributes that are essential to lead the \nOffice of Policy Development.\n  Both Mr. Dinh and Mr. Chertoff have distinguished themselves with \nhard work and great intellect. I am confident that they will do great \nservice to the Department of Justice and the citizens of this country, \nand I support their nominations wholeheartedly.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Viet Dinh, \nthe President's nominee to be Assistant Attorney General for the Office \nof Policy Development. I have had the pleasure of knowing him both \nprofessionally and personally over the past several years and cannot \nimagine a more qualified candidate for this position.\n  Professor Dinh's journey began 23 years ago on a small fishing boat \noff the coast of Vietnam. For 12 days, the ten-year-old Viet and 84 \nothers fought storms, hunger, and gunfire as their boat drifted in the \nSouth China Sea. Fortunately, Viet, his mother, and six siblings, \nreached a refugee camp after coming ashore in Malaysia. After being \nadmitted to the United States Viet's family arrived in Oregon and later \nmoved to California, where Viet became a U.S. citizen.\n  Those early years presented many challenges for Viet and his family. \nThey had little money and worked long hours in the berry fields. \nMoreover, Viet's father had been incarcerated in Vietnam because of his \nrole as a city councilman. It was not until 1983 that they were finally \nreunited after his father's successful escape from Vietnam.\n  Despite this tumultuous beginning, Dinh persevered. More than that, \nhe excelled. Perhaps those early obstacles hardened Viet's resolve and \nfueled his rapid ascent through the legal profession.\n  Viet graduated magna cum laude from both Harvard College and Harvard \nLaw School, where he was a class marshal and an Olin Research Fellow in \nlaw and economics. He served as a law clerk to Judge Laurence H. \nSilberman of the U.S. Court Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and to U.S. \nSupreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor.\n\n[[Page S5602]]\n\n  Shortly after Viet completed his Supreme Court clerkship, he came to \nwork for the U.S. Senate, where I had the opportunity to work with him \nfor the first time. He quickly demonstrated his outstanding legal \nability, superb professional judgment, and fine character.\n  Professor Dinh's record of achievement continued in academia. Viet \ncurrently is a professor of law at Georgetown University, where he is \nthe deputy director of the Asian Law and Policy Studies Program. In \naddition to his expertise in Asian law, Professor Dinh is accomplished \nin constitutional law, corporate law, and international law. He has \nalso served as counsel to the special master mediating lawsuits by \nHolocaust victims against German and Austrian banks.\n  Since he left the Senate, I have called on him from time to time for \ncounsel on constitutional issues. On each occasion, Viet exhibited a \ncomprehensive knowledge of the law and extraordinary energy.\n  In closing, I believe that Professor Dinh's character, along with his \ndistinguished academic and professional accomplishments, make him \nuniquely qualified to serve in the Department of Justice. It is, thus, \nwith great pleasure that I will vote for his confirmation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am prepared to vote in favor of Professor \nDinh's nomination to be the Assistant Attorney General for the Office \nof Policy Development at the Department of Justice. I do so, however, \nwith reservations.\n  Like other members of the committee, I admire Professor Dinh and his \nfamily for the courage they displayed during their extraordinary \njourney to this country from Vietnam. I also do not question \nProfessor's Dinh's obvious intelligence or his academic achievements. \nIf we were evaluating a nominee for a teaching position, I would vote \nfor him without hesitation.\n  However, I am concerned by Professor Dinh's relative lack of \nexperience for the position in the Department of Justice for which he \nhas been nominated. One of the major responsibilities of the Office of \nPolicy Development at the Department of Justice, which Professor Dinh \nhas been nominated to head, is the evaluation of the qualifications and \nfitness of candidates for the Federal judiciary. Yet Professor Dinh, as \nhe concedes, has never appeared as an attorney in a court of law. Aside \nfrom being a law clerk and an academic, Professor Dinh's principal \nreal-world experience since graduating from law school in 1993 has been \nas associate counsel to the Republicans in the Senate Whitewater \ninvestigation of President Clinton. While that was no doubt an \nexcellent introduction to the world of partisan politics, it hardly \nprovides a model of the apolitical and unbiased pursuit of justice that \nought to characterize the operations of the United States Department of \nJustice.\n  I am also concerned by Professor Dinh's testimony about his \ninvolvement with the Federalist Society. In answer to questions by \nSenator Durbin, Professor Dinh testified that he did not know whether \nthe Federalist Society had a stated philosophy and that he viewed it \nsimply as ``a forum for discussion of law and public policy from both \nsides.'' (Tr. 71, 73). Yet the Federalist Society itself states quite \nprominently on its internet website that it is ``a group of \nconservatives and libertarians interested in the current state of the \nlegal order'' and concerned with the alleged domination of the legal \nprofession ``by a form of orthodox liberal ideology which advocates a \ncentralized and uniform society.'' I do not, of course, suggest that \nmembership in the Federalist Society should disqualify someone from \npublic office, any more than should membership in other organizations \nsuch as the American Civil Liberties Union that seek to promote a \nparticular political philosophy or agenda. Nevertheless, it is simply \nnot accurate to portray the Federalist Society as a non-partisan \ndebating society.\n  In his writings, Professor Dinh, like other members of the Federalist \nSociety, has condemned what is sometimes called ``judicial activism.'' \nHowever, when I asked Professor Dinh in my written questions to cite \nsome specific cases where courts that had occurred, the only example he \nprovided was a California decision from 1854 that dealt with the \ndisqualification of persons of Chinese ancestry from testifying in \ncourt. While obviously no one would disagree with Professor Dinh's \ncondemnation of that odious decision, his answer is not particularly \nenlightening as to what he views as the proper limits on the role of \nthe judiciary in the 21st century. Many legal scholars regard the \nSupreme Court's decision in Bush v. Gore as a recent and obvious \nexample of a court's overstepping its role and improperly injecting \nitself into the political arena. Yet, when I asked Professor Dinh \nspecifically about that case in my written questions, he stated that, \nin his opinion, the Supreme Court Justices had ``exercised their \njudgment in a thoughtful and prudent manner given the nature of the \ncase, the rulings below and the constraints of time.''\n  Despite my misgivings, I have decided to vote in favor of Professor \nDinh's nomination. I believe that he has answered the Committee's \nquestions. I am giving him the benefit of all doubts and giving \ndeference to the President's decision with respect to this appointed \npolicy position. Moreover, regardless of Professor Dinh's political \nviews and associations, I credit his assurances that he will exercise \nhis judgment based upon the merits of legal positions and judicial \ncandidates he is called upon to evaluate rather than on political \nideology.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Viet D. Dinh, \nof the District of Columbia, to be an Assistant Attorney General?

Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Michael \nChertoff, of New Jersey, to be an Assistant Attorney General.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the nomination of \nMichael Chertoff to be Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal \nDivision. Mr. Chertoff has ably served the citizens of New Jersey in \nnumerous capacities, as well as the Department of Justice and indeed \nthe Nation. We will all be fortunate to have his tremendous skills at \nthe helm of the Criminal Division.\n  Mr. Chertoff has impeccable credentials, not the least of which is \nbeing a native New Jerseyan. He attended Harvard College, then Harvard \nLaw\n\n[[Page S5603]]\n\nSchool, where he was Editor of the Harvard Law Review. He then served \nas a Supreme Court law clerk. In both private practice and public \nservice since then he has developed a reputation as a brilliant, tough, \nfair, and truly world class litigator, and earned the respect of his \npeers and adversaries. Indeed, one New Jersey paper has even suggested \nhe might be New Jersey's ``Lawyer Laureate.'' While I should \nacknowledge that we might not agree on every issue, I consider Mr. \nChertoff to be one of the finest lawyers my State has to offer.\n  From 1990 to 1994, Mr. Chertoff served New Jersey exceptionally well \nas our U.S. Attorney, where he tackled organized crime, public \ncorruption, health care fraud and bank fraud. Unlike his predecessors, \nas U.S. Attorney he continued to try cases himself, and his long hours \nand unending commitment to the job and the citizens of New Jersey were \nlegendary. He tackled the highest-profile cases in a serious and \nthoughtful manner, and, despite being one of the youngest U.S. \nAttorneys in the Nation, raised the profile and reputation for \nexcellence of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Newark.\n  More recently, Mr. Chertoff has played a critical role in helping the \nNew Jersey State legislature investigate racial profiling. As Special \nCounsel to the State Senate Judiciary Committee, he helped the \ncommittee probe how top state officials handled racial profiling by the \nState Police. His work was bipartisan and thoroughly professional, and \nhelped expose the fact that for too long, state authorities were aware \nthat statistics showed minority motorists were being treated unfairly \nby some law enforcement officials, and yet ignored the problem.\n  Mr. Chertoff is one of our Nation's most competent and respected \nlawyers, with a very distinguished record of public and private \nservice. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of his nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am voting in favor of Mr. Chertoff's \nnomination to be the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal \nDivision at the Department of Justice.\n  I have been concerned that Mr. Chertoff, like several of the \nPresident's other nominees for top positions in the Department of \nJustice, has a history of partisan political activities. Mr. Chertoff \nwas special counsel to the Republicans in the Senate Whitewater \ninvestigation of President Clinton, which hardly provided a model for \nthe apolitical and unbiased search for justice that ought to \ncharacterize the operations of the United States Department of Justice.\n  Fortunately, however, Mr. Chertoff also has an established track \nrecord as a Federal prosecutor apart from his involvement with the \nWhitewater Committee. More importantly, he has answered the committee's \nquestions about his political activities and has given appropriate \nassurances that he will not allow partisanship to influence the \nexercise of his judgment on the legal merits of questions he will \naddress as the Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division. I \ncredit his assurances, and for that reason I am voting for his \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Michael Chertoff, of New Jersey, to be an \nAssistant Attorney General? On this question the yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Mr. President, I rise for a couple of minutes to briefly \ndiscuss the change that occurred today in the Senate and to share some \nthoughts, if I may.\n  First, I think I can safely speak for virtually all of us in this \nChamber on both sides of the aisle in expressing our affection for our \ncolleague from Vermont. He has been a friend to us for many years. He \nis known in this body as a good and decent man. I have no doubt that \nthe high esteem in which he has been held will continue.\n  Secondly, I think it bears mentioning that despite the change in the \ncaucus ratio that will soon occur, the Senate is going about its \nbusiness today much as it did yesterday and much as I am confident it \nwill in the days to come. That is how this institution functions, and \nwhether ratios change by 1 or 2 in one direction or the other is \ncertainly big political news for some, I guess. My guess is that the \nsubstantive work will continue much as it has, with us having to work \nout differences and compromise to benefit the public at large.\n  This conduct of business according to established and familiar \nroutines is a good sign that the Senate will to a large degree continue \nto operate on a bipartisan basis to accomplish the work the American \npublic sent us here to do.\n  This change will, without a doubt, have an impact on committee \nratios, on the subject of hearings and witnesses, and on the substance \nof legislation we will consider, to some degree. However, just as \nimportant, it should--and I believe will--cement the need for \nbipartisanship in how we conduct our business and in how we govern \ntogether\n\n[[Page S5604]]\n\nwith the administration and the other body.\n  We in the Democratic Caucus now share a new responsibility with our \nRepublican friends for addressing and advancing, as equal partners, the \ninterests of the larger American public. I know of nobody in our caucus \nwho shrinks from or shirks that responsibility. Indeed, I think we all \nwelcome it.\n  Likewise for our Republican friends, bipartisanship will now become \nas much a necessity for them as it has been for us Democrats.\n  Perhaps most importantly, it will not be enough any longer to embrace \nbipartisanship in word; we will from now on have to demonstrate it in \ndeeds as well. I look forward to beginning this new chapter in the \nSenate's history with all of our colleagues.\n  On that score, allow me to say that I hope one of the first orders of \nbusiness we will take up after reorganizing will be election reform. I \nrealize we have many important matters to consider regarding education, \na Patients' Bill of Rights, prescription drugs, energy, the \nenvironment, environmental protection, minimum wage, and foreign and \ndefense policies. The list is rather long and tremendously worthwhile.\n  But I submit to our colleagues that election reform is also an issue \nthat deserves our early consideration in the Senate. It is an issue of \nfundamental importance for the simple reason that it concerns the most \nfundamental of American rights, the right to vote. I know a number of \nour colleagues on both sides of the aisle have given various opinions \non this matter, and even drafted legislation. These include my \ncolleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, Senator Hollings, Senator \nMcConnell of Kentucky, Senator Schumer, Senator Brownback, Senator \nTorricelli, and others.\n  There are a lot of ideas kicking around on how we might improve the \nelectoral process in this country. The list reflects a widespread and \nbipartisan recognition that the events of last November--not just in \nFlorida and not just last November, but ones that have been ongoing for \na number of years--illustrate that our electoral system is in need of \nrepair and reform. With only one-half of all the eligible voters in \nthis country participating in a Presidential election and one-quarter \nof those eligible voters choosing the President of the United States, \nthen I think all of us recognize that, if we do nothing else, there is \nneed for reform that would make this process more inclusive, to reach \nout to every American who is not participating in this process.\n  I hope we will act in that recognition in the weeks to come, and I \nhope we will pass legislation which ensures that many of the mistakes \nand wrongs, if you will, in the electoral process will forever be \nevents of the past, never to be repeated.\n  Congressman John Conyers of Michigan and I have introduced \nlegislation that will establish some minimum national requirements to \nensure that voters, on Presidential races and races involving the \nNational Legislature, regardless of race, disability, or language \nminority, will not be turned away from the polls in the next \nPresidential election. This legislation has well over 100 cosponsors in \nthe House of Representatives, the other body, and 50 cosponsors in this \nChamber.\n  This bill would establish three commonsense requirements:\n  First, that all voting machines and systems used in Federal \nelections, starting in the year 2004, conform to uniform, \nnondiscriminatory standards to ensure that no voter will be \ndisenfranchised because of race; that blind and disabled voters can \nvote with independence and privacy; language minorities can read \nballots and instructions in their native language; and all of us can \nvote with the assurance that our vote will not be canceled because of \novervotes, undervotes, or outdated machinery.\n\n  Second, the bill requires that all States provide for provisional \nvoting so that no voter who goes to the polls is told he or she cannot \nvote because their name is not on a registration list or their \nidentification is not good enough.\n  Third, and lastly, the bill provides that all voters receive a copy \nor sample ballot with instructions on how to vote, including their \nrights as voters.\n  In this Senator's view, with any legislation that doesn't include \nthese three national requirements is simply unacceptable.\n  Bills that only offer, on a voluntary basis, funding for States to \ntake certain actions will not ensure that Americans--African Americans, \nHispanic Americans, Asian Americans, the blind and disabled, and many \nothers--working men and women across the country, can exercise their \nmost precious right to vote and to have their vote counted.\n  Forty-seven years ago this month, the Supreme Court issued its \nlandmark decision in the case of Brown v. Board of Education. On that \nMay day, the Court did not rule that States could desegregate their \nclassrooms. It ruled that they would do so ``with all deliberate \nspeed,'' in the now famous words of that decision.\n  Thirty-seven years ago, when we wrote the Civil Rights Act, the \nCongress did not say that restaurants, stores, hotels, and other public \naccommodations could desegregate their facilities. We decreed that they \nwould do so, and do so without delay.\n  When, in 1965, we passed the Voting Rights Act, the Congress did not \nsay States could, if they so chose, do away with barriers to voting \nsuch as poll taxes and literacy tests. We said they had to do away with \nit because the right to vote was far too precious and too vital to be \nin any way denied to any American citizen based on race or ethnicity.\n\n  Lastly, when in 1990 Bob Dole and President George Bush joined with \nGeorge Mitchell, Ted Kennedy, and others to enact the Americans with \nDisabilities Act, we did not leave it to chance as to whether public \nfacilities would be accessible to the disabled. We decided as a country \nthat the time had come to remove those barriers to access.\n  At critical moments, whether it was to go to a restroom or a \nrestaurant or to have access to a hotel or any other public \naccommodation, we said that people had the right to be there, and in \nthe case of a voting booth, it certainly ought to hold no less a status \nthan a restaurant, restroom, hotel, or any other public accommodation. \nPeople ought to have the right to be in that voting booth, to cast \ntheir vote and have it counted.\n  At critical moments in our history, such as those I just enumerated, \nour Nation has been resolved in advancing the cause of equality and \nfreedom. We have not settled for voluntary measures when fundamental \nrights were at stake. I believe the same resolve is called for at this \nmoment in our history when we know that so many Americans, perhaps \nmillions, were denied the right to vote and the right to have their \nvote counted. With the same resolve demonstrated in times past, we can \nassure that will never happen again in America as it was so unjustly \ndenied to many in the previous elections.\n  I urge my colleagues to take a look at the proposed legislation. When \nwe return after the break, I invite any comments, thoughts, and ideas \non how this bill can be improved, but I hope there will be strong \nbipartisan support for this effort. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/24/senate-section/article/S5604-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5604-S5605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF NANCY BRIANI\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a member of my \nstaff, Nancy Briani, who will be retiring from the Senate at the end of \nthis month. She will be sorely missed by me and all who have had the \nopportunity to work with her.\n  Nancy began her career in the Senate 25 years ago when she joined the \nstaff of Senator Jim Pearson of Kansas as a receptionist.\n  Following Senator Pearson's retirement in 1978, Nancy became office \nmanager for his successor--Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum. From the \nsetting up of that freshman Senator's office to closing down operations \nand turning in the keys 18 years later, Nancy was there and remains a \nvery close friend of Senator Kassebaum.\n  She has approached her job as office manager in a diligent and \nmethodical fashion. She recognizes that well-organized support \nfunctions are a critical foundation in the hectic and fast-paced \nenvironment of a Senate office. Nancy has consistently brought to her \nwork a\n\n[[Page S5605]]\n\nquiet, but firm, determination to see that things are done properly. \nShe stayed, as we were taught many years ago, until it was done right.\n  During her tenure in the Senate, Nancy helped guide her coworkers \nthrough the transition from 3-color carbon sets to the computer age, \nand she is a good manager of computers. It fell upon her to determine \nhow to file the ``yellows'' in a post-carbon era and how to assure that \ndocuments were not ``lost in space'' due to haphazard filing and \nforgotten file names.\n  Her proofreading skills are not limited to catching typos. Rather, \nshe brings to bear the full force of her early experience and training \nas a teacher. One of the most well thumbed cards in her Rolodex is that \nof the Grammarphone--a grammar hotline operated by Frostburg State \nUniverstity--to make sure our material goes out correctly. After all, a \nSenator ought to know how to punctuate correspondence.\n  Shortly after my election to the Senate in 1996, I had the good \nfortune of bringing Nancy onto my staff after Nancy Kassebaum retired. \nHer years of experience and her solid professionalism proved invaluable \nto me in putting together my office here in Washington.\n  Her effective management of the day-to-day operations of my office \nhas made a real difference in my ability to serve the people of \nAlabama.\n  The work that Nancy has done in her 25 years of service in the Senate \ndoes not produce headlines in the newspaper or segments on TV talk \nshows. Indeed, this is the first time in her 25 years that she has come \non to the floor of the Senate Chamber. Young staff members get to do \nthat if they are working on legislation, but she has been doing her job \nmanaging the work product in our office.\n\n  In fact, the best mark of success for an office manager is that the \nsmooth operation of an office is taken for granted. In that, Nancy has \nexcelled.\n  The truth is that Nancy lives by the greatest American virtues. She \nis directly honest, she is exceedingly diligent in her work, always \ntaking care to ensure that things are completed and done right. I have \ngreatly admired her frugality, a trait that has fallen from favor but \nwhich is much needed today. She watches every penny of the taxpayers' \nmoney in a way I greatly admire.\n\n  In a host of ways, Nancy has lived by these great American values and \nhas taught them to hundreds of young people who have worked with her as \ninterns and young staffers over the years. Such richness of \ncontribution simply cannot be replaced.\n  As Nancy leaves the Senate to start a new chapter in her life, she \ncan take great pride and satisfaction in the accomplishments she has \nmade and the respect she has earned.\n  Just today, staff people from all over this Senate were in our office \nexpressing their admiration for her as she had a reception this \nafternoon. I am grateful for her efforts and the dedication as a member \nof my staff. I wish her and her husband, Vince, who retired a few years \nago after a career with NASA--he was with NASA during the glory days of \nthe space age--I wish Nancy and her husband, Vince, all the best in \ntheir future years. We look forward to seeing you both on a regular \nbasis and thank you again for the great contributions you have made to \nthe success of our office and to the people of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/24/senate-section/article/S5605-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VETERANS HISTORY PROJECT\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I call to the attention of the Senate the \nVeterans History Project that is currently being developed by the \nLibrary of Congress.\n  This is a project that is dear to the hearts of all Americans and a \nproject to which the Congress gave our unanimous support when we passed \nPublic Law 106-380 last fall. Jut as a new memorial on the Mall will \nhonor our WW II veterans, a living memorial to all our war veterans \nwill be created by the Veterans History Project. This project, which is \npart of the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress, will \ncollect oral histories, along with letters, diaries, photographs, and \nother papers from veterans of World War I, World War II and the Korean, \nVietnam, and Persian Gulf wars, as well as from those who served in \nsupport of them. The Veterans History Project will create this national \ncollection by creating partnerships and encouraging participation from \na wide range of veterans' organizations, military installations, civic \ngroups, museums, libraries, historical societies, students and \nteachers, colleges and universities, and citizens and the families of \nour veterans nationwide.\n  This is an important national project and one that we should continue \nto support. Of the 19 million war veterans living in our Nation today, \nnearly 1,500 of them die each day--1,100 of them having served in World \nWar II. While their own monument is under construction, we can build a \nlasting national collection that will preserve their wartime memories, \nactions and experiences. Through this national project we have to \nencourage local projects and local archives that will collect oral \nhistories of all our war veterans for our children and our children's \nchildren.\n  This is a project worthy of consideration by all Senators as they \nreturn home for Memorial Day. That is the reason I come to the Chamber.\n  I thank our colleagues in the Senate, Senator Chuck Hagel and Senator \nMax Cleland for bringing this opportunity to us and to the citizens of \nour great Nation--a lasting democracy due to the sacrifices of the men \nand women honored by the Veterans History Project.\n  I will support funding for this project and for the operations of the \nLibrary's American Folklife Center, where the veteran's collections \nwill be preserved and shared with all. Nearly all of us have worked \nclosely with the American Folklife Center. Many of you will recall the \nrecent Local Legacies Project, done for the Library of Congress \nbicentennial last year, and other programs it has undertaken over the \nyears.\n  As we approach Memorial Day I ask the Senate to reaffirm our \ncommitment to our veterans and show our support for the Veterans \nHistory Project. As a grateful nation, we must preserve and honor their \nmemories for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/24/senate-section/article/S5605-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5605-S5606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                A VICTORY FOR PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT KIDS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, at the beginning of this year, the State of \nMichigan enacted a ``shall issue'' law that makes it easier to obtain a \nconcealed carry permit and will increase the number of guns on our \nstreets. The law, which was scheduled to go into effect on July 1, \n2001, takes discretion away from local gun boards and requires \nauthorities to issue a license to carry a concealed weapon to any \napplicant who meets basic eligibility requirements.\n  Most law enforcement groups in Michigan reject the proliferation of \nconcealed weapons in our communities and warn that this law will move \nour State in a dangerous direction. Similarly, gun safety groups, \nincluding the Michigan Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence and the \nMichigan Million Mom March, have voiced their concerns that the \nexpected ten-fold increase in the number of concealed weapons on \nMichigan's streets would jeopardize the safety of our children. These \nand other groups that oppose the ``shall issue'' law joined together to \nform the coalition of People Who Care About Kids and successfully \ncollected more that 230,000 signatures on a petition calling for a \nreferendum on the law.\n  Last week, the Michigan State Court of Appeals came down on the side \nthe voters of the State, agreeing that they should be able to decide on \nthe law in a referendum. The appeals panel stated that ``the \noverarching right of the people to their `direct legislative voice' '' \noverrides a constitutional prohibition against referenda for laws that \ninclude spending provisions. Unless the decision is overturned by the \nMichigan Supreme Court, the voters of Michigan will be able to voice \ntheir opinions on the ``shall issue'' law in a referendum in November \n2002.\n  This unanimous decision by the State Court of Appeals panel is not \nonly a victory for the voters of Michigan, but also for the safety of \nour children and the security of our communities. I am convinced the \npeople of Michigan want to find ways to decrease the amount of gun \nviolence in our communities, not remove discretion from local gun \nboards with the goal of increasing the number of guns on our\n\n[[Page S5606]]\n\nstreets. I am pleased that they will have a say in this important issue \nthat so directly impacts their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/24/senate-section/article/S5606-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     FINAL PASSAGE OF THE TAX BILL\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this is a sad day for the U.S. Senate \nand America's economic future. Yesterday we rushed through an \nunbalanced, backloaded, overbloated tax-cut that we literally cannot \nafford, that runs a substantial risk of driving us back into the ditch \nof deficits and higher interest rates, and in the end could affect our \nlong-term prosperity which we have worked so hard to build. And for \nwhat purpose? To meet the arbitrary deadline of passing a bill by \nMemorial Day.\n  This bill and the whole process for considering it is a case study in \nirresponsibility, not just fiscally but governmentally. By squandering \nthe surplus this way, we are squandering an historic opportunity to \nmeet a number of national needs and to strengthen our economic security \nin the coming years. We lost an opportunity to pass not just a tax plan \nbut a prosperity plan, geared to long-term economic growth. We lost an \nopportunity to pay down the debt and keep interest rates low.\n  We may well have lost an opportunity to pass a strong prescription \ndrug benefit and strengthen the long-term stability of Medicare and \nSocial Security for the retirement of the baby boom generation. And we \nmay have lost an opportunity to make strategic investments in \neducation, job training, scientific research--all of which we know are \ncritical to expanding the winners' circle in this innovation economy. \nIn short, we lost an opportunity to make the surplus work for us. \nInstead, we have given it all away in a tax cut tilted to give the most \nhelp to those who need it least.\n  I support tax cuts, and have voted for tax cuts, but they should be \ncuts we can afford. Some of the tax reductions for which I have \nadvocated were included in this bill as part of the manager's \namendment. Specifically, this amendment makes the R tax credit \npermanent, an issue on which I have been working for many years, makes \na start on college tuition deductibility, and accelerates the wage \ncredits for Round II Enterprise Zones, a program I have supported from \nits inception. These provisions, however, do not make up for the fiscal \nirresponsibility and lack of vision this bill represents.\n  I cautioned earlier this year that ten years from now, we will be \njudged by the decisions we make today. People will ask, did we fully \nunderstand the awesome changes taking place in our economy and in our \nsociety? Did we create a plan to assure our ongoing prosperity? Did we \ndirect our unprecedented surpluses into investments with the greatest \nreturns? Did we give our workers the tools they needed to seize the \nopportunities an innovation economy offers? And, were we guided by the \nfiscal discipline and values that had brought us so far in the past \ndecade? Much to my chagrin, I am no longer confident that these \nquestions will be answered affirmatively.\n  Indeed, we have passed a bill that relies heavily on a surplus whose \nsize six months down the road is unclear, to say nothing of its \ndimensions ten years from now. The inflated size of this tax cut may \nwell force us to set discretionary spending at levels that don't keep \npace with inflation. We may be forced to return to the fiscally-\ndestructive practice of deficit spending by borrowing from the Social \nSecurity and Medicare trust funds. Additionally, this tax cut pays \nnothing but lip service to reducing the national debt, the very step \nthat has proven to be so valuable to the health of our economy in \nrecent years by keeping the cost of capital and interest rates low. In \nfact, this bill crowds our ability to devote a single dollar, aside \nfrom funds already committed to the Medicare and Social Security Trust \nFunds, toward debt reduction.\n  I am especially concerned that the idea of an immediate economic \nstimulus has been abandoned. During the debate on the budget resolution \nlast month, we Democrats argued that the economy needed a jump-start \nand our colleagues on both sides of the aisle agreed to adopt a \nstimulus package. Our plan was fair. It was fast. And it was fiscally \nresponsible. It was fair because it was directed at every American who \npaid any taxes--payroll or income. It was fast because it would go into \neffect immediately, with rebate checks being cut within weeks. And not \nleast of all, it was fiscally responsible because it fit into a \nbalanced budget that did not spend money we do not have. Unfortunately, \nthe so-called stimulus included in the tax bill we just passed does \nnone of those things.\n  This bill may prove to be nothing but a one trick pony, and, if so, \nit's a bad trick to play on the American people. No matter the well-\nintentioned claims of my colleagues, this bill promises something we \ncannot deliver. It abandons fiscal discipline, fails to invest the \nwealth our Nation has earned over the past eight years, and may send us \nback down the road to debt, higher interest rates, and higher \nunemployment. It is not what the American people deserve, nor is it \nwhat they expected it to be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/24/senate-section/article/S5606-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5606]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to \nthank the Chairman from Iowa, and the Ranking Member from Montana for \ntheir distinguished leadership on the tax cut bill. Their support of \nthe adoption tax credit amendment made the crucial difference in its \nbeing accepted as part of the manager's package. Both are true friends \nto children and families and should be commended for their willingness \nto ensure that this bill reflects the needs of adoptive parents. I \nwould also like to thank Senators Lincoln, Lieberman, Johnson, \nMikulski, Boxer, Daschle, DeWine, Harkin, Santorum, Shelby, Stevens, \nCochran, Dayton, Durbin, Hutchinson, Kohl, Sessions, Smith of New \nHampshire, and Fitzgerald.\n  This is not the first time that I have come to this floor to urge my \ncolleagues to support efforts to strengthen and extend the adoption tax \ncredit. In fact, each and every time that this body considered the \nissue of tax relief, the senior Senator from Idaho and I have come \nbefore the Senate to argue that the adoption tax credit should be \nincluded. And while this is not the first time that this important \nmeasure has been successfully adopted as part of a tax bill, I am \nhopeful that it will be the last.\n  Because of our action here, 60,000 plus children will find their \n``forever families'' in the year to come. Parents who have long dreamed \nabout adopting will finally have the help necessary to make those \ndreams a reality. I could be wrong, but I would guess that few parts of \nthe tax code can compare to the impact had by the adoption tax credit. \nEach time a child finds a loving home, we have not only saved children \nand strengthened a family, but we have also saved billions of \ntaxpayer's dollars.\n  I believe that there is no such thing as an unwanted child, merely \nunfound families. This tax credit will help to find more families for \nmore children. I would like to commend my colleagues for their support \nin passing this important amendment. With it, we will be\n\n[[Page S5607]]\n\nyet another step closer to the day when no child goes to bed feeling \nalone, unloved or unwanted.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/24/senate-section/article/S5607-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5607]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              LYME DISEASE\n\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague, Senator \nChris Dodd of Connecticut, in lending support to the pressing cause of \naddressing the ruinous effects of America's most common tick-borne \nillness, Lyme disease.\n  I thank the senior Senator from Connecticut for his long involvement \nand leadership on this most important public health issue. With \nthousands of Americans contracting Lyme disease each year, it is \ncritical that we work aggressively to wage a comprehensive fight \nagainst this devastating tick-borne illness, which costs our country \ndearly in the way of medical expenditures and human suffering. The \ncurrent lack of physician knowledge about Lyme and the inadequacies of \nexisting detection methods are particularly problematic, and only serve \nto compound this growing public health hazard.\n  Approximately one year ago, I joined with Senator Dodd, and \nRepresentatives Smith of New Jersey, Pitts and Goode to request of the \nU.S. General Accounting Office a report on some of the current concerns \nsurrounding public and private efforts dedicated to Lyme. We asked \nabout the past and present funding trends within the NIH and CDC and to \nwhat projects these resources are being devoted, and we asked about \npossible conflicts of interest within government agencies related to \ndecisions about the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of Lyme.\n  Although we have not yet received the official report of the GAO, we \nhave received some preliminary findings that Senator Dodd and I \nbelieved merited the development of new legislation that we are \nintroducing today the Lyme and Infectious Disease Information and \nFairness in testing ``LIIFT'' Act to build upon the solid foundation \nlaid by the Lyme Disease Initiative of 1999.\n  The GAO's preliminary findings suggest that the CDC and NIH have lost \nsight of what ultimately matters to the people living with Lyme: \nAccurate diagnostic tools, access to effective treatment and ultimately \na cure. Needless to say, the patient community is not well-served if \nthese areas are not given proper priority at the CDC and NIH.\n  Between 1991 and 1999, the annual number of reported cases of Lyme \ndisease increased by an astonishing 72 percent. Even as the dramatic \nincrease took place, according to the GAO, funding for Lyme disease at \nthe CDC has increased by only 7 percent over the past 10 years.\n  Whereas we applaud NIH for its work and we are pleased to see that \nCongress' efforts to double NIH funding have directly benefited Lyme \nresearch, poor coordination and the lack of proper funding at the CDC \nhas left too many questions unanswered. Senator Dodd and I share the \nfrustration of the patient community; why hasn't all of this research \ntranslated into better treatment? We similarly believe that the CDC's \nlack of proper funding and attention to tick-borne disease has stalled \nprogress in the development of more accurate diagnostic tests for Lyme \ndisease.\n  The LIIFT Act will seek to remedy these issues by ensuring that the \nproper collaboration is taking place on the Federal level the proper \ncollaboration between the Federal Government and the people it serves. \nOur bill will also address the funding imbalances for Lyme disease \nactivities at the CDC that has inhibited the development of accurate \ndetection methods and treatment for Lyme.\n  With this new legislation we are calling for the formation of a \nDepartment of Health and Human Services Advisory Committee that will \nbring Federal agencies, such as the CDC and the NIH, to the table with \npatient organizations, clinicians, and members of the scientific \ncommunity. This Committee will report its recommendations to the \nSecretary of HHS. It will ensure that all scientific viewpoints are \ngiven consideration at NIH and the CDC and will give a voice to the \npatient community which has often been left out of the dialogue.\n  The LIIFT Act will also provide an additional $14 million over the \nnext two years to the CDC to ensure that the Centers work with \nresearchers around the country to develop better diagnostic tests and \nto increase its efforts to educate the public about Lyme disease. We \nalso call upon the NIH to place an emphasis on funding the neurologic \nand vascular aspects of Lyme disease and to recruit a larger pool of \nresearchers.\n  In addition, this legislation authorizes an additional $7 million to \nfund the extraordinary research and eradication efforts already \nunderway at the U.S. Army Center for Health Promotion and Preventive \nMedicine located in the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.\n  I sincerely hope that our colleagues will join Senator Dodd and me in \nthis most worthy cause and cosponsor the LIIFT Act. Lyme disease \npatients and their families have waited too long for a responsive plan \nof action to address their suffering and needs.\n  The Tireless efforts of the Lyme patient and advocacy community have \nbeen instrumental in raising awareness and mobilizing support for this \nissue, and for this both Senator Dodd and I thank them. I look forward \nto working with them, Senator Dodd, and our colleagues to synthesize \nthe best ideas from last session's Lyme Disease Initiative and the new \nLIIFT Act, and to enact into law strong legislation to help correct the \nmistakes of the past, and to give greater hope for the future by \nensuring patients that the Federal Government is doing everything in \nits power to provide better treatments and ultimately, a cure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/24/senate-section/article/S5607-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5607-S5608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL\n\n  Ms. LINCOLN. Mr. President, in anticipation of Memorial Day, I rise \nto honor the 1.1 million Americans who have given their lives for this \ncountry. Their lasting legacy is freedom, both here and abroad.\n  I hope this Memorial Day will be a special one for the World War II \ngeneration. Earlier this week, the Senate cleared the way for the \nconstruction of the World War II Memorial on the National Mall. The \nbrave men and women of this generation will finally receive the \nnational recognition they deserve.\n  I want to take time today to acknowledge the contributions of the \nnearly four million veterans of the Korean War. This issue is a \npersonal one for me. My father is a veteran of the Korean War and I \nknow his generation made tremendous sacrifices. During the course of \nthe war, over 36,000 Americans lost their lives and over 90,000 were \nwounded.\n  My father served in Korea as an enlisted man. He left for the 38th \nParallel shortly after graduating from high school. When he returned, \nhe married my mother and went to college at the University of Arkansas \nwhere he joined the ROTC. Upon graduation, his ROTC unit was activated \nand Dad left for the Azores for a 12 month assignment.\n  Like many members of the military, my father didn't endure the \nsacrifice of service alone. My mother boarded a military flight to the \nAzores when my sister Mary was only 6 months old to join my father. The \nmilitary didn't provide housing for married service members on the \nisland and so my father had to make alternative arrangements before my \nmother and sister could join him. Once reunited, they lived as normal a \nlife as possible in a trailer on an island in the Atlantic thousands of \nmiles from home.\n  Seldom do we properly recognize the contribution and sacrifice \nspouses and other family members make when a loved one joins the Armed \nForces. So while we honor our nation's veterans on Memorial Day, let us \nalso salute the spouses and other family members who share the \nsacrifice and burdens of military service.\n  To commemorate this Memorial Day, I urge my colleagues and all \nAmericans to watch the PBS documentary Korean War Stories. It will air \nin the evening on Sunday May 27th. This documentary has been sponsored \nby the Disabled American Veterans as a tribute to those who served \nduring the Korean War.\n  Our Korean War veterans served this nation with honor, dignity, and \ndedication, and, in the end, they preserved freedom on the Korean \npeninsula.\n  I have the highest respect for the men and women who have served our\n\n[[Page S5608]]\n\nnation in the Armed Forces, especially those who gave their lives to \nprotect the freedoms we enjoy today. Their sacrifice on behalf of our \ncountry is commendable and I extend my sincere appreciation for the \nhonorable service they have given.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/24/senate-section/article/S5608-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5608]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

AMESBURY, JR.\n\n Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Major Harry \nA. Amesbury, Jr. who after 29 years is finally being returned home to \nhis family. On April 26, 1972, Harry was the commander of a C-130E \naircraft on a night emergency resupply mission to the besieged city of \nAn Loc, Republic of Vietnam. He knew there was a concentration of enemy \nanti-aircraft defenses because he made the flight the night before. His \naircraft was struck by the intense enemy fire and shot down. He has \nbeen missing in action since that date, but not forgotten. An Idaho \nresident and career Air Force officer with over sixteen years of \nservice to his country, he was survived by his parents Dr. and Mrs. \nHarry A. Amesbury, Sr., who are now deceased, his wife Mary Amesbury \nPredoehl, and four sons: Harry Kurt Amesbury, David John Amesbury, \nRobert Stephen Amesbury, and Alan Keith Amesbury. He is also survived \nby David's wife Marjan, their son Brendan, and the twins Cameron and \nShannon, as well as, Stephen's wife Mary and their sons Ryan and \nConnor. I know I speak for all my colleagues in the Senate in \nexpressing my profound sorrow to the Amesbury family for their loss.\n  In a letter to his parents on 15 April 1972, just eleven days before \nhis death, Harry wrote: ``I want you to know that if something should \nhappen to me, that I am doing what needs to be done and I am doing what \nI think is right''. He was a thorough professional who believed in his \ncountry and his duties as an Air Force Officer. He knew that his fellow \nservice members needed his help, so he didn't hesitate when called on \nto make that final flight.\n  Harry received the Silver Star for his valor in attempting the \nmission to An Loc. He also received the Distinguished Flying Cross for \na mission the previous day, when his aircraft was heavily damaged by \nenemy anti-aircraft fire. These final acts of courage, following days \nand years of courageous acts, demonstrate the commitment that Major \nHarry Amesbury had for military service, his dedication to our country, \nand the importance he placed on performing his duty. Unfortunately, \nthis tragedy reminds us once again of the painful costs of answering \nthe call of service to our country, and the sacrifices our military \nmembers make for others who need help. We will never know how many \nlives in An Loc were saved because of the valor of Major Harry \nAmesbury, but as we pay homage to his memory, let us rededicate \nourselves in the days and months ahead to the ideals of our great \nnation, and keep faith with all brave Americans who choose to wear the \nuniform and ensure that their sacrifices were not made in vain.\n  I hope it is of some comfort to the family that Major Harry Amesbury, \nJr. is finally returning home to Idaho. It was always his plan to \nreturn to the State after completing his Air Force career, and even \nbought land over looking the Snake River, near Marsing, where he \nplanned to build his retirement home.\n  On Memorial Day at Mountain Home AFB, there will be an official \nceremony which will include the rendering of military honors and one \nfinal opportunity to express appreciation for his service and his \nsacrifice. His family will then travel into the mountains, to a place \nthat he loved to go with his children, and say goodbye in their own \nway.\n  I am very proud to recognize Major Harry A. Amesbury, Jr. and tell \nhim and his family, Thank You.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/24/senate-section/article/S5608-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5608-S5609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO JANE ELLEN STRITZINGER\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to one of this \ncountry's great educators as she retires after over 30 years of \nteaching English in my home state of Alabama. This week marks the end \nof an outstanding career for Jane Ellen Stritzinger as she retires from \nDemopolis High School. Mrs. Stritzinger has taught thousands of \nstudents to write well and motivated many to pursue higher education. I \njoin her family, friends, fellow teachers and the students she has \nguided in congratulating and wishing her well in retirement. Her \ndevoted service to the young people of Alabama has made both the state \nand the nation better places. Her leadership and teaching will be \nsorely missed.\n  Mrs. Stritzinger's awards, activities and leadership positions are \nfar too numerous to list exhaustively, yet a few bear special mention. \nShe was selected as the Alabama State Teacher of the Year, District V \nwinner for 1999-2000. Mrs. Stritzinger has also received the University \nof West Alabama College of Liberal Arts Alumni Achievement Award, the \nTombigbee Girl Scout Council Outstanding Educator Award and the Alabama \nCouncil of Teachers of English Distinguished Service Award. She has \nalso been recognized three times by the National Endowment for the \nHumanities with Awards allowing her to attend special seminars. In \naddition to her support of educational efforts, Mrs. Stritzinger has \nplayed active roles in numerous community organizations including \nhistorical, alumni and religious organizations.\n  Mrs. Stritzinger spent most of her career teaching English and \nliterature to twelfth grade students at Demopolis High School where she \nhas been responsible for the Advanced Placement, Honors and College-\nbound English classes. In addition, she has served as the Chairperson \nof the English Department at Demopolis High School for twenty years and \nof both the English Curriculum Development and the English Textbook \nCommittees. Early in her career, she taught English at Uniontown High \nSchool and remedial reading at Westside School and served as Assistant \nDirector of the Alabama Consortium for the Development of Higher \nEducation. She has helped mold the minds of students as they prepared \nfor college and for life. Her focus on encouraging and recognizing \nacademic excellence extended beyond her classroom to the numerous \nactivities and organizations she helped coordinate including founding \nthe local chapter of the National Honor Society.\n  Mrs. Stritzinger holds a strong belief in encouraging students to \nimprove their reading abilities and develop strong writing skills. She \nchampioned using the Accelerated Reader Program and applied for her \nschool to become an Alabama Reading Initiative Demonstration site. She \ndevoted countless hours over the years to the Alabama Penman Creative \nWriting Contest, the Gulf Coast Writing Conference, the Program to \nRecognize Excellence in High School Literary Magazines, a tutorial \nprogram for high school students and the Beta Club. Mrs. Stritzinger \nparticipated in a program on writing instruction filmed by the State \nDepartment of Education for Alabama Public Television.\n\n[[Page S5609]]\n\n  Strong schools foster strong students and Mrs. Stritzinger worked \ndiligently to improve the quality of our Alabama schools. She was \nselected as Chairperson of the Ten Year Study for Demopolis High School \nfor Southern Association accreditation and as Teachers' Representative \nto the Demopolis Educational Foundation. She served as chairperson of \nthe Grants Committee for the Educational Foundation and coordinated a \nsystem-wide meeting for reading and language teachers on improving test \nscores. Mrs. Stritzinger represented Demopolis High School on the Mid-\nSouth Humanities Project, the University of Alabama Bio-Prep Workshops \nand a School Improvement Workshop. She also served on an Alabama State \nDepartment of Education Evaluation Team to accredit Judson College. \nCentral to her effort to improve our schools was her twenty years as a \nCooperating Teacher providing guidance to student teachers seeking \nclassroom experience. She also played an active role in encouraging the \nuse of technology in the classroom including through the use of the \nInternet.\n  Mrs. Stritzinger earned both Masters and Bachelors degrees in English \nand maintains affiliations with numerous education associations. She \nhas been married to Pete Stritzinger for 36 years and while pursuing \nthis busy career raised two daughters--Ann and Gloria. Mrs. \nStritzinger's commitment to Demopolis Schools continues a tradition \nbegun by her mother Lucille Lewis who was also a long serving public \nschool teacher.\n  No one can begin to quantify the amazing impact that a teacher of \nMrs. Stritzinger's ability has had on her students and on her \ncommunity. The success stories are myriad and many of Mrs. \nStritzinger's students have risen to become pillars of their \ncommunities. Often her students have been inspired by Mrs. \nStritzinger's teaching to pursue careers as teachers or careers which \ndepend upon the critical thinking and strong writing skills fostered by \nher classes.\n  As you can tell from my description of her career, Mrs. Stritzinger's \ninvolvement in the Demopolis City School System will be hard to \nreplace. Although I am sure she will stay involved with the schools and \nthe community after retirement, she has begun a legacy of success that \nis sure to be continued. I am confident that her former students and \nfellow teachers will continue to rise to the challenges that Mrs. \nStritzinger posed to them.\n  Congratulations again Mrs. Stritzinger on such an outstanding \ncareer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/24/senate-section/article/S5609-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO REVEREND MARK HURLEY\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to pay \ntribute to the Reverend Mark J. Hurley, the former bishop of the \nCatholic Diocese of Santa Rosa, California. Bishop Hurley passed away \non Monday, February 5, 2001, after undergoing surgery for an aneurysm. \nMark Hurley was one of two priests born to a proud Irish Catholic \nfamily. His brother, Francis Hurley, is the Archbishop of Anchorage, \nAlaska.\n  I had the great fortune to make the acquaintance of Mark Hurley \nseveral years ago while traveling in California. He was a deeply \nreligious man, as you would expect, and a very learned individual and \nthe author of several books. He lectured about the tragedy of abortion \nand wrote extensively about medical and genetic research and individual \nprivacy. But he will be remembered most of all for his extraordinary \nwork as the bishop of the six-county North Coast diocese from 1969-\n1986.\n  Pope Paul VI appointed Mark Hurley second bishop of the Santa Rosa \ndiocese in 1969. Prior to his appointment, he was a teacher and \nadministrator for Catholic high schools in San Francisco, Marin and \nOakland and served as vicar general of the Archdiocese of San \nFrancisco. He would become Santa Rosa's longest-serving bishop since \nthe diocese was created. Most importantly, Bishop Hurley was credited \nwith saving the diocese from financial ruin. When he took office the \ndiocese was over $12 million in debt, including $7 million owed to \nparishes and other organizations within the diocese. By imposing strict \nspending limits, a building moratorium and other cutbacks he was able \nto orchestrate the financial recovery that was so desperately needed.\n  After his tenure, Pope John Paul II rewarded Reverend Hurley's \nefforts by transferring him to the Vatican where he was consular to the \nSacred Congregation for Catholic Education and a member of the \nSecretariat for Non-Believers. He returned to the United States and \nretired in San Francisco, the same city in which he was born on \nDecember 13, 1919.\n  He was acknowledged by many as an intellectual and a world leader on \nreligious matters, but it was his successful tenure as bishop of Santa \nRosa for which he will be remembered most. Santa Rosa's current bishop, \nDaniel Walsh, said of Mark Hurley, ``I believe his most esteemed role \nand responsibility was that of Bishop of Santa Rosa. He labored here \nfrom November 1969 to April 1986. He made a great impact on the diocese \nand we are all beneficiaries of his ministry here.''\n  With the death of bishop Hurley the Lord has lost a dutiful servant, \nthe Catholic faith has lost a pillar of virtue and our nation has lost \na loving soul that quietly touched and improved the lives of many. I \nknow I speak for all my colleagues in extending our condolences to his \nbrother, Bishop Francis Hurley, his sister Phyllis Porter of San \nFrancisco and to the rest of his family and friends.

It has proven to be a very successful and \ninspirational method for pulling together business people, educators, \nyouth counselors, parents and students behind the effort to eradicate \nillegal drugs, crime and violence from our nation's schools.\n  The students at Mary Harmon Weeks Elementary School successfully put \nto work 21 precepts from a common sense moral code booklet titled The \nWay to Happiness including, ``Try to treat others as you would want \nthem to treat you.''\n  I would like to applaud the students of Mary Harmon Weeks Elementary \nSchool and their teacher Gilbert Lowe for the outstanding \naccomplishment. Sometimes it is very hard for young people to stand out \nfrom the crowd and not give in to peer pressure. The choices the \nstudents at Mary Harmon Weeks Elementary School have made to stay away \nfrom drugs and to promote a safe school environment is a mature and \nresponsible decision. It will not only benefit them as individuals but \nwill bring numerous benefits to the school and community as \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/24/senate-section/article/S5609-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5609-S5610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNITION OF MR.

Mr. President, today Mr. Kenneth Hood of \nGunnison, MS, will conclude his term as President of Delta Council.\n  Delta Council is an economic development organization representing \neighteen counties of Northwest Mississippi. Organized in 1935, Delta \nCouncil brings together the agricultural, business, and professional \nleadership of the area to solve common problems and promote the \neconomic development of the Mississippi Delta region.\n  As President of Delta Council, Mr. Hood has been an articulate \nspokesman and leader in the effort to define an effective agriculture \npolicy, and to confront the needs for better schools, water resources, \nand transportation.\n  Kenneth Hood has been committed to Mississippi agriculture since he \nfirst began farming in 1960. He is president of Hood Gin Company and \nChief Executive Officer of Perthshire Farms, a family farm operation. \nHe is also president of Hood Equipment Company, an agricultural and \nconstruction equipment dealer located in Batesville and Bruce, MS.\n  Mr. Hood has served also as the President of the Mississippi and \nNational Association of Farmer Elected\n\n[[Page S5610]]\n\nCommitteemen, a member of the Board of Directors of Staplcotn, a \nfounding director of Delta Wildlife, a past chairman of the National \nand Southern Cotton Ginners Association, and Chairman of the \nMississippi Boll Weevil Management Corporation. He has recently been \nchosen as the new Chairman of the National Cotton Council.

I have sent the enclosed notice to the Federal \nRegister for publication, stating that the national emergencies \ndeclared with respect to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and \nMontenegro) (the ``FRY (S)'') in 1992 and with respect to Kosovo in \n1998, are to continue beyond May 30, 2001, and June 9, 2001, \nrespectively. The most recent notice continuing these emergencies was \npublished in the Federal Register on May 26, 2000.\n  With respect to the 1992 national emergency, on December 27, 1995, \nPresident Clinton issued Presidential Determination 96-7, directing the \nSecretary of the Treasury, inter alia, to suspend the application of \nsanctions imposed on the FRY (S) and to continue to block property \npreviously blocked until provision is made to address claims or \nencumbrances, including the claims of the other successor states of the \nformer Yugoslavia. This sanctions relief, in conformity with United \nNations Security Council Resolution 1022 of November 22, 1995 \n(hereinafter the ``Resolution''), was an essential factor motivating \nSerbia and Montenegro's acceptance of the General Framework Agreement \nfor Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina initialed in Dayton on November 21, \n1995, and signed in Paris on December 14, 1995 (hereinafter the ``Peace \nAgreement'').\n  Sanctions against both the FRY (S) and the Bosnian Serbs were \nsubsequently terminated by United Nations Security Council Resolution \n1074 of October 1, 1996. This termination, however, did not end the \nrequirement of the Resolution that those blocked funds and assets that \nare subject to claims and encumbrances remain blocked, until unblocked \nin accordance with applicable law.\n  Until the status of all remaining blocked property is resolved, the \nPeace Agreement implemented, and the terms of the Resolution met, this \nsituation continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the \nnational security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States. \nFor these reasons, I have determined that the 1992 emergency, and the \nmeasures adopted pursuant thereto, must continue beyond May 30, 2001.\n  With respect to the 1998 national emergency regarding Kosovo, on \nJanuary 17, 2001, President Clinton issued Executive Order 13192 in \nview of the peaceful democratic transition begun in the FRY (S); the \ncontinuing need to promote full implementation of United Nations \nSecurity Council Resolution 827 of May 25, 1993, and subsequent \nresolutions calling for all states to cooperate fully with the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY); the \nillegitimate control over FRY (S) political institutions and economic \nresources or enterprises exercised by former President Slobodan \nMilosevic, his close associates and other persons, and those \nindividuals' capacity to repress democracy or perpetrate or promote \nfurther human rights abuses; and the continuing threat to regional \nstability and implementation of the Peace Agreement. The order lifts \nand modifies, with respect to future transactions, most of the economic \nsanctions imposed against the FRY (S) in 1998 and 1999 with regard to \nthe situation in Kosovo. At the same time, the order imposes \nrestrictions on transactions with certain persons described in section \n1(a) of the order, namely Slobodan Milosevic, his close associates and \nsupporters and persons under open indictment for war crimes by ICTY. \nThe order also provides for the continued blocking of property or \ninterests in property blocked prior to the order's effective date due \nto the need to address claims or encumbrances involving such property.\n  Because the crisis with respect to the situation in Kosovo and with \nrespect to Slobodan Milosevic, his close associates and supporters and \npersons under open indictment for war crimes by ICTY has not been \nresolved, and because the status of all previously blocked property has \nyet to be resolved, this situation continues to pose an unusual and \nextraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the \nUnited States. For these reasons, I have determined that the emergency \ndeclared with respect to Kosovo, and the measures adopted pursuant \nthereto, must continue beyond June 9, 2001.\n                                                      George W.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Hawaii relative to appropriated \n     funds for children with disabilities; to the Committee on \n     Appropriations.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 47\n\n       Whereas, under Title 20, section 1411(a) of the United \n     States Code, the maximum amount of federal funds that a state \n     may receive for special education and related services is the \n     number of children with disabilities in the State who are \n     receiving special education and related services multiplied \n     by forty percent of the average per-pupil expenditure in \n     public elementary and secondary schools in the United States; \n     and\n       Whereas, since the enactment of the Education for All \n     Handicapped Children Act of 1975 and its subsequent \n     amendments, including the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act of 1990, Congress has appropriated funds for a \n     maximum of ten per cent of special education and related \n     services for children with disabilities when federal law \n     authorizes the appropriation of up to forty per cent; and\n       Whereas, the Hawaii Department of Education received \n     approximately $23,500,000 in federal funds during fiscal year \n     1999-2000 for what was then referred to as ``education of the \n     handicapped''. If this figure represented an appropriation of \n     funds for ten per cent of special education and related \n     services for children with disabilities, then an \n     appropriation of forty per cent would have equaled \n     $94,000,000; and\n       Whereas, the difference between an appropriation of forty \n     per cent and an appropriation of ten per cent for ``education \n     of the handicapped'' would amount to $70,500,000 just for the \n     Department of Education. If the number of students receiving \n     special education and related services equaled 22,000 during \n     the fiscal year 1999-2000, then the difference would have \n     amounted to approximately $3,200 per student; and\n       Whereas, the State of Hawaii, through the Felix consent \n     decree, is being compelled by the federal district court to \n     make up for more than twenty years of insufficient funding \n     for special education and related services-funding that \n     should have been borne substantially by Congress, which \n     enacted the Education for All Handicapped Children Act of \n     1975 and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act of \n     1990; and\n       Whereas, if Congress is going to mandate new programs or \n     increase the level of service under existing programs for \n     children with disabilities, and if it is going to give the \n     federal courts unfettered power to enforce these mandates \n     through the imposition of fines and the appointment of \n     masters, then Congress should provide sufficient funding for \n     special education and related services; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the Twenty-first Legislature of \n     the State of Hawaii, Regular Session of 2001, That the United \n     States Congress is requested to appropriate funds for forty \n     per cent of special education and related services for \n     children with disabilities; and be it further\n       Resolved, That certified copies of this Resolution be \n     transmitted to the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the President pro tempore of the United \n     States Senate, the Vice-President of the United States, and \n     the members of Hawaii's congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/24/senate-section/article/S5613-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. HELMS, from the Committee on Foreign Relations, \n     without amendment and with a preamble:\n       S.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe recognition of capital gain rule for home offices; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, in 1997 Congress made an important change in \nthe tax code for small businesses by restoring the home-office \ndeduction. That change opened the door for millions of Americans to \noperate successful small businesses from their homes. Now the home-\nbased financial planner or landscape can use an extra bedroom or a \nbasement to conduct her business without the cost of commercial office \nspace. In many cases, these home offices also allow today's \nentrepreneurs to spend more time with their family by avoiding the \nadded time and expense of day-care and commuting.\n  With the restoration of the home-office deduction, however, came a \nsignificant new complexity for home-based businesses, depreciation \nrecapture. If a home-based medical transcriber elects to claim the \nhome-office deduction, she will deduct the expenses relating to her \nhome office, such as a portion of her home-owners insurance, utilities, \nrepairs, and maintenance. She is also entitled to depreciate a portion \nof the cost of her house relating to the home office. But there is a \nbig catch. When the home-based business owner sells her home, she must \nrecapture all of the depreciation deductions and pay income taxes on \nthem, even though her house qualifies for the exclusion from tax for \nthe sale of a principal residence.\n  The specter of depreciation recapture has several significant \nramifications. First, it requires additional recordkeeping for home-\nbased business owners, on top of the enormous burdens that the tax code \nalready imposes on a small business. Second, when the home-based \nbusiness owner decides to sell his home, he must struggle with the \ncomplexities of calculating the depreciation recapture or, as is too \noften the case, he must hire a costly tax professional to undertake the \ncalculations and prepare the required tax forms.\n  Additionally, the depreciation-recapture requirement creates a \ndisincentive for home-based business owners to claim the home-office \ndeduction in the first place. In fact, I have heard from accountants \nand tax advisors in my home State of Missouri that they frequently \nadvise their clients to forego the home-office deduction simply to \navoid the recordkeeping and complexities associated with recapturing \nthe depreciation. That is clearly not what Congress intended when it \nrestored the home-office deduction in 1997.\n  In light of this problem, I rise today to introduce the ``Home-Office \nDeduction Simplification Act of 2001.'' This bill simply repeals the \ndepreciation-recapture requirement and the disincentive for home-based \nbusinesses to utilize the home-office deduction. At a time when the \nNation's small businesses are feeling real pain from the current \neconomic slow down, this bill will provide real relief, not only when \nthey sell their homes, but today by giving them the benefit of the \nhome-office deduction that Congress intended.\n  It is my pleasure to be working with Congressman Donald Manzullo, \nChairman of the House Committee on Small Business, to raise this issue \nin both Chambers. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to support this \nlegislation and make the home-office deduction as simple and accessible \nas possible. Our home-based businesses across the nation deserve \nnothing less.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a description \nof its provisions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 945\n\n  [Data not available at time of printing.]\n\n   Home-Office Deduction Simplification Act of 2001--Description of \n                               Provisions\n\n  The bill repeals section 121(d)(6) of the Internal Revenue Code. \nCurrently, this provision requires individuals who claim depreciation \ndeductions with respect to a home-office to recapture such deductions \nupon the sale of their home. As a result, the amount of the recaptured \ndepreciation deductions is subject to income taxation without the \nbenefit of the income-tax exclusion for the sale of a principal \nresidence or the capital-gains tax rates in cases where the exclusion \ndoes not apply.\n  By repealing the depreciation-recapture requirement, the bill \neliminates the paperwork and compliance burdens that frequently prevent \nhome-based business owners from claiming the home-office deduction. The \nbill will be effective for sales or exchanges of homes occurring after \nDecember 31, 2000.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 946. A bill to establish an Office on Women's Health within the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Women's \nHealth Office Act of 2001 and I am pleased to be joined on this \nlegislation by my friends and colleagues Senators Mikulski and Harkin. \nCompanion legislation to this bill has been introduced in the House by \nCongresswomen Connie Morella and Carolyn Maloney.\n  The Women's Health Office Act of 2001 provides permanent \nauthorization for Offices of Women's Health in five Federal agencies: \nthe Department of Health and Human Services, HHS; the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, CDC; the Agency for Health Care \nResearch and Quality, AHRQ; the Health Resources and Services \nAdministration, HRSA; and the Food and Drug Administration, FDA.\n  Currently, only two women's health offices in the Federal Government \nhave statutory authorization: the Office of Research on Women's Health \nat the National Institutes of Health, NIH, and the Office for Women's \nServices within the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, SAMHSA.\n  For too many years, women's health care needs were ignored or poorly \nunderstood, and women were systematically excluded from important \nhealth research. One famous medical study on breast cancer examined \nhundreds of men. Another federally funded study examined the ability of \naspirin to prevent heart attacks in 20,000 medical doctors, all of whom \nwere men, despite the fact that heart disease is a leading cause of \ndeath among women.\n  Today, Members of Congress and the American public understand the \nimportance of ensuring that both genders benefit equally from medical \nresearch and health care services.\n  Throughout my tenure in the House and Senate, I have worked hard to \nexpose and eliminate this health care gender gap and improve women's \naccess to affordable, quality health services. As cochairs of the \nCongressional Caucus for Women's Issues, CCWI, Representative Pat \nSchroeder and I, along with Representative Henry Waxman, called for a \nGAO investigation, in the beginning of 1990, into the inclusion of \nwomen and minorities in medical research at the National Institutes of \nHealth.\n  This study documented the widespread exclusion of women from medical \nresearch, and spurred the Caucus to introduce the first Women's Health\n\n[[Page S5619]]\n\nEquity Act, WHEA, in 1990. This comprehensive legislation provided \nCongress with its first broad, forward-looking health agenda designed \nto redress the historical inequities that face women in medical \nresearch, prevention and services.\n  Three years later, Congress enacted legislation mandating the \ninclusion of women and minorities in clinical trials at NIH through the \nNational Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993, P.L. 103-43. \nAlso included in the NIH Revitalization Act was language establishing \nthe NIH Office of Research on Women's Health, language based on my \noriginal Office of Women's Health bill that was introduced in the 101st \nCongress.\n  Yet, despite all the progress that we have made, there is still a \nlong way to go on women's health care issues. Last May, the GAO \nreleased a report, a 10-year update, on the status of women's research \nat NIH, ``NIH Has Increased Its Efforts to Include Women in Research''. \nThis report found that since the first GAO report and the 1993 \nlegislation, NIH had made significant progress toward including women \nas subjects in both intramural and external clinical trials.\n\n  However, the report noted that the Institute had made less progress \nin implementing the requirement that certain clinical trials be \ndesigned and carried out to permit valid analysis by sex, which could \nreveal whether interventions affect women and men differently. The GAO \nfound that NIH researchers would include women in their trials--but \nthen they would either not do analysis on the basis of sex, or if no \ndifference was found, they would not publish the sex-based results.\n  NIH has done a good job of improving participation of women in \nclinical trials and has implemented several changes to improve the \naccuracy and performance for tracking and analyzing data, but our \ncommitment to women's health is not about quotas and numbers. It is \nabout real scientific advances that will improve our knowledge about \nwomen's health. At a time when we are on track to double funding for \nNIH, it is troubling that the agency has still failed to fully \nimplement both its own guidelines and the Congressional directive for \nsex-based analysis. And as a result, women continue to be shortchanged \nby Federal research efforts.\n  The crux of the matter is that NIH's problems exist despite that fact \nthat it has an Office of Women's Health that is codified in law. If NIH \nis having problems, imagine the difficulties we will have in continuing \nthe focus on women's health in offices that do not have this \nlegislative mandate, and that may change focus with a new HHS Secretary \nor Agency Director.\n  Offices of Women's Health across the Public Health Service are \ncharged with coordinating women's health activities and monitoring \nprogress on women's health issues within their respective agencies, and \nthey have been successful in making Federal programs and policies more \nresponsive to women's health issues. Unfortunately, all of the good \nwork these offices are doing is not guaranteed in Public Health Service \nauthorizing law. Providing statutory authorization for federal women's \nhealth offices is a critical step in ensuring that women's health \nresearch will continue to receive the attention it requires in future \nyears.\n  Codifying these offices of women's health is important for several \nreasons. First, it re-emphasizes Congress's commitment to focusing on \nwomen's health. Second, it ensures that agencies will enact \ncongressional intent with good faith. Finally, it ensures that \nappropriations will be available in future years to fulfill these \ncommitments.\n  By statutorily creating Offices of Women's Health, the Deputy \nAssistant Secretary for Women's Health will be able to better monitor \nvarious Public Health Service agencies and advise them on scientific, \nlegal, ethical and policy issues. Agencies would establish a \nCoordinating Committee on Women's Health to identify and prioritize \nwhich women's health projects should be conducted. This will also \nprovide a mechanism for coordination within and across these agencies, \nand with the private sector. But most importantly, this bill will \nensure the presence of offices dedicated to addressing the ongoing \nneeds and gaps in research, policy, programs, education and training in \nwomen's health.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Senators Mikulski, Harkin, and me in \nsupporting this legislation to help ensure that women's health will \nnever again be a missing page in America's medical textbook.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Snowe and Senator \nHarkin to introduce the Women's Health Office Act of 2001. I am pleased \nto introduce this bill with my colleagues because it establishes an \nimportant framework to address women's health within the Department of \nHealth and Human Services, HHS.\n  Historically, women's health needs have been ignored or inadequately \naddressed by the medical establishment and the government. A 1990 \nGeneral Accounting Office, GAO, report stated that: the National \nInstitutes of Health, NIH, had made little progress in implementing its \nown inclusion policy on women's participation in clinical trials, NIH \ninconsistently applied this policy, and NIH had done little to \nimplement analysis of research findings by gender. This was \nunacceptable. Women make up half or more of the population and must be \nadequately included in clinical research. That's why I fought to \nestablish the Office of Research on Women's Health, ORWH, at the NIH 11 \nyears ago. We needed to ensure that women were included in clinical \nresearch, so that we would know how treatments for a particular disease \nor condition would affect women. Would men and women react the same way \nto a particular treatment for heart disease? We can't answer this \nquestion unless both men and women are being included in clinical \ntrials.\n  While the ORWH began its work in 1990, I wanted to ensure that it \nstayed at NIH and had the necessary authority to carry out its mission, \npart of which is to ensure that women are included in clinical \nresearch. That's why I authored legislation in 1990 and 1991 to \nformally establish the ORWH in the Office of the Director of NIH. These \nprovisions were later enacted into law in the NIH Revitalization Act of \n1993.\n  In 1999, Senator Harkin, Senator Snowe, and I requested that GAO \nexamine how well the NIH and the ORWH were carrying out the mandates \nunder the NIH Revitalization Act of 1993. The results were mixed. While \nNIH had made substantial progress in ensuring the inclusion of women in \nclinical research, it had made less progress in encouraging the \nanalysis of study findings by sex. This means that women are being \nincluded in clinical trials, but we are not able to fully reap the \nbenefits of inclusion if the analysis of how interventions affect men \nand women is not being done or not being reported. While the NIH and \nothers are taking steps to address this, we may be missing information \nfrom research done over the last few years about how the outcomes \nvaried or not for men and women.\n  NIH is but one agency in HHS. Other agencies in HHS do not even have \nwomen's health offices. How are these other agencies addressing women's \nhealth? Only NIH and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \nAdministration, SAMHSA, have authorizations in law for offices \ndedicated to women's health. In 1993, I requested language that \naccompanied the Fiscal Year 1994 Senate Labor, Health and Human \nServices Appropriations bill and the Agriculture Appropriations bill to \nestablish and provide funding for Offices of Women's Health in the \nCenters for the Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, the Food and Drug \nAdministration, FDA, the Health Resources and Services Administration, \nHRSA, and the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research, AHCPR, now \nthe Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, AHRQ. Today, there are \noffices of women's health in HHS, FDA, CDC, and HRSA. AHRQ has a \nwomen's health advisor. These offices and advisors are important \nadvocates within the agency for women's health research, programs, and \nactivities. A recent HHS report to Congress describes their roles, \nresponsibilities, and future plans. The degree of support for these \noffices, in terms of staff and financial resources, varies widely \nacross HHS. This can mean inadequate and inconsistent attention to \nwomen's health needs within an agency.\n  I believe we need a consistent and comprehensive approach to address \nthe\n\n[[Page S5620]]\n\nneeds of women's health in the HHS. This bill would do just that. The \nWomen's Health Office Act of 2001 would authorize women's health \noffices in HHS, CDC, FDA, AHRQ, and HRSA.\n  This legislation establishes an important framework and builds on \nexisting efforts. Under the bill, the HHS Office on Women's Health \nwould take over all functions which previously belonged to the current \nOffice of Women's Health of the Public Health Service. The HHS Office \nwould be headed by a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Women's Health who \nwould also chair an HHS Coordinating Committee on Women's Health. The \nresponsibilities of the HHS Office would include establishing short and \nlong-term goals, advising the Secretary of HHS on women's health \nissues, monitoring and facilitating coordination and stimulating HHS \nactivities on women's health, establishing a National Women's Health \nInformation Center to facilitate exchange of and access to women's \nhealth information, and coordinating private sector efforts to promote \nwomen's health.\n  Under this legislation, the Offices of Women's Health in CDC, FDA, \nHRSA, and AHRQ would be housed in the office of the head of each agency \nand be headed by a Director appointed by the head of the respective \nagency. Responsibilities of the offices include: an examination of \ncurrent women's health activities, the establishment of short-term and \nlong-term goals for women's health, the coordination of women's health \nactivities, and the establishment of a coordinating committee on \nwomen's health within each agency to identify women's health needs and \nmake recommendations to the head of the agency. The FDA office would \nalso have specific duties regarding women and clinical trials. The \ndirector of each office would serve on HHS's Coordinating Committee on \nWomen's Health. The bill authorizes appropriations for all the offices \nthrough 2006.\n  I believe that this bill will establish a valuable and consistent \nframework for addressing women's health in the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. It will help to ensure that women's health research \nwill continue to have the attention and resources it needs in the \ncoming years. This bill is a priority of the Women's Health Research \nCoalition. The Coalition is comprised of academic medical, health and \nscientific institutions, as well as other organizations interested in \nand supportive of women's health research. The Women's Research and \nEducation Institute recently released a list of 15 high-impact actions \nCongress could take to improve the health of midlife women, including \nthe establishment of permanent offices of women's health at HHS and \nrelated federal agencies. This bill is supported by over 45 other \norganizations including the YWCA, the Society for Women's Health \nResearch, the National Partnership for Women and Families, Hadassah, \nand the American Physical Therapy Association. I encourage my \ncolleagues to cosponsor and support this important legislation, and I \nask unanimous consent that a letter of support for this bill be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                            Women's Health Research Coalition,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2001.\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     Hart Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Mikulski: As organizations representing \n     millions of patients, health care professionals, advocates \n     and consumers, we thank you for your leadership in \n     introducing the ``Women's Health Office Act of 2001.'' We \n     enthusiastically support this legislation and look forward to \n     its passage.\n       Historically, women's health has not been a focus of study \n     nor has there been adequate recognition of the ways in which \n     medical conditions solely or differently affect women and \n     girls. In the decade since attention began to focus on \n     disparities between the genders, scientific knowledge has \n     accumulated alerting us to the importance of considering the \n     biological and psychosocial effects of sex and gender on \n     health and disease.\n       We support the work of the offices of women's health in \n     ensuring that women and girls benefit equitably in the \n     advances made in medical research and health care services. \n     The legislation will provide for the continued existence, \n     coordination and support of these offices so that they \n     analyze new areas of research, education, prevention, \n     treatment and service delivery.\n       We appreciate your firm commitment to improving the health \n     of women throughout the nation.\n           Sincerely,\n       Women's Health Research Coalition; Society for Women's \n     Health Research; American Association of University Women; \n     American Medical Women's Association; American Osteopathic \n     Association; American Physical Therapy Association; American \n     Psychological Association; American Urological Association; \n     Association for Women in Science; Association of Women \n     Psychiatrists; Association of Women's Health, Obstetric and \n     Neonatal Nurses; Center for Ethics in Action.\n       Center for Reproductive Law and Policy, Center for Women \n     Policy Studies, Church Women United, Coalition of Labor Union \n     Women, General Board of Church and Society, the United \n     Methodist Church; Girls Incorporated; Hadassah; Jewish \n     Women's Coalition, Inc.; McAuley Institute; National Abortion \n     Federation; National Association of Commissions for Women; \n     National Center on Women and Aging; National Coalition \n     Against Domestic Violence; National Council of Jewish Women; \n     National Organization for Women; National Partnership for \n     Women and Families; National Women's Health Network; National \n     Women's Health Resource Center; National Women's Law Center; \n     NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund.\n       Organization of Chinese American Women; OWL; Religious \n     Coalition for Reproductive Choice; Society for Gynecologic \n     Investigation; Soroptimist International of the Americas; The \n     General Federation of Women's Clubs, The Woman Activist Fund, \n     Inc.; Voters for Choice Action Fund; Women Employed; Women \n     Heart: The National Coalition for Women with Heart Disease; \n     Women Work!; Women's Business Development Center; Women's \n     Health Fund at University of Minnesota; Women's Institute for \n     Freedom of the Press; Women's Research and Education \n     Institute; YWCA of the U.S.A.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Inhofe):\n       S. 947. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to permit the \n     Governor of a State to waive the oxygen content requirements \n     for reformulated gasoline and for other purposes; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nJames Inhofe of Oklahoma today in introducing a bill to allow the \ngovernor of a State to waive the oxygenate content requirement for \nreformulated or clean-burning gasoline. The bill retains all other \nprovisions of the Clean Air Act to ensure that there is no backsliding \non air quality.\n  We introduce this bill to address the widespread contamination of \ndrinking water by MTBE in California and at least 41 other States.\n  On April 12, 1999, California Governor Gray Davis asked Carol \nBrowner, who was the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection \nAgency, for a waiver of the 2 percent oxygenate requirement. I have \nwritten and called former Administrator Browner and the current \nAdministrator Christine Todd Whitman and both former President Clinton \nand President Bush, urging approval of the waiver. And we are still \nwaiting. It has been two years.\n  Today, yet again I call on EPA and the Administration to act. In the \nmeantime, I will push Congress to act.\n  MTBE, Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether, has been the oxygenate of choice \nby many refiners in their effort to comply with the Clean Air Act's \nreformulated gasoline requirements. California Governor Davis has \nordered a phase-out in our State, but the Federal law requiring two \npercent oxygenates remains, putting our State in an untenable position.\n  This is because the most likely substitute for MTBE to meet the two \npercent requirement is ethanol, but there is not a sufficient supply of \nethanol to meet the demand in California and the rest of the country \nwith the two percent law in place.\n  With inadequate supplies, we can expect disruptions and price spikes \nduring the peak driving months of this summer, at a time when there are \npredictions that retail gasoline prices may climb to an unprecedented \n$3.00 per gallon or more.\n  The California Energy Commission reports that without relief from the \ntwo percent oxygenate mandate, California consumers will pay 3 to 6 \ncents more per gallon than they need to. This adds up to $450 million a \nyear.\n  The Clean Air Act requires that cleaner-burning reformulated \ngasoline, RFG, be sold in so-called ``non-attainment'' areas with the \nworst violations of ozone standards: Los Angeles, San Diego, Hartford, \nNew York Philadelphia, Chicago, Baltimore, Houston, Milwaukee, \nSacramento. In addition, some States and areas have opted to use \nreformulated gasoline as way to achieve clean air.\n  Second, the Act prescribes a formula for reformulated gasoline, \nincluding\n\n[[Page S5621]]\n\nthe requirement that reformulated gasoline contain 2.0 percent oxygen, \nby weight.\n  In response to this requirement, refiners have put the oxygenate MTBE \nin over 85 percent of reformulated gasoline now in use. But, there is a \nproblem: increasingly, MTBE is being detected in drinking water. MTBE \nis a known animal carcinogen and a possible human carcinogen, according \nto U.S. EPA. It has a very unpleasant odor and taste, as well.\n  The Feinstein-Inhofe bill would allow governors, upon notification to \nU.S. EPA, to waive the 2.0 percent oxygenate requirement, as long as \nthe gasoline meets the other requirements in the law for reformulated \ngasoline.\n  On July 27th, 1999, the non-partisan, broad-based U.S. EPA Blue \nRibbon Panel on Oxygenates in Gasoline recommended that the two percent \noxygenate requirement be ``removed in order to provide flexibility to \nblend adequate fuel supplies in a cost-effective manner while quickly \nreducing usage of MTBE and maintaining air quality benefits.''\n  In addition, the panel agreed that ``the use of MTBE should be \nreduced substantially.'' Importantly, the panel recommended that \n``Congress act quickly to clarify federal and state authority to \nregulate and/or eliminate the use of gasoline additives that pose a \nthreat to drinking water supplies.''\n  The bill we are introducing today, while not totally repealing the \ntwo percent oxygenate requirement, moves us in that direction. It gives \nStates that choose to meet Clean Air requirements without oxygenates \nthe option to do so. It allows States that choose an oxygenate, such as \nethanol, to do so. Areas required to use reformulated gasoline for \ncleaner air will still be required to use it. The gasoline will have a \ndifferent but clean formulation. Areas will continue to have to meet \nclean air standards.\n  MTBE has contaminated groundwater at over 10,000 sites in California, \naccording to the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. Of 10,972 sites \ngroundwater sites sampled, 39 percent had MTBE, according to the State \nDepartment of Health Services. Of 765 surface water sources sampled, \n287, 38 percent, had MTBE.\n  Nationally, one EPA-funded study of 34 States found that MTBE was \npresent more than 20 percent of the time in 27 of the States. A U.S. \nGeological Survey report had similar findings. An October 1999 \nCongressional Research Service analysis concluded that at least 41 \nstates have had MTBE detections in water.\n  In California, Governor Davis concluded that MTBE ``poses a \nsignificant risk to California's environment'' and directed that MTBE \nbe phased out in California by December 31, 2002. There is not a \nsufficient supply of ethanol or other oxygenates to fully replace MTBE \nin California, without huge gasoline supply disruptions and price \nspikes.\n  In addition, California can make clean-burning gas without \noxygenates. Therefore, California is in the impossible position of \nhaving to meet a federal requirement that is 1. contaminating the water \nand 2. is not necessary to achieve clean air.\n  A major University of California study concluded that MTBE provides \n``no significant air quality benefit'' but that its use poses ``the \npotential for regional degradation of water resources, especially \nground water. . . .'' Oxygenates, say the experts, are not necessary \nfor reformulated gasoline.\n  California has developed a gasoline formula that provides flexibility \nand provides clean air. Refiners use an approach called the \n``predictive model,'' which guarantees clean-burning RFG gas with \noxygenates, with less than two percent oxygenates, and with no \noxygenates. Several refiners, including Chevron and Tosco, are selling \nMTBE-free gas in California, for example.\n  Under this bill, clean air standards would still have to be met and \ngasoline would have to meet all other requirements of the federal \nreformulated gasoline program, including the limits on benzene, heavy \nmetals, and the emission of nitrogen oxides.\n  This bill will give California and other States the relief they need \nfrom an unwarranted, unnecessary requirement. It will give state \nofficials flexibility to determine whether to use oxygenates in their \ngasoline. The bill does not undo the Clean Air Act. The bill does not \ndegrade air quality.\n  The two percent oxygenate requirement creates an unnecessary federal \n``recipe'' for gasoline. It causes contamination of groundwater. It \nadds to the price of gasoline unnecessarily, and it will probably \ntrigger disruptions in gasoline supplies this summer.\n  I call on this Congress to enact this legislation promptly. \nCalifornians do not need to have MTBE -laced drinking water to enjoy \nthe benefits of cleaner air. It is that simple.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an editorial from the Sacramento Bee \ndescribing the MTBE problem in California be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Sacramento Bee, Apr. 23, 2001]\n\n      Remember MTBE?--Political Inattention May Fuel Price Spikes\n\n       It was a poison brew that sent California into an \n     electricity swoon: rising demand, stagnant supplies and \n     missed political opportunities. Unfortunately, President Bush \n     may be about to stir up virtually the same potion with \n     another source of energy, gasoline. Like the electricity \n     crunch, this gasoline problem can be averted with timely \n     political action.\n       Under federal law, gasoline in dirty air basins must \n     contain an additive known as an oxygenate. These additives \n     produce cleaner-burning fuel. The primary additive in \n     California is the infamous MTBE; a byproduct of the refinery \n     process. It can cause drinking water to smell like turpentine \n     at minute concentrations, so the state plans to phase out \n     MTBE by the end of 2002.\n       Refiners say that can produce clean-burning gasoline \n     without an oxygenate but farm politics has kept the \n     requirement in law. For now, the only alternative to MTBE is \n     ethanol, which is made from corn and other grains.\n       That threatens California with the kind of imbalance \n     between supply and demand that could push up gasoline prices.\n       Switching from MTBE to ethanol as the additive of choice in \n     California would increase the nation's consumption of ethanol \n     by perhaps 800 million gallons a year. This represents about \n     a 50 percent jump in demand. California produces only 9 \n     million gallons of ethanol a year. That means that the folks \n     who produce ethanol, who are concentrated in Iowa, may be \n     able to extort California with the same vigor as Texas-based \n     electricity marketers.\n       The seeds of this crisis were planted in some revisions of \n     the federal Clean Air Act, which combined the laudable goal \n     of cleaning up the skies with some unwise restrictions on the \n     legal recipes for fuel. Gov. Gray Davis has been asking for \n     federal government to waive this mandated recipe for the \n     fuel, letting the state meet its air-quality goals in a less \n     expensive way.\n       Yet with its seven precious electoral votes at stake, Iowa \n     made ethanol a litmus test for any and all presidential \n     candidates, and candidates Bush, like most others, said he \n     would stick to the recipe for gas that favors ethanol.\n       Is this now the policy of President Bush as well? Bush must \n     say something, and soon.\n       Ideally, he should use his administrative powers to waive \n     the oxygenate mandate and let various fuel recipes compete on \n     their costs and air-quality benefits. But he must say \n     something. His silence is preventing companies from building \n     ethanol (which could be produced from corn kernels or rise \n     straw) plants in California, if that is what must be done to \n     replace MTBE.\n       California can't afford the uncertainty on gasoline any \n     more than it can afford uncertainty about whether power \n     plants can be built. For a president who preaches the gospel \n     of sending clear signals to markets, Bush's silence on MTBE \n     and ethanol is an expensive sin.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LOTT (for himself and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 948. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to require the \nSecretary of Transportation to carry out a grant program for providing \nfinancial assistance for local rail line relocation projects, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, the history of the geographic expansion of \nour great Nation is closely tied to the development of our network of \nrailroad lines. Cities and towns sprang up and grew around the railroad \ntracks that provided transportation vital to their survival and \neconomic future. While the development of modern automobiles, trucks \nand airplanes have provided alternate forms of transportation, \nrailroads still fulfill important cargo and passenger transportation \nrequirements across the Nation.\n  However, in many cities and towns across our country, the increased \nneed for motor vehicle transportation, and the road infrastructure to \nfacilitate it, have led to increasing conflicts between railroads, \nmotor vehicles, and people for the use of limited, and increasingly \ncongested, space in downtown areas. Highway-rail grade crossings, even \nproperly marked and gated\n\n[[Page S5622]]\n\nones, increase the risk of fatal accidents. Many rail lines cut \ndowntown areas in half while serving few, if any, rail customers in the \ndowntown area. Heavy rail traffic can cut off one side of a town to \nvital emergency services, including fire, police, ambulance, and \nhospital services. Downtown rail corridors can hamper economic \ndevelopment by restricting access to bisected areas.\n  This situation is not the fault of the railroads. They own and have \ninvested heavily to maintain their existing rail lines. These conflicts \nare due to economic and technological changes that occur faster and \nmore easily than railroads can economically adjust. In 1998, the \nCongress enacted a landmark surface transportation bill, called TEA-21. \nWhile TEA-21 provides some flexibility in the use of the Highway Trust \nFund to enable States to address some of these concerns, it is \nprimarily focused on solving transportation problems by building or \nmodifying roads, including road overpasses and underpasses, as it \nshould be. However, in many situations, this highway-rail conflict can \nnot, or should not, be fixed by cutting off or modifying a roadway. The \nanswer is often to relocate the rail line. I know of at least five such \nsituations in my home State of Mississippi, so there must be many more \nin other States.\n  To address this need, I, along with Senator Kerry, today introduce \nthe Community Rail Line Relocation Assistance Act of 2001. The bill \nwould authorize the Secretary of Transportation to provide grants to \nStates or communities to pay for the costs of relocating a rail line \nwhere this solution makes the most sense. In those cases where the best \nsolution is to build a railroad tunnel, underpass, or overpass, or even \nreroute the rail line around the downtown area, this bill will enable \nthese cities and towns to afford to undertake such a significant \ninfrastructure project.\n  Our bill would authorize grants to fund rail line relocation projects \nthat: (1) mitigate the adverse effects of rail traffic on safety, motor \nvehicle traffic flow, or economic development; (2) involve a lateral or \nvertical relocation of the rail line in lieu of the closing of a grade \ncrossing or the relocation of a road; and (3) provide at least as much \nbenefit over the economic life of the project as the cost of the \nproject. The DOT would fund 90 percent of the cost of these rail line \nrelocation projects out of the general fund of the Treasury. The State \nor local government would be required to pay the remaining 10 percent, \nbut would be allowed to cover this cost through appropriate in-kind \ncontributions or dedicated private contributions.\n  In awarding these grants, the Secretary of Transportation would have \nto consider: (1) the ability of the State or community to fund the \nproject without Federal assistance; (2) the equitable treatment of \nvarious regions of the country; (3) that at least 50 percent of the \navailable funding be spent on projects costing less than $50 million; \nand (4) that not more than 25 percent of the available funding may be \nspent on any single project. The bill would authorize $250 million in \ngrants during the first year, and $500 million over each of the \nfollowing five years.\n  I understand that some may ask ``why don't the railroads pay for \nthese relocation costs?'' As I noted earlier, the railroad has the \nright of way and has no legal obligation to move. However, I know the \nrailroads to be concerned about maintaining good relations with the \ncommunities they serve and pass through. They want to cooperate in \nsolving this problem. That is why the Association of American Railroads \nand the Short Line and Regional Railroad Association support this bill. \nThe bill is also supported by the Railway Progress Institute and the \nNational Railroad Construction and Maintenance Association. This \nproposal has been enthusiastically received by several State and local \ngovernment associations, and I hope to have their endorsements of the \nbill soon. I ask my Senate colleagues to review the needs of their own \nStates and support this bill and I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record. \n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 948\n\n  [Data not available at time of printing.]\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN:\n  S. 949. A bill for the relief of Zhenfu Ge; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer today, \nlegislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Zhenfu Ge. \nMrs. Ge is the grandmother of two U.S. citizen children who face the \ndevastation of being separated from their grandmother after losing \ntheir mother just last month.\n  Mrs. Ge came to the United States in 1998 to help care for her two \ngrandchildren while her U.S. citizen daughter Yanyu Wang and her son-\nin-law John Marks worked. Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Ge's daughter filed \nan immigration petition on her behalf. She was scheduled for an April \n26 Immigration and Naturalization Service, INS, interview, which is the \nlast step in the green card process. The family anticipated that the \ninterview would result in Mrs. Ge's gaining a green card.\n  In a tragic turn of events, Mrs. Ge's daughter was diagnosed with a \nrare and deadly form of lymphoma and given only 7 months to live. As \nMrs. Wang's health quickly declined, she asked her mother to care for \nher 3-year-old daughter and 12-year-old son after her death. Mrs. Ge \npromised her daughter she would care for her grandchildren and quickly \nbecame the most active maternal figure in their lives.\n  On April 15 of this year, 11 days before Mrs. Ge's scheduled INS \ninterview, her daughter died. Because current law does not allow Mrs. \nGe to adjust her status without her daughter, Mrs. Ge now faces \ndeportation.\n  This family has certainly felt the pain of a significant tragedy. \nWith the death of Yanyu Wang, her family must begin to rebuild their \nlives and face a future without their loved one. Losing a grandmother \nto deportation will only further the grief and compromise the emotional \nhealth of her two young grandchildren, who are still mourning the loss \nof their mother. According to her son-in-law, John Mark, Mrs. Ge \n``represents continuity and a tie to their mother for our children, and \nher presence will allow me to continue to successfully support my \nfamily.\n  Mrs. Ge has done everything she could to become a permanent resident \nof this country. But for the tragedy of her daughter's untimely death, \nshe likely would have attained that status.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this private legislation so that we \ncan help Mrs. Ge, her grandchildren, and son-in-law begin to rebuild \ntheir lives in the wake of their family tragedy and allow Mrs. Ge to \nkeep the promise she made to her daughter.\n  I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record. I also ask unanimous consent that the letter from Mr. Marks \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 949\n\n  [Data not available at time of printing.]\n\n\n                                                Sausalito, CA,\n\n                                                   April 19, 2001.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write to appeal for your help in \n     an exceptional immigration case regarding my mother-in-law, \n     Zhenfu Ge (United States Immigration & Naturalization Service \n     reference #A78192014.)\n       Mrs. Ge came to the United States from her native Shanghai, \n     China in 1998 after our daughter was born. The purpose of her \n     immigration was to care for our infant and for our nine-year-\n     old son to enable my wife and me to work. I have lived in \n     California most of my life and I work for Kaiser Permanente \n     in San Rafael; my wife, Yanyu Wang, was a research scientist \n     for Onyx Pharmaceuticals in Richmond, and a naturalized \n     citizen of the United States.\n       We had applied for naturalization for Mrs. Ge to allow her \n     to remain in the United States to care for her grandchildren \n     indefinitely. We had every expectation that the INS hearing \n     set for April 26 (see correspondence enclosed) would result \n     in the successful completion of her application.\n       My wife had learned that she was suffering from lymphoma in \n     1999. Unfortunately, despite every possible medical \n     intervention, she died on April 15, eleven days before her \n     mother's hearing for naturalization. We are advised by our \n     attorney that absent her daughter, Mrs. Ge's case will be \n     dismissed out-of-hand, and she will be forced to return to \n     China.\n       I hope you will agree that Mrs. Ge's presence in our family \n     is even more important following the death of my wife. She is \n     the\n\n[[Page S5623]]\n\n     only maternal figure for our children, she represents \n     continuity and a tie to their mother for our children, and \n     her presence will allow me to continue to successfully \n     support my family notwithstanding the reduction of our income \n     to a single salary.\n       Before she died, my wife implored her mother to do \n     everything possible to remain in the United States to ensure \n     that our children would be raised with her care and love. I \n     ask for your help in enabling this to happen.\n       Thank you for your consideration in this matter.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                        John Mark.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself and Mr. Reid):\n  S. 950. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to address problems \nconcerning methyl tertiary butyl ether, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, by now everyone knows of \nthe damage that the gasoline additive, MTBE, has done to our nation's \ndrinking water supply, including in the state of New Hampshire. MTBE \nhas been a component of our fuel supply for two decades. In 1990, the \nClean Air Act was amended to include a clean gasoline program. That \nprogram mandated the use of an oxygenate in our fuel, MTBE was one of \ntwo options to be used. The problem with MTBE is its ability to migrate \nthrough the ground very quickly and into the water table. Several \nstates have had gasoline leaks or spills lead to the closure of wells \nbecause of MTBE. MTBE is not a proven carcinogen, but its smell and \ntaste does render water unusable. Many homes in New Hampshire and \nacross the nation have lost use of their water supply because of MTBE \ncontamination.\n  Today I am introducing a bill with my friend Senator Reid, who is the \nRanking Member on the committee that I chair, the Environment & Public \nWorks Committee. This bill addresses the problems associated with MTBE, \nbut will not reduce any environmental benefits of the Clean Air \nprogram. Briefly, this bill will: Authorize $400 million out of the \nLeaking Underground Storage Tank Fund (LUST Fund) to help the states \nclean up MTBE contamination, address the integrity of Underground \nStorage Tanks and the program; Ban MTBE four years after enactment of \nthis bill; Allow Governors to waive the gasoline oxygenate requirement \nof the Clean Air Act; Preserve environmental benefits on air toxics, \nand; Provide funds to help transition from MTBE to other clean, safe \nfuels.\n  The funding for cleanup and transition is provided out of a sense of \nfairness. Since a Federal mandate caused the pollution, it would be \nirresponsible for the Federal Government not to bear some of the \nfinancial burden associated with the clean up and the transition to a \nless destructive alternative fuel.\n  This is a very complex issue that the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee has struggled with for months. It has always been my intent \nto craft a solution that was direct and balanced. There are many \ncompeting interests and a number of solutions have been offered. Most \nof the competing interests are based on regional differences and \npreferences.\n  Some prefer a simple ban of MTBE, this approach would make gas \ndramatically more expansive and more dirty. Some would like a stand \nalone mandate of Ethanol, that too has many problems associated with \nit. Ethanol would bring with it both cost and smog concerns, \nparticularly in states like New Hampshire. Simply eliminating the RFG \nmandate does not work either. Under this scenario, MTBE would continue \nto be used and wells would continue to be contaminated.\n  I am also very pleased that this bill is consistent with the \nPresident's National Energy Policy because it will reduce the intra-\nregional patchwork of what are known as ``boutique'' fuels. This bill \nwill allow for the use of one fuel blend to meet RFG requirement in \nmany regions that currently require multiple boutique fuels. This will \nease the burden on refineries and fuel supply, which in turn will \nreduce the risk of increased gas prices for the consumer. The fuel \nsuppliers recognize this benefit and I am very pleased that this bill \nhas the support of the American Petroleum Institute. While they have \nraised some minor technical concerns that I am committed to addressing \nprior to passage, I am pleased to have their support.\n  I believe that this bill provides for a workable solution to both our \nMTBE problem as well as addressing the ``boutique'' fuels problems in \nthis country. We will clean up our nation's drinking water and preserve \nthe environmental benefits of RFG without undue added cost to the \nconsumers. I am convinced this is the right approach.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 950\n\n  [Data not available at time of printing.]\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, the Chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, in introducing legislation to address the water resource \nproblems that have been caused in Lake Tahoe and around the country by \nMTBE contamination.\n  As my colleagues may know, the oxygenate requirement that Congress \nincluded in the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments for certain nonattainment \nareas was met by most fuel providers and refiners with significantly \nincreased production of MTBE. While this additive has proven beneficial \nin meeting air quality goals and reducing toxic air pollution, its \nenhanced production and usage has led to major drinking and surface \nwater contamination, largely because of leaking underground storage \ntanks, spills and watercraft releases.\n  Our bill seeks to deal with the MTBE problem and prevent such \nunintended consequences from occurring again, while still protecting \nair and water quality. This measure embodies several of the major \nrecommendations of the EPA's Blue Ribbon Panel on Oxygenates in \nGasoline.\n  We are proposing to significantly enhance state authority and \nresources to deal with remediation of MTBE releases from leaking \nunderground storage tanks, and to improve compliance and prevent \nadditional releases at these sources. Four years after enactment, MTBE \nwould be banned from the fuel supply. The bill would amend the Clean \nAir Act to ensure that additives added to the fuel supply in the future \nundergo regular testing and review of public health and water quality \nimpacts.\n  Our legislation allows Governors to waive out of the oxygenate \nrequirement imposed by the Act's reformulated gasoline, RFG provisions \nand, for the RFG areas in those states, refiners and fuel providers \nwould have to ensure that there would be continued overcompliance with \ntoxics reductions performance standards based on regional averages. In \nrecognition of the industry investments made to comply with the \noxygenate requirement, the bill authorizes grants to American companies \nmaking MTBE for domestic consumption in RFG areas if they opt to \nconvert to production of replacement additives that do not degrade \nwater quality, as well as continuing to improve public health and air \nquality. Finally, the bill allows the EPA to improve on its mobile \nsource toxics rule and afford better protection to more sensitive and \nexposed populations from these harmful substances.\n  This is a sensible bill that prevents backsliding on air quality and \nis designed to improve water resource protection. I am hopeful that the \nCommittee and Congress will be able to act swiftly to resolve the MTBE \nproblems facing so many communities across the nation and in Nevada.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. McCain, Mr. Hollings, \n        Mr. Breaux, Mr. Lott, Mr. Murkowski, and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 951. A bill to authorize appropriations for the Coast Guard, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Coast \nGuard Authorization Act of 2001.\n  The Coast Guard provides many critical services for our nation. \nDedicated Coast Guard personnel save an average of more than 5,000 \nlives, $2.5 billion in property, and assist more than 100,000 mariners \nin distress. Through boater safety programs and maintenance of an\n\n[[Page S5624]]\n\nextensive network of aids to navigation, the Coast Guard protects \nthousands of other people engaged in coastwise trade, commercial \nfishing activities, and recreational boating.\n  The Coast Guard enforces Federal laws and treaties related to the \nhigh seas and U.S. waters. This includes marine resource protection and \npollution control. As one of the five armed forces, the Coast Guard \nprovides a critical component of the nation's defense strategy. The \nCoast Guard has joined with the Navy under the National Fleet Policy \nStatement to integrate their complementary offshore assets and enhance \nour national defense.\n  The Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1998 was enacted on November 13, \n1992 and authorized the Coast Guard through Fiscal Year 1999. Last \nyear, I spend a considerable amount of time trying to enact meaningful \nlegislation to reauthorize the Coast Guard. To that end, the Commerce \nCommittee and the Senate unanimously passed the Coast Guard \nAuthorization Act of 2000 in July of 2000. Unfortunately, final \nenactment of the bill was derailed by one provision that had nothing to \ndo with the Coast Guard itself and was outside the jurisdiction of the \nSubcommittee on Oceans and Fisheries. As a result, the dedicated and \nhard-working men and women in uniform were penalized.\n  The Coast Guard deserves more. By introducing the Coast Guard bill \ntoday, I intend to give them my full support, and I hope my colleagues \nwill work with me to provide the Coast Guard with the support that they \nhave so clearly earned.\n  For the second year in a row, the Coast Guard has announced that it \nwill reduce routine non-emergency operations by at least 10 percent. \nThe Administration's Budget request for fiscal year 2002 would leave \nthe Coast Guard $250 million short in critical operating funds. This \nshortfall will necessitate operations cutbacks to include \ndecommissioning ships and aircraft. The budget authorized in this bill \nwould restore those funding shortfalls and prevent the need for \noperational cutbacks.\n  The bill my colleagues and I introduce today authorizes funding and \npersonnel levels for the Coast Guard in fiscal years 2000 through 2002. \nThe bill authorizes funding for FY 2002 at $5.2 billion. This \nrepresents a 9.3 percent increase over the levels contained in last \nyear's Senate-passed bill authorization and a 14 percent increase over \nthe funds appropriated for fiscal year 2001. The bill also contains \nseveral provisions to provide greater flexibility on personnel \nmanagement matters and critical readiness concerns within the Coast \nGuard.\n  The Coast Guard bill contains a new initiative on fishing vessel \nsafety training. Commercial fishing is one of the most dangerous \nprofessions in the United States. Over the last three years, over two \nhundred fishermen have died at sea and even more fishing vessels have \nbeen lost. Last year, the Maine fleet tragically lost ten fishermen. \nThis bill authorizes the Coast Guard to work with and support local \norganizations that promote or provide fishing vessel safety training. \nUnder this proposal, active duty Coast Guard personnel, Coast Guard \nReserve, and members of the Coast Guard Auxiliary could serve as \ninstructors for training and safety courses; assist in the development \nof curricula; and participate in relevant advisory panels. This new \ninitiative allows discretionary participation by the agency on a not-\nto-interfere basic with other Congressionally mandated missions.\n  A major part of the Coast Guard's law enforcement mission remains \ninterdicting illegal narcotics at sea. In 2000, the Coast Guard seized \n56 vessels and arrested 201 suspects transporting illegal narcotics \nheaded for our shores. The U.S. Coast Guard set a cocaine seizure \nrecord for the second consecutive year by stopping 132,920 pounds of \ncocaine from reaching American streets, playgrounds, and schools. The \nCoast Guard also seized 50,463 pounds of marijuana products, including \nhashish and hashish oil. At $4.4 billion, the street value of the drugs \nseized last year nearly matched the entire Coast Guard budget.\n  In 2000, the Cost Guard also introduced the highly successful \nOperation New Frontier force package, including specially armed \nhelicopters, over-the-horizon pursuit boats, and the use of non-lethal \ntools to stop go-fast type smuggling boats. Operation New Frontier \nforces documented an unprecedented 100 percent success rate by seizing \nall six of the go-fast trafficking boats detected.\n  This bill provides funding to maintain many of the new drug \ninterdiction initiatives of the past few years. The Coast Guard has \nproven time and again its ability to efficiently stem the tide of drugs \nentering our nation through water routes.\n  The Coast Guard is the lead Federal agency for preventing and \nresponding to major pollution incidents in the coastal zone. It \nresponds to more than 17,000 pollution incidents in the average year. \nThe recent oil spill in the fragile Galapagos Islands is an example \nwhere our investment in the Coast Guard reaped international rewards. \nWithin 24 hours of the spill, a team of Coast Guard oil spill \nprofessionals were on transport aircraft en route to the spill scene \nwith cleanup equipment. Their presence limited the ecological damage of \nthis potentially horrific environmental tragedy.\n  One provision that deserves particular mention relates to icebreaking \nservices. The FY 2000 budget request included a proposal to \ndecommission 11 WYTL-class harbor tugs. These tugs provide vital \nicebreaking services throughout the Great Lakes and northeastern \nstates, including my home state of Maine. While I understand that the \nage of this vessel class may require some action by the agency, it \nwould be premature to decommission these vessels before the Coast Guard \nhas identified a means to assure their domestic icebreaking mission \nrequirements are fulfilled. The Coast Guard has identified seven \nwaterways within Maine that would suffer a meaningful degradation of \nservice if these tugs were decommissioned. These waterways provide \ntransport routes for oil tankers, commercial fishing vessels, and cargo \nships. The costs would be excessive to the local communities should \nthat means of transport be cut off. As we have seen during recent \nwinters, ready access to home heating fuel in Maine and elsewhere in \nthe Northeast is a necessity. As such, the bill I am introducing today \nincludes a measure that would prevent the Cost Guard from removing \nthese tugs from service unless adequate replacement assets are in \nplace.\n  Finally, we must recognize that the United States Coast Guard is a \nforce conducting 21st century operations with 20th century technology. \nOf the 39 worldwide naval fleets, the United States Coast Guard has the \n37th oldest fleet of ships and aircraft. This year the Coast Guard will \nembark on a major recapitalization for the ships and aircraft designed \nto operate more than 50 miles offshore. The Integrated Deepwater System \nacquisition program is critical to the future viability of the Coast \nGuard. I wholeheartedly support this initiative and the ``system-of-\nsystems'' procurement strategy the Coast Guard has proposed. This bill \nauthorized funding for the first year of this critical long-term \nrecapitalization program.\n  This is a good bill that enjoys bipartisan support on the Commerce \nCommittee.

REPEAL OF SPECIAL AUTHORITY TO REVOKE ENDORSEMENTS.\n\n       Section 503 of the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 1998 \n     (46 U.S.C. 12106 note) is repealed.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Coast Guard \nAuthorization Act of 2001. Charged with maintaining our national \ndefense and the safety of our citizens, the Coast Guard is a multi-\nmission agency. The Coast Guard is a branch of the U.S. Armed Forces, \nbut it is also a unique instrument of national security, responsible \nfor search and rescue services and maritime law enforcement. Daily \noperations include drug interdiction, environmental protection, marine \ninspection, licensing, port safety and security, aids to navigation, \nwaterways management, and boating safety.\n  Recently the Coast Guard has been forced to reduce its services and \ncut its operations as a result of funding shortfalls. Earlier this \nyear, for the second year in a row, the Coast Guard reduced its non-\nemergency operations by over 10 percent due to a shortfall in operating \nappropriations. Mr. President, the Coast Guard and the American people \ndeserve better, and the bill I am proud to cosponsor today authorizes \nfunding at levels which would restore the Coast Guard to the full \noperational level. Additionally, the bill provides necessary funding \nfor cutter and aircraft maintenance including the elimination of the \nexisting spare parts shortage.\n  This bill provides the funding necessary to maintain the level of \nservice and the quality of performance that the United States has come \nto expect from the Coast Guard. I commend the men and women of the \nCoast Guard for their honorable and courageous service to this country. \nThe bill authorizes $4.63 billion in FY 2000, $4.83 billion in 2001, \nand $5.22 billion in FY 2002.\n  One critical goal of this bill is to provide parity with the \nDepartment of Defense on certain personnel matters. We\n\n[[Page S5630]]\n\nshould ensure that the men and women serving in the Coast Guard are not \nadversely affected because the Coast Guard does not fall under the DOD \numbrella. This bill provides parity with DOD for military pay and \nhousing allowance increases, Coast Guard membership on the USO Board of \nGovernors, and compensation for isolated duty.\n  In today's strong economy, the Armed Services are seeing an exodus of \nexperienced officers and enlisted personnel. Additional funding in this \nbill provides for recruiting and retention initiatives, to ensure that \nthe Coast Guard retains the most qualified young Americans. In \naddition, it addresses the current shortage of qualified pilots and \nauthorizes the Coast Guard to send more students to flight school. New \nprograms will offer financial assistance to bring college students into \nthe Service and bring retired officers back on active duty to fill \ntemporary experience gaps.\n  The Coast Guard is the lead federal agency in maritime drug \ninterdiction. Therefore, they are often our nation's first line of \ndefense in the war on drugs. This bill authorizes the Coast Guard to \nacquire and operate up to seven ex-Navy patrol boats, thereby expanding \nthe Coast Guard's critical presence in the Caribbean, a major drug \ntrafficking area. With the vast majority of the drugs smuggled into the \nUnited States on the water, the Coast Guard must remain well equipped \nto prevent drugs from reaching our schools and streets. I was gratified \nto learn that just a few weeks ago, the Coast Guard made the largest \nsingle maritime cocaine seizure in history; more than 13 tons of \nillegal drugs bound for U.S. streets are instead bound for an \nincinerator.\n  Environmental protection, including oil-spill cleanup, is an \ninvaluable service provided by the Coast Guard. Under current law, the \nCoast Guard has access to a permanent annual appropriation of $50 \nmillion, distributed by the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, to carry \nout emergency oil spill response needs. Over the past few years, the \nfund has spent an average of $42 to $50 million per year, without the \noccurrence of a major oil spill. Clearly these funds would not be \nadequate to respond to a large spill. For instance, a spill the size of \nthe Exxon Valdez could easily deplete the annual appropriated funds in \ntwo to three weeks. This bill authorizes the Coast Guard to borrow up \nto an additional $100 million, per incident, from the Oil Spill \nLiability Trust Fund, for emergency spill responses. In such cases, it \nalso requires the Coast Guard to notify Congress of amounts borrowed \nwithin thirty days and repay such amounts once payment is collected \nfrom the responsible party.\n  The 1999 President's Interagency Task Force on U.S. Coast Guard Roles \nand Missions reported ``The Coast Guard provides the United States a \nbroad spectrum of vital services that will be increasingly important in \nthe decades ahead.'' It further found that ``the nation must take \naction soon to modernize and recapitalize Coast Guard forces, if the \nService is to remain Semper Paratus--Always Ready.'' Mr. President, \nthat modernization is just beginning and I am proud to support the \nAdministration's request for $338 million in Fiscal Year 2002 to fund \nthe Integrated Deepwater System project. The bill I am cosponsoring \ntoday authorizes full funding for the first year of this multi-year \nproject to replace more than 115 old ships and 165 aircraft that will \nsoon reach their service lives. I support the Coast Guard's \ngroundbreaking procurement process that stresses life cycle cost \nefficiency and not just lowest procurement cost.\n  This bill represents a thorough set of improvements which will make \nthe Coast Guard more effective, improve the quality of life of its \npersonnel, and facilitate their daily operations. I would like to thank \nSenators Snowe and Kerry for their bipartisan leadership on Coast Guard \nissues, as well as my fellow co-sponsors Senators Hollings, Breaux, \nLott, Murkowski, and DeWine for their longstanding support of the Coast \nGuard.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. \n        Bayh):\n  S. 952. A bill to provide collective bargaining rights for public \nsafety officers employed by States or their political subdivisions; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to be joined by \nSenators Kennedy, DeWine, and Bayh in introducing the Public Safety \nEmployer-Employee Cooperation Act of 2001. This legislation would \nextend to firefighters and police officers the right to discuss \nworkplace issues with their employers.\n  With the enactment of the Congressional Accountability Act, State and \nlocal government employees remain the only sizable segment of workers \nleft in America who do not have the basic right to enter into \ncollective bargaining agreements with their employers. While most \nStates do provide some collective bargaining rights for their public \nemployees, others do not.\n  The lack of collective bargaining rights is especially troublesome in \nthe public safety arena. Firefighters and police officers take \nseriously their oath to protect the public safety, and as a result, \nthey do not engage in work stoppages or slowdowns. The absence of \ncollective bargaining denies these workers any opportunity to influence \nthe decisions that affect their lives or livelihoods.\n  Studies have shown that communities which promote such cooperation \nenjoy much more effective and efficient delivery of emergency services. \nSuch cooperation, however, is not possible in the 18 States that do not \nprovide public safety employees with the fundamental right to bargain \nwith their employers.\n  The legislation I am introducing today recognizes the unique \nsituation and obligation of public safety officers. First, we create a \nspecial collective bargaining right outside the scope of other Federal \nlabor law and specifically prohibit the use of strikes, work stoppages \nor other actions that could disrupt the delivery of services. Second, \nthis legislation utilizes the procedures and expertise of the Federal \nLabor Relations Authority to help resolve disputes between public \nsafety employers and employees. This bill simply requires that each \nState provide minimum collective bargaining rights to their public \nsafety employees in whatever manner they choose. It outlines certain \nprovisions that must be included in state laws, but leaves the major \ndecisions to the state legislatures. States that already have the \nminimum collective bargaining protections as outlined in this \nlegislation would be exempt from the Federal statute. And third, the \nbill specifically prohibits strikes, lockouts, sickouts, work slowdowns \nor any other job action which will disrupt the delivery of emergency \nservices.\n  Labor-management partnerships, which are built upon bargaining \nrelationships, result in improved public safety. Employer-employee \ncooperation contains the promise of saving the taxpayer money by \nenabling workers to give input as to the most efficient way to provide \nservices. In fact, States that currently give firefighters the right to \ndiscuss workplace issues actually have lower fire department budgets \nthan states without those laws.\n  The Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation act of 2001 will put \nfirefighters and law enforcement officers on equal footing with other \nemployees and provide them with the fundamental right to negotiate with \nemployers over such basic issues as hours, wages, and workplace \nconditions.\n  I urge its adoption and ask unanimous consent that the text of this \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 952\n\n  [Data not available at time of printing.]\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored today to join my colleagues, \nSenators Gregg, DeWine, and Bayh, to introduce the ``Public Safety \nEmployer-Employee Cooperation Act of 2001.''\n  For more than 60 years, collective bargaining has enabled labor and \nmanagement to work together to improve job conditions and increase \nproductivity. Through collective bargaining, labor and management have \nled the way on many important improvements in today's workplace--\nespecially with regard to health and pension benefits, paid holidays \nand sick leave, and workplace safety.\n\n[[Page S5631]]\n\n  Collective bargaining in the public sector, once a controversial \nissue, is now widely accepted. It has been common since at least 1962, \nwhen President Kennedy signed an Executive Order granting these basic \nrights to federal employees. Congressional employees have had these \nrights since enactment of the Congressional Accountability Act almost a \ndecade ago. It is long since time to give state and local government \nemployees federal protection for the basic right to enter into \ncollective bargaining agreements with their employers.\n  The act we are introducing today extends this protection to \nfirefighters, police officers, paramedics and emergency medical \ntechnicians. The bill guarantees the fundamental rights necessary for \ncollective bargaining--the right to form and join a union; the right to \nbargain over hours, wages and working conditions; the right to sign \nlegally enforceable contracts; and the right to a resolution mechanism \nin the event of an impasse in negotiations. The bill also accomplishes \nits goals in a reasonable and moderate way.\n  The benefits of this bill are clear and compelling. It will lead to \nsafer working conditions for public safety officers. These valued \npublic employees serve in some of the country's most dangerous, \nstrenuous and stressful jobs. Every year, more than 80,000 police \nofficers and 75,000 firefighters are injured on the job. An average of \n160 police officers and nearly 100 firefighters die in the line of duty \neach year. Because these men and women serve on the front lines in \nproviding firefighting services, law enforcement services, and \nemergency medical services, they know what it takes to create safer \nworking conditions. They deserve the benefit of collective bargaining \nto give them a voice in decisions that can literally make a life-and-\ndeath difference on the job.\n  Our bill will also save money for states and local communities. \nExperience has shown that when public safety officers can discuss \nworkplace conditions with management, partnerships and cooperation \ndevelop and lead to improved labor-management relations and better, \nmore cost-effective services. A study by the International Association \nof Fire Fighters shows that states and municipalities that give \nfirefighters the right to discuss workplace issues have lower fire \ndepartment budgets than states without such laws. When workers who \nactually do the job are able to provide advice on their work \nconditions, there are fewer injuries, better morale, better information \non new technologies, and more efficient ways to provide the services.\n  It is a matter of basic fairness to give these courageous men and \nwomen the same rights that have long been enjoyed by other workers. \nThey put their lives on the line to protect us every day. They deserve \nto have an effective voice on the job, and improvements in their work \nconditions will benefit their entire community.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. \n        Brownback, Mr. Allard, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Allen, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \n        Bennett, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Burns, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Cleland, Ms. Collins, \n        Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Craig, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Corzine, \n        Mr. DeWine, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Ensign, \n        Mr. Durbin, Mr. Enzi, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Frist, Mr. Graham, Mr. \n        Gramm, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Hatch, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Helms, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \n        Jeffords, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lott, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lugar, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Murkowski, Mr. Nelson of \n        Florida, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Santorum, Mr. \n        Wellstone, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Smith of New \n        Hampshire, Mr. Smith of Oregon,\n  S. 953. A bill to establish a Blue Ribbon Study Panel and an Election \nAdministration Commission to study voting procedures and election \nadministration, to provide grants to modernize voting procedures and \nelection administration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nRules and Administration.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, when election reform emerged on the \nnation's agenda last winter, as chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, \nthe committee of jurisdiction over election law, I resolved to keep the \nissue from getting bogged down in the partisan morass. The furor and \nfervor surround the last election has finally given way to a \nconstructive bipartisan consensus. Today it is a distinct pleasure to \njoin with Senators Schumer, Torricelli, and Brownback in advancing \nbipartisan legislation to restore faith in American elections.\n  Even more remarkable is the support in the endeavor of two reform \ngroups with whom I have been engaged over the years in something less \nthan a mutual admiration society, to say the least: Common Cause and \nthe League of Women Voters. Ours is perhaps the most curious alliance \nsince Bob Dole teamed up with Britney Spears to push Pepsi. And only \nslightly less jarring.\n  Nearly as discombobulating was opening the New York Times editorial \npage and seeing my name in print in the lead editorial applauding the \nMcConnell/Schumer/Torricelli/Brownback bill. My wife, the Secretary of \nLabor, subsequently performed the Heimlich maneuver, lest I choke on \nthe New York Times' praise. No doubt the editorial writer experienced \nsimilar bewilderment, as Darth Vader suddenly became Luke Skywalker \novernight.\n  As this alliance indicates, election reform must transcend \npartisanship and result in real and lasting achievement by ensuring \nwhat I call, the three A's of election reform: Accuracy, Access and \nAccountability. This is the essence of this bill.\n  Our bill will establish, for the first time in our Nation's history, \na permanent Election Administration Commission. This new permanent \ncommission will bring focused expertise to bear on the administration \nof elections, and, importantly, award matching grants to States and \nlocalities to improve the accuracy and integrity of our election \nsystem.\n  Accuracy. The last election produced outcries over inaccurate voter \nrolls where some cities actually had more registered voters than the \nvoting age population. And, of course, we've all heard the stories of \nboth pets and dead people being registered to vote, and, in some \ninstances, actually voting.\n  This legislation will require accurate voter rolls to ensure that \nthose who vote are legally entitled to do so, and do so only once.\n  Access. This legislation also seeks to ensure that never again will \nour men and women in uniform be denied the opportunity to vote. The \nbill will merge the Department of Defense's Office of Voting Assistance \ninto the new permanent commission. Moreover, the bill will increase the \nability of disabled voters to both register and vote.\n  Accountability. The new Election Administration Commission will \ndramatically increase accountability by awarding grants only to those \nstates and localities who ensure accurate and accessible voting.\n  Again, I applaud Senators Schumer, Torricelli, and Brownback for \ntheir principled and diligent work on this effort over the past six \nmonths. I believe this bill is the first, best step toward meaningful \nelection reform.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mr. Graham, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kerry, \n        Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Feingold, \n        and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 955. A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to modify \nrestrictions added by the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration \nResponsibility Act of 1996; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleagues, \nSenators Graham, Leahy, Kerry, Wellstone, Dodd, Inouye, Akaka, \nFeingold, and Durbin in introducing the Immigrant Fairness Restoration \nAct. This legislation will restore the balance to our immigration laws \nthat was lost when Congress amended the immigration laws in 1996.\n  The changes made in 1996 went too far. They have had harsh \nconsequences that punish families and violate individual liberty, \nfairness and due process.\n\n[[Page S5632]]\n\n Families are being torn apart. Persons who present no danger to their \ncommunities have been left to languish in INS detention. Individuals \nare being summarily deported from the United States, to countries they \nno longer remember, separated from all that they know and love.\n  The bill we are introducing will undo many of these harsh \nconsequences. It will eliminate the retroactive application of the 1996 \nchanges. Permanent residents who committed offenses long before the \nenactment of the 1996 laws should be able to apply for the relief from \nremoval under the law as it existed when the offense was committed.\n  Current immigration laws too often punish permanent residents out of \nall proportion to their crimes. Relatively minor offenses are turned \ninto aggravated felonies. Permanent residents who did not have criminal \nconvictions or serve prison sentences are blocked from all relief from \ndeportation.\n  Our proposal restores the discretion that immigration judges \npreviously had and responsibly exercised to evaluate cases on an \nindividual basis and grant relief from deportation to deserving \npersons. Currently, immigration judges are precluded from granting such \nrelief to many permanent residents, regardless of the circumstances or \nequities in the cases. As a result of the 1996 laws, the judges' hands \nare tied, even in the most compelling cases. This legislation will \nallow immigration judges to return to their proper role.\n  Our bill will also end mandatory detention. The Attorney General will \nhave the authority to release from detention persons who do not pose a \ndanger to the community and are not a flight risk. Detention is an \nextraordinary power that should only be used in extraordinary \ncircumstances. A judge should have the discretion to release from \ndetention persons who are not a danger to the community and who do not \npose a flight risk.\n  Clearly, dangerous criminals should be detained and deported. But \nindefinite detention must end. No public purpose is served by wasting \nvaluable resources detaining non-dangerous individuals, many of whom \nhave lived in this country with their families for many years, \nestablished strong ties to their communities, paid taxes, and \ncontributed in other ways to the fabric of our Nation.\n  The 1996 laws also stripped the Federal courts of any authority to \nreview the decisions of the INS and the immigration courts. Under \npresent law, harsh determinations are often made at the unreviewable \ndiscretion of INS officers. Fundamental decisions are made on the basis \nof a brief review of a few pages in a file, or a perfunctory \nadministrative hearing, without judicial review. Our proposal will \nrestore such review. Immigrants deserve their day in court.\n  Americans are proud of our heritage and history as a nation of \nimmigrants. It is long past time for Congress to correct the laws \nenacted in 1996.\n  Many heart-wrenching stories could be cited about the ``nightmares'' \ncreated by the 1996 laws and the people caught by its provisions.\n  Consider the case of Carlos Garcia, who fled from his native land of \nEl Salvador in 1978 during the civil war. Upon arriving in the United \nStates, he became fluent in English and attended a local community \ncollege, and in 1982, he became a permanent resident. All of his family \nlive in this country, including his U.S. citizen parents.\n  In 1993, he pleaded guilty to taking $200 from a department store \nwhere he worked. He was sentenced to two years of probation, with a \nsuspended jail sentence, and he completed his probation early. Apart \nfrom this single offense, he has no criminal history. For years, he has \nworked as a caterer, holding a security clearance, since his employer \nhandled functions in Congress, the State Department and White House. He \nregularly attends church and participates in a bone marrow transplant \nprogram to help children.\n  In 1998, the INS placed Carlos in removal proceedings after he \nreturned from a four-day vacation cruise. Because the 1996 laws made \nhis crime an aggravated felony, the immigration judge no longer had \ndiscretion to consider evidence of his positive contributions to his \ncommunity, his family ties, or the potential hardship that severing \nthose ties may cause.\n  Or consider the case of Claudette Etienne, who fled from Haiti at the \nage of 23, and was a legal resident of the United States for 20 years. \nShe had two young U.S. citizen children and lived with her husband in \nMiami. One day, during an argument, Claudette threatened her husband \nwith a broken bottle, and was sentenced to a year of probation. In June \n1999, she was found guilty of selling a small amount of cocaine and was \nsentenced to another year of probation. When she was summoned to see \nher probation officer in February 2000, INS officers arrested her and \nplaced her in deportation proceedings under the 1996 immigration laws. \nShe was imprisoned in an INS detention center for the next seven \nmonths, and in September was taken by U.S. Marshals and put on a flight \nto Haiti.\n  Upon arriving in Haiti, the police immediately jailed her in a cell \nthat was pitch black. The air was thick with the stench of human sweat \nand waste, and the temperature reached 105 degrees. Claudette had to \nrely on the compassion of prisoners and guards for food, since the jail \nprovided none. During her imprisonment in Haiti, she became sick with \nfever, stomach pains, diarrhea, and constant vomiting from drinking tap \nwater. She died in the jail a few days later.\n  Surely, Congress cannot ignore such abuses. Even many proponents of \nthe 1996 laws now admit that these changes went too far and need to be \ncorrected as soon as possible. The Immigrant Fairness Restoration Act \nwill help to protect families, assure fairness and due process, and \nrestore the integrity of our immigration laws, and I urge all my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenators Kennedy, Dodd, Durbin, Inouye, Kerry, Leahy, Akaka, and \nWellstone to introduce the Immigrant Fairness Restoration Act of 2001. \nThis legislation brings balance back to the legal system. It rights \nsome of the wrongs of the 1996 immigration law. It restores fairness \nand justice to everyone in our country.\n  As it stands today, the immigration laws violate those core American \nprinciples.\n  The original aim of the 1996 immigration bill was to control illegal \nimmigration. In practice, the law hurts legal permanent residents and \nothers who entered, or wanted to enter, the United States legally.\n  The 1996 laws, Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant \nResponsibility Act, IIRAIRA, and Antiterrorism and Effective Death \nPenalty Act, AEDPA, mandated deportation of legal aliens for relatively \ninsignificant crimes. For the most part, these are crimes for which \nthey have already served their punishment. They have restricted access \nto legal counsel and virtually no recourse in the courts.\n  This violates the tradition of our country. It also violates the \nessence of our legal system. Our constitution demands that no person \nshall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of \nlaw. This fundamental right applies to all persons, regardless of their \npaperwork or where they were born.\n  Our legal system should be about granting people their day at court, \nto provide a second chance, to keep the rules of the game fair.\n  When we think about fairness, or lack of fairness, we should think \nabout personal stories. John Gaul, formerly from Tampa, FL, has been \npunished twice for his mistakes. John was adopted from Thailand by his \nU.S. citizen parents when he was 4 years old. As a teenager, he was \nconvicted of car theft and credit card fraud, two nonviolent offenses \nfor which he served 20 months in jail. John does not remember Thailand. \nHe does not speak Thai, nor does he know of relatives there. None of \nthat mattered. John was deported to Thailand and may never be allowed \nto return to his parents in the United States.\n  Was it fair to threaten Carolina Murry of Neptune Beach with \ndeportation for voting, even though she never knew she was not a U.S. \ncitizen? Carolina's father told her that she had become a U.S. citizen \nshortly after she moved with him from the Dominican Republic at the age \nof 3. Only in 1998, when she applied for a passport, did she learn that \nin fact she was not. In the process of becoming a citizen, INS \nofficials asked her if she ever voted in a\n\n[[Page S5633]]\n\nU.S. election. She replied she had, because she takes her civic duties \nseriously. As a consequence, INS not only denied her application but \nalso told her that she faced criminal prosecution and deportation for \nvoting illegally. Only after the case caught media attention and raised \na lot of public protest did the charges get dropped.\n  Would it be fair to separate Aarti Shahani, a U.S. citizen, from her \nfather, a legal permanent resident in the United States since 1984? Her \nfather, a small businessman, is facing deportation to India. As early \nas next week he will be transferred to INS detention following a State \nsentence relating to his failure to report taxable business earnings. \nAarti has taken a leave from the University of Chicago to help support \nher family. She and her two U.S. citizen siblings continue to fight for \ntheir father's right to stay in the United States. They are fighting to \nkeep the family together.\n  Earlier this month, President Bush urged Congress to establish \nimmigration laws that recognize the importance of families and that \nhelp to strengthen them. The Immigrant Fairness Restoration Act does \nexactly that. Right now, our immigration laws tear families apart. The \nlaws are harsh and offer no chance for review or appeal.\n  I strongly believe that criminals should be punished. They should \nrepay their debt to society by incarcertaion, monetary restitution or \nother sanctions. But I also believe that everyone deserves a chance at \na fresh start after the debts are paid. No one should be punished \ntwice.\n  The 1996 law went too far. It is time to eliminate retroactivity. It \nis time to restore a system that punishes legal residents in proportion \nto their crimes. It is time to restore discretion so immigration judges \ncan evaluate cases individually and grant relief to those deserving. It \nis time to ensure legal residents are not needlessly jailed or \nimprisoned.\n  We need legislation that lives up to our nation's legacy as a country \nof immigrants. I urge my colleagues to support the Immigrant Fairness \nRestoration Act to grant everyone equal protection under the law.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORZINE:\n  S. 956. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to promote the \nuse of safety belts and child restraint systems by children, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Child \nPassenger Safety Act, a bill to ensure that our children are adequately \nrestrained and protected in cars. I am pleased to join my colleague \nCongressman Frank Pallone of New Jersey, who has introduced this \nlegislation in the House and who has a longstanding interest in child \nsafety. I also want to recognize Senator Peter Fitzgerald's commitment \nto child safety. His recent hearing on the subject of child passenger \nsafety laws shed important light on the need to encourage States to \nstrengthen their laws, and I look forward to working with him to \naddress this issue.\n  No child should be placed at risk by a simple trip to the local \ngrocer. No child should be in danger on a family trip to the beach. No \nchild should be placed in jeopardy in the daily ride to school. Yet \nunfortunately, every year almost 1,800 children aged 14 and under die \nin motor vehicle crashes, and more than 274,000 kids are injured. In \nfact, traveling in a car without a seatbelt is the leading killer of \nchildren in America.\n  Despite this compelling statistic, the lack of reasonable safety \nmeasures for kids in this country is staggering. We know that children \nwho are not restrained are far more likely to suffer severe injuries or \neven death in motor vehicle crashes, yet approximately 30 percent of \nchildren ages four and under ride unrestrained, and of those who do \nbuckle up, four out of five children are improperly secured. Only five \npercent of four- to eight-year-olds ride in booster seats.\n  Unfortunately, States have done too little to protect child \npassengers, a conclusion documented in a recent study of child car \nsafety laws by the non-profit National Safe Kids Campaign. This report \nrated the effectiveness of each State's laws in protecting children \nfrom injury in traffic accidents, and twenty-four of the fifty States \nreceived a failing grade, while only two States, Florida and \nCalifornia, received grades higher than a C. My own State of New \nJersey's laws were ranked dead last in the survey, because the State \ndoes not require any protection for children aged five or older riding \nin the back seat.\n  Among the study's alarming findings: no State fully protects all \nchild passengers ages 15 and under, no States require children aged 6-8 \nto ride in booster seats, 34 States allow child passengers to rider \nunrestrained due to exemptions, and in many States, children are \nlegally allowed to ride completely unrestrained in the back seat of a \nvehicle.\n  Statistics like these make it clear that we need new Federal \nlegislation. States are simply not doing enough to protect children in \ncar accidents, especially older children. That is why today I am \nintroducing a bill that would help ensure that all children are safely \nsecured in cars, no matter where they live. The Child Passenger Safety \nAct would encourage States to enact laws requiring that children up to \nage eight are properly secured in a child car safety seat or booster \nseat appropriate to the child's age or size. The legislation also would \nencourage States to ensure that children up to the age 16 are \nrestrained in a seatbelt, regardless of where they are sitting in the \nvehicle.\n  States that do not meet these critical goals would be subject to the \nloss of Federal transportation funds, the same approach used to \nencourage States to establish strong drunk driving standards.\n  We cannot sit idly by while so many of our children are exposed to \nunnecessary danger on our nation's roads. I ask my colleagues to join \nme in support of the Child Passenger Safety Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself, Mr. Dayton, Mr. Byrd, and Ms. \n        Stabenow)\n  S. 957. A bill to provide certain safeguards with respect to the \ndomestic steel industry; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce, on \nbehalf of myself and Senators Dayton, Byrd, and Stabenow, the Steel \nRevitalization Act of 2001. This is the companion measure to H.R. 808, \nwhich, as of this moment, has 189 cosponsors in the House. The measure \nrepresents a comprehensive approach to the serious crisis facing our \ndomestic iron ore and steel industry.\n  I want to note that several of the provisions contained in the Act \nare ones that my colleagues in the bi-partisan Steel Caucus here in the \nSenate and our counterparts in the House have been working on for some \ntime. I want to publicly acknowledge and thank, in particular, Senators \nRockefeller and Specter for their work in co-chairing the Caucus, and \nSenator Byrd for his unflinching support of the entire steel industry \nand his creative efforts on behalf of the industry's working families.\n  The Steel Revitalization Act includes the following four components: \n1. A five-year period of quantitative restrictions on the import of \niron ore, semi-finished steel, and finished steel products. Import \nlevels would be set for each product line at the average level of \npenetration that occurred during the three years prior to the onset of \nthe steel import crisis in late 1997. 2. Creation of a Steelworker \nRetiree Health Care Fund to be administered by a Steelworker Retiree \nHealth Care Board at the Department of Labor which would be accessible \nby all steel companies that provide health insurance to retirees at the \ntime of enactment. The Fund would be underwritten through a 1.5 percent \nsurcharge on the sale of all steel products in the United States, both \nimported and domestic. 3. Enhancement of the current Steel Loan \nGuarantee program to provide steel companies greater access to funds \nneeded to invest in capital improvements and take advantage of the \nlatest technological advancements. Among other things, the Act would \n(a) increase the current Steel Loan Guarantee authorization from $1 \nbillion to $10 billion, (b) increase the loan coverage from 85 percent \nto 95 percent, and (c) extend the duration of financing from 5 to 15 \nyears. 4. Creation of a $500 million grant program at the Department of \nCommerce to help defray the cost of environmental mitigation and \nrestructuring as a result of consolidation. Companies which have merged\n\n[[Page S5634]]\n\nwill be eligible to apply for such funds if their grant application \noutlines a merger that will retain 80 percent of the domestic blue-\ncollar workforce and production capacity for 10 years after the merger.\n  The recent economic conditions facing the U.S. iron ore and steel \nindustry are of particular concern to those in my home state of \nMinnesota. We are extremely proud of our state's history as the \nnation's largest producer of iron ore. The iron ore and taconite mines, \nlocated on the Iron Range in Minnesota and in our sister state of \nMichigan, have provided key raw materials to the nation's steel \nproducers for over a century.\n  You will not find a harder working, more committed group of workers \nanywhere in this country than you find in the iron ore and taconite \nindustry. This is a group of people who work under the toughest of \nconditions, are absolutely committed to their families, and who now \nface dire circumstances, through no fault of their own, because of the \neffects of unfairly traded iron ore, semi-finished steel, and finished \nsteel products.\n  Earlier this year, for example, citing poor economic conditions, LTV \nSteel Mining Company halted production at the Hoyt Lakes, Minnesota \nmine, leaving 1,400 workers out of good-paying jobs and affecting \nnearly 5,000 additional workers as well. These are people who believe \nin the importance of a strong domestic steel industry to the economic \nand national security of our country.\n  The Steel Revitalization Act is a comprehensive measure designed to \naddress the multiplicity of needs facing the iron ore and steel \nindustry today. It provides import relief, industry-wide sharing of the \nhuge retiree health care cost burdens resulting from massive layoffs \nduring the 1970's and 1980's, improved access to capital, and \nassistance for industry consolidation that protects American jobs.\n  It is imperative that we act and that we act soon. Failing economic \nconditions, huge health care legacy cost burdens, and staggering levels \nof iron ore, semi-finished steel, and finished steel imports pose \nimmense threats to this essential industry. I urge my colleagues in the \nSenate to join in helping to pass this critical legislation at the \nearliest possible date. Relief for this essential industry is long \noverdue. We cannot afford to delay.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Summary--Steel Revitalization Act\n\n       In mid-January, the United States Steelworkers of America \n     presented a proposal for a comprehensive steel revitalization \n     package. The results is H.R. 808, the Steel Revitalization \n     Act, outlined below. This was introduced on March 1, 2001 by \n     Congressional Steel Caucus Vice Chairman Peter Visclosky, \n     with 84 other original cosponsors, including Congressional \n     Steel Caucus Chairman Jack Quinn and Congressional Steel \n     Caucus Executive Committee Chairman Phil English and Vice \n     Chairman Dennis Kucinich. The measure currently has 172 \n     cosponsors.\n     TITLE I--Import Relief\n       This title will mirror H.R. 975, the Steel Import Quota \n     Bill, which was approved by the House in the 106th Congress, \n     but failed to achieve cloture in the Senate.\n\n\n                         provisions of title i\n\n       Provides import relief by imposing 5-year quotas on the \n     importation of steel and iron ore products into the U.S.\n       The quotas will limit import penetration to the average \n     pre-crisis (1994 to 1997) levels (i.e., the import levels \n     allowed in will be linked to the percentage of domestic \n     consumption of foreign steel in the years preceding the \n     import crisis).\n\n\n                         changes from h.r. 975\n\n       H.R. 975 based quotas on tonnage, not percentage of \n     penetration. Because the market is weakening, we expect \n     tonnage imported to decrease anyway. Therefore, we will link \n     quota numbers to penetration to account for expected \n     decreases in imported tonnage. However, due to differences in \n     statistical methodology, iron ore, semifinished steel and \n     coke product quotas will be determined by tonnage.\n       H.R. 975 did not include stainless and specialty steel \n     products. This provision will include those products.\n       This measure will include a short supply clause to ensure \n     that sufficient supplies of steel products are available and \n     to prevent overpricing in some product areas.\n     TITLE II--Legacy Cost Sharing\n       This title will address the overwhelming cost many steel \n     companies face in retiree health care due to massive \n     downsizing and restructuring in the 1980s.\n\n\n                         Provisions of Title II\n\n       Imposes a 1.5 percent surcharge on the sale of steel and \n     iron ore in the U.S. The average cost of a ton of steel is \n     about $500, translating to a $7.50 per ton payment. With an \n     average of 130 million tons of steel sold in the U.S. per \n     year, the fund should generate approximately $880 million per \n     year.\n       Revenues will be placed in a Steelworker Retiree Health \n     Care Trust Fund, to be administered by the Department of \n     Labor through a newly established Steel Retiree Health Care \n     Board.\n       The Board will accept applications from steel and iron ore \n     companies for access to the Fund to defray the cost of \n     retiree health care benefits.\n       Eligible retirees will have retired prior to enactment of \n     the bill.\n       The fund will be available to defray up to 75 percent of \n     the cost of health care per individual, based on benefits \n     available at the time of enactment adjusted for inflation in \n     the health care market. New benefits negotiated by the union \n     or offered by the company will not be eligible for increased \n     funding.\n       If there are insufficient funds to cover all eligible \n     health care rebates, the funds will be divided equally on a \n     per-beneficiary basis. The funds will not be divided based on \n     benefit costs.\n       After the first year the level of the tax will be adjusted \n     annually based on the size of the fund and projected outlays, \n     until the tax sunsets automatically. The tax will never \n     exceed 1.5 percent.\n     TITLE III--Steel Loan Guarantee Adjustments\n       This title will address problems with the Steel Loan \n     Guarantee program, which has proven ineffective in finalizing \n     loans. Currently, 7 loans have been approved, but only one \n     has actually resulted in financing for a steel company \n     (Geneva Steel). Steel companies are finding it almost \n     impossible to raise capital through other sources, especially \n     due to plummeting stock prices and decreasing demand. This \n     portion of the bill was hammered out with the help of Senator \n     Byrd's office.\n\n\n                        provisions of title iii\n\n       The authorization of the program will be increased from $1 \n     billion to $10 billion.\n       The guarantee will cover 95 percent of the loan, up from \n     85% under the current program.\n       The duration of the loan guarantee will be extended from 5 \n     to 15 years.\n       The period between application to the Board and \n     determination of a guarantee will be set at 45 days.\n       The Board will be composed of the Secretaries of Treasury, \n     Commerce, and Labor, or their designees, with the \n     Chairmanship held by the Commerce Secretary. Currently the \n     Board includes the Fed and SEC Chairmen, who have limited \n     experience with the steel industry.\n       The funds made available from loans will be limited to \n     capital expenditures, and will not be used to service \n     existing debt.\n     TITLE IV--Incentives for Consolidation\n       This title will encourage the responsible consolidation of \n     the steel industry, which is currently deeply fragmented.\n\n\n                         Provisions of Title IV\n\n       A $500 million grant program at the Department of Commerce \n     will be created.\n       Any time up to 1 year after a merger is completed, an \n     eligible company, as defined as a producer of products \n     protected under the Quota portion of the bill, will be able \n     to apply for up to $100 million in grants to defray costs \n     associated with the merger.\n       The Department of Commerce will review the merger proposal \n     to determine if the merger will promote the retention of jobs \n     and production capacity.\n       If the merger meets certain thresholds in employment and \n     production capacity retention (retention of 80 percent of the \n     workforce and at least 50 percent of the workforce of the \n     acquired company and 80 percent of production capacity, not \n     utilization), the company applying will be awarded up to $100 \n     million in funds to defray the costs of environmental \n     mitigation. There is clear language stating that the intent \n     of the measure is to promote the MAXIMUM retention of \n     workers, regardless of the 80 percent cutoff.\n       The applicant will also be given access to the Steelworker \n     Retiree Health Care Trust Fund for new retirees created by \n     the merger, if the merger occurs prior to 2010.\n       Requirements for employment must be met for ten years to \n     avoid penalties. Penalties for violation of the grant \n     agreements will be weighted more heavily in the first five \n     years, then will gradually phase out during the following \n     five years.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, I join with the senior Senator from \nMinnesota and all my colleagues from steel states, in making every \neffort to revitalize this important and basic American industry.\n  There are thirty-four Senators representing twenty-four States in the \nSteel Caucus, and we all agree that without immediate relief from the \nflood of foreign steel, the future of the United States steel industry \nis in jeopardy. The provisions of the Steel Revitalization Act will \ngive our domestic steel industry the time it needs to recover from the \nimport surges of the past three years.\n\n[[Page S5635]]\n\n  This bill also acknowledges the highly integrated process of making \nsteel. It provides import relief for steel products that include iron \nore and semi-finished steel. Minnesota and Michigan are the two leading \nstates in the production of taconite. Taconite is essentially \npelletized iron ore that is melted in blast furnaces and then blown \nwith oxygen to make steel. Every ton of imported, semi-finished steel \ndisplaces 1.3 tons of iron ore in basic, domestic steel production. \nThis means reduced production, cutbacks, and plant closings, causing \ndevastating economic uncertainty in critical regions of these states.\n  This bill will provide much needed help to the hardworking people and \ntheir families who live in the Iron Range regions of Northeastern \nMinnesota and Northern Michigan. The bill also helps the steelworkers \nand the steel-making communities of West Virginia, Pennsylvania, \nIndiana, Ohio, to name only a few. In this crisis, we are all one \nfamily. We are people who believe that America's steel industry is a \nbasic industry, essential to the economic and national security of our \ncountry.\n  Yesterday, the Department of Labor informed 1,400 workers from the \nLTV Steel Mining Company in Hoyt Lakes, Minnesota that they are \neligible for trade adjustment assistance because of the increase in \nimported steel products. Last December, LTV declared bankruptcy, making \nthese workers permanently unemployed. Trade adjustment assistance will \nhelp with extended unemployment benefits, training and relocation. I \nknow that these workers are grateful for this assistance, but it is \nhelp that comes after LTV has closed its doors forever.\n  The bill we introduce today will give the industry time to \nrestructure and provide needed capital to companies through the Steel \nLoan Guarantee program, a program established through the efforts of \nthe distinguished Senator, Robert Byrd. The Steel Revitalization Act \nwill help retired steelworkers with a health care fund; and help \ncompanies with necessary consolidation while at the same time requiring \nthem to retain the majority of their workforce.\n  The United Steelworkers state: ``On a level playing field, there \nwould be no steel crisis, but there is no level playing field.'' The \nSteel Revitalization Act will help strengthen the steel industry and \nmake American steel competitive once again.\n  I promise the Minnesota taconite workers, their families, and the \ncommunities of the Iron Range, to work hard to pass this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 958. A bill to provide for the use and distribution of the funds \nawarded to the Western Shoshone identifiable group under Indian Claims \nCommission Docket Numbers 326-A-1, 326-A-3, 326-K, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today for myself and for Senator \nEnsign, to introduce the Western Shoshone Claims Distribution Act. I am \nre-introducing this much needed bill for the Western Shoshone Tribe \nfrom the second session of the 106th Congress. It had been referred to \nthe Indian Affairs Committee, but there was not enough time at the end \nof the Congress to act on it.\n  In 1946, the Indian Claims Commission was established to compensate \nIndians for lands and resources taken from them by the United States. \nThe Commission determined in 1962 that Western Shoshone homeland had \nbeen taken through ``gradual encroachment.'' In 1977, the Commission \nawarded the Tribe in over $26 million dollars. However, it was not \nuntil 1979, that the United States appropriated the funds to reimburse \nthe descendants of these Tribes for their loss. Plans for claims \ndistribution were further delayed by litigation; and the Western \nShoshone concern that accepting the claims would impact their right to \nget back some of their traditional homelands.\n  The Western Shoshone are an impoverished people. There is relatively \nlittle economic activity on some of their scattered reservations. Those \nwho are employed, work for the tribal government, work in livestock and \nagriculture, or work in small businesses, such as day-cares and \nsouvenir shops. They live from pay check to pay check, with little or \nno money for heating their homes, much less for their children's \neducation. Many of the Western Shoshone continue to be \ndisproportionately affected by poverty and low educational achievement. \nMany individuals of the Western Shoshone are willing to accept the \ndistribution of the claim settlement funds to relieve these difficult \neconomic conditions. About $128.8 million (in principal and interest) \nwould be distributed to over 6,000 eligible members of the Western \nShoshone; $1.27 million (in principal and interest) would be placed in \nan educational trust fund for the benefit of and distribution to future \ngenerations of the Tribe.\n  The Western Shoshone have waited long enough for the distribution of \nthese much needed funds. The final distribution of this fund has \nlingered for more than twenty years, and the best interests of the \nTribe will not be served by a further delay in enacting this \nlegislation. My bill will provide payments to eligible Western Shoshone \ntribal members, and ensure that future generations will be able to \nenjoy the financial benefits of this settlement by establishing a grant \nprogram for education and other individual needs. The Western Shoshone \nSteering Committee, a coalition of Western Shoshone individual tribal \nmembers, has officially requested that Congress enact legislation to \naffect this distribution.\n  This Act also provides that acceptance of these funds is not a waiver \nof any existing treaty rights pursuant to the Ruby Valley Treaty. Nor \nwill acceptance of these funds prevent any Western Shoshone Tribe or \nBand or individual Western Shoshone Indian from pursuing other rights \nguaranteed by law.\n  Twenty-three years has been more than long enough.\n  Finally, I would like to highlight the fact that Senator Ensign of \nNevada joins me today to introduce this important bill. I know that \nSenator Ensign is concerned, as I, about the delay of the distribution \nof the claims to the Western Shoshone, and his support for this bill \nwill help ensure that the Tribe will receive their long-awaited \ncompensation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 958\n\n  [Data not available at time of printing.]\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BAUCUS:\n  S. 959. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to authorize \nthe Secretary of Transportation to consider the impact of severe \nweather conditions on Montana's aviation public and establish \nregulatory distinctions consistent with those applied to the State of \nAlaska; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Montana \nRural Aviation Improvement Act.\n  As many in this body know, flying in Montana can be an adventure. \nThere's an old saying in Montana that ``if you want the weather to \nchange, wait five minutes''.\n  Simply put, this act would provide the aviation public with an \naccurate report of Montana's weather conditions at airports across the \nstate.\n  This year the Federal Aviation Administration eliminated the use of \non-site certified weather observers at Service Level D Airports in \nMontana. These Level D Airports are an important part of Montana's \ntransportation infrastructure and economy. Without accurate \ninformation, both commercial and private planes may not be able to land \nat these airports because of inaccurate readings from the Automated \nSurface Observing System, ASOS.\n  In August 2000 I directed a member of my staff to spend a day at the \nMiles City weather observation station, where the Automated Surface \nObserving Systems system was being tested.\n  I am now even more convinced that the commission of the Automated \nSurface Observing Systems as a stand-alone weather observation service \nis a grave mistake.\n  Many of the following conditions are characteristic of Montana's \ncomplicated weather patterns and can't be\n\n[[Page S5636]]\n\naccurately read by the Automated Surface Observing System.\n  The Automated Surface Observing System User's Guide, dated March \n1998, states that the following weather elements cannot be sensed or \nreported by Automated Surface Observing System; hail; ice crystals \n(snow grains, ice pellets, snow pellets); drizzle, freezing drizzle; \nvolcanic ash; blowing obstruction sand, dust, spray; smoke; snow fall \nand snow depth; hourly snow increase; liquid equivalent of frozen \nprecipitation; water equivalent of snow on the ground; clouds above \n12,000 feet; operationally significant clouds above 12,000 feet in \nmountainous areas; virga; distant precipitation in mountainous and \nareas and distant clouds obscuring mountains; and operationally \nsignificant local variations in visibility.\n  Five of the seven airports affected provide commercial airline \nservice through the Essential Air Service, EAS, program--a program that \nis indispensable to the transportation and economy of Eastern Montana. \nWith Automated Surface Observing System on stand-alone, Montana's EAS \ncommercial carrier has expressed real reservations to landing at \nairports where data may or may not be current or correct, and \nespecially in circumstances where Automated Surface Observing System \ndoes not yet read inclement or severe weather conditions common to \nMontana. As you know, airline service is dependent on one thing--\npassengers. If they cannot land, who would pay to fly?\n  This past summer I hosted the Montana Economic Summit, a statewide \nconference that brought together a strong public- private partnership \nto examine the evidence, chart a course and focus on those elements we \ncan execute to help move this state forward. Transportation is a strong \ncomponent of this state's economy. If commercial air service is \nimpacted, it will have a dire and immediate impact on my state's \neconomy, currently ranked at 49th in per capita income and struggling \nto climb out of the basement.\n  I would like to add an accountability log compiled by the Miles City \nweather observers that identifies errors Automated Surface Observing \nSystem in data collected and reported by the Automated Surface \nObserving System at the Miles City Airport from April-July 2000. My \nstaff observed the hourly accounting throughout the day, particularly \nnoting the frustration by weather observers to input, correct and \ntransmit data via the keyboard and terminal. It is extremely important \nto note that Montana's weather observers see the Automated Surface \nObserving System as a compatible tool to complement their professional \ntraining and provide the safest environment for Montana aviation.\n  Maintenance and operational backup are of additional concern in \nMontana's rural landscape. It goes without saying that in instances of \nsevere weather, when the Automated Surface Observing System should go \ndown without backup, it effectively closes the airport to any traffic, \ncommercial or private, that cannot or will not land without the \ntechnological benefit of reliable weather data. This process could \nclearly impact the safety of Montana's flying public.\n  It cannot be overemphasized that in many smaller airports, \nspecifically Service Level C sites, these observers are critical to \nthe overall operation and safety of community airspace. I know you \nwould have felt the same pride and support for the human weather \nobserver positions that I do. We are one team, working for the same \ngoal.\n  The best available tools should be used to provide the most accurate \ndata in situations involving public safety. The human weather observers \nassure me that Automated Surface Observing System as a tool, combined \nwith their individual ability to override, correct or supplement \nweather data gathered by the sensors, will provide the American public \nwith the highest quality safety and weather reporting capability in the \nworld.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 959\n\n  [Data not available at time of printing.]\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Craig, Mr. Cochran, Ms. \n        Collins, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dorgan, Mr. Ensign, Mrs. Murray, Ms. \n        Stabenow, and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 960. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nexpand coverage of medical nutrition therapy services under the \nMedicare program for beneficiaries with cardiovascular diseases; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce bipartisan \nlegislation with my good friend and colleague from Idaho, Senator Craig \nand a bipartisan group of additional Senators. This legislation, \nentitled the ``Medicare Medical Nutrition Therapy Amendment Act of \n2001,'' provides for the coverage of nutrition therapy for \ncardiovascular disease under Part B of the Medicare program by a \nregistered dietitian.\n  This bill builds on provisions in the ``Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP \nBenefits Improvement and Protection Act,'' otherwise known as BIPA, \nwhich included coverage of Medicare nutrition therapy for diabetes and \nrenal disease taken from my legislation last year, S. 660, the \n``Medicare Medical Nutrition Therapy Act of 1999.''\n  This bipartisan legislation is necessary because there is currently \nno consistent Medicare Part B coverage policy for medical nutrition \ntherapy, despite the fact that poor nutrition is a major problem in \nolder Americans. Nutrition therapy in the ambulatory or outpatient \nsettings has been considered by Medicare to be a preventive service, \nand therefore, not explicitly covered.\n  While it was significant that nutrition therapy coverage was added to \nPart B of the Medicare program for diabetes and renal disease, it is \ncritical that the Congress also takes action to cover cardiovascular \ndisease through passage of this legislation, as recommended by the \nInstitute of Medicine in its report, The Role of Nutrition in \nMaintaining Health in the Nation's Elderly: Evaluating Coverage of \nNutrition Services for the Medicare Population.\n  The report, which had been requested by Congress in the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997, found that nutrition therapy has been shown to be \neffective in the management and treatment of many chronic conditions \nwhich affect Medicare beneficiaries, including diabetes and chronic \nrenal insufficiency, but also cardiovascular disease. As the IOM notes, \n``Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death and major \ncontributors to medical utilization and disability . . . Furthermore, \nthere is a striking age-related rise in mortality from heart disease \nsuch that the vast majority of deaths due to heart disease occur in \npersons age 65 and older.''\n  In addition, the costs associated with cardiovascular disease are \nsubstantial with regard to the Medicare program. According to the IOM, \n``. . . in 1995, Medicare spent $24.6 billion for hospital expenses \nrelated to [cardiovascular diseases], an amount that corresponds to 33 \npercent of its hospitalization expenditures.''\n  Providing nutrition therapy to Medicare beneficiaries could \npositively impact the Medicare Part A Trust Fund if hospitalization \ncould be reduced or avoided. The IOM found this would likely occur. As \nthe report notes, ``Such programs can prevent readmissions for heart \nfailure, reduce subsequent length of stay, and improve functional \nstatus and quality-of-life . . . In view of the high costs of managing \nheart failure, particular admissions for heart failure exacerbations, \nand the rapid response to therapies, there is a real potential for cost \nsavings from multidisciplinary heart failure programs that include \nnutrition therapy.''\n  It is exactly the type of cost effective care that we should \nencourage in the Medicare program. As the American Heart Association \nadds in their letter of support for this legislation, Dr. Robert Eckel \npoints out that, in one study, ``for every dollar spent on [Medicare \nnutrition therapy] there is a three to ten dollar cost savings realized \nby reducing the need for drug therapy.'' With drug costs increasing \ndramatically, this could potentially result in significant cost savings \nto Medicare beneficiaries.\n  Therefore, both the Medicare program and beneficiaries would benefit\n\n[[Page S5637]]\n\nfrom this expanded benefit. As the IOM concludes, ``Expanded coverage \nfor nutrition therapy is likely to generate economically significant \nbenefits to beneficiaries, and in the short term to the Medicare \nprogram itself, through reduced healthcare expenditures. . . .''\n  Most importantly, it would also improve the quality of care of \nMedicare beneficiaries. As the IOM report adds, ``Whether or not \nexpanded coverage reduces overall Medicare expenditures, it is \nrecommended that these services be reimbursed given the reasonable \nevidence of improved patient outcomes associated with such care.''\n  For these reasons, I am pleased to be introducing the ``Medicare \nMedical Nutrition Therapy Amendment Act of 2001'' today with Senator \nCraig.\n  However, as this legislation is introduced, I do want to note that \nthe IOM also recommended nutrition therapy be covered based on \nphysician referral rather than a specific medical condition. The \noriginal legislation introduced in the last Congress by Senator Craig \nand myself did just that but was made disease-specific in conference \nlast year. While I am pleased to introduce this legislation to include \ncardiovascular disease, I do believe that we need to move toward \neliminating this disease-specific approach in the near future. For \nexample, I believe that Medicare should also provide Medicare nutrition \ntherapy for HIV/AIDS, cancer, and osteoporosis, among other things.\n  In the meantime, I urge the Congress to expand Medicare nutrition \ntherapy benefits to cover cardiovascular diseases as soon as possible.\n  I request unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 960\n\n  [Data not available at time of printing.]\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON:\n  S. 962.

Con. Res. 43\n\n  [Data not available at time of printing.]\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today, as co-chairman of the Senate Auto \nCaucus, I am submitting with my colleague and Auto Caucus co-chairman, \nSenator Voinovich, a Concurrent Resolution urging Korea to remove its \nautomotive trade barriers to U.S. automotive exports.\n  Our resolutions urges the Republic of Korea to immediately end \npractices that have restricted market access for U.S. made automobiles \nand auto parts and meet the letter and spirit of the commitments it \nmade in the 1998 Memorandum of Understanding in Automotive Trade. An \nidentical Resolution is being submitted in the House by the co-chairmen \nof the House Auto Caucus. I call on both chambers to act swiftly to \npass this important measure and send a strong signal to the Government \nof Korea that it's time to remove these trade barriers.\n  The Senate and House Auto Caucuses have worked hard to bring \nattention to the rapidly increasing automotive trade deficit between \nthe United States and South Korea. We have urged our Government to make \nit a priority to remove barriers to competitive U.S. automotive exports \nto Korea. It is a matter of simple fairness and American jobs.\n  When it comes to automotive trade between the United States and \nKorea, the numbers speak for themselves. Korea has the most closed \nmarket for imported motor vehicles in the developed world with foreign \nvehicles making up less than one half of one percent of its total \nvehicle market. At the same time, Korea is dependent on open markets to \nabsorb its automotive exports and has become one of the world's major \nauto exporting countries. The relationship is so blatantly unfair that \nKorea cannot deny their market is closed. Last year, Korea imported \nonly 1,000 vehicles from the United States and exported nearly 500,000 \nto the United States.\n  This grossly unfair automotive trade relationship is due to the \ncontinuation in Korea of discriminatory practices such as labeling \nforeign vehicles as ``luxury goods''; ignoring harassment by the media \nand others of foreign vehicles owners; and an automotive tax system \nwhich discriminates against imported vehicles, making them \nprohibitively expensive.\n  It's not fair and our message to Korea is that we don't accept it.\n  That is why we submit this Concurrent Resolution on the even of the \nnext round of trade negotiations between the United States and Korea \nwhich start in mid-June. The message we wish to send is clear and \nsimple: we expect to see some significant market opening concessions by \nthe Government of Korea in this round of negotiations and we expect to \nsee the result in the form of actual and significantly increased sales \nof U.S. vehicles and parts in Korea.\n  After five years of bilateral negotiations and two major trade \nagreements, imported automobiles are still locked out of Korea. This \nsituation is unacceptable to the United States Congress and to the \nAmerican people and it has to change. We expect and hope that the \nKorean Government will quadruple the effort that is required of them in \norder to ensure an open Korean market to U.S. automotive products. The \nnearly 2.5 million men and women working in the largest manufacturing \nand highest exporting industry in our country deserve nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/24/senate-section/article/S5637-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5637]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 790.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate\n\n[[Page S5639]]\n\nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 94, submitted earlier today by \nSenators Cleland, McCain, Levin, and others.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 94) expressing the sense of the \n     Senate to designate May 28, 2001, as a special day for \n     recognizing the members of the Armed Forces who have been \n     killed in hostile actions since the end of the Vietnam War.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, on next Monday, May 28, and acting \npursuant to a joint resolution approved by the Congress back in 1950, \nthe President of the United States will issue a proclamation calling \nupon the people of the United States to observe a day of prayer for \npermanent peace in remembrance of all of those brace Americans who have \ndied in our Nation's service. That is how Memorial Day got started and \nis what this special day is supposed to be all about.\n  Whenever Memorial Day comes around, I am reminded of what may well \nhave been the first, and is still one of the finest, memorials to \nfallen soldiers, the Funeral Oration of the great Athenian leader \nPericles, as recorded by the historian Thucydides, during the \nPeloponnesian War in the 5th Century BC.\n\n       For this offering of their lives made in common by them all \n     they each of them individually received that renown which \n     never grows old, and for a sepulcher, not so much that in \n     which their bones have been deposited, but that noblest of \n     shrines wherein their glory is laid up to be eternally \n     remembered upon every occasion on which deed or story shall \n     call for its commemoration. For heroes have the whole earth \n     for their tomb; and in lands far from their own, where the \n     column with its epitaph declares it, there is enshrined in \n     every breast a record unwritten with no tablet to preserve \n     it, except that of the heart.\n\n  In that spirit, today I have introduced a resolution calling upon all \nAmericans to especially dedicate Memorial Day of 2001 to those brave \nAmerican men and women who have given their lives in service to their \ncountry since the end of the war in Vietnam. No grand edifices or other \npublic monuments commemorate their deeds, but their service to their \ncountry was just as strong, their sacrifice just as great, their \nfamilies' and communities' loss just as keen as their predecessors in \nthe two World Wars of the 20th Century, Korea and Vietnam.\n  As the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Personnel \nSubcommittee, I have been heavily involved in trying to improve the \nquality of life for our servicemen and women through such steps as \nincreasing pay and enhancing health and education benefits. It is my \ndeeply held view that not only do we need to take such action to \naddress some disturbing trends in armed forces recruitment and \nretention, but we owe these individuals nothing less in recognition of \ntheir service. Indeed, tomorrow, I will be re-introducing my \nlegislation to update the Montgomery GI Bill, and to continue its \nrelevance for the married, family-oriented Armed Forces we have today \nby making its education benefits transferrable to the spouse or \nchildren of the service member.\n  The Senate has passed this measure twice, and with the continued \nleadership and support of Senators Warner and Levin, I am hopeful that \nthis will be the year we provide this valuable recruiting and retention \ntool.\n  As recent events have shown perhaps too clearly, Americans have still \nnot fully come to grips with the reality of warfare, especially the \nVietnam Conflict. Shortly after World War II--which of all wars in \nrecent history is most widely regarded as necessary and unavoidable--\nGeneral Dwight D. Eisenhower said, ``I hate war as only a soldier who \nhas lived it can, only as one who has seen its brutality, its futility, \nand its stupidity.''\n  Last year, to focus on the reality of war and on other questions \nrelated to the global role of the United States in the post-cold-war \nworld, I had the great honor of being joined by my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Roberts of Kansas, in conducting six dialogues on \nthe Senate floor on these and related questions. At the end, we came up \nwith seven general principles, three of which have particular relevance \nto this occasion:\n  First, the President and the Congress need to:\n  Find more and better ways to increase communications with the \nAmerican people on the realities of our international interests and the \ncosts of securing them;\n  Find more and better ways to increase the exchange of experiences and \nideas between the government and the military to avoid the broadening \nlack of military experience among the political elite; and\n  Find more and better ways of ensuring that both the executive and \nlegislative branches fulfill their constitutional responsibilities in \nnational security policy, especially concerning military operations \nother than declared wars.\n  Second, as the only global superpower, and in order to avoid \nstimulating the creation of a hostile coalition of other nations, the \nUnited States should, and can afford to, forego unilateralist actions, \nexcept where our vital interests are involved.\n  Finally, in the post-cold-war world, the United States should adopt a \npolicy of realistic restraint with respect to use of U.S. military \nforces in situations other than those involving the defense of vital \nnational interests. In all other situations, we must:\n  Insist on well-defined political objectives;\n  Determine whether non-military means will be effective, and if so, \ntry them prior to any recourse to military force;\n  Ascertain whether military means can achieve the political \nobjectives;\n  Determine whether the benefits outweigh the costs--political, \nfinancial, military--and that we are prepared to bear those costs;\n  Determine the ``last step'' we are prepared to take if necessary to \nachieve the objectives;\n  Insist that we have a clear, concise exit strategy, including \nsufficient consideration of the subsequent roles of the United States, \nregional parties, international organizations and other entities in \nsecuring the long-term success of the mission; and\n  Insist on congressional approval of all deployments other than those \ninvolving responses to emergency situations.\n  Since I came to the Senate, I have been deeply disturbed by the tenor \nof many of the debates which have occurred in the Congress and with \nboth the Clinton and Bush administrations on a host of important \nnational security issues. Last session, the Senate failed to ratify the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty after little meaningful debate and no \nSenate hearings. This was one of the most consequential treaties of the \ndecade, and it was sadly reduced to sound-bite politics and partisan \nrancor. In addition to the CTBT, the Senate has made monumental \ndecisions on our policies in the Balkans and the Persian Gulf, and the \nfuture of NATO and the United Nations, all without a comprehensive set \nfor American goals and policies.\n  And though it is too early to arrive at a firm judgment on this \npoint, and though there is no individual in the national security arena \nthat I have more confidence in or respect more than Secretary of State \nColin Powell, I am dismayed by the apparent surge of unilateralism, \nwithout meaningful consultation with Congress, displayed by the new \nadministration on subjects ranging from Korean security, to defense of \nTaiwan, to National Missile Defense, to the Kyoto Accords, to the OECD \nefforts to fight tax evasion, all once again occurring without clearly \narticulated goals and policies. In my opinion, we--all of us on both \nends Pennsylvania Avenue--have to do better. Simply put, I do not \nbelieve we can afford to continue on a path of partisanship and \ndivision of purpose without serious damage to our national interests.\n  I spoke earlier about some key quality of life concerns of today's \nmilitary, especially education and the GI bill. However, as important \nas these other factors are, the ultimate quality of life issue for our \nservicemen and women centers in policy decisions made by national \nsecurity decision-makers here in Washington relating to the deployment \nof our forces abroad. It is these deployments which separate families, \ndisrupt lives, and in those cases which involve hostilities, endanger \nthe service member's life itself. This is not to say that I believe our \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen\n\n[[Page S5640]]\n\nand marines are not fully prepared to do whatever we ask of them. Quite \nthe contrary, they most assuredly are, as my visits to the front lines \nin the Balkans and Korea have clearly demonstrated to me. But we on \nthis end owe them nothing less than a full and thorough consideration \neach and every time we put them into harm's way.\n  There are 13 military installations in Georgia, and I visit the \ntroops there whenever I can. When I go to these bases, I see weary and \nbeleaguered families who are doing their best to make it through the \nweeks and months without their husbands or wives. This is a heavy toll \nfor our military personnel. It is a price they are ready to pay, but \none I want the Senate to understand and appreciate as we continue in \nour commitment of troops abroad.\n  Under the Constitution, war powers are divided. Article I, section 8, \ngives Congress the power to declare war and raise and support the armed \nforces, while Article II, Section 2 declares the President to be \nCommander in Chief. With this division of authority there has also been \nconstant disagreement, not only between the executive and legislative \nbranches, but between individual Members of Congress as well, as we \nhave seen in our debates on authorizing the intervention in Kosovo and \non the Byrd-Warner amendment concerning funding of that operation. \nJudging by the text of the Constitution and the debate that went into \nits drafting, however, Members of Congress have a right, and I would \nsay an obligation, to play a key role in the making of war and in \ndetermination of the proper use of our armed forces.\n  It is generally agreed that the Commander in Chief role gives the \nPresident full authority to repel attacks against the United States and \nmakes him responsible for leading the armed forces. During the Korean \nand Vietnam conflicts, however, this country found itself involved for \nmany years in undeclared wars. Many Members of Congress became \nconcerned with the erosion of congressional authority to decide when \nthe United States should become involved in a war or in situations that \nmight lead to war. On November 7, 1973, the Congress passed the War \nPowers Resolution over the veto of President Nixon.\n  The War Powers Resolution has two key requirements. Section 4(a) \nrequires the President to submit a report to Congress within 48 hours \nwhenever troops are introduced into hostilities or situations where \nimminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the \ncircumstances. Section 5(b) then stipulates that if U.S. armed forces \nhave been sent into situations of actual or imminent hostilities the \nPresident must remove the troops within sixty days--ninety days if he \nrequests a delay--unless Congress declares war or otherwise authorizes \nthe use of force. The resolution also provides that Congress can compel \nthe President to withdraw the troops at any time by passing a joint \nresolution. It is important to note, however, that since the adoption \nof the War Powers Resolution, every President has taken the position \nthat it is an unconstitutional infringement by the Congress on the \nPresident's authority as Commander in Chief, and the courts have not \ndirectly addressed this vital question.\n  I would submit that although the Congress tried to reassert itself \nafter the Vietnam war with the enactment of the War Powers Resolution, \nwe have continued to be a timid, sometimes nonexistent player in the \ngovernment that Clausewitz emphasized must play a vital role in \ncreating the balance necessary for an effective war-making effort. \nSince I came to the Senate, it has been my observation that the current \nsystem by which the executive and legislative branches discharge their \nrespective constitutional duties in committing American service men and \nwomen into harm's way has become inadequate. Congress continually lacks \nsufficient and timely information as to policy objectives and means \nprior to the commitment of American forces. And then, in my opinion, \nCongress largely abdicates its responsibilities for declaring war and \ncontrolling the purse with inadequate and ill-timed consideration of \noperations.\n  Reasons for the failure of the War Powers Resolution and for our \ncurrent difficulties abound. I believe that part of our problem stems \nfrom the disputed and uncertain role of the War Powers Resolution of \n1973 in governing the conduct of the President, as well as the \nCongress, with respect to the introduction of American forces into \nhostile situations. Once again, these disputes continue to resound \nbetween both the branches and individual members of the legislative \nbranch.\n\n  In all honesty, however, the realities of our government highlight \nthe fact that while the legislature can urge, request, and demand that \nthe President consult with members of Congress on decisions to use \nforce, it cannot compel him to follow any of the advice that it might \ncare to offer. With that in mind, as an institution, Congress can do no \nmore than give or withhold its permission to use force. And while this \n``use it or lose it'' quality of congressional authorizations may make \nmany members leery about acting on a crisis too soon, delays will \nvirtually guarantee, as Senator Arthur Vandenberg once stated, that \ncrises will ``never reach Congress until they have developed to a point \nwhere congressional discretion is pathetically restricted.''\n  I believe that in view of our obligations to the national interest, \nto the Constitution and to the young American servicemen and women \nwhose very lives are at stake whether it be a ``contingency operation'' \nor a full-scale war, neither the executive or legislative branches \nshould be satisfied with the current situation which results in \nuncertain signals to the American people, to overseas friends and foes, \nand to our armed forces personnel. In making our decision to authorize \nmilitary action, Congress should work to elicit all advice and \ninformation from the President on down to the battlefield commanders, \nmake a sound decision based on this information, and then leave \nbattlefield management in the hands of those competent and qualified to \ncarry out such a task.\n  In response to such concerns, last year I introduced S. 2851, a bill \nwhich seeks to find a more workable system for Presidential and \ncongressional interaction on the commitment of American forces into \ncombat situations. Today, I am re-introducing this measure. It is a \nbill derived from the current system for Presidential approval and \nreporting to Congress on covert operations, a system which was \nestablished by Public Law 102-88 in 1991. By most accounts, this system \nhas been accepted by both branches and has worked very well with \nrespect to covert operations, producing both better decision-making in \nthe executive branch and improved congressional input and oversight \nwith respect to these operations. Since overt troop deployments into \nhostilities almost certainly constitute a greater risk to American \ninterests and to American lives, I believe such a system represents the \nvery least we should do to improve the approval and oversight process \nwith respect to overt military operations. It does not bind or limit \nthe executive branch or military, but offers greater reassurance to \nthose serving us in the Armed Forces that their service in harm's way \nwill have the full backing of not only the President, but the Congress \nand the American public as well.\n  Honoring our fallen heroes on Memorial Day is altogether fitting and \nproper, as President Lincoln said at Gettysburg. However, it is not \nsufficient. We must also honor them by our words and deeds while they \nstill wear their Nation's military uniforms.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list of all American service men and \nwomen killed in hostile action since the end of the Vietnam war be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5641]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24MY01.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S5642]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24MY01.002\n\n\n\n[[Page S5643]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24MY01.003\n\n\n\n[[Page S5644]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24MY01.004\n\n\n\n[[Page S5645]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24MY01.005\n\n\n\n[[Page S5646]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24MY01.006\n\n\n\n[[Page S5647]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24MY01.007\n\n\n\n[[Page S5648]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24MY01.008\n\n\n\n[[Page S5649]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24MY01.009\n\n\n\n[[Page S5650]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24MY01.010\n\n\n\n[[Page S5651]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24MY01.011\n\n\n\n[[Page S5652]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24MY01.012\n\n\n\n[[Page S5653]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24MY01.013\n\n\n\n[[Page S5654]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24MY01.014\n\n\n\n[[Page S5655]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24MY01.015\n\n\n\n[[Page S5656]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24MY01.016\n\n\n\n[[Page S5657]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS24MY01.017\n\n\n\n[[Page S5658]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.
