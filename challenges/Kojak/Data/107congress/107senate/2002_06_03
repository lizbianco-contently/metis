Mr. President, the Supplemental Appropriations Act for \nFurther Recovery From and Response To Terrorist Attacks on the United \nStates is now in the Senate, having come from the House. Senator Byrd \nand Senator Cochran, who will manage this bill today, will be here at 2 \no'clock to present their opening statements. We hope Senators who have \namendments will be in a position to offer those.\n  Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens, the two managers of the bill, have \nsuggested we have a cutoff time for the offering of amendments \ntomorrow. We will work toward that goal after conferring more with the \ntwo managers of the bill.\n  Concerning this very important legislation, we need to move to it, as \nwe will, and also move through it as quickly as we can.\n\n\n                 Local Law Enforcement Enhancement Act\n\n  This week sometime we will also be able to deliberate on S. 625, the \nLocal Law Enforcement Enhancement Act, which is commonly referred to as \nthe hate crimes bill. Senate consideration of this legislation is much \nneeded and really long overdue. It demonstrates once again, I believe, \nthe change that has taken place in this body since Senator Daschle took \nover as majority leader. We are moving this legislation for that fact \nalone. We would not be on this legislation but for the fact that \nSenator Daschle is the majority leader.\n  The present law does not respond to hate crimes motivated by a \nperson's gender, sexual orientation, or disability. In fact, one of \nthese characteristics, sexual orientation, is the third leading \nmotivation behind hate crimes.\n  By now everyone has heard of some of the most egregious cases of hate\n\n[[Page S4884]]\n\ncrimes, national in scope. Happening just a few years ago, the one we \nstill talk about is Matthew Shephard, a very small man in stature. He \nwas a student at the University of Wyoming. He was gay. He was severely \nbeaten and left for dead, simply because of his being gay.\n  James Byrd, Jr., an African-American man, was dragged to his death \nbehind a pickup truck in Texas. This man was walking home, simply \nwalking on the street, when these evil people grabbed him, beat him, \ntied him to the back of a pickup, and dragged him through the streets \nwhile he was still alive.\n  Unfortunately, these appalling tragedies were not isolated events. \nIncidents continue to be reported all over this country. Nevada is a \nsmall State population-wise--big in area--but even in the State of \nNevada we have witnessed acts of hatred. A 20-year-old man from Las \nVegas struck a Japanese-American girl in the head at a skinhead party. \nShe just happened to be there. Someone set a black family's home on \nfire in Carson City and wrote the words ``White Power'' and other \nracial slurs at the scene. Vandals spray-painted a swastika and other \ngraffiti on a Roman Catholic church in Henderson, NV. Three residents \nof Las Vegas burned a cross on the lawn of a black family's home. Two \nwhite men attacked two Muslim men with a baseball bat outside of a \nmosque in Sparks.\n  Condemning these acts is important, but it is not enough. We must act \nwith unbending resolve to legislate against them. These types of crimes \nnot only infringe on the victims' rights, they erode people's sense of \nsecurity and self-worth and confidence in our system.\n  This country was founded on the principle that there should be \nliberty and justice for all. When perpetrators of hate crimes target \nanyone, they are really targeting against all of us and the principles \nupon which our diverse Nation was founded. We need those principles to \ncontinue to prevail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/03/senate-section/article/S4884-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, in September of 1862, in a sun-drenched \ncornfield near the Mason-Dixon Line, a devastation called Antietam \nhappened. Twelve thousand young Americans on each side perished. \nAntietam is a name forever soaked in blood. It has come to symbolize \nthe tragic nature of a domestic conflict called the Civil War--or the \nWar Between the States.\n  Now this Nation is challenged once again by war on our own shores. \nAnother tragic loss of life on another sunny morning in the September \nof another century has recalled for us the special trauma of war on our \nhomeland. This time the violence on our own land has roots in a \ncultural clash of worldwide proportions. It is, at once, a war at home \nand a war abroad.\n  While we must fight on both fronts, these are conflicts of a very \ndifferent nature. The brave men and women who serve in our military \nvolunteer for that duty. They have the unquestioned support of the \nAmerican people and, through the American people, of their Government. \nThey fight aided by technology which is the envy of the world. Our \nmilitary personnel accept and understand the discipline imposed on them \nwhile they serve for the cause of freedom. The weapons of destruction \nwhich engage them are easily discernible and their lethal potential is \nwell understood.\n  The war on our own shores is much more complex. We know that \nterrorists live among us and that they traverse our open borders with \nrelative ease. We know the new enemy among us prefers weapons fashioned \nfrom the ordinary infrastructure of modern life--trucks, trains, \nplanes, mail delivery systems, ports, energy sources, cyberspace, spent \nnuclear material. All of these, we are told, can be easily adapted to \ncause death and destruction, fear and panic. At home, our technology is \ndeficient, with outdated computers in key government agencies unable to \neasily transmit vital information back and forth. In April and May, the \nAppropriations Committee heard testimony that indicate that our \nadversaries could cripple the U.S. economy without great difficulty or \nenormous cost. Yet we do not know much more. We do not know where this \nnew shadowy enemy will strike, or when.\n  Within the past few weeks, the concern seems to have grown. The Vice \nPresident has warned that a strike is ``almost certain.'' Secretary of \nDefense Donald Rumsfeld has stated that it is inevitable that \nterrorists will acquire weapons of mass destruction. Secretary of State \nColin Powell has warned that ``terrorists are trying every way they \ncan'' to get nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. Security has \nbeen tightened around New York City landmarks. The FBI has warned that \nsites, such as the Statue of Liberty and Brooklyn Bridge, might be \nattacked.\n  With all of these warnings in mind, and with a realization of the \nmany gaps in our homeland security network, the men and women of this \nCongress have an obligation to take immediate steps to protect American \nlives and to try to prevent future tragedies such as the one we \nwitnessed last September.\n  After several days of hearings by the Senate Appropriations Committee \non the urgent supplemental request for defense and homeland security, \nwhat emerges is a picture of a nation conflicted. While united in the \ngoal of fighting terrorism, we are conflicted about how to do so, how \nto go about it.\n  Finite resources must be stretched to fulfill the mission of a \nmilitary on a worldwide hunt for terrorists and a less defined, but \njust as urgent, need to protect our people here at home, which\n\n[[Page S4885]]\n\nmust be executed by layers of bureaucrats responding to hundreds, if \nnot thousands, of vulnerabilities.\n  When the North wrestled the South for the soul of this Nation in the \n19th century, America stood at a crossroads. Then, as now, transcendent \nand solid leadership was essential to our ultimate success.\n  In the 1860s, this Nation was blessed, as it often has been in its \nbrief history, with a gifted leader, able to quiet the squabbling \ngenerals and calm the bureaucratic struggles that threatened to consume \nhis single-minded effort to preserve the Nation and restore the peace. \nAbraham Lincoln was a giant. He saved the Nation.\n  But what we as leaders are now faced with may well be without \nparallel in U.S. history. I say that because the events surrounding \nSeptember 11 have underscored a revolutionary blurring of the lines \nbetween domestic danger and international danger for our people. We can \nno longer sit safely in our large and prosperous country, confident \nthat we need not fear foreign attack. True, our military might on the \nbattlefield is the envy of the world, but the enemy now lives and works \namong us.\n  He is here. He crosses our borders with relative ease. He boards our \nairplanes. He rides our trains and hides in our ships. No longer is the \nenemy only on a far away and distant foreign shore.\n  The question for all of the leaders of this Government is, Can we \nadapt? Can we restructure where we need to do so? Can we even fully \ncomprehend at this point the intertwining nature of the dual conflict \nin which we find ourselves? Can we sustain military action on so many \nfronts and not shortchange a defense of the homeland? Can we be steady \nenough to know that, even if public attention strays from the dangers \nhere at home, our attention must not stray from the dangers here at \nhome? In many cases, the answers come down to funding questions.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee is doing its part. Senator \nStevens and I are proud of our record on homeland defense. Last fall, \nwe approved $10 billion for homeland defense programs, $4 billion more \nthan had been requested by the President, and that $4 billion has made \na difference.\n  Over 2,200 more INS border agents and Customs inspectors are being \nhired on the northern and southern borders; the Immigration and \nNaturalization Service is now implementing a system for tracking \nforeign students in this country; our police, fire, and medical \npersonnel are getting better training, better equipment for detecting \nand responding to potential biological, chemical, or nuclear attacks; \nthe FBI is hiring hundreds of new agents; 750 more food inspectors and \ninvestigators are being hired; the number of ports with Food and Drug \nAdministration investigators is being doubled; 324 additional \nprotective personnel are being hired to protect our nuclear weapons \ncomplex. Additional resources are being spent on efforts to destroy or \nsecure nuclear materials overseas.\n  However, a great deal remains to be done. In recent weeks, the \nAppropriations Committee in the Senate held a series of hearings on \nhomeland defense. Senator Stevens and I joined in identifying and \ninviting the witnesses. We heard from terrorism experts about the \ncontinuing threat to our Nation. We heard from Governors. We heard from \nmayors. We heard from first responders--our police, fire, and medical \npersonnel. They all testified to a continuing need for resources to \nexpand our capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to terrorist \nattacks.\n  We also took testimony from seven Cabinet officers and the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency. Our former colleagues, Sam Nunn and Warren \nRudman, testified on the very real threat this Nation faces. The \ncompelling message from our witnesses was that we need to do more and \nthat we need to do more now. They also stressed the need for better \nFederal coordination and clearer standards for such efforts as securing \nour ports and making sure we have interoperable equipment that will \nallow our first responders to communicate with each other.\n  The legislation before the Senate today, which totals $31 billion, \nfully funds the President's $14 billion request for defense programs. \nIt provides over $8.3 billion for homeland defense programs. It \nprovides $5.5 billion to augment the Federal response to New York City \nin response to the events of September 11. It approves $1 billion for \nthe Pell grant shortfall. It includes $417 million for veterans' \nmedical care. In addition, the bill includes $1.1 billion of mandatory \nspending for the Veterans Compensation and Pension Program.\n  This bill contains $8.3 billion for critical homeland security \nefforts, efforts that we should not delay until the next fiscal year or \nthe next calendar year.\n  Within the homeland security package, more than $1 billion is \ndirected to first responder programs. These are the people at the local \nlevel. They are the people who would be first on the scene. This \nfunding will help to address those gaps that can endanger lives in case \nof an emergency.\n  For instance, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has received \ngrant requests from 18,000 fire departments across the country, \nrequests that total more than $3 billion. The Senate legislation would \nbegin to address this critical need for training and equipment. So we \nhave equipment funds providing $300 million for our firefighters.\n  Another $200 million is in the legislation to improve the ability for \nfirst responders to talk with each other. Currently, too many local \npolice and fire departments have radio systems that are incompatible. \nThey simply cannot talk with each other when responding to a crisis.\n  The Appropriations Committee has included funding for the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology to establish uniform standards \nfor interoperable equipment. We had several witnesses who testified to \nthe need for such.\n  Recently, the Brookings Institution released a report critiquing the \nadministration's homeland defense strategy. One of the report's \nauthors, Michael O'Hanlon, stated that the threat posed by terrorists \nusing cargo containers entering our seaports ``may be our single \ngreatest vulnerability that we have not yet made much progress towards \naddressing in this country.'' We heard from several witnesses to this \nneed.\n  To take steps to address this danger, the committee has provided $666 \nmillion for the Coast Guard for port and maritime security. This \nfunding would expedite vulnerability assessments at our Nation's ports. \nIt would expand the number of port strike teams trained to respond to \nbiological, chemical, and radiation incidents. It would create two new \nmaritime safety and security teams and purchase homeland security \nresponse boats, and it would expand surface and aviation assets, as \nwell as the shore facilities to support them.\n  Two hundred million dollars is included for port security grants. \nFifty seven million dollars is provided to the Customs Service to \nimprove cargo container inspections overseas, and $28 million is \nincluded to improve our technology on inspecting cargo containers.\n  We cannot ignore looming gaps in our homeland security efforts. These \ngaps were exposed during those hearings. The committee listened. The \ncommittee has acted. The committee is going to do something about the \nproblems that were brought to our attention by the witnesses who came \nbefore the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  That is why this legislation provides $387 million for bioterrorism, \nincluding funds to improve our toxicology and infectious disease lab \ncapacity at the Centers for Disease Control.\n  Our committee, the Senate Appropriations Committee, is responding to \nthe needs of the country as expressed by the men and women who appeared \nrecently before the Senate Appropriations Committee in those very \nimportant hearings. Congress has approved a $3 billion bioterrorism \nresponse authorization bill. This funding will move us toward meeting \nthat bill's goal.\n  The supplemental bill provides $200 million for security at our \nnuclear weapons facilities and nuclear labs. The bill provides $154 \nmillion for cyber-security with a special emphasis on helping the \nprivate sector defend itself from attack.\n  No witness before that committee was more impressive than the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah, Bob Bennett, who testified as to the \nneed for the private sector to be prepared against attack. He \nemphasized the dangers that confront the Nation. So the committee has \nresponded by, as I say, appropriating $154 million for cyber-security.\n\n[[Page S4886]]\n\n  Then there is in the bill $125 million for border security, including \nresources for Immigration and Naturalization Service facilities on the \nborders of the Nation, and for deploying the system for rapid response \ncriminal background checks to 30 more ports.\n  The bill provides $100 million for nuclear nonproliferation programs. \nThe bill provides $265 million for airport security, including $100 \nmillion to help airports meet the new Federal standards for airport \nsecurity.\n  The bill before the Senate provides $200 million to the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture for food safety labs, additional food \ninspectors, and for vulnerability assessments for rural water systems.\n  The bill before the Senate provides $100 million for the EPA to \ncomplete vulnerability assessments on the security of our water \nsystems.\n  The bill before the Senate today provides $286 million for other \nhomeland defense items such as Secret Service efforts to combat \nelectronic crime, FBI counterterrorism efforts, and funds for the \nJustice Department to develop an integrated information system.\n  The bill fully funds the President's $4.4 billion request for the new \ntransportation security administration.\n  The bill includes $1.95 billion for international programs. We have \nincluded $200 million for Israel and $50 million for disaster \nassistance for the Palestinians.\n  The legislation contains $1.069 billion for nonemergency programs, \nwith offsets to pay for them. The major items include $450 million for \nelection reform grants, $100 million for the global AIDS trust fund, \nand $75 million for WIC. The bill also provides $110 million for flood \nrelief and $55 million for Amtrak repairs and security.\n\n  I could go on, but Senators and the American people already know we \nare vulnerable, and in many instances they know where we are \nvulnerable: Anthrax, smallpox, dirty bombs, border security, nuclear \nlabs, powerplants, cyber-security, food safety, airport security, \ndrinking water.\n  So we do understand the gaps in our security structures. If we know \nwhere those gaps are, we can be sure terrorists know where they are.\n  Many decisions, large and small, lie ahead. One thing is certain: We \ncannot afford delay. So I urge Senators to offer amendments, debate, \nvote, and help members of the Appropriations Committee expedite this \nmuch-needed assistance for our Nation.

Two years ago she began the Pet \nTherapy Program. The program involves disabled young adults taking dogs \nto nursing homes to visit with senior citizens. As the creator of the \nprogram, Jude has created a means by which these young adults can give \nback to their community. The program brings immense value to all \nparties involved as they benefit from the time they spend with one \nanother.\n  Jude's hard work is a tribute to her profession. Her ability, \ndedication, and desire to serve all members of the community is \ncommendable.

The WOKQ morning show has received two nominations \nin as many years from the Country Music Association in the small market \ncategory for best on air personalities. The award winning WOKQ is heard \ndaily in New Hampshire, Maine, Massachusetts, Vermont and Canada. \nMike's witty humor and sense for broadcasting lead him to the creation \nof the wildly famous ``Joke du Jour.''

Mr. President, today I pay a very \ndeserved tribute to Veteran James Costa for his service in the U.S. \nArmy. The courage and bravery shown in the face of battle exemplify the \nspirit of a true American hero.\n  James Costa entered the service in July of 1943 and fought in the \nAsiatic Pacific Theater where he was wounded in the line of duty by \nJapanese rifle fire while sweeping caves. His heroic service was \nconcluded in January of 1946 at the conclusion of the war. The freedom \nCosta gave while defending his country is commendable and worthy of \npraise. It is doubtless that the sacrifices he made changed the outcome \nof the war and the future of the world.\n  Veteran Costa received many awards while serving in the Armed Forces \nincluding a Combat Infantry Badge, Purple Heart, Bronze Star, American \nDefense, American Campaign, Asiatic Pacific Campaign, World War II \nVictory Medal, Sharpshooter Badge with Rifle, and Good Conduct to name \njust a few. Although many years removed from service, Costa still \nremains active in the support of his fellow comrades as seen by his \nlife membership in the Disabled American Veterans, Veterans of Foreign \nWars, and past Commander of Post 31 Penacook American Legion.\n  I commend Veteran James Costa on his selfless service in the United \nStates Army and on his bravery during a Japanese attack in which he was \nwounded.

Mr. President, I rise to recognize Lieutenant \nColonel Elizabeth A. Judge, U.S. Marine Corps, on her upcoming \nretirement from active duty. Upon her retirement on August 31, 2002, \nLieutenant Colonel Judge will have served our great Nation and the \nMarine Corps for more than 20 years.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Judge is a career public affairs officer, and is \nknown as the preeminent expert within her field. She has been assigned \nto various locations, bases, and stations in the United States and \noverseas, to include an extended tour as the 31st Commandant's personal \npublic affairs officer. Most recently, she served as the deputy \ndirector of public affairs for the entire Marine Corps, a position \nnormally filled by a full-bird colonel. Lieutenant Colonel Judge's \nstraightforward, no-nonsense approach and uncanny media instincts are \nrenowned throughout the Headquarters Marine Corps Staff, and the \nDepartment of Defense public affairs office. There is no doubt that her \nefforts over the years have been instrumental in helping the news media \nand the public to better understand the Marine Corps' roles and \nmissions. Although she would be too humble to make this claim, \nLieutenant Colonel Judge should justifiably receive a degree of credit \nfor the positive image the Corps enjoys today.\n  The Marine Corps will sorely miss Lieutenant Colonel Judge's \nunrivaled professional knowledge and superior work ethic. Her steadfast \ndedication to Corps and country is uncompromising and impressive, and \nher unique talents will not be easily replaced.\n  I wish Betsy and her husband, Marine Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Judge, \nall the best as they embark on a new life chapter.

SUGAR POLICY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the tariff-rate quotas imposed on imports of sugar, \n     syrups and sugar-containing products under chapters 17, 18, \n     19, and 21 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United \n     States are an essential element of United States sugar \n     policy;\n       (2) circumvention of the tariff-rate quotas will, if \n     unchecked, make it impossible to achieve the objectives of \n     United States sugar policy;\n       (3) the tariff-rate quotas have been circumvented \n     frequently, defeating the purposes of United States sugar \n     policy and causing disruption to the United States market for \n     sweeteners, injury to domestic growers, refiners, and \n     processors of sugar, and adversely affecting legitimate \n     exporters of sugar to the United States;\n       (4) it is essential to United States sugar policy that the \n     tariff-rate quotas be enforced and that deceptive practices \n     be prevented, including the importation of products with no \n     commercial use and failure to disclose all relevant \n     information to the United States Customs Service; and\n       (5) unless action is taken to prevent circumvention, \n     circumvention of the tariff-rate quotas will continue and \n     will ultimately destroy United States sugar policy.\n       (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States to \n     maintain the integrity of the tariff-rate quotas on sugars, \n     syrups, and sugar-containing products by stopping \n     circumvention as soon as it becomes apparent.

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the \n     ``Bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority Act of 2002''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The expansion of international trade is vital to the \n     national security of the United States. Trade is critical to \n     the economic growth and strength of the United States and to \n     its leadership in the world. Stable trading relationships \n     promote security and prosperity. Trade agreements today serve \n     the same purposes that security pacts played during the Cold \n     War, binding nations together through a series of mutual \n     rights and obligations. Leadership by the United States in \n     international trade fosters open markets, democracy, and \n     peace throughout the world.\n       (2) The national security of the United States depends on \n     its economic security, which in turn is founded upon a \n     vibrant and growing industrial base. Trade expansion has been \n     the engine of economic growth. Trade agreements maximize \n     opportunities for the critical sectors and building blocks of \n     the economy of the United States, such as information \n     technology, telecommunications and other leading \n     technologies, basic industries, capital equipment, medical \n     equipment, services, agriculture, environmental technology, \n     and intellectual property. Trade will create new \n     opportunities for the United States and preserve the \n     unparalleled strength of the United States in economic, \n     political, and military affairs. The United States, secured \n     by expanding trade and economic opportunities, will meet the \n     challenges of the twenty-first century.\n       (3) Support for continued trade expansion requires that \n     dispute settlement procedures under international trade \n     agreements not add to or diminish the rights and obligations \n     provided in such agreements. Nevertheless, in several cases, \n     dispute settlement panels and the WTO Appellate Body have \n     added to obligations and diminished rights of the United \n     States under WTO Agreements. In particular, dispute \n     settlement panels and the Appellate Body have--\n\n[[Page S4915]]\n\n       (A) given insufficient deference to the expertise and fact-\n     finding of the Department of Commerce and the United States \n     International Trade Commission;\n       (B) imposed an obligation concerning the causal \n     relationship between increased imports into the United States \n     and serious injury to domestic industry necessary to support \n     a safeguard measure that is different from the obligation set \n     forth in the applicable WTO Agreements;\n       (C) imposed an obligation concerning the exclusion from \n     safeguards measures of products imported from countries party \n     to a free trade agreement that is different from the \n     obligation set forth in the applicable WTO Agreements;\n       (D) imposed obligations on the Department of Commerce with \n     respect to the use of facts available in antidumping \n     investigations that are different from the obligations set \n     forth in the applicable WTO Agreements; and\n       (E) accorded insufficient deference to the Department of \n     Commerce's methodology for adjusting countervailing duties \n     following the privatization of a subsidized foreign producer.\n\n     SEC. 2102. TRADE NEGOTIATING OBJECTIVES.\n\n       (a) Overall Trade Negotiating Objectives.--The overall \n     trade negotiating objectives of the United States for \n     agreements subject to the provisions of section 2103 are--\n       (1) to obtain more open, equitable, and reciprocal market \n     access;\n       (2) to obtain the reduction or elimination of barriers and \n     distortions that are directly related to trade and that \n     decrease market opportunities for United States exports or \n     otherwise distort United States trade;\n       (3) to further strengthen the system of international \n     trading disciplines and procedures, including dispute \n     settlement;\n       (4) to foster economic growth, raise living standards, and \n     promote full employment in the United States and to enhance \n     the global economy;\n       (5) to ensure that trade and environmental policies are \n     mutually supportive and to seek to protect and preserve the \n     environment and enhance the international means of doing so, \n     while optimizing the use of the world's resources;\n       (6) to promote respect for worker rights and the rights of \n     children consistent with core labor standards of the \n     International Labor Organization (as defined in section \n     2113(2)) and an understanding of the relationship between \n     trade and worker rights;\n       (7) to seek provisions in trade agreements under which \n     parties to those agreements strive to ensure that they do not \n     weaken or reduce the protections afforded in domestic \n     environmental and labor laws as an encouragement fortrade; \n     and\n       (8) to ensure that trade agreements afford small businesses \n     equal access to international markets, equitable trade \n     benefits, expanded export market opportunities, and provide \n     for the reduction or elimination of trade barriers that \n     disproportionately impact small business.\n       (b) Principal Trade Negotiating Objectives.--\n       (1) Trade barriers and distortions.--The principal \n     negotiating objectives of the United States regarding trade \n     barriers and other trade distortions are--\n       (A) to expand competitive market opportunities for United \n     States exports including motor vehicles and vehicle parts and \n     to obtain fairer and more open conditions of trade by \n     reducing or eliminating tariff and nontariff barriers and \n     policies and practices of foreign governments directly \n     related to trade that decrease market opportunities for \n     United States exports or otherwise distort United States \n     trade; and\n       (B) to obtain reciprocal tariff and nontariff barrier \n     elimination agreements, with particular attention to those \n     tariff categories covered in section 111(b) of the Uruguay \n     Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3521(b)).\n       (2) Trade in services.--The principal negotiating objective \n     of the United States regarding trade in services is to reduce \n     or eliminate barriers to international trade in services, \n     including regulatory and other barriers that deny national \n     treatment and market access or unreasonably restrict the \n     establishment or operations of service suppliers.\n       (3) Foreign investment.--Recognizing that United States law \n     on the whole provides a high level of protection for \n     investment, consistent with or greater than the level \n     required by international law, the principal negotiating \n     objectives of the United States regarding foreign investment \n     are to reduce or eliminate artificial or trade-distorting \n     barriers to trade-related foreign investment, while ensuring \n     that foreign investors in the United States are not accorded \n     greater rights than United States investors in the United \n     States, and to secure for investors important rights \n     comparable to those that would be available under United \n     States legal principles and practice, by--\n       (A) reducing or eliminating exceptions to the principle of \n     national treatment;\n       (B) freeing the transfer of funds relating to investments;\n       (C) reducing or eliminating performance requirements, \n     forced technology transfers, and other unreasonable barriers \n     to the establishment and operation of investments;\n       (D) seeking to establish standards for expropriation and \n     compensation for expropriation, consistent with United States \n     legal principles and practice;\n       (E) seeking to establish standards for fair and equitable \n     treatment consistent with United States legal principles and \n     practice, including the principle of due process;\n       (F) providing meaningful procedures for resolving \n     investment disputes;\n       (G) seeking to improve mechanisms used to resolve disputes \n     between an investor and a government through--\n       (i) mechanisms to eliminate frivolous claims and to deter \n     the filing of frivolous claims;\n       (ii) procedures to ensure the efficient selection of \n     arbitrators and the expeditious disposition of claims;\n       (iii) procedures to enhance opportunities for public input \n     into the formulation of government positions; and\n       (iv) establishment of a single appellate body to review \n     decisions in investor-to-government disputes and thereby \n     provide coherence to the interpretations of investment \n     provisions in trade agreements; and\n       (H) ensuring the fullest measure of transparency in the \n     dispute settlement mechanism, to the extent consistent with \n     the need to protect information that is classified or \n     business confidential, by--\n       (i) ensuring that all requests for dispute settlement are \n     promptly made public;\n       (ii) ensuring that--\n\n       (I) all proceedings, submissions, findings, and decisions \n     are promptly made public;\n       (II) all hearings are open to the public; and\n\n       (iii) establishing a mechanism for acceptance of amicus \n     curiae submissions from businesses, unions, and \n     nongovernmental organizations.\n       (4) Intellectual property.--The principal negotiating \n     objectives of the United States regarding trade-related \n     intellectual property are--\n       (A) to further promote adequate and effective protection of \n     intellectual property rights, including through--\n       (i)(I) ensuring accelerated and full implementation of the \n     Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property \n     Rights referred to in section 101(d)(1 5) of the Uruguay \n     Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3511(d)(15)), particularly \n     with respect to meeting enforcement obligations under that \n     agreement; and\n       (II) ensuring that the provisions of any multilateral or \n     bilateral trade agreement governing intellectual property \n     rights that is entered into by the United States reflect a \n     standard of protection similar to that found in United States \n     law;\n       (ii) providing strong protection for new and emerging \n     technologies and new methods of transmitting and distributing \n     products embodying intellectual property;\n       (iii) preventing or eliminating discrimination with respect \n     to matters affecting the availability, acquisition, scope, \n     maintenance, use, and enforcement of intellectual property \n     rights;\n       (iv) ensuring that standards of protection and enforcement \n     keep pace with technological developments, and in particular \n     ensuring that rightholders have the legal and technological \n     means to control the use of their works through the Internet \n     and other global communication media, and to prevent the \n     unauthorized use of their works; and\n       (v) providing strong enforcement of intellectual property \n     rights, including through accessible, expeditious, and \n     effective civil, administrative, and criminal enforcement \n     mechanisms;\n       (B) to secure fair, equitable, and nondiscriminatory market \n     access opportunities for United States persons that rely upon \n     intellectual property protection;

and\n       (B) to ensure that such standards do not place United \n     States persons at a competitive disadvantage in international \n     trade.\n       (7) Improvement of the wto and multilateral trade \n     agreements.--The principal negotiating objectives of the \n     United States regarding the improvement of the World Trade \n     Organization, the Uruguay Round Agreements, and other \n     multilateral and bilateral trade agreements are--\n       (A) to achieve full implementation and extend the coverage \n     of the World Trade Organization and such agreements to \n     products, sectors, and conditions of trade not adequately \n     covered;

SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This title may be cited as the ``Andean \n     Trade Preference Expansion Act''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since the Andean Trade Preference Act was enacted in \n     1991, it has had a positive impact on United States trade \n     with Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru. Two-way trade has \n     doubled, with the United States serving as the leading source \n     of imports and leading export market for each of the Andean \n     beneficiary countries. This has resulted in increased jobs \n     and expanded export opportunities in both the United States \n     and the Andean region.\n       (2) The Andean Trade Preference Act has been a key element \n     in the United States counternarcotics strategy in the Andean \n     region, promoting export diversification and broad-based \n     economic development that provides sustainable economic \n     alternatives to drug-crop production, strengthening the \n     legitimate economies of Andean countries and creating viable \n     alternatives to illicit trade in coca.\n       (3) Notwithstanding the success of the Andean Trade \n     Preference Act, the Andean region remains threatened by \n     political and economic instability and fragility, vulnerable \n     to the consequences of the drug war and fierce global \n     competition for its legitimate trade.\n       (4) The continuing instability in the Andean region poses a \n     threat to the security interests of the United States and the \n     world. This problem has been partially addressed through \n     foreign aid, such as Plan Colombia, enacted by Congress in \n     2000. However, foreign aid alone is not sufficient. \n     Enhancement of legitimate trade with the United States \n     provides an alternative means for reviving and stabilizing \n     the economies in the Andean region.\n       (5) The Andean Trade Preference Act constitutes a tangible \n     commitment by the United States to the promotion of \n     prosperity, stability, and democracy in the beneficiary \n     countries.\n       (6) Renewal and enhancement of the Andean Trade Preference \n     Act will bolster the confidence of domestic private \n     enterprise and foreign investors in the economic prospects of \n     the region, ensuring that legitimate private enterprise can \n     be the engine of economic development and political stability \n     in the region.\n       (7) Each of the Andean beneficiary countries is committed \n     to conclude negotiation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas \n     by the year 2005, as a means of enhancing the economic \n     security of the region.\n       (8) Temporarily enhancing trade benefits for Andean \n     beneficiaries countries will promote the growth of free \n     enterprise and economic opportunity in these countries and \n     serve the security interests of the United States, the \n     region, and the world.\n\n     SEC. 3102.

TRANSPARENCY IN NAFTA TRIBUNALS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Chapter Eleven of the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement (NAFTA) allows foreign investors to file claims \n     against signatory countries that directly or indirectly \n     nationalize or expropriate an investment, or take measures \n     ``tantamount to nationalization or expropriation'' of such an \n     investment.\n       (2) Foreign investors have filed several claims against the \n     United States, arguing that regulatory activity has been \n     ``tantamount to nationalization or expropriation''. Most \n     notably, a Canadian chemical company claimed $970,000,000 in \n     damages allegedly resulting from a California State \n     regulation banning the use of a gasoline additive produced by \n     that company.\n       (3) A claim under Chapter Eleven of the NAFTA is \n     adjudicated by a three-member panel, whose deliberations are \n     largely secret.\n       (4) While it may be necessary to protect the \n     confidentiality of business sensitive information, the \n     general lack of transparency of these proceedings has been \n     excessive.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this amendment is to ensure \n     that the proceedings of the NAFTA investor protection \n     tribunals are as transparent as possible, consistent with the \n     need to protect the confidentiality of business sensitive \n     information.\n       (c) Chapter 11 of NAFTA.--The President shall negotiate \n     with Canada and Mexico an amendment to Chapter Eleven of the \n     NAFTA to ensure the fullest transparency possible with \n     respect to the dispute settlement mechanism in that Chapter, \n     consistent with the need to protect information that is \n     classified or confidential, by--\n       (1) ensuring that all requests for dispute settlement under \n     Chapter Eleven are promptly made public;\n       (2) ensuring that with respect to Chapter Eleven--\n       (A) all proceedings, submissions, findings, and decisions \n     are promptly made public; and\n       (B) all hearings are open to the public; and\n       (3) establishing a mechanism under that Chapter for \n     acceptance of amicus curiae submissions from businesses, \n     unions, and nongovernmental organizations.\n       (d) Certification Requirements.--Within one year of the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the U.S. Trade Representative \n     shall certify to Congress that the President has fulfilled \n     the requirements set forth in subsection (c).\n\n     SEC. 4202.

Bush declared on November 21, 2001, \n     ``We fight the terrorists and we fight all of those who give \n     them aid. America has a message for the nations of the world: \n     If you harbor terrorists, you are terrorists. If you train or \n     arm a terrorist, you are a terrorist. If you feed a terrorist \n     or fund a terrorist, you are a terrorist, and you will be \n     held accountable by the United States and our friends.''.\n       (3) The United States has committed to provide resources to \n     states on the frontline in the war against terrorism.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--The Congress--\n       (1) stands in solidarity with Israel, a frontline state in \n     the war against terrorism, as it takes necessary steps to \n     provide security to its people by dismantling the terrorist \n     infrastructure in the Palestinian areas;\n       (2) remains committed to Israel's right to self-defense;\n       (3) will continue to assist Israel in strengthening its \n     homeland defenses;\n       (4) condemns Palestinian suicide bombings;\n       (5) demands that the Palestinian Authority fulfill its \n     commitment to dismantle the terrorist infrastructure in the \n     Palestinian areas;\n       (6) urges all Arab states, particularly the United States \n     allies, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, to declare their unqualified \n     opposition to all forms of terrorism, particularly suicide \n     bombing, and to act in concert with the United States to stop \n     the violence; and\n       (7) urges all parties in the region to pursue vigorously \n     efforts to establish a just, lasting, and comprehensive peace \n     in the Middle East.\n\n     SEC. 4203.
