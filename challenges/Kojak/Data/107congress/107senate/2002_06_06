Madam President, I understand there will be morning \nbusiness now until 10:30 and the time will be equally divided. Between \n10:30 and 11 a.m. we will have equally divided debate on the pending \nissue and the Stevens-Byrd cloture vote at 11 a.m.\n  I come to the floor to make sure that I have an opportunity to urge \nmy colleagues to vote for cloture. I am not happy with this \nlegislation. It is very unfortunate that it has been increased at every \nstep along the way beyond what the President asked for, at least $4 \nbillion more than what the President asked for, and the mix within the \nrest is clearly not what the President asked for in this emergency \nsupplemental for defense and homeland security. It is unfortunate that \nit has been brought to the floor in this way.\n  I remind my colleagues that postcloture, assuming cloture passes, \namendments to strike would still be in order. I am sure there will be a \nnumber to try to pare back the bill and to take out nonemergency, \nnondefense, and homeland security issues. I hope they succeed, because, \nclearly, the bill has gotten out of control.\n  This is nothing new. Every Congress does it. Every President makes \nthe mistake of asking for supplemental appropriations, and every \nCongress sees this as a vehicle on which we can enjoy a ride. We have \nall participated. I am not proud of that. But I say that to\n\n[[Page S5108]]\n\nmake the point this is not something new. They always tend to grow and \ngrow. I have taken occasion with every President of both parties to \nplead with them not to send a supplemental; just do what we need in the \nregular appropriations process. But they always do it. And quite often \nwe urge them to do it when there are, ostensibly, emergencies. Many of \nthem are very legitimate.\n  On the other side of this coin, this is supposedly an emergency. We \nshould have done it 2 months ago. The President should have asked for \nit earlier, the House should have acted earlier, and we should have \nfound a way to act early, although it is hard to be too critical of the \ntime in the Senate because we were not going to be able to move forward \non it until the House acted.\n  If it is an emergency, if it is payback for what we have spent in \ndefense, if it is to provide what we need on an emergency basis--\nhomeland security, Coast Guard, whatever--in terms of making sure our \ncountry is safe, we should have already done it. To drag this out into \nnext week would not be a positive thing.\n  I add that amendments that would be offered, if we don't get cloture, \nwill make worse a bill that has a lot of problems. Substantive \namendments would be offered that would cause problems. More spending \nwould be added. The better part of valor is to vote for cloture, \ncontinue to work to try to pare it down to a more reasonable number, \nget it in conference, and get it closer to what the President wants so \nwe can get our work done before the Fourth of July recess and get it to \nthe President so he can sign it.\n  We are not unanimous on our side of this issue. The proper leadership \nposition is to say, let's vote for cloture, go forward in the hours we \nhave after cloture to cut it back and then get it into conference.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides to vote for this cloture motion. \nPerhaps the cloture was filed too quickly. I understand, as majority \nleader, sometimes events or speeches prod you to do things that later \nmaybe you wish you had not done. The fact is the majority leader filed \nit, and we will vote on it. After watching events the last 2 days, I \nthink we should go ahead and support cloture.\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator from Mississippi, the Republican leader, \nleaves the floor, I express my appreciation for his leadership role in \nsuggesting and advocating that we invoke cloture.\n  This is the right thing to do for the country. There are things in \nthe bill I do not like. There are things in the bill the President does \nnot like. But that is what conferences are all about.\n  We will get this thing out of here. There are some motions to strike. \nI understand we have been talking about bringing those forward for \nseveral days now. Good, let's have them come forward. We will vote as \nto whether or not they are good or bad motions. Let's get the matter to \nconference as quickly as possible so we can help our troops and we can \nhelp homeland defense.\n  The Republican leader's advocacy is something that is good for the \ncountry, and I appreciate that very much.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the statement of the Senator \nfrom New Jersey not appear interrupted and he be given, minus the time \nhe has already taken, the full 30 minutes as the Republicans would be \ngiven, and then we will shorten the time.\n  I am reminded, of course, it is not the full 30 minutes but whatever \nhe was accorded, following the initial discussion, prior to his \nbeginning. The Democrats would have the same amount of time as \nRepublicans; we would just shorten the time before 11 o'clock for those \nfor and against the cloture motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this morning I would like to take a few \nmoments to talk about one of my favorite subjects: Social Security and \nthe privatization plans that have been developed by President Bush's \nSocial Security Commission.\n  As I have discussed in the past, I, like many Members, have serious \nconcerns about these privatization plans, primarily because they \ninvolve deep cuts in guaranteed benefits. Those cuts would exceed 25 \npercent for many current workers and would exceed 45 percent for \nseniors in the future. The cuts would apply even to those who choose \nnot to participate in these privatized accounts. In effect, they would \nforce many Americans to delay their retirement.\n  Over the past few weeks, I have engaged in an ongoing dialogue with \nprivatization supporters, including the Cato Institute and a few of the \nmembers of the Bush Commission. The Cato Institute criticized the \nnational radio address I gave on April 27 describing the privatization \nprogram the Bush Commission proposed. I then responded with a critique \nof their critique. And then, most recently, I received a letter from 6 \nof the 16 members of the President's Commission with a critique of my \ncritique of the Cato critique.\n  Unfortunately, their critique also is flawed, as I have outlined in a \nletter back to the six Commissioners, and as I want to discuss today.\n  The most fundamental disagreement I have with the six Commissioners \nconcerns the deep cuts in guaranteed benefits included in the \nCommission's report. The Commissioners state:\n\n       The Commission proposals do not ``cut benefits'' for \n     anyone.\n\n  I am troubled by this statement, which, at best, is highly \nmisleading. Essentially, the Commissioners are arguing that reductions \nin benefit levels, relative to those proposed under current law, should \nnot be considered cuts. That is just wrong on its face.\n  The Commissioners reach this conclusion by assuming that the assets \nin the Social Security trust fund will be deleted in the future and \nCongress will refuse to take the steps necessary to honor the promises \nmade to workers who now are paying into the system. They make this \nassumption even though they also assume that massive amounts of general \nrevenue will be available to subsidize privatized accounts.\n  In effect, the Commissioners are arguing that Congress, having used \nSocial Security funds for other purposes, now should be able to break \nits promise to retirees because there is not enough money in the trust \nfund.\n  To me, this is tantamount to a borrower telling a lender: I haven't \nsaved enough, and therefore I have a right to default on your loan. \nAnd, moreover, the reduction in my payments to you should not be \nconsidered a cut or a loss to your income.\n  I do not think that adds up. Surely the lender in such a situation \nwould experience the loss and view it as a real cut--just as seniors \nwould experience a reduction in their promised benefits as a cut.\n  In my view, it is a distortion of the English language to claim that \nchanging the law in order to reduce benefit levels, as the Commission \nhas proposed, should not be considered a cut. This claim is especially \nproblematic because the Commission's proposed cuts would be so deep for \nmany beneficiaries--exceeding 25 percent for many current workers, and \nexceeding 45 percent in the future. By the way, these numbers are \nconfirmed by the nonpartisan Social Security actuaries. The Commission \nshould be open and honest about this. The numbers are in the report.\n  It also is important to emphasize, as I noted earlier, that the \nbenefit cuts proposed by the Commission apply even to those who choose \nnot to participate in privatized accounts. This belies claims that the \nCommission's plan is based on voluntary choice. It's not. Even those \nwho do not choose to use privatized accounts will get cuts.\n  Supporters of privatization may believe that income from privatized \naccounts will offset the cuts in guaranteed benefits. That is the \nargument they make. However, this is problematic for at least two \nreasons.\n  First, the combination of reduced guaranteed benefits and income from \nprivate accounts in many cases would be less than the benefits under \ncurrent law, even under the assumptions used in the Commission's \nreport.\n  That is certainly one of the possibilities. And that is particularly \ntrue if one takes into account the administrative costs which are going \nto accompany these private accounts. In Great\n\n[[Page S5109]]\n\nBritain up to 40 percent of the returns in private accounts are used \njust to pay for administering the accounts. This takes away from income \nand really does undermine the ability to maintain the same levels of \nbenefits.\n  Second, relying on the whims of the market is inconsistent with the \nprincipal goal of Social Security--guaranteeing a basic level of \nsecurity, even when private investments fail.\n  As one who worked personally as a trader and as the head of a major \nfinancial firm, I understand that stocks can move down, or sideways, \nfor extended periods. While all workers should save on their own in \nprivate accounts, the purpose of Social Security is to establish a \nfloor below which they will not be allowed to fall. The Commission's \nproposals would drastically lower that floor.\n  This would be a mistake, especially when one considers that average \nbenefit levels are now only about $10,000 a year--hardly enough to live \non in many parts of the country. As I pointed out to the Chair on a \nnumber of occasions, the average benefit for women is closer to $9,000. \nThat is not sufficient to provide a secure retirement in most parts of \nthe country--certainly not in New Jersey and I suspect not in Michigan.\n  Another argument in the letter I received from the six Commissioners \nfocused on what some people have referred to as the ``clawback'' \nprovisions in their proposals. The Commissioners don't like the term \n``clawback,'' and I am not going to get into a semantic debate with \nthem about it. But my main point here is undisputed: each of the \nCommission's plans--there are three of them--would reduce guaranteed \nbenefits based on amounts workers contribute to privatized accounts.\n  These cuts would be in addition to the direct cuts in guaranteed \nbenefits that would apply to all seniors, even those who do not \ncontribute to privatized accounts.\n  I think many Americans would see this as political sleight of hand--\ngiving with one hand, and taking away with another.\n  Another issue addressed in the Commissioner's letter is whether this \nautomatic benefit cut proposal would apply to ``near retirees.'' The \nsix Commissioners argued that the Commission's plans ban persons older \nthan 55 from participating in privatized accounts. However, this \nactually isn't clear from the text of the report. Nor have the \nCommissioners explained why older Americans should be banned from \nparticipating in privatized accounts if that is such a great idea. Why \nare they being left out of such a wonderful opportunity to reduce their \nguaranteed benefit?\n  Next, the Commissioners dispute my point that the Commission's plans \nwould force many Americans to delay their retirement. On this point, I \nacknowledge that their proposal does not explicitly raise the legal \nretirement age. And I have never claimed otherwise. But my point is \nthat their proposals cut benefits so drastically that the effect is the \nsame.\n  Many people would be forced to work longer to build up more assets, \nin order to maintain the same level of retirement security. In fact, \none of the Commission's plans would directly target benefit cuts at \nthose who retire at 62. It seems clear that, as a practical matter, \nthis will force many seniors to delay their retirement.\n  Another point in the letter from the six Commissioners is that their \nproposals would reduce the amount of general revenues that would be \nrequired to maintain the solvency of the Social Security trust fund. To \nthe extent that they are calling for deep cuts in guaranteed benefits, \nthat's right. But, by that logic, we could eliminate the need for any \ngeneral revenues by eliminating guaranteed benefits altogether.\n  To me, this just isn't a good argument for the deep cuts in benefits.\n  I will not go into each and every argument raised by the six \nCommission members. But I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my \nwritten response to the Commissioners be printed in the Record at the \nend of my statement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit I)\n  Mr. CORZINE. Madam President, I have been very critical of the letter \nwritten by the six Commissioners, as I have been critical of materials \nprepared by the CATO Institute in the past. But I know they reflect \ndeeply held beliefs, and I sincerely want to thank them for engaging in \nthe debate. In my view, the debate that has begun here with the CATO \nInstitute and the six Commissioners is a good thing because it \nhighlights our differences for the American people. Every American has \na stake in the future of Social Security.\n  It is disappointing that the Bush administration is trying to push \nthis matter under the rug, and seems to want to defer the debate until \nafter the November election. That would be wrong. The American people \nhave a right to be part of this process.\n  Let me close and again emphasize the important points that Americans \nneed to understand. The Bush Commission's privatization plans involve \ncuts in guaranteed benefits for many current workers of 25 percent, and \nfuture benefits for seniors could be cut as much as 45 percent. These \ncuts would apply even to those who choose not to invest in privatized \naccounts. And they would have the effect of forcing Americans to delay \ntheir retirement.\n  For these reasons, I strongly oppose these proposals, and I look \nforward to continuing this dialogue with those who are supporters of \nprivatization. The future of Social Security is too important to be \nleft out of the limelight and negotiated behind closed doors. We need \nto have an open discussion.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for this opportunity to speak about \nprivatization.\n\n                               Exhibit I\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2002.\n     Ms. Leanne Abdnor, et al.,\n     Boulder, CO.\n       Dear Ms. Abdnor, Mr. Penny, Mr. Saving, Mr. Vargas, Mr. \n     Cogan and Ms. Mitchell: Thank you for your letter of May 23.\n       I appreciate your apparent willingness to engage in a \n     dialogue with respect to the report of the President's Social \n     Security commission, and trust you agree that the future of \n     Social Security deserves nothing less than a full public \n     debate. Although we obviously disagree strongly about the \n     merits of privatizing the program, I look forward to hearing \n     more from you as we seek to educate the public about the \n     plans you helped produce last December, along with the 10 \n     other members of the Commission who did not sign your letter.\n       Having said that, I was disappointed by your letter and \n     believe it presents several arguments about the Commission's \n     report and my reactions to it that are, at best, misleading.\n       Perhaps our most fundamental disagreement concerns the deep \n     cuts in guaranteed benefits included in the Commission's \n     proposals. You attempt to obscure these cuts by arguing that \n     reductions in benefit levels, relative to those promised \n     under current law, should not be considered cuts. Instead, \n     you begin by assuming that the trust fund's assets will be \n     depleted and Congress will refuse to take the steps necessary \n     to honor these promises in the future (even though you also \n     assume that massive amounts of general revenue will be \n     available to subsidize privatized accounts). You then use \n     this assumption to claim that if Congress affirmatively \n     reduces benefits through a change in current law, this should \n     not be considered a ``cut.''\n       To me, this is tantamount to a borrower telling a lender: I \n     haven't saved enough, and therefore I have a right to default \n     on your loan--and, moreover, the reduction in my payments to \n     you should not be considered a ``cut'' in your income. Surely \n     the lender in such a situation would experience the loss of \n     income as a real cut--just as seniors would experience a \n     reduction in their promised benefits as a cut.\n       In my view, it is a distortion of the English language to \n     claim that a change in the law that intentionally reduces \n     benefit levels, as the Commission has proposed, should not be \n     considered a cut. This claim is especially problematic \n     because the Commission's proposed cuts would be so deep for \n     many beneficiaries--exceeding 25 percent for many current \n     workers, and exceeding 45 percent in the future. The \n     Commission should be open and honest about this.\n       Furthermore, it is important to emphasize that cuts \n     proposed by the Commission apply even to those who choose not \n     to participate in the option of privatized accounts. This \n     belies claims that the Commission's plan is based on \n     voluntary choice.\n       The Commission's report also includes proposals for deep \n     cuts in benefits for disabled individuals. These Americans \n     would not be able to save in privatized accounts when they \n     were disabled and not working. In any case, under the \n     Commission's proposals, such disabled individuals would not \n     have access to the privatized accounts until they reached \n     retirement age. The treatment of the disabled again belies \n     claims that the Commission's plan is based on voluntary \n     choice. While I understand that the Commission expressed \n     concern about the impact of its own proposals on the \n     disabled, it nevertheless relied on savings from these cuts \n     to make its numbers add up. Without these savings, the \n     Commission's plans would not restore the Trust Fund to long-\n     term solvency.\n\n[[Page S5110]]\n\n       I recognize that you believe that privatized accounts will \n     offset the cuts in guaranteed benefits. However, this is \n     wrong for at least two reasons. First, the combination of \n     reduced guaranteed benefits and income from private accounts \n     in many cases would be less than the benefits under current \n     law, even under the assumptions used in the Commission's \n     report. Second, relying on the whims of the market is \n     inconsistent with the principal goal of Social Security--\n     guaranteeing a basic level of security, even when private \n     investments fail.\n       As one who worked personally as a trader and as the head of \n     a major financial firm, I understand that stocks can move \n     down, or sideways, for extended periods. While all workers \n     should save on their own in private accounts, such as 401(k) \n     plans and IRAs, the purpose of Social Security is to \n     establish a floor below which they will not be allowed to \n     fall. The Commission's proposals would drastically lower that \n     floor. This would be a mistake, especially when one considers \n     that average benefit levels are now only about $10,000 a \n     year--hardly enough to live on in many parts of the country.\n       You also argue that I wrongly accuse the Commission of \n     adopting a ``clawback'' proposal. But yours is a semantic \n     argument that rests on a very narrow and arguably incorrect \n     interpretation of this colloquial term. Your claim is that \n     this term applies only to reductions in privatized accounts, \n     not to reductions in guaranteed benefits. However, even if \n     one accepts this narrow definition, my basic point remains \n     undisputed. Each of the Commission's plans would reduce \n     guaranteed benefits based on amounts contributed to \n     privatized accounts. These cuts would be in addition to the \n     direct cuts in guaranteed benefits that would apply to all \n     seniors, even those who do not contribute to \n     privatized accounts. To many Americans, this will seem \n     like giving with one hand, but taking away with another.\n       To defend your proposal for automatic cuts, you cite a \n     quote from page 99 of the Commission's report that is highly \n     misleading as presented. That quote states that ``no \n     adjustments to traditional Social Security benefits would be \n     made as a function of the accumulations in [privatized] \n     accounts.'' This is technically true, but it obscures the \n     more important point: traditional guaranteed Social Security \n     benefits would be cut based on workers' contributions to \n     privatized accounts. Thus, regardless of whether the market \n     rises or falls, guaranteed benefits will be cut just as \n     deeply, undermining the value of Social Security as a \n     backstop against possible destitution.\n       Next, you argue that I was wrong to conclude that this \n     automatic benefit cut proposal would apply to ``near \n     retirees.'' More specifically, you argue that the \n     Commission's plans ban persons older than 55 from \n     participating in privatized accounts.\n       However, while the descriptions of two of the plans in the \n     Commission's report prominently include the ban, in the \n     description of Model 1, the ban is conspicuously absent. You \n     may want to check pages 110, 119, and 131 in the Commission's \n     report to see this clear difference in the descriptions of \n     the three plans. If one were to apply basic principles of \n     statutory construction to the text of the Commission's \n     report, the obvious conclusion would be that Model 1 does not \n     contain the same age limitation as do the other models.\n       I understand your claim that it was not the intent of the \n     signers of your letter to apply the automatic cuts to those \n     who contribute to privatized accounts under Model 1. However, \n     given the language of the Commission's report, this still \n     seems a reasonable interpretation of the intent of the \n     Commission as a whole. You may want to raise this with the \n     other members of the Commission and have the entire \n     Commission submit a modification of its report to the \n     Congress, if they share your intent. Such a submission might \n     include an explanation of why older Americans are banned from \n     participating in privatized accounts if, as you seem to \n     suggest in your letter, such accounts do not put the \n     guaranteed benefits of participants at risk.\n       You also dispute my point that the Commission's plans would \n     force many Americans to delay their retirement. To clarify, I \n     never said, nor did I mean to imply, that your proposal \n     explicitly raises the legal retirement age. My point is that \n     cutting the level of guaranteed benefits so drastically could \n     have the same effect. This is because individuals would be \n     forced to work longer to build up more assets, in order to \n     maintain the same level of retirement security. Note that one \n     of the Commission's plans would target benefit cuts at those \n     who retire at 62. It seems clear that, as a practical matter, \n     this will force many seniors to delay their retirement.\n       Another point you make in your letter is that the \n     Commission's proposals would reduce the amount of general \n     revenues that would be required to maintain the solvency of \n     the Social Security Trust Fund. To the extent that you are \n     calling for deep cuts in guaranteed benefits, I acknowledge \n     that your proposals would have this effect, and have never \n     argued otherwise. In fact, the benefit cuts associated with \n     the change in indexing are so substantial that, by \n     themselves, they would restore long-term balance. However, \n     the high cost of privatized accounts then forced the \n     Commission to rely on massive general revenue subsidies to \n     achieve long-term solvency.\n       Your letter also complains about critiques that ``count \n     `current law benefits' but not the taxes required to pay \n     them''. This complaint seems disingenuous, considering that \n     the Commission itself depends on substantial transfers from \n     the rest of the budget without making clear how those would \n     be financed. Under the Commission's plans, these transfers \n     would be necessary to fully fund privatized accounts and \n     partially address trust fund solvency. Yet given projections \n     of deficits outside of Social Security for the foreseeable \n     future, one might have expected the Commission to explain \n     whose taxes would be raised and whose services would be cut \n     to generate the need savings. The Commission's report \n     includes no such explanation. However, one way to reduce the \n     need for such taxes is to not subsidize privatized accounts \n     in the first place.\n       I do accept your point that investing in broadly \n     diversified funds reduces risks. That is true and, again, I \n     have never argued otherwise. However, while diversification \n     reduces risks, significant risks remain. The value of even a \n     diversified account can decline significantly at any time, \n     and can stay depressed for years. If this were to happen when \n     an individual is retiring, the consequences could be \n     catastrophic without Social Security's basic level of \n     guaranteed benefits.\n       Finally, it is hard to argue that the Commission \n     represented a balanced forum for the open consideration of \n     differing points of view. After all, the membership of the \n     Commission was stacked from the beginning with those who \n     support a shift to privatized accounts, and the Commission \n     was specifically directed to promote such accounts. That is \n     not your fault, and I do not blame you for holding policy \n     beliefs in good faith. But it seems to many observers that \n     the basic recommendations of the Commission were largely \n     predetermined by President Bush when he selected such a one-\n     sided group of members and then limited the scope of options \n     they were allowed to consider.\n       In sum, I stand by my critique of the Commission's report \n     and believe that the benefit cuts it proposes would be a \n     serious mistake for our nation, and the millions of Americans \n     who will depend on Social Security in the future.\n       I look forward to continuing our dialogue in the months \n     ahead, and hope you will be able to convince the White House \n     and the Republican congressional leadership to join in the \n     discussion before this fall's elections.\n           Best regards,\n                                                   Jon S. Corzine,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  (Mr. NELSON of Nebraska assumed the chair.)\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, will my colleague from New Jersey yield?\n  Mr. CORZINE. Yes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I appreciate my colleague stepping in the Chair so I \nmight come down for a moment before my good friend from New Jersey \nleaves.\n  I wanted to indicate my personal thanks to him--as well as my \ncolleagues whom I know share this gratitude--for his willingness to \ncome to the floor and articulate in such a precise way and an \nunderstandable way what the challenge is to this whole question of \nSocial Security and privatization of Social Security; and the fact the \nSenator has been willing to put the time in to really make it clear \nwhat is at stake for people, I am very grateful. I thank him on behalf \nof the people of Michigan for doing that.\n  I wanted to ask one question before the Senator left. I know one of \nthe things we talked about before is that Social Security is not just \nretirement. It is also a disability policy. If you are a worker and \nbecome disabled, your family is able to receive assistance, as a \ndisability policy. If you, unfortunately, lose your life on the job, it \nis a life insurance policy.\n  Isn't it also true that we really have three parts to that system? I \nknow the Senator from New Jersey spoke to that as well. This is not \nonly a question of retirement, but it is a question of a security \nsystem--disability, life insurance, and retirement. That is why it is \nso critical that it remain in place.\n  I would appreciate it if the Senator might speak to that for a \nmoment.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I very much appreciate the comments of my \ncolleague from Michigan, whom I know has been so vocal about the need \nfor a prescription drug benefit and the cost containment issue. \nActually, we need a whole list of approaches to make sure our seniors \nin America have access to the American promise, and we need to work to \nmake that happen. Prescription drugs must be part of that. Protecting \nSocial Security must be, as well.\n  As it relates to the disability benefits, the proposals in the \nCommission's report would be even more devastating to disabled \nindividuals than to retirees. Disabled people would not be able to \nbuild up assets in a privatized account if they are unable to work. And \nto the extent that they have assets in such an\n\n[[Page S5111]]\n\naccount, they would not be available until an individual retires. Even \nthe Commission expressed discomfort with their own cuts in disability \nbenefits, though in the end they relied on the savings from such cuts.\n  I very much appreciate the distinguished Senator from Michigan \nspeaking out on this aspect of the Bush Commission's cuts. Because, as \nshe suggests, these cuts do go beyond retirees, and also jeopardize the \ndisabled and those young people who lose a parent. That needs to be \nunderstood by the American people.\n  Mr. President, privatized accounts can provide some benefits, if \ntrees grow to the sky and the market never goes down or sideways. But \nif history is any guide, that is not really how the world works. In the \nreal world, privatization would put at serious risk Social Security's \nfloor level of support for the disabled, children, and our retirees.\n  Again, I thank the Senator for her question and for her support. I \nhope she will also see that same kind of support with regard to her \nefforts to contain the costs of prescription drugs, and to provide \nprescription drug benefits, both of which are serious and important \nissues for our country.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Murray). The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nI be able to speak until about 6 minutes after 10.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/06/senate-section/article/S5111-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5111-S5113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     STATE FISCAL RELIEF AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, this morning I would like to \ntalk about a very important issue that is affecting the States and the \nbudgets at the State level.\n  While the national economy may be recovering from the recession, \nState budgets will take another 12 or 18 months to recover. Just last \nmonth, the National Governors Association and National Association of \nState Budget Officers found that over 40 States are facing an aggregate \nbudget shortfall of $40 billion to $50 billion.\n  In my home State of Nebraska, the latest numbers show the highest \nunemployment level in 15 years. Tax receipts this year will be less \nthan the previous year for only the second time in the history of the \nState. The State is cutting child care, rural development, and other \nessential services. Raising taxes to build up the budget cap and \ncutting aid to local governments will result in higher property taxes.\n  Many States face the same challenges as Nebraska. This is the \nappropriate time for some help to come from Washington. Part of the \nblame that can be assessed for States that are hurting can be laid at \nthe feet of Congress.\n  A few months ago, this body passed--and the President signed into \nlaw--a bill to stimulate the economy and help workers. It wasn't a \nperfect bill. But then there are very few. But the economy was hurting, \nand it was, in fact, time to act.\n  But there were unintended consequences of that bill. Not only did the \neconomic stimulus bill fail to provide State fiscal relief in certain \nareas, but by making some changes to Federal tax law, the bill \nunintentionally added to revenue shortfalls. This means that we, in \neffect, cut State tax revenue streams. This, in turn, has put at risk \nprograms such as medical assistance to the most vulnerable individuals \nin this country.\n  I am concerned about the crunch that the States are facing. As a \nformer Governor, I know how hard it is to balance a State's budget. And \nevery State has to balance its budget. The most important thing is that \nwe recognize that this shortfall will continue, and it will affect the \nmost vulnerable among us.\n  This supplemental appropriations bill that is being considered--and \nother bills will be coming up in the area of appropriations--is an \nimportant opportunity to do something helpful.\n  My good friend, Senator Susan Collins, from Maine, will be speaking \nshortly as well on the Collins-Nelson proposal that would provide a \ntemporary 1-percent increase in the Federal Medicaid matching rate. In \nWashington, we require that the States deal with Medicaid and that they \nprovide the services, and we offer some assistance. It is an \nunderfunded Federal mandate.\n  At the present time, if we increase the amount of State funding to a \ntemporary 1-percent increase, we will assist the States in being able \nto deal with the challenges in their budgets. At the same time, this \nbill will also permit them to continue to provide in the short term for \nthe rising demand in social services from the economic downturn.\n  The bill would provide approximately $8.9 billion in total fiscal \nrelief to the States, which would allow them to expand--not contract--\nMedicaid and other health and social services.\n  States have worked very hard in order to be able to help people go \nfrom welfare to work. It is very important for us to help them continue \nthat because if they are unable to continue, and they pull back on the \nMedicaid funding and they are not able to provide the social services, \nyou could very easily have States returning to the process of bringing \npeople from the workplace back into welfare. That is counterproductive. \nIt works in the opposite direction. That is why we, in fact, must move \nforward and assist the States at this very important time.\n  The National Governors Association has embraced much of what we have \nproposed, and so have other organizations. And a number of cosponsors \nin our own body have stepped forward and said that this is the right \nthing to do, it is the right time to do it, and it is the right way to \napproach it.\n  The health care of Americans is part of our responsibility and our \ninterest. We must, in fact, help the States so we do not end up with \nthe tough choices that the States are having to make, involving \nreducing Medicaid benefits to those among our most neediest in our \nmidst.\n  According to the National Governors Association, Medicaid spending \nhas been a particular struggle for States since expenditures have risen \nby an average of 12 percent over the last 2 years, while the State's \nrevenues rose a total of 5 percent, as in the State of Nebraska. It \nappears that the revenues are flat.\n  Medicaid spending has been driven by high increases in health care \ncosts nationwide, particularly the cost of prescription drugs, an issue \nthat we are going to be facing to move forward to help our seniors deal \nwith the high cost of prescription drugs as part of Medicare. These \nsame pressures on the health care system and on our citizens are \naffecting the Medicaid population as well.\n  States have exhausted the usual ways of balancing their budgets. And \nso, given the projection of continued deficits, this means that we \nmust, in fact, step up to the plate at this time and help our States \nwork through this partnership that we have with Medicaid, where the \nStates have a matching obligation with the Federal Government, with our \nbudget. I hope we will be able to do that.\n  In closing, as a former Governor, I can say, having worked with this \nprogram, that it is an essential program. But it is a partnership with \nthe Federal Government. Now is an opportunity for the Federal \nGovernment to do its share in assisting the States in dealing with this \nvery important problem.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with Senator Collins and myself in this \neffort to show the States that Congress is not indifferent to their \nbudget problems, and we will step in and provide meaningful assistance \nat a time when Governors need it most.\n  Madam President, I believe my time is about to expire, so I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise today with my good friend, \nSenator Ben Nelson, to discuss the fiscal plight of our States. Here in \nWashington, consumed with our own budget challenges, we often forget \nthat we have 50 partners in our efforts to provide needed health, \neducation, and other essential services to our citizens. Our partners \nare our States and they need our help.\n  No one is more aware of the difficulties States are facing than \nSenator Nelson. As a former Governor, he understands that we are most \neffective when we work arm in arm, not toe to toe, with our partners, \nthe States.\n  Senator Nelson and I have filed an amendment to the supplemental \nappropriations bill to provide emergency short-term fiscal relief to \nthe States. Our amendment is needed, and it is needed now.\n\n[[Page S5112]]\n\n  The recession may have eased earlier this year, but its effects still \nlinger. They are felt acutely by States from Maine to Nebraska, from \nNew York to Washington State. And I know the Presiding Officer is a \ncosponsor of the underlying bill that Senator Nelson and I have \nintroduced. Though the recession has ended and economic growth has \npicked up in the first quarter of this year, unemployment continues to \nrise. Now it stands at 6 percent. It is an 8-year high.\n  The recession, the resulting rise in unemployment, and the tragic \nevents of September 11 have placed tremendous and unanticipated demands \non government services and resources. At the same time, these factors \nhave contributed to a dramatic and unexpected drop in government \nrevenues at precisely the time when more revenues are needed to respond \nto the confluence of challenges that confront us.\n  The combination of the increasing demands for services and the \nunexpected drop in revenues is causing a fiscal crisis for State \nbudgets all across this Nation. According to the National Governors \nAssociation and the National Association of State Budget Officers, more \nthan 40 States are facing a combined budget shortfall of between $40 \nand $50 billion. Most States have seen their estimates of tax \ncollections for the current year decrease, often dramatically. State \ngovernments are scrambling to respond. Forty-nine States are required \nby law or constitution to balance their budgets, so running a temporary \ndeficit is simply not an option.\n  Moreover, the problem is getting worse and is not likely to improve \nuntil next year at the earliest. A survey released by the National \nGovernors Association shows that individual tax revenues for the first \n4 months of this year are running nearly 15 percent below last year's \nlevels.\n  The problem is not an isolated one. Thirty-nine States have been \nforced to reduce their already enacted budgets for fiscal year 2002, by \ncutting programs across the board, tapping rainy day funds, laying off \nemployees, and reducing important services.\n  States have been forced to cut a number of critical programs. Twenty-\nnine States have attempted to balance their budgets by cutting spending \non higher education. Twenty-five States have cut corrections programs. \nTwenty-two have been forced to slash Medicaid. Seventeen States have \ncut spending for K-12 education. And 10 States have reduced aid to \nlocal governments. In addition, a number of States have raised taxes \nand fees by a total of $2.4 billion. We believe the Federal Government \ncan and should help our partners, the States. We should do so in an \neffective and responsible way.\n\n  Our amendment would provide a temporary increase in the Federal \nMedicaid matching rate and would provide block grant funds to each and \nevery State. Specifically, our proposal would increase the Federal \nGovernment's share of each State's Medicaid costs by 1 percent and hold \nthe Federal matching rate for each State harmless for the second half \nof this fiscal year and all of the next.\n  In addition, our proposal includes a temporary block grant to States \nthat would help them pay for the rising demand in social services \nresulting from the economic downturn. Our amendment would provide \napproximately $8.9 billion in total fiscal relief to the States that \nwould allow them to continue rather than contract Medicaid and other \nvital services.\n  Our amendment would provide fiscal relief to each and every State \nthat is struggling to balance the budget and care for their citizens. \nIt has been endorsed by the National Governors Association, the \nAmerican Hospital Association, the American Health Care Association, \nand the Visiting Nurse Associations of America. These groups understand \nthe importance of providing assistance to States at a time when many \nare forced to look at cutting Medicaid and other essential health care \nprograms.\n  For that reason, our bill targets most of the assistance to the \nMedicaid Program. That is the fastest growing component of State \nbudgets. While State revenues were stagnant or declined in many States \nlast year, Medicaid costs increased by 11 percent. This year, Medicaid \ncosts are increasing at an even higher rate--13.4 percent. My home \nState of Maine is one of a number of States that has been forced to \nconsider cuts in the Medicaid Program in order to compensate for \ndeclining revenues and to balance the budget.\n  Earlier this month, after the legislature had already adjourned for \nthe year, Maine's budget estimators determined that the State's \nrevenues would come in some $90 million under budget for this year and \nwould most likely result in another $90 million shortfall in the year \nto come.\n  Maine, despite the fact the legislature has gone home after enacting \ncuts earlier this year, is once again confronted with the need to \nreexamine its budget and make painful cuts.\n  Among the programs being considered for reductions in Maine are \nMedicaid and general purpose aid, which funds are vital for K-12 \neducation. Maine is not alone. Maine is typical. If we do not help, if \nwe do not provide some modest, reasonable aid to our States, States \nwill be forced to slash health care, education, and social service \nprograms in order to balance their books.\n  The amendment we have filed would help to bridge Maine's funding gap \nby bringing an additional $56 million to my State. It would help us \npreserve Medicaid and other essential programs such as education over \nthe next 18 months, while the economy continues to recover.\n  I emphasize, even with our amendment, States are still going to face \nvery difficult choices. They are still going to have to cut worthwhile \nprograms. But with our amendment, States will be able to keep critical \nprograms such as Medicaid, such as education, without having to slash \nthem and cause real harm for the low-income populations in our States.\n  The challenges facing Governor King in Maine and other Governors \nacross the country are considerable. The decisions they may be forced \nto make could affect the access of millions of Americans to health care \nand social services. They simply need our help. The proposal Senator \nNelson and I have put forth would do just that.\n\n  We are very hopeful that the distinguished chairman and ranking \nminority member on the Appropriations Committee will join us in the \neffort to assist our States. If the supplemental appropriations bill is \nnot the right vehicle for our amendment, we hope they will help us to \nidentify very soon an appropriate bill to which our amendment could be \nattached.\n  We need to provide this help right away. Most States begin a new \nfiscal year next month, and we need to provide this much-needed \nassistance now.\n  It has been a great pleasure to work with the Senator from Nebraska \non this important initiative.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Will the Senator from Maine yield for a \nquestion?\n  Ms. COLLINS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. If we are unable to find the appropriate \nlegislative mechanism to get this legislation passed, what is the \nSenator's opinion as to what States will be faced with doing, and what \nwill the impact be for the citizens of States?\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, the Senator from Nebraska raises a very \nimportant question. If we do not act, if we do not act within the next \nfew weeks, States will have no choice but to slash their Medicaid \nPrograms, thus depriving our needy low-income families of the health \ncare they depend on. They will be forced to cut education programs for \nK-12 and for State universities. They will be forced to make choices \nthat will cause real harm to the citizens of this country.\n  They have no other option. Unlike the Federal Government, they cannot \ntemporarily run a deficit. Forty-nine States are required to balance \ntheir budgets so they will have no choice, given that the fiscal year \nfor most States is going to begin on July 1, but to make Draconian cuts \nin the programs that serve the most needy members of our society.\n  We need to act as their partners. We need to provide them with help \nto get over this difficult period.\n  I thank the Senator from Nebraska for his excellent question.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I have another question, if I might ask the \nSenator from Maine, who so very eloquently expressed the concerns and \nso diplomatically suggested that we need\n\n[[Page S5113]]\n\nsome help in finding the true mechanism to get this legislation \nthrough.\n  What, in the Senator's opinion, might happen to the efforts we made \ncollectively as partners with the States for welfare reform and getting \npeople off the welfare rolls and into the workforce? What might happen \nto that?\n  Ms. COLLINS. The Senator from Nebraska has asked a very important \nquestion. He was a leader, when he was Governor, in helping people in \nhis State move from welfare to work, to give people the dignity and \nindependence that comes from the ability to earn a living. Those \nefforts depend on child care. They depend on assistance with \ntransportation. They depend on assistance with education, with expanded \nMedicare coverage. In order for people to be able to move from welfare \nto work, we have to have the social supports in place to ease that \ntransition. Those supports would be in jeopardy if we do not provide \nour States with the assistance we are discussing.\n  Furthermore, there are States that are scheduled to have an actual \ndecline in the amount of Medicaid match that they receive from the \nFederal Government. That could not happen at a worse time. It would \ncause them to slash services even more. We cannot allow that to happen.\n  This is a temporary problem. We are proposing temporary assistance to \nour States. The economy is recovering, but the effects still linger. \nStates are still seeing the demand for social services.\n  I ask, through the Chair, the Senator from Nebraska--yielding some of \nmy time to him--whether he has seen the kinds of problems in his State \nthat we are seeing in Maine where revenues have dropped unexpectedly \none more time, causing the legislature and the Governor to confront a \npending deficit in a budget that had already been enacted.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, the State of Nebraska's tax \nreceipts, for the first time--maybe only the second time in history--\nare below what they have been in the past. We have had downturns in the \neconomy previously, and the tax revenues may have been down, but they \nwould continue to be greater than the previous year. That is no longer \nthe case. You actually do have a downturn in the economy--much of it \nrelated to the difficulties in agriculture. But when you see \nunemployment moving up to the highest level in 15 years, together with \ntax receipts going down, it doesn't take a mathematician to figure out \nwhat will, in fact, continue to happen in the future.\n  When we require, at the Federal level, certain programs and do not \nprovide all the funding, all we are really doing is underfunding a \nmandate to the States. Maybe it is an important mandate that we are \nrequiring, but it is also important to not be inconsistent here, to try \nto further reform welfare with legislation that is going to be coming \nbefore this body in a short period of time and, at the same time, as we \ntry to have a higher requirement for work, and what have you, to \nimprove the income level of people going from welfare to the workforce. \nWe have to make sure we are consistent and we don't require that on the \none hand and not make it impossible when it comes to funding on the \nother hand.\n  I thank my colleague from Maine for a very articulate and passionate \nexpression of why it is important that we do this. I hope I have \nresponded to her question.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the Senator.\n  Madam President, I will make one final point. This proposal will not \nonly help our States balance their budgets without slashing essential \nsocial services such as the Medicaid Program, but it will also provide \nmuch-needed help to struggling health care providers such as our rural \nhospitals, our nursing homes, and our home health agencies. Those \nhealth care providers have been struggling with inadequate \nreimbursements under Medicaid and Medicare. By increasing the Federal \nshare of what is a partnership between the Federal Government and the \nStates to provide health care for our low-income families, we will also \nbe helping to stabilize the health care providers, particularly in \nrural States such as Nebraska and Maine. So that is another reason you \nwill find that health care providers associations are strongly backing \nour legislation, as is the National Governors Association.\n  This is not a partisan issue; it is one where we have come together \nto provide much-needed relief to our partners, the States. My hope is \nthat we will expeditiously enact our proposal before the July 4 recess.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/06/senate-section/article/S5113-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate to be divided by the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Appropriations Committee.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the bill before the Senate is an emergency \nsupplemental bill. It responds to emergency needs for our military. It \nprovides emergency funds for enormous gaps in our homeland security \nnetwork. It makes investments today to protect the people of this \ncountry against attacks tomorrow. We cannot afford continued delay and \ndragging of feet.\n  The Nation is unprepared for a biological or chemical attack. Our \ncurrent public health system is ill funded, fragmented, and unprepared \nto respond to the threats posed by bioterrorism. We must expand State \nand local capacity to recognize and to treat deadly pathogens so that \nwe are prepared to deal with weaponized disease.\n  The anthrax-laced letters that were sent through the mail afforded us \njust a glimpse of the terror that could result from a more serious \nbiological attack involving smallpox or Ebola. We know Bin Laden \nloyalists have conducted research on chemical and biological weapons at \n40 sites in Afghanistan. We know that more than a dozen nations, \nincluding China, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Russia, and Syria, can \nproduce biological and chemical weapons. So what are we doing about it? \nAre we taking action? No. Senators are dragging their feet. The \nGovernment's seemingly uncoordinated and chaotic response to the \nanthrax scare and the public's ensuing panic to anything both powdery \nand white had overwhelmed our public health systems.\n  Many of our local health departments were found impotent and ill \nprepared, lacking such basic forms of communication equipment as \ncomputers and fax machines. Astonishingly, according to the former \nDirector of the Centers for Disease Control, only half of the Nation's \npublic health departments have direct, secure Internet access.\n  State and local health officials will be first on the scene in a \nbiological attack. It is essential that they be capable of quickly \nidentifying a deadly organism and disseminating that information widely \nand rapidly so that new cases can be caught early and the spread of \ndisease can be stopped. Many local health departments, however, do not \npossess modern communications systems because of funding constraints.\n  Simply put, in the event of a chemical or biological attack, our \nlocal health care providers are probably better able to get more \naccurate information and more quickly from CNN than they are from other \nhealth care officials. So what are we doing about it?\n\n[[Page S5114]]\n\nAre we taking action? No. Some Senators are dragging their feet.\n  Our Nation's seaports are the soft underbelly of our homeland \ndefense. U.S. ports are home to oil refineries and chemical plants that \nprocess noxious, volatile chemicals. There are 68 nuclear powerplants \nlocated along U.S. waterways. A hijacked vessel that crashes into a \nport can be used to ignite volatile fuels or gases and produce a fuel \nair explosion equal to hundreds of tons of dynamite.\n  Within a mile of the Inner Harbor of Baltimore is a major east coast \nimport and export hub for a broad range of dry and liquid chemicals. If \nignited, many are capable of producing ferocious fires, explosions, and \nclouds of noxious fumes immediately adjacent to such densely populated \nrowhouse neighborhoods as Locust Point, Highlandtown, and Canton.\n  So what is being done about it? What are we doing about it? Is the \nSenate taking action? No. Senators are dragging their feet--some \nSenators.\n  U.S. ports receive 16,000 cargo containers every day--16,000 cargo \ncontainers every day--and 6 million containers per year, but only 2 \npercent of those containers are inspected. That means that a terrorist \nhas a 98-percent chance of sneaking weapons of mass destruction into \nthe United States.\n  Cargo containers are piled up by the thousands at ports, depots, and \nhuge outdoor warehouses. Many big cities, such as Charleston, SC, and \nNew Orleans, LA, were literally built around their ports, and they \npresent an attractive target. The only thing separating that container \nyard from where people live and work is a barbed-wire fence.\n  Cargo containers that are not inspected are quickly loaded and \nshipped to practically every town in America on top of ships, trains, \nand trucks. It would not be difficult for a terrorist to track a \ncontainer with a global positioning system and detonate a weapon hidden \ninside.\n  So what are we doing about it? What is the Senate doing about it? The \nSenate is stalling. The Senate is not moving. Are we taking action? No, \nwe are not taking action. Senators are dragging their feet--some \nSenators.\n  International authorities have linked 20 merchant vessels to Osama \nbin Laden. Some of the vessels are thought to be owned outright by Bin \nLaden business interests while others are on long-term charter. The \nTimes of London reported in October 2001 that Bin Laden used his ships \nto import the explosives used to destroy the U.S. Embassies in Kenya \nand Tanzania in 1998.\n  So what is the Senate doing about it? Is the Senate taking action? \nNo, no, the Senate is spinning its wheels. Senators are dragging their \nfeet--certain Senators.\n  Nuclear material is easily available if one knows where to look. In \nJanuary 2001, a panel headed by former Senator Howard Baker and former \nWhite House Counsel Lloyd Cutler found that the threat of terrorists \ngetting their hands on Russian nuclear weapons is the most urgent, \nunmet national security threat to the United States today.\n  I served with Howard Baker. He is a man of great integrity, \nknowledge, and wisdom. He is a patriot.\n  Stealing or buying a warhead from Russia would be the quickest way \nfor the terrorists or a rogue state to get a nuclear weapon, but it is \nmuch easier to construct a radiological bomb from poor-quality nuclear \nmaterials. A radiological bomb, or a dirty bomb as it is sometimes \ncalled, does not have a massive explosion, but instead it spreads \nradioactive contamination by using a conventional explosive.\n  So what are we doing about it? What is the Senate doing about it? The \nSenate is spinning its wheels. Are we taking action? Is the Senate \nmoving on this bill? No. Senators are dragging their feet--certain \nSenators.\n  The list of gaps in our homeland defense structure is overwhelming. \nSenators should be ashamed of holding up action on this legislation. We \nought to be doing everything within our power to ensure the safety of \nthe American people to protect their lives and their property, but \ninstead of moving quickly on this supplemental bill, instead of \nfulfilling their responsibility to protect the American people, some \nSenators would rather play politics. In other words, they would rather \nblow up the train.\n  What I fear is that with continued delay, we are making it far too \neasy for terrorists to blow up anything they want. We ought to move \nforward with this legislation. We ought to pass this bill. We ought to \ntake steps now to protect the American people from terrorist acts. The \nadministration ought to halt its opposition to this bill.\n  Senator Stevens and I have tried our best to provide money for this \ncountry and for the needs of the Nation and for the Nation's defense, \nboth at home and abroad. We held 5 days of hearings. We have brought a \nbill to this floor that we believe protects the interests of our \ncitizens at home and continues our efforts to fight terrorism abroad. \nWe had good witnesses. We did not omit important Department heads, \nimportant officials from the executive branch.\n  I, frankly, have difficulty in understanding the complacency about \nthese matters.\n  We have alerts and prognostications, warnings, dire warnings, from \nthe President, the Vice President, who has indicated quite clearly that \nanother attack by terrorists of such dimensions as September 11 is \nvirtually certain, almost certain.\n  Many other officials in this Government have indicated another \nterrorist attack on this Nation is a virtual certainty, and yet some \npeople in this body appear to be asleep when it comes to the urgency of \nproviding the funds that may prevent another attack.\n  Some Senators have problems with some of the items in the bill. They \nknow what to do. They can offer amendments. Let us have a vote. They \nought to offer amendments and ask for a vote. Come on, bring your \namendments. Ask for a vote. Get a vote on your amendment.\n  Yet we have spent 3 full days already on this legislation, much of \nthat time begging Members to come to the Chamber and offer amendments. \nThose amendments have been very slow in coming. It is obvious there are \nsome in this body who wish further delay. Perhaps they are being \nprodded and urged by the administration to delay this bill.\n  What does it take to awaken Senators to the emergency nature of our \nsituation? What does it take to jar some of the Members of this body \nout of the usual political posturing that so bores and distresses the \nAmerican public? Does it take another horrific attack, with thousands \nof more lives lost, to focus the attention of the Senate on the urgency \nof this matter?\n  Cloture must be invoked. We must move this urgent legislation. We \nmust shake off the complacency. We must stop playing politics with this \nNation's security and get this bill to conference and on the \nPresident's desk. So I urge all Senators today to vote for cloture.\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 4 minutes 20 seconds.\n  Mr. BYRD. I reserve that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent, on behalf of the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, Senator Conrad, to modify amendment No. 3764 earlier \nsubmitted by the chairman of the Budget Committee, to comply with the \nagreement with Senator Domenici on the budget enforcement procedures, \nand ask that that modified amendment be in order postcloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, reserving the right to object, every \nother amendment which is nongermane would be barred postcloture. I do \nnot see any reason why this amendment should be treated differently \nthan any other, and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume.\n  I do not know if anybody is confused about what is happening. I guess \nwith everything that has been said today and yesterday maybe they are, \nso let me try to straighten it out. The President sent a request to the \nCongress for an emergency appropriation for $29.7 billion. In his \nrequest, the President outlined what he thought we needed to provide \nhomeland security and to deal with the crisis that it poses. He urged \nCongress not to load up this bill with\n\n[[Page S5115]]\n\nextraneous appropriations and not to use this as a vehicle to spend a \nwhole bunch of money that we do not have, now that we are looking at \nthe potential of running a $100 billion or $150 billion deficit. That \nis the request that the President made.\n  Let me outline the bill before us. I hear my dear friend, the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, talking about people dragging their feet; we need \nthis bill. The President has already said he will veto this bill. The \nPresident has already issued a detailed outline running four pages, \nsingle-spaced, saying what is wrong with the bill and saying in the \nclearest possible terms that he is going to veto it.\n  So is this a political exercise or is this making law? Well, I guess \nthat depends on one's perspective.\n  Why is the President so upset about this bill that he is saying it \nwill be the first bill he has vetoed since he has been President? That \nis pretty extraordinary. A bill he requested, a bill that is aimed at \nproviding homeland security, the man who requested it, who has the \nresponsibility to all the people of the country for providing homeland \nsecurity, the man who under the Constitution is Commander in Chief, is \nnow saying he is going to veto this bill. Why is that?\n  Here is why: First, this bill spends $4 billion more than the \nPresident requested. That is $4 billion, in the words of our dear \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, that will come right out of \nthe Social Security trust fund. That is $4 billion that will not be \nthere for trust fund accounts or for any other purpose.\n  The problem does not stop there. My guess is, if $4 billion of add-on \nspending had been piled on to this emergency bill the President \nprobably would have swallowed hard, noted this is the way Congress \nworks, and signed the bill. But that is not the biggest problem. Four \nbillion dollars of overspending is not the biggest problem, and I will \nread from the committee's own document, from their committee report, \nwhere they outline what they are doing.\n  The President requested in emergency appropriations, to deal with \nexactly the needs we are talking about, $24.447 billion. When the \nPresident requested $24.447 billion for emergency appropriations, what \ndoes the committee provide; what does the bill before us provide? It \nprovides not $24.447 billion. It provides $14.041 billion. In other \nwords, this bill not only spends $4 billion more than the President \nasked for but in the committee report summary, it notes that it \nunderfunds the President's request by over $10 billion. In other words, \n$10 billion in emergency appropriations the President asked for were \nnot provided in this bill.\n\n  Now, one might say, they spend $4 billion more than the President but \nthey do not fund $10 billion of emergency funding he asked for? How is \nthat possible? I will explain how it is possible. In contingency \nemergency appropriations, these are things that are not true \nemergencies, the President had $2.7 billion of offset expenditures, but \nwe do not provide $2.7 billion for nonemergency items. We provide $17 \nbillion of nonemergency items and we do not pay for them. As a result, \nthis bill funds $14 billion of nonemergency items that the President \ndid not request.\n  So is anybody startled that even a President who goes the extra mile \nto be bipartisan, even a President who has done everything he could do \nto try to make this effort a bipartisan effort, has finally balked and \nsaid, look, the Congress is spending $4 billion more than I asked for? \nThey are giving me $10 billion less in emergency spending than I asked \nfor, and they are giving me $14 billion of nonemergency spending I did \nnot ask for. As a result, the President is pretty upset. He kind of \nfeels his effort to prosecute this war is being used to fund programs \nthat he believes--and I am not saying he is the only person with an \nopinion--do not represent the right priorities.\n  Now given this is the situation we are in, given that our President \nhas said he would veto this bill, is anybody shocked that Republicans \nare concerned about it and that we are objecting to it?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am very happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator identify the emergency items that the \nPresident requested that the committee did not fund?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I do not have before me a detailed listing. I can get that \nand I would provide it. I simply point out to the Senator, in his \ncommittee report, which is dated May 29 of this year, in the \nclassification of total amounts, the net appropriation is $3.8 billion \nabove what the President requested; emergency appropriations are $10.4 \nbillion; contingency appropriations are $14 billion more. They are your \nnumbers.\n\n  I am not saying everything the President says is an ``emergency'' is \nthe right designation and everything you want to fund which is not an \nemergency is the wrong thing. I am simply saying that the man who was \nelected by the American people to prosecute this war and to protect \nsecurity asked for $29 billion. We are spending almost $34 billion. He \nasked for $24 billion of emergency spending, and we are giving him $14 \nbillion. He asked for $2.7 billion in contingency emergencies--much of \nwhat he spends--and we are spending $17 billion for that purpose. So we \nare spending $14 billion more for nonemergency appropriations than the \nPresident asked for. Those are the facts in this.\n  I don't want to get into an argument with my dear friend, but I am \nreading from his report.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  I am on page 148.\n  Mr. BYRD. As I understand it--and I am confident I am right--there is \nonly $65 million in the President's request for emergency that we did \nnot approve.\n  The Senator is not on the committee. Let me tell you what we did \napprove. Fourteen billion dollars, as requested by the President, for \nthe Department of Defense, for the war on terrorism; $1.95 billion for \nforeign assistance, virtually all of which was either requested or \nsupported by the President.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If the Senator would yield, I would be happy to listen, \nbut I only have a little bit of time left.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is making some statements that are simply not \ntrue, and I would like to clarify them.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me give the Senator 1 more minute, and I will have to \nhave my time back.\n  Mr. BYRD. There is $8.3 billion for homeland reform that the \nAppropriations Committee determines is necessary based on extensive \nhearings. The Senator was in not in those hearings. The ranking member \nwas in the hearings. They were well attended by Republican Members. \nThere is $5.5 billion requested by the President in response to the \nSeptember attack on New York City.\n  The Senator has come to the Senate floor ``loaded for bear,'' but he \nis saying some things that simply are not true about this bill. I think \nhe had a bad dream. I think he had a nightmare. He is not feeling well. \nHe is not feeling well this morning.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me read the words from the Statement of Administration \nPolicy:\n       The administration strongly opposes this bill and also \n     would strongly oppose any amendment to further increase \n     spending above the President's request.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Continuing:\n\n       The Senate includes scores of unneeded items that total \n     billions of dollars all classified as emergency.\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I cannot yield now because I have a very limited time. If \nwe had unlimited debate, I would yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. I would love to go to that point.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Maybe when we get into the postcloture we can.\n  Finally, to sum up--and this is a President who has not vetoed a \nsingle bill, who came to this city determined to work on a bipartisan \nbasis--he says:\n\n       If the supplemental appropriations bill were presented to \n     the President in its current form his senior advisors would \n     recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  The point I am responding to is that when people say they do not \nunderstand why there is opposition to this bill given that we are in an \nemergency situation, that simply leaves out that the President has \nalready said he would veto this bill.\n  What we should be doing, it seems to me, is sitting down, perhaps the \ncommittee should go back and rewrite the bill, work with the President, \nand craft\n\n[[Page S5116]]\n\nsomething the President would sign. The idea that somehow there is foot \ndragging going on when the President has already said he would veto the \nbill, I don't view as productive work in which we are engaged. It seems \nto me what we should be trying to do is to make this bill acceptable to \nthe President.\n  I also note that if you look at every agency of the executive branch \nof Government, you see that this bill funds every single agency of the \nexecutive branch of Government at a higher level than the President \nrequested, except one. There is only one agency of Government that does \nnot get more funding than the President requested under this bill. \nGuess what it is. Only one agency does not get more funding than \nrequested by the President. What is the agency? The Defense Department. \nAnd this is a bill that is about homeland security.\n  So there are two sides to the story. We are at an impasse. Those who \nwant to see a bill signed into law and want to support a President who \nbelieves his effort is being subverted have some responsibility to do \nthat. It is not that we are trying to be mean or hateful, it is that \nthe President, who asked for the bill, said he will veto it. The \nnumbers provided by the committee show it grossly overspends what the \nPresident requested; and not only that, it overfunds in areas that the \nPresident has said do not represent emergencies.\n  Finally, in what I think is a twisting of the process, when we had a \nbudget, we said there could be an emergency under two circumstances: \nWith an agreement of two parties, the President and the Congress. If \nthe President says something is an emergency and Congress says it is an \nemergency, it does not count on the budget. But under this bill, this \n$14 billion of nonemergency spending that is added, the President \ncannot take any of the money that is provided for an emergency, even \nthough it is $10 billion less than he asked for; he cannot spend any of \nit, unless he designates this $14 billion add-on as a nonemergency.\n  That is a perversion of the whole emergency designation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator from Texas, I am sorry to say, is apparently \nhaving some hallucinations. The President requested--if the Senator \nwill look at the report, the Senator questioned $27,143,519,000.\n  The White House said the very same thing about homeland defense. They \ndid not need the money. They did not want the money. Tom Ridge wrote me \na letter--I believe he sent a copy of it to Senator Stevens, or he may \nhave written the same letter to Senator Stevens, I am not sure, but he \nsent me a letter saying they did not need the money, they did not want \nthe money, they would determine what they needed in due time and tell \nus what they needed.\n  This Senate added $4 billion for homeland defense last year over the \nPresident's request. It is being used; it is making a difference. And \nafter all of the hearings of this committee, before Republicans and \nDemocrats, after all the hearings in which the executive branch \nparticipated, this is the outcome. This bill that we have brought to \nthe floor is the result of those hearings. Go back and tell your \nfirefighters, may I say to the Senator from Texas--go back and tell \nyour firefighters, tell your law enforcement people, tell your \npolicemen, tell your health officials, tell those people, tell the \npeople back home they do not need this protection. Tell them; don't \ntell us.\n\n  The Senator was not on the committee. I greatly honor the Senator \nfrom Texas but he is absolutely wrong. He is dead wrong. He is having \ndreams. He is having nightmares. He is really wrong. The figures he \nquoted this morning, if we had the time, I would show, are absolutely \nfalse.\n  This committee, 29 members, backed this bill. Fourteen of those \nmembers were Republicans. They voted to report this bill, and they are \nright.\n  So I say to the Senator--if I may have his attention?\n  Mr. GRAMM. You certainly may.\n  Mr. BYRD. Would he please offer amendments. If he doesn't like this \nbill, offer amendments to take out the money, and then you can tell the \npeople back home, you can tell the policemen, you can tell the \nfirefighters, you can tell the health personnel, you can tell the \npeople at the local level, that their safety doesn't matter. Their \nsafety doesn't matter.\n  What the administration says is apparently what matters. But the \nadministration was wrong last year. The Senate was right last year. The \nadministration is wrong this year, and the Senate is right this year.\n  So I urge Senators to vote for cloture and then let's vote on the \namendments.\n\n\n                          wage index fairness\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I rise today, along with my \ndistinguished colleagues, Senator Shelby and Senator Hutchinson, to \noffer an amendment to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill. I \nhave come to the Senate floor many times in the last 5\\1/2\\ years to \ntalk about this issue--the wage index--and I will continue to do so, \nand I will continue to offer my bill S. 1001, the Wage Index Fairness \nAct, as an amendment until we do something about it. I wanted to offer \nthis amendment to the emergency supplemental bill because it is, in \nfact, an emergency. The wage index is causing hospitals in rural areas \nall over America to close their doors and to turn away patients. We \ncannot allow this to continue.\n  The wage index is an injustice to rural communities that I believe \nhas reached emergency levels. This terrible inequity within the \nMedicare wage index formula must be addressed in order to ensure access \nto care for Americans in need. This amendment, which is cosponsored by \nmy colleague from Alabama, Senator Shelby, as well as my colleague from \nArkansas, Senator Hutchinson, will establish a floor on area wage index \nadjustment factors used under the Medicare Prospective Payment System \nfor inpatient and outpatient hospital services\n  Over the past years, I have visited numerous hospitals, and at every \none, hospital administrators and hospital staff have urged me to do \nsomething about the wage index. They have illustrated for me the amount \nof money they lose each year as a result of this unfair formula, as \nwell as the struggles that result including fighting to keep their \nhospitals staffed and their doors open. Time after time fixing the wage \nindex has been cited as the number one issue for Alabama's hospitals, \nand I have worked closely with the Alabama Hospital Association and its \nmembers to develop a plan to address the wage index problem.\n  A complicated and mostly arbitrary formula, the wage index is part of \nthe hospital Perspective Payment System, PPS, which was created in the \nearly 1990s in an effort to cut Medicare spending. It established a \nbase rate for Medicare reimbursement based on two components: labor and \nnonlabor related costs. While nonlabor related costs are similar \nnationwide, labor-related costs must be adjusted to account for the \nregional differences in wage costs. This adjustment is made according \nto a wage index.\n  Rural areas such as Alabama and Arkansas have low wage costs; \ntherefore, their Medicare reimbursement is much lower than in other \nparts of the country. Alabama actually has the lowest average wage \nindex in the country, and Montgomery, Alabama's capital, has the lowest \nwage index in the State. In fact, the wage index for all Alabama's \nhospitals is between 0.74 and 0.89--well below the national average.\n  The amendment I have introduced would establish a wage index \n``floor'' for Medicare reimbursement to hospitals. By raising the \nminimum wage index to 0.925, we can help those hospitals that have been \nhit hardest by the unfairness of the wage index formula. Other \nlegislative proposals may fix the wage index, but they also include \nadditional funding for other portions of Medicare reimbursement policy. \nMy bill addresses just the wage index and will help nearly half of the \nhospitals in the country. According to the American Hospital \nAssociation, this proposal will benefit 2153 hospitals across America.\n\n  Illustrating what an important issue this is, my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Hutchinson, has also filed an amendment on the wage \nindex and base payment amount, is that not correct Senator?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I have also filed an amendment to the supplemental \nappropriations bill on this critically important issue. While my \namendment,\n\n[[Page S5117]]\n\ncosponsored by Senator Cleland, will not be considered relevant if the \nSenate invokes cloture on the supplemental appropriations bill this \nmorning, I want to stress to my colleagues how important it is to the \nlivelihood of hospitals across America who are struggling every day to \nsurvive and to meet growing health care demands.\n  Cuts in Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements, coupled with health \ncare inflation and a dramatically growing health care worker shortage, \nare forcing many hospitals to shut down units, cut services, or close \ndown entirely. This truly is an emergency situation, and Congress needs \nto take action.\n  The amendment I am offering is based on bipartisan legislation I \nintroduced called the Area Wage and Base Payment Improvement Act, which \nnow has 26 cosponsors. It is designed to help rural hospitals keep pace \nwith today's salary requirements for their workers by setting a minimum \npayment on the area wage index. Such an area wage index floor--set at \n.0925 percent--would bring Medicare payments for at least 2,100 \nhospitals nationwide closer to the national average of 1 percent.\n  The amendment also eliminates the disparity in the Medicare inpatient \nbase payment amount by moving rural and smaller metropolitan hospitals \nto the same payment level received by large urban facilities. This \nchange in the base payment amount is also supported by the Medicare \nPayment Advisory Commission. In total, my amendment would provide an \nadditional $328 million in needed payments to rural hospitals in \nArkansas.\n  These rural hospitals are truly the lifeblood of their community. Not \nonly are they often the primary source of health care in a given \ncommunity, they are also a major provider of jobs in a given area. The \nfinancial failure of a hospital puts its whole community at risk \nbecause, without these institutions, medical services, social services, \nand jobs disappear.\n  Small and rural hospitals have been especially hard hit by staffing \nshortages, particularly in the field of nursing, since lower Medicare \nreimbursements and the very nature of rural areas make it difficult to \nrecruit and retain qualified staff. In Arkansas and Alabama, rural \nhospitals are losing staff to bigger salaries offered by large, urban \nhospitals out-of-state. Meanwhile, in many urban area hospitals, fierce \ncompetition for qualified workers is creating serious retention issues \nas workers are hopping from job to job.\n  I ask my colleague how is this competition for workers affecting \nhospitals in Alabama?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Alabama is having to compete with surrounding urban \nareas such as Atlanta, GA, for health care professionals. In order to \nrecruit these highly qualified health care personnel, Alabama's \nhospitals must offer urban wages. This has become nothing short of a \nbidding war due to the national shortage of health care professionals, \nand nurses and health care technicians who are being offered high pay, \nliving expenses and, in some cases, traveling expenses to leave Alabama \nand work in larger urban hospitals. Alabama hospitals must offer higher \nwages, but they are not fairly reimbursed by Medicare based on these \nhigher costs. Their reimbursement continues to be adjusted by this \ncapricious area wage index, which, as I have just illustrated, does not \nalways reflect the actual labor costs.\n  The annual impact of the wage index formula results in a reduction of \nAlabama hospital payments by between 5.5 and 6.5 percent each year or \nclose to $46 million/year. Until we fix this problem, Alabama hospitals \nand hospitals all over the country will continue to lose millions every \nyear. Already forced to make the most of limited resources and to \ncontinue to provide care for the State's uninsured, these hospitals \nwill face tough decisions regarding health care services. They will \ncontinue to postpone important projects and the purchasing of much-\nneeded equipment.\n  In my home State, it is easy to see how arbitrary and unfair this \nformula is. In Mobile, AL, the prevailing wage index is 0.81. Just \nacross the border on the Mississippi side in Pascagoula, less than an \nhour's drive away, the wage index is 0.88. On the other side of \nAlabama, in Pensacola, FL, also about an hour's drive from Mobile, the \nwage index is 0.89. There is no reason for the difference. The wages \nare not that different. But what it means, is that the hospitals in \nMobile get less Medicare reimbursement than those in the other two \nareas. This formula is arbitrary and unfair.\n  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, and the Medicare \nPayment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, have recognized the problem, and \nthey have even made recommendations to change the wage index.\n  In addition to these recommendations, several pieces of legislation \nhave been introduced in this Congress to address the wage index. \nSenator Grassley, ranking member on the Senate Finance Committee has \nbeen a champion of changing the wage index, in fact, he introduced \nlegislation last year that I and several of my Senate colleagues \ncosponsored. I also appreciate the support we have received from \nSenators Specter and Harkin during last year's Labor, Health and Human \nServices Appropriations debate. I thank them for their support and \nwelcome their offer to help fix the wage index. Although many have \nrecognized the problem with the wage index, nothing has been done to \nfix it.\n  While I understand the upcoming cloture vote will make my amendment \nnongermane as well, I still feel compelled to offer this amendment to \nthe bill to illustrate to my colleagues the true urgent need to fix the \nwage index. I hope that my colleagues will realize the urgency of this \nmatter and will work with me to fix this inequity. I urge the Senate \nFinance Committee and my colleagues to join Senators Shelby and \nHutchinson and myself in our efforts to fix the wage index formula and \nto help our hospitals continue to provide the high quality of care and \nthe access to care Americans deserve.\n  Does the Senator agree that there is broad bipartisan support for \nthese changes?\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. Yes, the area wage index floor and base payment \nchange proposals both enjoy broad bipartisan support. As I mentioned \nearlier, 26 Senators have cosponsored the Area Wage and Base Payment \nImprovement Act. Elements of this legislation have also been included \nin legislative proposals introduced by both Senators, Grassley and \nBaucus, and I thank them for their leadership in this regard. The fact \nis that rural hospitals desperately need Congress to fix this inequity. \nThese hospitals are a vital like in our Nation's health care safety \nnet, and we must ensure that they are able to continue to offer quality \nhealth care services to rural Americans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nNevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, is there any time remaining to the Senator \nfrom West Virginia?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remain 45 seconds.\n  Mr. REID. I ask that time plus 1 minute be given to the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, and equal time be given to the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, when the Senator from Texas objected to \nthe unanimous consent request that was made by the Senator from Nevada, \nwhat he was objecting to was a bipartisan agreement on a budget \nframework and the extension of the budget disciplines that expired at \nthe end of September. All we were asking was for the body to have an \nopportunity to vote after the cloture vote this morning. That is \nbecause under the rules of the Senate, postcloture, that amendment to \nhave a budget, to have the budget disciplines extended, will not be \npermitted.\n  There has been criticism that we have not had a budget for this year. \nI think all of us understand the jeopardy of not having a budget \nframework and the lack of the budget disciplines, which expire in \nSeptember extended. This was an opportunity to address those critical \nconcerns. I regret that the Senator from Texas objected. He doesn't \nwant to give the body an opportunity to vote, to discuss, to debate, \nand to decide.\n  We had a chance to put in place a budget framework and to extend the \nbudget disciplines to keep the appropriations process from spiraling \nout of control. We will have to revisit that issue, but I hope people \nwill think carefully about whether we really do not\n\n[[Page S5118]]\n\nwant to have any budget disciplines as we go through the appropriations \nprocess.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, forgive me, but for the chairman of the \nBudget Committee, who has not brought a budget to the floor--for the \nfirst time in my entire period of service in Congress--to be saying \nthat he wants to write a budget by changing the rules of the Senate to \nallow it to be germane in a appropriations bill, when it doesn't even \nset totals as to how much we are going to spend, and criticizes me for \nobjecting--I am sorry, but I think that just simply goes too far.\n  Quite frankly, we should have brought a budget to the floor. We \nshould have debated it. We should have voted on it. We did vote on the \nSenator's budget yesterday and not one Member of the Senate voted for \nit. I guess every Republican thought it spent too much and every \nDemocrat thought it spent too little. But the net result was, unless I \nam wrong, and I will stand corrected if the Senator would correct me, \nit got zero votes. So I do not understand being criticized because the \nSenator did not bring a budget to the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. And if I could have the same.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I say to my colleague from Texas, when he says there were \nno number limits in what I was offering, he is wrong. He objected to \nputting in the very limits that he requests. This was our opportunity. \nWe had a chance to have a budget framework and to extend the budget \ndisciplines and the Senator from Texas said no. We will not even allow \nthe body to consider it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. We voted on a discipline yesterday. The Senator voted \nagainst it, raised a point of order against it, and it was his number \nand he voted against it.\n  I would like to say, Senator Byrd asked me where are we not funding \nsomething the President requested? I just opened up the bill and just \nlooked at the first two pages. For staff and expenses of the U.S. \nMarshals Service, this appropriation is down $2.1 million; for the Drug \nEnforcement Administration, it cuts $13 million. I don't know--I could \ngo further but I see I am out of time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. Under the previous \norder, under rule XXII, the clerk will report the motion to invoke \ncloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the \n     supplemental appropriations bill, H.R. 4775:\n         Harry Reid, Patty Murray, Barbara Boxer, Dianne \n           Feinstein, Jack Reed, Dick Durbin, Tim Johnson, Jeff \n           Bingaman, Robert Torricelli, Tom Harkin, Daniel Akaka, \n           Byron Dorgan, Joe Lieberman, Tom Carper, Bill Nelson, \n           Maria Cantwell, Barbara Mikulski.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on H.R. \n4775, an act making supplemental appropriations for further recovery \nfrom and response to terrorist attacks on the United States for the \nfiscal year ending September 30, 2002, and for other purposes, shall be \nbrought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are required under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Bingaman) \nand the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Daschle) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

On this vote, the yeas are 87, the nays are \n10. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are now on postcloture regarding this \nvery important legislation. I have spoken to the majority leader. If we \ncan finish tonight, of course, there would be no rollcall votes \ntomorrow. If we cannot, everyone should understand, we will work until \nwe finish this bill.\n  The President wants a bill. He may not like what we have now, but I \nam sure he will like what comes out of conference.\n  I suggest that we, in the next little bit, work with those who want \nto change this bill. We will try to work out a list of amendments \npeople can offer that are germane. We will be as cooperative as we can. \nEveryone should understand, we will finish this bill. It will be \nfinished this week. That is the way it is. If we get no cooperation \nfrom everybody, then we will have a vote at approximately 5:30 tomorrow \ntonight on this legislation. We are going to finish the bill this week.\n  The President has been calling for action for more than 2 months. We \nhave been working on this measure, wasting a lot of time this week. The \nwasteful time is over. As I told the Republican leader earlier today, I \nappreciate his coming to the floor advocating that Republicans vote for \ncloture, which they did.\n  I hope we can move forward expeditiously. I say again, we will finish \nthis bill tonight if possible, with no votes tomorrow. Otherwise, we \nwill work through tomorrow until we finish.\n  I yield to my friend from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I tell my friend and colleague from \nNevada, I am happy to work with him to try to expedite consideration of \nthe bill. I might note, the President sent the urgent supplemental \nrequest on March 21. It was just recently marked up--I believe, last \nweek. So we have had it on the floor for a couple days. We have had a \nchance to review it.\n  We did cooperate with the assistant majority leader to invoke \ncloture, which is unusual. I can't remember invoking cloture on an \nappropriations bill. Maybe the chairman of the committee remembers. It \nhas probably happened, but it is not often. We did it in an effort to \ntry to streamline it.\n  There are a lot of people trying to pass a budget on this bill. I \nhappen to be on the Budget Committee. I would like for us to consider a \nbudget, but we haven't had a budget on the floor of the Senate yet. \nSome people were trying to rewrite the budget through the \nAppropriations Committee, and I questioned the wisdom of that. I was a \nlittle concerned about that. Invoking cloture eliminates the budget \ndebate. We are not going to have four or five more proposals dealing \nwith budgets and caps and budget rules, and so on. We will deal with \nappropriations bills.\n  Now we have a list of amendments, a list of amendments germane \npostcloture. I will work with the Senator from Nevada to review that \nlist. I\n\n[[Page S5119]]\n\ndon't know if we can possibly pass this bill tonight. I will try. I \nwill work with him to try to do it. We will try to pass a good bill. \nSome of us are concerned about the expense of the bill. The bill is $4 \nbillion over the President's request, and we didn't fund everything the \nPresident requested. There is a provision in here that says we are \ngoing to change how we do emergencies. I have an amendment to deal with \nthat. I will call it up pretty quickly.\n  I urge all my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, if they have \ngermane amendments, to bring them forward. Let's consider those and see \nhow much progress we can make on the bill. I don't know if we can \nfinish this bill tonight. I will work with my colleague to do so.\n  If not, we will work to see if we can't come up with a timetable, a \nframework to where it is mutually agreeable to finish this bill as soon \nas possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the distinguished \nSenator from Oklahoma, Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens marked this \nbill up 2 days before the House reported it. This was following long, \nvery productive hearings that Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens \nconducted. In my 20 years in Congress, I don't know of more in-depth, \nimportant hearings that have ever been held. Everyone from the \nadministration was called to make their opinion known as to what should \nhappen with homeland defense and the security of the Nation. These were \nlong hearings. I didn't spend the time in committee that the chairman \nand ranking member did, but these were great hearings.\n  For someone to suggest--I am not confident that the Senator from \nOklahoma did--that the Appropriations Committee was dilatory in any \nfashion is a mistake. This is one of the most in-depth, prepared bills \nI have ever come in contact with, even though most emergency bills \ndon't have the background and depth this bill has.\n  We have marked this up; the Appropriations Committee did it 2 days \nbefore the House reported it. As everyone knows, we were even willing \nto bring it up, as the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Byrd, tried to do, before the Memorial Day recess. There was \nobjection heard from my friends on the other side of the aisle.\n\n  We are now to a point where we will finish the bill. There is no way \nto slow it down. There are a number of problems we have in \npostclosture, but one of them is not, as we usually have in the Senate, \nan indefinite time period. We have a definite time period. We have \nalready notified the cloakroom to have Presiding Officers here all \nnight tonight. We will finish this bill by tomorrow. We want this bill \nto go to conference next week. We want the bill to go to the President \nas soon as we can.\n  I am confident the chairman of the committee would say this: There \nare many inadequacies in our homeland defense. This bill will plug some \nof those holes. The sooner we do that, the safer my State of Nevada \nwill be and every other State in the Union. We are moving forward. We \nare ready for the first amendment whenever anyone is ready to offer it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have a number of amendments. I will be \nready to propose them. There is no sense in reviewing how quickly we \ngot to this point. In my memory there has not been a cloture motion \nfiled on the first day a bill is considered.\n  All that aside, we are where we are. I respect and appreciate the \nmotivation of the Senator from Nevada for getting this done as quickly \nas possible, perhaps tonight or tomorrow. Therefore, I believe I ought \nto tell the Senator from Nevada that in order to expedite that, there \nshould be no managers' amendment package because I will, because of the \negregious aspects of managers' amendments in the past, packages which \nnone of us have seen and all too often have been agreed to because it \nis late at night, unless we agree--first of all, there should not be a \nmanagers' package of amendments. We should debate and vote on all \namendments. But if I am not in agreement with them and others are not \nin agreement, we will have recorded votes on those amendments, I tell \nthe Senator from Nevada.\n  We will not have one of these deals that we have seen in the past so \nmany times where at the very end--maybe at 10 or 11 o'clock at night--\nthere is a unanimous consent agreement that a managers' package be \naccepted. We are not going to do that.\n  So if the Senator from Nevada wants to get it done tonight, I \nrecommend that he play some role in making sure we don't either have a \nmanagers' package or the contents of it are well known to all Members \nof the Senate and not discovered by reading the newspaper in the \nfollowing days. I tell the Senator from Nevada, I will be ready with \nthe first amendment that we have very shortly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Arizona, a State \nnext door to Nevada, that we did not file cloture on the first day, but \nwe filed it on the second day. On the first day, we came for business \nand there was nobody from the minority here. We did not stay in session \nvery long because there was no business to be transacted. That is one \nof the problems we have in the Senate. People think that if we have a \nbill up on a Monday or a Friday, it is kind of a day that doesn't \nreally matter. We should be conducting business on those days. So \ncloture was filed on the second day.\n  I agree with the Senator that it would have been better if we had \nheld off a little bit, but we simply were getting nothing done. The \nSenator will remember that on that day we accomplished nothing. Out of \nfrustration and the fact that my dear friend, the senior Senator from \nTexas, stated that there was an effort by him and others to ``slow down \nthe train''--and we read the next day in the Daily Press that there was \nan effort by the Republicans to slow-walk this legislation and other \nlegislation--I think the majority leader had no alternative. I think he \ndid the right thing. As the Senator from Arizona said, it doesn't \nmatter, it is water that has already gone under the bridge. We are here \nnow. Let's work together to try to get this bill, which the President \nsays he wants badly and we believe he needs badly, to sign for our \ncountry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I am not trying to take the place of \nanyone who wants to offer an amendment. I thought there was a little \nloose time here. Is the Senator ready? I wanted to speak a couple of \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am glad to wait.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, let me make a couple of observations. It seems to me \nthat there is no question that we are going to pass this supplemental. \nThe President of the United States will have his rights, when this bill \ngoes to conference, to argue with the Senate and the House conferees \nand have his input. It is very difficult to perceive a situation where, \nwhen you are talking of more than a few billion dollars and more than \n100 or 200 projects or programs or activities that are funded--it is \npretty hard to come up with the same number for the President and the \nCongress. As a matter of fact, it has taken me a long time. I fess up \nto understand that the Budget Committee ordered that the Congress pass \na congressional budget, and it is most interesting that they didn't say \na Presidential and congressional budget; they said a congressional \nbudget. Then, of course, nobody took away the President's prerogatives \nas that budget was implemented. The President retains his prerogatives \nto be for or against the bills that come from that budget.\n  In fact, there have been some in both Houses who have attempted to \nchange the Budget Act so the President could be part of it. They have \nnever gone anywhere--those proposals--because we are supposed to do our \njob, and the President, with the OMB and others, does his job; and \neventually we come to a rational conclusion somewhere down the line.\n  I believe the far bigger mistake we are making as we move toward \nappropriations this year than trying to square this bill up in actual \ndollars exactly the same as the President's, or that we not get any cap \nlanguage that exceeds the President's, I think the most important thing \nis to try to save some of the enforcement provisions of the Budget Act \nso they will be living throughout this process next year and give \neverybody an opportunity to see\n\n[[Page S5120]]\n\nwhether they want to get rid of the entire process or whether they want \nto maintain the seven, eight, or nine important provisions that help us \naround here.\n  I am not suggesting I know how to do that now in a postcloture \nposition. I will continue to work with the leader on the other side and \nthe leader on this side and the respective whips and Senator Byrd, \nSenator Stevens, and anybody else to see if we cannot have a bipartisan \nagreement. Let's retain the amendment. Let's retain what? Let's retain \nsome significant portion of the enforcement provisions in the Budget \nAct, adopt them as a statute for 1 year in this appropriations bill. I \nbelieve that is the most helpful thing we can do even if the numbers \nare not identical with the President's.\n  For instance, in the entire budget, it looks as if we are coming down \nwith an agreement that probably would be supported by more than half of \nthe Senate, which says we cannot meet the President's appropriations \nnumber, but we can put together pieces and be maybe $8 billion to $10 \nbillion higher on this gigantic budget. That does nothing to change the \nPresident's budget, does nothing to put him in a position where he is \ngetting the short end of what is expected to be a congressional budget \nprovided for in our own language, and then we have one called a budget \nof the U.S. Congress.\n  I hope, for those who are interested, we will continue to work on \nthat. In the meantime, clearly, with the last vote, we are on a path to \nhurry up. I think that is relatively good considering where we have \nbeen in the past.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3764\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: What is the \npending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is amendment No. 3764 by \nthe Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Daschle.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Is that amendment germane postcloture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In the opinion of the Chair, the amendment is \nnot germane.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Does the amendment fall?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On a point of order.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I make that point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained. The amendment \nfalls.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3703\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself and Mr. \n     Feingold, proposes an amendment numbered 3703.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To strike the amount provided for design of a storage \n               facility for the Smithsonian Institution)\n\n       On page 73, strike lines 1 through 11.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is not a very big or important \namendment, but I think it has some symbolism associated with it. The \namendment concerns striking $2 million for the Smithsonian to begin \ndesign of an alcohol storage facility for animal specimens away from \nThe Mall.\n  In the Statement of Administration Policy that was sent up on June 4, \nthe President states his strong objections to the increases in spending \nover what the President had requested, and it also states if the \nsupplemental appropriations bill were presented to the President in its \ncurrent form, he would veto the bill.\n  This is just $2 million of a several-billion-dollar increase over \nwhat the President requested. But in the Statement of Administration \nPolicy, the Office of Management and Budget goes on to specify certain \nexpenditures that are, in their view, either unnecessary--it says the \nSenate bill includes scores--quoting from the message--``includes \nscores of unneeded items that total in the billions of dollars, all \nclassified as an emergency.''\n  The bill adds unrequested funds for numerous programs and projects \nthroughout nearly all of the Federal agencies. Some of these items \nrelate to homeland security--many do not--including $11 million to the \nNational Oceanic Atmospheric Administration for economic assistance to \nNew England fishermen and fishing communities; $26.8 million for the \nU.S. Geological Survey for urban mapping activities; $2 million for the \nSmithsonian to begin design of an alcohol storage facility for \nspecimens away from The Mall. They go on to add that the President's \nfiscal year 2003 budget already includes funding for this project in \nfiscal year 2003.\n  So, basically, what we are talking about is a project that already is \nincluded in the President's budget for next year. Apparently, the \npeople at the Smithsonian are seeking to accelerate that, which I can \ncertainly understand because then they will have some millions of \ndollars--$2 million extra--to spend on other projects at the \nSmithsonian, a wonderful and venerable institution. But to no objective \nobserver could this be viewed as a response to, as the title of the \nlegislation is: Making supplemental appropriations for further recovery \nfrom a response to terrorist attacks on the United States. This is \nclearly not it.\n\n  To make a long story short--I do not intend to spend too much time on \nit--the President believes it is unnecessary, I believe it is \nunnecessary, and I believe it needs to be taken out and the money spent \nat the normal time in fiscal year 2003, which is in the President's \nbudget. I am sure they will receive those.\n  Someone who supports this will say this is a serious situation, that \nthe temperature control is an important aspect, alcohol is flammable, \nand we should be as careful as possible, et cetera. I agree with all of \nthose arguments, but I also would argue that other measures can be \ntaken and this project can be moved forward at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the supplemental appropriations bill does \ninclude $2 million for the Smithsonian Institution to begin planning \nand design work for construction of a storage facility that would hold \nspecimen collections preserved in alcohol.\n  The House included this amount in its version of the supplemental \nappropriations bill. The amount is requested by the administration in \nthe Smithsonian's fiscal year 2003 budget estimate. So the \nadministration supports this item.\n  The Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History on The National \nMall holds one of the largest natural science specimen collections in \nthe world. Most of this collection is preserved in alcohol, an \nestimated 730,000 gallons of highly flammable liquid occupying 50,000 \nsquare feet of space at the museum.\n  The storage space at the museum does not comply with the fire and \nsafety codes, exposing the public--we are talking about exposing the \npublic here--to significant risks. For example, large areas of the main \nbuilding have no sprinkler system, and there are no firewalls between \nthe newer wings and the older central exhibition spaces of the museum.\n  With the equivalent of several jet planes loaded with fuel--now get \nthis--with the equivalent of several jet planes loaded with fuel now \nhoused on The Mall, the committee has acted responsibly in providing \nfunds to begin the work that will eliminate this hazard. We should not \nwait until next year. To wait is to take great risks with human lives.\n  Funds can be obligated immediately, thereby accelerating construction \nof an appropriate storage facility for 6 months to a year. This is a \nsignificant fire hazard on The National Mall, and we ought to attend to \nit now, not wait until next year.\n\n  The administration supports this item. They asked for it in the 2003 \nbill. What is wrong with going ahead with it now? The museum informed \nthe committee that construction could begin early.\n  I know it sounds good that we are appropriating money for \nconstruction of a storage facility that would hold specimen collections \npreserved in alcohol.\n\n[[Page S5121]]\n\nYes, it has a political sound on which it is easy to beat the drums. \nBut this is something that involves human lives, not just worms, not \njust insects. It involves human lives. Let someone start a fire down \nthere with all of this inflammable alcohol, and we will be spending \nmore than $2 million, and there will be human lives involved.\n  I urge that the Senate not support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator from West Virginia allow me \nto ask a question?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding that these products--\nand I certainly am not going to divulge the location publicly--are in a \nvery sensitive location.\n  Mr. BYRD. No question.\n  Mr. REID. Very close to the Capitol where millions of tourists come \nevery year.\n  Mr. BYRD. Absolutely; no question about that.\n  Mr. REID. Any kind of a suicide bomber, a car bomb would cause a \nconflagration that would be untoward if these products were ever \ninvolved.\n  Mr. BYRD. There is no question about that.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator knows, as has been developed--and I assume that \nis why the House put it in this bill----\n  Mr. BYRD. The House put it in the bill.\n  Mr. REID. The reason they did is they were concerned about the safety \nof not only hundreds of thousands of people who work in the Capitol \ncomplex area but the millions of tourists who come every year.\n  Mr. BYRD. No question about it. The Senator is absolutely correct. \nAnd I certainly would not want to be a Senator who voted for this \nmotion to strike this item if something happened. And who knows what \nmight happen today, tonight, tomorrow.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I can say for this Senator, I appreciate the \nHouse putting it in the bill. I appreciate Senator Byrd and Senator \nStevens having it in the bill before us because I think to remove this \nlegislation is such a wrong way to go.\n  If we are talking about homeland security, the place to start is with \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator for his expression of support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me outline for my colleagues what I \nthink we are going to do. I do not speak for everybody on my side, much \nless everybody in the Senate. What we are going to do is pick out maybe \na half a dozen instances of provisions that are in this bill that the \nPresident did not ask for, that do not represent an emergency as we \nconventionally define it. We are going to give Members of the Senate an \nopportunity to vote to keep them in or take them out. Let me talk about \nthe Smithsonian issue.\n  The President proposed in his budget for 2003 that we build a new \nstate-of-the-art facility that will maintain the temperature at 65 \ndegrees so that we can take specimens that are stored in alcohol at the \nSmithsonian Institution and move them to this building; that lowering \nthe temperature would reduce the amount of evaporation and, in the \nprocess, preserve the specimens better than where they are currently \nstored.\n  No one argues--not one person I have heard argue or anything I have \nread on it, and I have read everything I could get my hands on about \nthis issue--no one argues that we can build this facility right now. \nThere is not even a blueprint for it. The funds, if we provide them, \nwould be available on October 1 through normal appropriations.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. This is the design money. The construction will follow. Why \nnot get on with the design money? We could save some time, possibly \nsave some lives.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The President has asked for this funding as part of his \nongoing appropriation process. The funds would be available on October \n1. The odds that we are going to spend the money before October 1, in \nmy opinion, given the experience we have in these kinds of matters, is \nrelatively low. What this amendment does in reality is it takes an \nongoing appropriation to provide funding for the storing of specimens \nin test tubes and jars in a new facility, makes it an emergency so that \nmoney that would have been provided in the regular appropriation \nprocess can be spent on something else.\n  I will read from the Washington Times statements about this issue.\n\n       Smithsonian officials acknowledged that the need for \n     specimen storage did not result from the terrorist attacks on \n     September 11. ``It predates September 11,'' said Jerome \n     Conlon, assistant director for facility operations. ``It \n     certainly has been on our wish list, yes.''\n\n  The point is there are a lot of things on wish lists. Almost anything \ncould be deemed to be an emergency. The point is the President sent us \na targeted list of things that cost $29 billion. This is an item that \nhas to do with the storage of specimens in the Smithsonian. It is true \nthat one can argue that someone could blow up the Smithsonian and get \nan afterburn from specimens in alcohol. One could argue that almost \nanything we would do would be an emergency, but the point is the \nSmithsonian does not say this is an emergency. The President did not \nask for it as an emergency.\n  It seems to me that an explosive at a chemical plant in Beaumont, TX, \nwould be a lot more dangerous than one in the Smithsonian with alcohol \ntubes.\n  I want to protect against both, but the point is where is the line \ndrawn on what is an emergency? If we took the standard that anything \nthat could potentially be considered as a terrorist target is fair game \nfor this emergency appropriation, we could literally spend $100 \nbillion, $200 billion.\n  The point is the President did not consider this to be an emergency. \nThe Smithsonian did not consider this to be an emergency, but it was \nadded to this bill along with other items on which we will vote, some \nof which are even clearer, but I think this is a pretty clear example \nof something that was in the appropriation process that the President \nrequested through the normal channels but it has found its way into \nemergency funding. I do not think we ought to do this. I think this is \none of a dozen or so clear examples of where we have overreached in \ndesignating emergency. You can make an argument for anything that it \nhas an emergency overtone to it, but basically this is an ongoing \nactivity of the Smithsonian. It was in the President's request for \n2003. I think logic would dictate that it be funded through the normal \nprocess.\n  Let me make this concluding point. The question before us, it seems \nto me, is not are we going to build this new building for the \nSmithsonian; the question is, does it represent such a dire emergency \nthat it should be exempted from the budget process and we should fund \nit by running a deficit and funding that out of the Social Security \ntrust fund?\n  I argue that where we are talking about clear examples, where the \nPresident and the Congress agree, which is our definition of an \nemergency, in law, that there is an imminent threat, the answer is yes, \nwe should run a deficit to do it. But in a case where the President \nsays this is not an emergency, where it is going to occur anyway \nthrough the normal appropriations process, where the Smithsonian admits \nthat it is not an emergency, it has been on their wish list for quite \nawhile, something they want to do and that is worthy, it seems to me \nthat under these circumstances this should not be funded as an \nemergency.\n  I think the case is clear cut. Obviously, people can vote however \nthey want to vote, but what we are doing in this emergency designation \nis we are waiving the Budget Act, we are raising the deficit, we are \nspending the Social Security trust fund because this is an imminent \nemergency. The point is the Smithsonian says it is not. The President \nsays it is not.\n  The question is, should we designate it as that or should we allow it \nto be funded through the normal appropriations process where the funds \nwill be available on October 1? It seems to me that the clear answer \nis, this should not be in this list of dire emergencies.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, for my friend to suggest that this is \nstuff stored in test tubes and jars, he certainly does not understand \nthe issue.\n\n[[Page S5122]]\n\nThere are 730,000 gallons at a site so close to where millions of \npeople come every year, and it seems to me there are a lot of things \nthat are emergencies but I think the Appropriations Committee in the \nHouse and the Appropriations Committee in the Senate did the right \nthing in getting the program on its way so they could find another \nplace for 730,000 gallons of alcohol and formaldehyde. This is an \nemergency. It should remain in this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. When the time is ready to expire, I intend to make a \nmotion to table the Senator's amendment. I believe others may want to \nspeak on it, so I do not want to do that in advance, but I will say \nthis: This is money to start this project, one that we all believe is \nextremely necessary due to the location of the Smithsonian. It is a \nvery small amount of money. Maybe that is why the argument was started. \nIt may be about a very small amount of money, but it is one that \ncollectively, on a bipartisan basis, we thought ought to be initiated \nnow. We will address the full amount in the 2003 bill, and I think that \nis proper.\n  This is not the kind of money that has to go through all kinds of \nrigmarole at OMB to get released. It is money that will be immediately \navailable to start this design, and by the time the money is released \nfor 2003, it ought to be possible to move this really a year ahead if \nwe start now.\n  So I urge the Senate to support our recommendation. I do not know how \nthe House will feel about it, but it is a nice test case to see whether \nor not the Senate wants to support the judgment of the Appropriations \nCommittee on the staging of monies for the Smithsonian. This is an \nemergency to get that collection and everything else out of that \nbuilding and get it where it should be, away from the concentrated area \nof the District of Columbia and the millions of visitors who come to \nWashington, DC.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I will be very brief. I look forward to \na vote. The Senator from Texas and I will have several votes, not an \nunending stream of votes because we will know after three or four votes \nwhether there is going to be any imposition of fiscal discipline or is \nthis just a spigot that is going to be turned on. It is not the amount \nof money that is symbolic about this vote. It is whether, as the \nSenator from Alaska said, we will rely on the judgment of the \nAppropriations Committee, as he just stated, or we will rely on the \njudgment of the Commander in Chief, the President of the United States, \nwho specifically in his veto threat objected to this provision in the \nappropriations bill. It is really that simple.\n  So it is not $2 million. It is, whose judgment are we going to trust? \nAre we going to--as with other amendments, as I say, we will establish \na precedent for it--be able to trust the judgment of the President of \nthe United States or the judgment of the Appropriations Committee?\n  So I look forward to a quick vote. I say to the Senator from Alaska \nwe have no further debate on this issue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I will be very brief. I have had the \nopportunity to sit on the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian \nInstitution.\n  I have been in numerous meetings, especially since September and \nOctober, addressing this very specific issue.\n  Having listened to the presentation of the people who have studied \nthis issue most carefully inside the Smithsonian Institution, I am very \nhesitant to back away from the recognition that we have over 730,000 \ngallons of highly flammable alcohol within about 150 yards of where we \nare sitting right now. I don't want to overstate or understate, and I \nread what has been written about this in the last several days.\n  Let me make several points. We are talking about the National Museum \nof Natural History located on the National Mall, right outside the \ndoor. It currently holds tens of thousands of specimens. These \nspecimens are placed in highly flammable alcohol jars. The collections \ntoday occupy about 50,000 square feet of space in various areas of the \nmuseum. They do not today comply with the fire code that has been \nwritten locally in this area, in this region, in this district, in this \npart of the country. They do not comply with the fire code. They are \nstacked under a stairwell where we have thousands of people walking \nover the course of a month.\n  The National Museum of Natural History has 1,200 staff and 25,000 \nvisitors on a weekday who are walking either over, because it is stored \nunder a stairwell there, or around the flammable jars.\n  This issue has been a concern of the Smithsonian. I have been a \nregent for about 6 years, for some time. For my colleagues who have not \nbeen in the room, recent national security reviews highlighting the \nvulnerability of highly visited public buildings indicate this problem \nshould be resolved as soon as possible.\n  The Smithsonian, as mentioned before, has planned to build a \nspecially designed storage facility at the research and storage complex \nin Maryland, removing the collections from The Mall area where we have \nso many people coming from all over the United States of America to \nvisit.\n  We need to remove this as soon as we possibly can. If the Smithsonian \ncan plan it, it is in the underlying plan. If they do that--it will not \nbe done in 2002--those 730,000 gallons will be over there in 2002 and \nin 2003 and in 2004 and they will be removed in the year 2005.\n  Failure to address this issue now would be a huge mistake on behalf \nof this body.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I want to express my strong opposition to \nthe McCain Amendment that would strike the $2 million for the National \nMuseum of Natural History that is provided in the Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations bill.\n  The events of September 11 prompted multiple reviews of the security \nat all federal facilities. These reviews have highlighted a number of \nmeasures that need to be taken to improve the safety for employees and \nvisitors at federal facilities.\n  One important item that has been brought to our attention is the \npotential volatility of a storage facility located in the heart of \nWashington, near the national Mall. The National Museum of Natural \nHistory is recognized internationally as a premier museum and research \nfacility. Unfortunately, tens of thousands of specimens are currently \nstored in 730,000 gallons of highly flammable alcohol.\n  I commend Chairman Byrd and Senator Stevens for including $2 million \nto begin design for a new facility that would safely store the \nspecimens and do so in a location that is away from such a high traffic \narea. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I move to table the amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment of the Senator from Arizona. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. I believe the motion of the Senator from Alaska was to \ntable the amendment to strike.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I hope Senators will support the Senator from Alaska and \nvote to table the amendment to strike.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCAIN] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3635.\n       On page 25, strike lines 1 through 11.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, this has to do with the $2.5 million \nthat is earmarked for the mapping of the coral reefs in Hawaii. The \nbill directs $.5 million under the Commerce-Justice-State \nappropriations bill for 2002 to be dedicated to conducting coral \nmapping in the waters of the Hawaiian Islands and the surrounding \nExclusive Economic Zone.\n  I remind my colleagues at the outset, again, the title of the \nlegislation we are considering is: Making supplemental appropriations \nfor further recovery from and response to terrorist attacks on the \nUnited States for the fiscal year 2002.\n  I knew of many devastating effects of the attacks on our homeland. I \ndid not know of any disruption of the coral reefs in Hawaii associated \nwith the terrorist attacks on the United States of America.\n  The administration did not request this redirection of previously \nappropriated funding for coral reef mapping for the benefit of Hawaii. \nThis is no surprise, since there is not an emergency need for coral \nreef mapping in Hawaii. It is even more of a reach to suggest that a \ncoral reef mapping provision has a role on the war on terrorism. This \nis an attempt to preclude a competitive contracting process to benefit \none State.\n  A recent report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration stated that the coral reefs in the northwestern Hawaiian \nIslands are some of the most pristine in the world and that the coral \nreefs in the Atlantic, which includes Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, and \nthe Caribbean, are some of the most in distress. Why should a \nrelatively healthy reef system receive extra attention and funding at \nthe expense of those in most need?\n  I might add, the Federal Government has already been very generous \nwith respect to Hawaiian coral reefs for fiscal year 2002. In fact, \nduring this fiscal year, NOAA is scheduled to spend $8.215 million of \nits $28.25 million Coral Reef Conservation Program budget on programs \nspecifically targeted toward the northwest Hawaiian Islands; that is \nmore than a quarter of the program budget.\n  These funds include $762,000 for mapping, $893,000 for monitoring, \n$1.25 million for the Hawaii Coral Reef Initiative, $3.25 million on \nnorthwest Hawaiian Island Reserve operations and sanctuary development, \n$210,000 for fisheries management, and $3.1 million for marine debris \nremoval.\n  So the State of Hawaii has already gotten $8.215 million. Now they \nare asking for $2.5 million more. Moreover, this does not include \nfunding for NOAA'S overall program that is being spent across all of \nour Nation's coral reef, of which Hawaii also benefits.\n  Now the managers of the bill want to carve out another $2.5 million \nfor Hawaiian coral reefs. As I said before, what this bill does is \nearmark $2.5 million of that funding for a specific project in the \nwaters of the Hawaiian Islands and to a specific organization.\n  Are there other organizations that do mapping? I do not know. But why \nis it earmarked for a specific corporation to do this work? I believe \nthat it is part governmental and part private, as I understand it. This \nspecific earmark would purposefully preclude the issuance of a \ncompetitive contract for this work. Congress should not be taking such \naction and should allow a competitive contracting process to go forward \nfor any Federal funding involved.\n  I do not believe we should be providing special treatment to one part \nof the country when other parts also have a great need. If the Hawaiian \nreefs deserve this already appropriated funding, they should be able to \nsecure it based on merit review through a competitive process at NOAA.\n\n  Therefore, this amendment would strike the directive provided in the \nbill and allow the competitive process to go forward.\n  Madam President, under no stretch of the imagination can this \nprovision providing this money for a specific project in the State of \nHawaii be deemed as a response to the attacks on the United States of \nAmerica that took place on September 11. The administration opposes \nthis legislation. And it has no relation to the war on terrorism or \nhomeland security in the view of the President of the United States.\n  So I have gotten, from the last vote, a pretty good idea how these \nvotes are going to turn out. But there is going to come a time, Madam \nPresident--there is going to come a time--when our deficits have \nballooned well into $150 billion, $200 billion, from the surplus that \nwe had and people will say: What happened to all that money? What \nhappened to our money for Social Security? What happened to our money \nfor Medicare? What happened to the surpluses that we were so confident \nof, that were going to be $4- or $5- or $6 trillion over the next 10 \nyears? We are going to look back, and we are going to point at votes \nsuch as these, where, in the name of fighting the war on terror, we \nwill earmark millions of dollars for a project to map coral reefs. I \nthink the American people will not be satisfied with that result or \nthat decision made by the Congress of the United States.\n  As the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee \nfrom Alaska just said: We just made a judgement.\n  Do you want to trust the judgment of the Appropriations Committee or \nthe President of the United States? We will probably again vote to \ntrust the judgment of the Appropriations Committee, in the name of \nfighting the war on terror, of mapping coral reefs in Hawaii.\n  I would assume there will be a tabling motion made, and at that time \nI will ask for the yeas and nays.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, the provision in the bill does not add new \nspending; rather, it clarifies the allocation of funding provided for \ncoral reef mapping in the fiscal year 2002 Commerce-Justice-State and \nthe Judiciary appropriations bill.\n\n[[Page S5124]]\n\n  This amendment directs $2.5 million of the coral reef funds \nappropriated in fiscal year 2002 for mapping coral reefs in the \nHawaiian Island chain and adjacent areas to complement the general \nmapping currently planned by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration.\n  These funds will be used to begin identifying the location, type, and \ncondition of coral reefs throughout the Hawaiian Island chain. This \ndata will be used by resource managers and will provide valuable \ninformation for the northwestern Hawaiian Islands sanctuary designation \nprocess. This data will also provide a baseline for future monitoring \nof Pacific coral reefs.\n  The funds will be administered by the National Defense Center of \nExcellence for Research in Ocean Sciences through a cooperative \nagreement with NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration. Established in 1993 with funds from the Department of \nDefense, CEROS is product oriented and seeks to advance innovative \nconcepts and new approaches to technology while fully leveraging \nexisting facilities and infrastructure in Hawaii.\n\n  I urge the Senate to vote down the amendment by the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, as the distinguished chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee has stated, this coral reef initiative does \nnot appropriate any money, not even a penny. The sums involved have \nbeen appropriated and were appropriated in the last fiscal year.\n  It may interest the Senate to know that the administration does not \noppose this initiative. In fact, they authored the initiative. The \ninitiative as drafted in the supplemental was drafted by the staff of \nNOAA.\n  Eighty-four percent of the coral reefs of the United States are found \naround the Hawaiian Islands. Of that 84 percent, 15 percent are found \naround the occupied islands, the inhabited islands, the islands I live \non; 69 percent are in the northwest. The Commerce Department is in the \nprocess now of establishing a sanctuary in the northwestern islands. In \norder to establish a proper sanctuary to identify the ecosystem, to \nidentify the fishes, the plant life that all of us want to preserve for \ngenerations to come, we must have a mapping. We must know where they \nare.\n  This is a technical thing. Therefore, my staff was not adequately \nprepared to draft such legislation. It had to be done by the staff of \nCommerce.\n  This is not a pork item. One may get the impression that we were \nusing this vehicle to get $2.5 million for the people of Hawaii. Such \nis not the case. The moneys will be handled by the Commerce Department \ntogether with the National Defense Center of Excellence for Research in \nOcean Sciences, CEROS. This was established by the Defense Department. \nUnder the rules of CEROS, this will be under a competition. No \norganization has been selected for the purpose of this mapping. We have \nno idea who that organization will be.\n  If we are to carry out the initiative started by the Government of \nthe United States to protect our environment, to protect our coral \nreefs, this is absolutely essential. What we have done was to carry out \nthe wishes of the people of the United States and the wishes of the \nadministration.\n  I hope we can defeat the amendment.\n  I move to table the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The clerk will continue the call of the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  (Mr. MILLER assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table amendment No. \n3635.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I rise in support of the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table has been made and is not \ndebatable.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I might speak \ndespite the fact that a motion to table has been made.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator from Texas will allow, I have \na unanimous consent request I would like to propound at this time. I \nthink it will solve the problem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the McCain amendment No. 3635 \nbe laid aside to recur at 2 p.m. today; that at 2 p.m. there be 5 \nminutes equally divided prior to a vote on a motion to table the \namendment, with no amendments in order to the language proposed to be \nstricken; with the time equally divided and controlled between Senators \nMcCain and Inouye or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator McCain has graciously consented, as \nhas Senator Gramm, that if someone wants to offer an amendment prior to \n2 p.m., they will have no objection to doing that. We could perhaps \nhave two votes around that time. It is up to the body as to whether or \nnot someone wants to offer another amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, as I noted earlier, we basically find \nourselves in a position where the President has asked for emergency \nfunding.\n  We have a bill before us the President has said he will veto. We have \na problem in that the proposal spends more money than the President \nasked for. It doesn't fund some of the emergencies he asked for, funds \nmany things he did not ask for. The question is, how do we get this \nright so we get the money that the White House wants in a form that \nthey will sign and that we can get on about the Nation's business?\n  It is fair to say the people on my side of the aisle decided that in \nthe end the best thing to do is to go ahead and cloture this bill so it \nwill have a vote hopefully sometime this afternoon or tonight, send the \nbill to conference, and then it will be up to the conferees to bring it \ninto compliance with what the President has said he will sign, or have \nit vetoed. In either case, we decided that was a better approach than \nsimply continuing to debate this issue on the floor of the Senate in \nthe face of the President's first veto threat.\n\n  Senator Byrd and I had a discussion earlier today about that veto \nthreat. I don't want to get back into that discussion. I want to talk \nabout this amendment.\n  Senator McCain and I are concerned that there are a lot of provisions \nin this bill that really are not emergencies. That doesn't mean they \nare not meritorious. The example we had before about building the \nstorage facility for the Smithsonian so that specimens stored in \nalcohol could be in a building with the temperatures controlled, so you \ndon't have to keep adding alcohol and will have better protection \nagainst fire, is something we need to do. The President has that in his \n2003 budget. It is being funded here as an emergency. The President \nmentioned it in his veto message.\n  Senator McCain and I decided that the way to deal with this problem \nis to pick out about four or five of these issues that the President \nhas singled out as not being emergencies and give the Senate the \nopportunity to vote on them, and then we have two points of order on \nthe bill.\n  One point of order is the emergency designation, where the body would \ndecide whether or not it is an emergency by whether or not 60 Members \nwould vote to deem it such. The other point of order has to do with a \nquirky provision of the bill where the President cannot designate what \nhe called an emergency to spend the money unless he takes $14 billion \nof spending that he has not designated as an emergency and spends that \nmoney.\n  We believe that circumvents the whole emergency designation process. \nWe believe there is a point of order\n\n[[Page S5125]]\n\nbased on that, and my guess is that at some point we will have a vote \non those two points of order, assuming they lie.\n  In going down the amendments, one that Senator McCain has identified \nis the mapping of the coral reef. Let me say this. I don't have any \ndoubt in the world that mapping the coral reef is a good thing. Other \nthan the State that I represent, my home and the State I was born in, I \ndon't love any place more than I love Hawaii. Let me also say that no \nMember of the Senate has been sweeter to me and my family than the \nSenator from Hawaii. So if I had been picking amendments, I would not \nhave picked this amendment. But I don't believe that mapping the coral \nreef around Hawaii is an emergency that warrants waiving the Budget Act \nand, in the process, spending money that will generate a deficit and \nthat will take the money, ultimately, out of the Social Security trust \nfund.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to.\n  Mr. BYRD. This is not designated as an emergency, so it does not \nviolate the Budget Act. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me make my point. I hear the Senator. While the bill \nis $4 billion above the level the President requested, the nonemergency \nparts of the bill are $14 billion above the level the President \nrequested.\n  What we have sought to do is come up with a series of amendments on \nthings that we do not believe represent emergencies, to really give \npeople an opportunity to say yes or no as to whether they believe they \nshould be included in this emergency bill, which is--I think everybody \nagrees--$4 billion above what the President requested.\n\n  We understand where the votes are here. We just find ourselves in a \nposition where our President has said he is going to veto the bill. I \nintend to vote against the bill and make these points of order and vote \nfor them. I wish we could start the process over and eliminate the veto \nthreat and get this job done, but I don't have the power to control \nthat. Maybe no single Senator at this point has that power.\n  In any case, Senator McCain has offered this amendment. Despite all \nof the merits of what it is doing, it seems to me that this provision \ndoes not belong in an emergency appropriations bill. We will offer \nseveral more amendments that we believe fall into this category. \nObviously, it is up to the Senate to decide whether or not they believe \nthese provisions belong in the bill. In any case, Senator McCain felt, \nand I felt, that it was important that at least some of these items be \nvoted on, and so there will be two or three more of them that we will \noffer. I don't know what other people are going to do. Then I think we \nwould have a budget point of order against the bill.\n  At that point, from my point of view, we have made the decision, \ndespite the President's veto message, despite the fact that the \nPresident has said this does not fund the emergency items he wanted and \ndesignates items as emergencies that he doesn't believe are \nemergencies--if at that time it is the Senate's will to move ahead, \nthen I don't know that we serve any purpose to hold it back.\n  So the question we are trying to pose is--this is clearly an \nemergency bill. It is over budget from what the President requested by \n$4 billion. I do not believe this provision is an emergency, though I \ndon't doubt that it is meritorious. So I intend to support the \nSenator's amendment. I hope other people will as well.\n  There will be at least two more amendments. At that point, I think we \nwould probably be through. I think we are establishing a pattern here \nthat people are ready to pass this bill, spend this money, and worry \nabout the problem later.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, if I may repeat myself, not a penny is \nappropriated by the coral reef initiative--not one penny. Moneys were \nappropriated in the fiscal year 2002 bill. This is to set aside, of \nthat amount, $2.5 million for the mapping of the coral reef around the \nnorthwestern islands of the Hawaiian chain.\n  Mr. President, 84 percent of the coral reefs of the United States are \nfound in the Hawaiian chain. Of that 84 percent, 6 to 9 percent would \nbe found in the northwestern islands and 15 percent around the occupied \nislands. This is not important for the Hawaiian people. This is an \nemergency as far as the Commerce Department is concerned because they \nare in the process of establishing a sanctuary in the northwest \nislands. In order to set the sanctuary, you must begin mapping that \narea to determine what sort of fishes are there, what sort of plant \nlife.\n  If we are to carry out the national mission of protecting our \nenvironment and protecting the species of this land and this planet, \nthen this is an important part of it.\n  Furthermore, the funds that will be designated for this initiative \nwill be administered by the National Defense Center of Excellence for \nResearch and Ocean Sciences through a cooperative agreement with NOAA. \nOne specific item they must live up to is that this will be done by \ncompetition, using a competitive process of selecting whoever does the \nmapping.\n  This initiative does not designate any person, institution, or \norganization to do this job. Yes, it is not part of homeland security, \nbut as far as NOAA is concerned, this is an emergency. We are not \nappropriating any money; we are just saying let's use the money we have \nalready appropriated for this purpose.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me make one point and then I will be \nthrough. Part of what makes it hard to determine what is happening is \nthat the bill does make appropriations for the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration operations, research, and facilities of \n$29.2 million. That is new money that is provided in this bill on an \nemergency basis.\n  What the Senator from Hawaii is saying is that his amendment does not \nrequire new money because he is taking it from money that was \nappropriated in Public Law 107-77. Our problem is that while you are \ntaking $2.5 million for this purpose from money that was appropriated \nfor this general account, the bill puts in $29.2 million into the \naccount. So it is hard for us to tell--at least it is not obvious--that \nwhile you are spending old money, that the bill is not replacing that \nold money with new money which is, in fact, designated as an emergency. \nPerhaps this is a technicality, but it is the source of the issue we \nare trying to raise.\n  I do not know what the $2.5 million--which is being transferred for \nthis purpose--was going to be used for in the first place, and I would \nnot be shocked if it were a lower priority than what the Senator wanted \nto use it for. But there is $29.2 million of new money for the same \naccount that the committee--let me read the language:\n\n       The committee recommendation includes $29.2 million for \n     NOAA to address critical homeland security requirements.\n\n  The problem is, is any of this $29.2 million going to replace the \n$2.5 million that is being transferred for this purpose? That is what \nwe cannot tell. Hence, that is why this issue has been raised by the \nPresident and by others as an example of a nonemergency that is being \nfunded.\n  It is clear that the money is being transferred from an existing \naccount, but the question is, Is any of this $29.2 million going to pay \nfor what is being taken away? That is the question.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is the Senator aware that the money is going to the \nNational Defense Center of Excellence for Research in Ocean Studies, \nwhich is a Hawaiian State government agency, but that Hawaiian State \ngovernment agency is solely federally funded? We are proving that money \nis fungible. They give it to an outfit called the National Defense \nCenter of Excellence for Research in Ocean Studies which happens to be \na State government organization, but that State government organization \nis fully federally funded.\n  This is a remarkable movement of money and, frankly, the $29 million \nwhich is added for new money for NOAA is something that was not \nrequested by the administration either. Is the Senator aware of that?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n\n[[Page S5126]]\n\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me yield the floor and let the Senator have the floor.\n  I was looking to find my place in the bill. I do not know this bill \nas well as the people who are on the committee, but I believe this was \nan addition to the President's request, as far as I can tell.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, CEROS, the National Center of Excellence \nfor Research in Ocean Studies, is not a State government institution. \nIt is a Federal institution. It was established by the Department of \nDefense. That is why it is called a national defense center.\n  Secondly, the $2.5 million does not come out of this bill. The sums \nhave already been appropriated for mapping of coral reefs. This just \nexpedites it because NOAA wants it expedited. The amendment itself was \ndrafted by the staff of NOAA. It is not to benefit any Hawaiian \norganization, I can assure you, Mr. President. This is to benefit the \npeople of the United States who have been crying about the environment, \nabout protecting the species of this planet. This is how we are going \nto do it.\n  If we do not do it, then it is going to be wide open to fishermen, \nand if the lobsters disappear, if the exotic fishes disappear from that \narea, do not blame me. We are carrying out the wishes of the \nadministration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will not be able to fully detail some \nvery good work that staff has done for me on this supplemental \nappropriations bill, but I want to speak about one part of this \nlegislation that is of great concern to me.\n  Overall, I absolutely support the supplemental, but I want to talk \nabout some of the language and some of the additional funding for \nsupport for Colombia. First, I want to make it clear, having visited \nthe country of Colombia twice now, I believe we have a very important \nrole to play.\n  I rise today to raise concerns about the administration's proposal \nfor lifting the restrictions on aid to Colombia and providing an \nadditional $35 million to help it fight terrorism. President Bush is \nseeking authority to permit U.S.-funded combat helicopters to be used \ndirectly against FARC and the ELN, the two biggest leftist insurgency \ngroups. The administration claims that the best way to fight drugs in \nColombia is to help the country end the threat from guerrillas.\n  Violence, has wracked the Colombian countryside for more than 75 \nyears, a product of poverty, inequality and the state's chronic \nweakness. The FARC's four-decade old insurgency, which grew out of an \nearlier civil war, has intensified dramatically since peace talks broke \ndown in February, after several high-profile kidnappings. Narco-\ntraffickers, working with left wing guerrillas and right wing \nparamilitaries, continue to make large portions of the country \nungovernable.\n  In short, Colombia's democracy is in crisis. Colombian civil society \nis under siege. Union members and activists, clergy, human rights \ndefenders, journalists, and politicians continue to bear the brunt of \nhuman rights violations including murders, disappearances and threats \nin the escalating conflict in Colombia. Most Colombians living in rural \nareas unprotected by state forces are under constant threat by the left \nand right.\n  While I believe we must help Colombia, I also believe that we must do \nso wisely. The Administration has requested $35 million for Colombia--\n$25 million of which will be used to train and equip anti-kidnapping \npolice units, $4 million to support police posts in areas out of \ngovernment control, and $6 million to start training troops to protect \nan oil pipeline. This is on top of the nearly $2 billion we have \nalready dedicated to Colombia in recent years.\n\n  I have serious concerns about this proposal. Expanding our role in \nColombia is a major change in U.S. policy. In my view, such a change \ndeserves to be considered and debated on its own terms, not within the \ncontext of an emergency supplemental appropriations bill. I am \nconcerned further that this shortsighted approach will only compound \nthe already tragic toll on civilian life in Colombia.\n  There are several serious problems with this approach, not least of \nwhich is the fact that the majority of U.S. assistance to Colombia goes \nto the Colombian armed forces, which continue to maintain ties to \nparamilitary groups that are listed on the State Department terrorist \nlist. I cannot emphasize this point strongly enough. The administration \nis proposing to send hundreds of millions of dollars to a military \nforce that has long, well-established ties to one of the very terrorist \ngroups we purport to be fighting.\n  Another immediate effect of the changes in policy would be to permit \nthe United States to expand how it shares intelligence information with \nColombian security forces. Again, I think we should be careful about \nproviding intel to a Colombian military that is sullied by ties to \nright wing paramilitary terrorist organizations which are deeply \ninvolved in drug trafficking.\n  I also am concerned that the Colombian military does not have the \nwill to adequately protect its citizenry. For example, a May 2002 \nreport prepared by the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human \nRights in Colombia has placed equal blame on the FARC, the AUC, the \ngovernment, and the military on fighting that left 119 civilians dead \nin the small town of Bojaya, in the remote jungles of northwest \nColombia.\n  The UN report says that the government, the police and the army not \nonly ignored warnings of an impending tragedy but also may have \ncollaborated with the outlawed paramilitary forces to allow them to \nenter the region. The report lays out evidence that a 250-person \nparamilitary unit sailed up the River Atrato in seven large boats and \npassed through two police and one army checkpoint without the slightest \nproblem. Anders Kompass, director of the UN's Colombia office, said in \nhis report that paramilitary commanders flew into the town aboard light \naircraft at a time when the town was under full military control and \nonly army aircraft were authorized to land on the small airstrip.\n  Although this is just one of the most recent examples of Colombian \nmilitary cooperation with the outlawed paramilitaries, it is emblematic \nof a broader pattern in Colombia. Military-paramilitary linkages in \nColombia are real. It's high time we addressed this problem.\n  Like Human Rights Watch, the Washington Office on Latin America \n(WOLA), and Amnesty International, I have serious concerns about the \nState Department's decision to certify the Colombian government's \ncompliance with human rights. In my view, the Colombian government and \nmilitary have shirked their responsibility to suspend high-ranking \nmilitary officers implicated in serious human rights abuses. In \naddition, the Colombian government has failed to arrest known human \nrights violators, and when they have done so, have failed to vigorously \nprosecute these individuals.\n  In particular, I am concerned about the characterization of army \nactions in Barrancabermeja as an example of progress in breaking army-\nparamilitary ties. Despite the high concentration of security forces in \nBarrancabermeja, the city remains under virtual paramilitary control. \nParamilitaries move freely through the city, and the civilian \npopulation lives in an atmosphere of unmitigated terror. Surely this \ncannot be seen as progress.\n\n  Over time, I think it's safe to say that we can expect requests by \nthe Colombian government for additional substantial aid increases in \nthe near future, perhaps as soon as next year. Now is the time to raise \nimportant questions about our end game. We must ask now, rather than a \nyear or two from now: how far are we willing to go? We should not \nbroaden our assistance until we get a satisfactory answer.\n  As you know, the administration's Foreign Operations Appropriations \nrequest includes $98 million for FY2003 to\n\n[[Page S5127]]\n\ntrain an additional brigade of Colombian troops to serve as a rapid-\nreaction force protecting the Cano-Limon pipeline used by the U.S. oil \ncompany, Occidental Petroleum, against guerrilla attack.\n  U.S. Ambassador Anne Patterson told Colombia's El Tiempo newspaper \nthat ``there are more than 300 infrastructure sites that are strategic \nfor the United States in Colombia.'' Are we going to pay to protect all \nof these sites as well? Where do we draw the line? Why protect this \npipeline and not another? Why not a dam, a coal mine, a power grid? We \nneed to openly debate these questions before targeting assistance to \none entity.\n  I also am concerned that the Administration may appear to want to \ncircumvent congressional authority. They have requested $6 million in \nthis emergency supplemental for a program that Congress has not yet \nauthorized. However, I am pleased to see that Senator Leahy has reduced \nthe amount of funding for pipeline security to $3.5 million. He also \nhas inserted language requiring Occidental and the other oil companies \nthat would benefit from such protection to repay these funds. I applaud \nthese efforts to check this glaring example of corporate welfare.\n  This is not to say that the United States should not help strengthen \nColombia's democracy. The United States can and should help Colombia. \nHere's what I believe we should be doing instead: Support the civilian \npart of Colombia's state--judges and prosecutors, oversight agencies, \nhonest legislators, and reformist police officers; protect human rights \nand anti-corruption reformers inside and outside of government; provide \nand more effectively implement alternative development and rural \ndevelopment programs to create the conditions for a functioning legal \neconomy and alleviate the desperation of Colombia's countryside, which \nfuels the conflict; step up our provision of humanitarian aid to \ninternally displaced persons and refugees; use the full weight of our \ndiplomacy to support efforts to restart peace talks, perhaps with UN \ninvolvement; press the Colombian military to break ties with the \nparamilitaries, without sending mixed signals--like waivers and \ndisingenuous certification processes; and, spend more money at home on \nefforts to reduce demand through treatment and prevention.\n  In Colombia, we should do all we can to strengthen the rule of law \nand democratic institutions. Economic and social development should be \nour highest priorities, and humanitarian delivery is essential. In \naddition, we need to invest in demand side interventions here in the \nU.S. Our militarized drug strategy overwhelmingly emphasizes drug \neradication, interdiction and law enforcement when studies show that \nthese are the least effective means of reducing illicit drug use.\n  A landmark study of cocaine markets by the conservative RAND \nCorporation found that, dollar for dollar, providing treatment to \naddicts is 10 times more effective at reducing cocaine use than drug \ninterdiction schemes and 23 times more cost effective than eradicating \ncoca at its source.\n\n  Our counter-narcotics policy in Colombia has not worked. Although \nsome drug laboratories have been destroyed, coca production in Colombia \nhas risen. In fact, despite massive fumigation across Colombia, the \narea of Colombia planted with coca grew by 24.7 percent in 2001 to \n419,000 acres, 169,800 hectares. CIA figures for 2000 showed final \ncocaine output at 580 tons.\n  What's more, just last month, General Gustavo Socha, the head of \nColombia's anti-narcotics police force was removed from his post on \nFriday amid an inquiry into how some $2 million provided by the U.S. \ndisappeared from an administrative police account. His removal--and \nsubsequent resignation--are positive steps, but ultimately the \nperpetrators must be arrested and prosecuted prior to any new infusion \nof assistance money.\n  Also, we do not know what the policies of any new Colombian \nadministration will be. With the recent landslide victory of Alvaro \nUribe in the Colombian Presidential elections, I think we have cause to \nbe concerned. I hope Mr. Uribe will keep his campaign pledge to combat \nillegal right-wing paramilitary forces with as much vigor as he does \nthe rebels, but I have cause for skepticism. I have serious concerns \nthat Mr. Uribe's plans could lead to increased abuses that would mostly \nbefall poor villagers who live in the areas where the fighting often \ntakes place.\n  Uribe, a 49-year-old former state governor, has promised to wage a \nwar without quarter against both the FARC and the AUC. In my view, an \nescalated military approach is doomed to fail. He says he will double \nthe size of the army's combat force to 100,000 soldiers and the \nNational Police to 200,000, create commando teams to root the \nterrorists and drug traffickers out of Colombia's vast jungles, and \nrecruit hundreds of thousands of civilians for security squads. As \ngovernor, paramilitary forces flourished in his department, and his \nchief election opponent has alleged paramilitary and narco-trafficker \nlinks.\n  Uribe, whose campaign slogan is ``Firm Hand, Big Heart,'' has raised \nconcerns among human rights groups, who fear his anti-guerrilla \nrhetoric might encourage right-wing paramilitaries. I share this \nconcern.\n  Most analysts agree that the military offensive proposed by \nPresident-elect Uribe will make things worse before they get better. It \nwill most likely result in an increase of Colombian refugees and a rise \nin kidnappings, violence and drug production by FARC rebels in \nneighboring countries. The spillover effect of the war on neighboring \ncountries could be compounded by the fact that the armed forces of \nVenezuela, Ecuador and Peru are consumed by internal troubles, Brazil \nis focused on its October presidential elections, and Panama does not \neven have an army. Again, I must ask: what are we trying to accomplish \nhere?\n  Between 1995 and 1998, when he was governor of the prosperous and \ntortured state of Antioquia, whose capital is Medellin, Mr. Uribe \noversaw the creation of a network of civilian patrol groups. At least \ntwo of these groups evolved into notorious death squads, but Uribe \ninsists that the others were merely efficient neighborhood \npeacekeepers. I believe that we should be wary of these civilian \nmilitias. Some see this as a new ``Self-Defense,'' or paramilitary, \ninitiative.\n  That said, with the exception of the civilian patrol groups that \nturned into death squads, and a military campaign against the \nguerrillas in the Uraba region of Antioquia, which is often described \nas brutal, Uribe's record as governor of Antioquia is outstanding, \nparticularly in this chaotic nation. Public health, education, and \nhighway systems, which are among Colombia's worst problems, improved \ngreatly in Antioquia during his tenure. As a result, I hold out hope \nthat he will advance a platform of economic, social, and cultural \ndevelopment all of which have been in short supply in Colombia.\n\n  Ultimately, there is no military solution to this conflict. Most \nobservers agree that a political solution is the only way out. Mr. \nUribe has issued a call for the United Nations to attempt to restart \npeace talks with the rebels. In my view, our government should be more \nactive in the quest for peace by encouraging negotiations like the \nsputtering ``Havana process'' of talks between the government and the \nELN. This model could pave the way for eventual negotiations with the \nFARC. Moreover, we should encourage the Colombian government to accept \na United Nations ``good offices'' mission, under Chapter 6 of the UN \nCharter, without preconditions.\n  However, Mr. Uribe's ideas are unlikely to succeed despite his recent \nattempts to reach out to the UN. Before there can be any talks, he has \ndemanded that both FARC and the AUC agree to an end to violence--an \nunlikely proposition. Yet I encourage his peace overtures and hope that \nhe will agree that a military solution is not the most effective means \nfor improving Colombia's plight.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I am an internationalist. I am a first-\ngeneration American. I am interested in the world and I very much want \nto see us promoting sustainable economic development, promoting the \nenvironment, promoting human rights. I want to see good economic \ndevelopment assistance to Colombia. The truth is, I have some concerns \nabout Mr. Uribe, who recently was elected President of Colombia. \nPresident Pastrana, I think, is a very honorable man, and I think had \ntremendous support in the Senate among Democrats and Republicans \ndealing\n\n[[Page S5128]]\n\nwith a tremendous amount of violence. The city I visited twice, \nBarrancabermeja, has been like the Sarajevo of Colombia, a very \ndangerous place, especially for the people who have to live there.\n  In Colombia, there are a lot of innocent people who have been \nmurdered by savage violence. There is the FARC, which is the \nguerrilla--if a label has to be used--left. There is the ELN, also the \nguerrilla left. Then there is the AUC, or the paramilitary, on the \nright.\n  Certainly, the Government deserves and needs our assistance. My \nconcern is about the direction we are taking in this supplemental bill. \nThis is a supplemental appropriations bill, and I do not think we \nshould be changing policy, but we are. The change in policy, as I \nunderstand it, is twofold.\n  First, our military equipment, such as the Blackhawk helicopter, has \nbeen used in the war against drugs. That is what the original Plan \nColombia was all about. Now this military assistance can be directly \nused in the counter insurgency war against the FARC and the ELN, no \nlonger just for counter-narcotics. What worries me is the one-sidedness \nof the approach that the Government is taking, and I believe this new \nadministration in Colombia will take.\n  That is to say, if we are concerned about narco-trafficking, there \nare a couple of things we can and should do. The first thing we ought \nto do is to reduce the demand for the drugs in our country. That is \nactually the most effective way to deal with this. I am not sure \nanybody has proven that we can--through aerial eradication, the \nspraying and the military effort--actually successfully fight this \nscourge.\n  The truth is, the drug trafficking business in Colombia continues to \nboom. Frankly, there is not anything we have done that has made much of \na difference to date. The best thing we could do would be to reduce \ndemand in our own country and have effective treatment programs in our \nown country. Above and beyond that, what has always worried me in what \nhas been, up to now, counter-narcotics, is that all of the focus has \nbeen on the FARC and on the ELN, two organizations about which no one \nshould have any illusions. These are not Robin Hood, justice \norganizations trying to redistribute the wealth and the income to the \npoor. These are organizations that are up to their eyeballs in narco-\ntrafficking, having made a tremendous amount of money off of it.\n  These are organizations that have been engaged in a clear policy of \nterrorism, that is, of kidnapping and murder of innocent people. The \ntruth is that if this Plan Colombia was all about going after narco-\ntrafficking, we would have spent as much time focusing on the \nparamilitaries on the right because they are also implicated in the \nnarco-trafficking up to their eyeballs.\n  My concern is that we are now becoming more involved in basically a \nmilitary effort. We are becoming more involved in what is now counter-\ninsurgency, not counter-narcotics. I was never sure what the divide \nline was, but we have now changed this. We have said our military \nweaponry--and I also worry about our U.S. advisers being directly \ninvolved in the actual military effort--can now be used to fight an \ninternal counter-insurgency effort. That is a different policy. We have \nnow moved from counter-narcotics to counter-insurgency, and we are \nbecoming directly involved.\n  Part of the problem is that we are relying on this Government and \nthis military and we basically are turning our backs on blatant \nviolations of human rights conditions. My concern is that the military \nin Colombia--and every human rights organization that does any \nindependent research comes up with the same report--is too closely tied \nto the AUC or the paramilitary. And, therefore, I say to my colleagues, \nit is amazing to me, for example, that this administration has \ncertified that the military is doing much better with respect to human \nrights, and they use Barrancabermeja, where I visited twice, as an \nexample. In Barrancabermeja, it is not the case at all.\n  Senator Leahy has shown important leadership on this question, but I \nsee an administration that is turning its gaze away from all of this \nbecause in Barrancabermeja people's phones have been taken from them. \nThey do not have any phones. The paramilitary moves into their homes. \nThere is total terror and, frankly, many people have been murdered. The \ntruth is that two-thirds of the extrajudicial killings every year in \nColombia are done by the paramilitary, the AUC, the right. But we are \nnow going to move forward and we are going to become directly involved \nin direct aid to the military, too much of which is closely tied to the \nparamilitary, which has been involved in too many slaughters of \ninnocent people. It is counterinsurgency, and we are playing a \ndifferent role than we played before. We are becoming more directly \ninvolved. This is all going to be done with our money. It is going to \nbe done in our name. It is a change of policy.\n  I wish to say, so at least it is part of the record, that I think it \nis wrong to do so in the supplemental bill, and I want to issue a \nwarning to people in our country that I think this is a profound \nmistake. I think this is a profoundly mistaken policy.\n  I have had a chance to visit and I especially have become familiar \nwith the work of a priest, Francisco de Roux, who has done some of the \nfinest economic development work, and his approach is manual \neradication of the coca plant, not the aerial spraying where the \nchemicals are used, where many people say they have been sick, where \nlegal crops also end up being destroyed. Frankly, on the ground, we \nwere supposed to be providing money for alternative social \ndevelopment. We haven't done that.\n\n  We have had the war on drugs. That has been quite unsuccessful. We \nhave done this aerial spraying. Many say: This has affected our health; \nwhat are you doing? We have destroyed some of their legal crops. We \nsaid we would have alternative crops and economic development money. \nThat has not happened on the ground. We have priests such as Francisco \nde Roux trying to do it a different way. I hope others will join me in \nsupporting a more productive approach.\n  Now we have moved into a different kind of policy. We are now going \nto be involved in a joint effort to protect the pipeline. I think the \noil companies, Occidental, et al, have a fair amount of money to \nprotect their own pipeline. I don't know why we must use the taxpayers' \nmoney. Last time I looked, the oil industry was doing pretty well. I \nthink they made $40 billion in profits last year.\n  It is a long pipeline. I cannot remember how many miles. How many \nprojects are we going to be directly involved in protecting? How much \nmoney goes to the military? What is the end game? What is a victory? \nWhat are we trying to accomplish? Why the change in policy?\n  We are told: By the way, this is part of the frontline fight against \nthe terrorists. This is not al-Qaeda. A lot of this has gotten mixed \nup. This is now being justified as part of the war against terrorism. \nFARC and ELN are terrorist organizations. They have been involved in \nthe indiscriminate murder of locals, and so has the AUC--which we \nindirectly support because they have ties to the some in the Colombian \nmilitary.\n  When we directly let our equipment be used in military efforts in \ncounter-insurgency against the terrorists and then try to wrap that up \nwith the fight against al-Qaeda and what happened in the United States \nand what has happened in Afghanistan and what is going on in south Asia \nand the Middle East, it is sleight of hand. They are not one and the \nsame. No one has presented one shred of evidence that al-Qaeda is \noperating in Colombia. No one has presented one shred of evidence this \nis part of this fight against this terrorist organization.\n  This is a slippery slope. We have made some policy changes. We better \nunderstand what we are doing. We are becoming more implicated in \ncounter-insurgency. We are becoming more implicated in direct work with \nthe military, which has been tied too closely to paramilitaries, and \nrightly have been harshly condemned.\n  I don't, with a broad stroke, condemn everyone, but there are too \nmany elements of the military in Colombia that have been condemned, \nwith irrefutable evidence presented by people who have done the \nreports--the State Department, human rights organizations and others--\nconcerning massacres of innocent people.\n\n[[Page S5129]]\n\n  We are basically turning our gaze from that and are quite uncritical. \nThe good work that has been done has been done by Senator Leahy. There \nare other Senators who care as well, and I appreciate some of the work \non human rights conditions, and I appreciate some of the work he has \ndone to slow this down.\n  Senators, I want it on the record--I will have a better formal \nstatement in writing with much more clear evidence, many more facts and \nfigures--that I believe we are making a profound mistake.\n  I say to the Ambassador, Anne Patterson, whom I met, I know we don't \nagree on all things. She is doing a heroic job under very difficult \ncircumstances, but I do not believe this war against drugs has been \nanything close to a success. We are now making a change in policy that \nis of great concern to me. I don't want someone to say that nobody \ntalked about this, or that there were no Senators who raised the \nquestions about this change in policy. It is a small part of the \noverall bill, so I will vote for the bill, but I am absolutely opposed \nto this change in policy in relation to Colombia.\n\n  The administration is going in the wrong direction. I ask the \nadministration to take human rights conditions more seriously.\n  With all due respect, do not certify that there has been compliance \nwith human rights standards when that is patently not the case. I \nchallenge anyone to go to Colombia and on the basis of 1 day come back \nhere and say the military is doing a good job of protecting people. The \npeople you met there, I am not talking about ELN or FARC, the civil \nsociety people, the people everyone here would respect who do the human \nrights work and economic development work, have nothing to do with the \nleft guerrilla organizations. They are not opposed to the military and \npolice but want their protection. They want to know how it can be that \nso many of them--innocent people who have had the courage to do this \nwork--are murdered with impunity.\n  This administration seems to put all of those concerns in \nparenthesis, and this Senate, in this supplemental appropriations bill, \nto tell you the truth, is not giving a change in policy the kind of \nscrutiny and the kind of analysis or thoughtful deliberation we ought \nto give it. We are making a mistake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/06/senate-section/article/S5129-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MENTAL HEALTH RALLY\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator answer a question?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I would be pleased.\n  Mr. REID. I was scheduled to appear with the Senator from Minnesota \nat a public hearing involving mental health. I was not able to be there \nbecause of floor duties. Would the Senator be kind enough to indicate \nwhat went on at that gathering today?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the whip. First, we know Senator Reid was not \nat the rally because of his duties in the Senate.\n  Senator Reid from Nevada is a perfect example of someone who has \ntaken his own life story in the most personal, powerful, and eloquent \nway and given a lot of other people inspiration. Thank you, thank you, \nthank you for your work.\n  It was very moving. I don't know what the temperature is out there, \nbut it feels like it is 120. It was on the west side of the Capitol. \nThe estimates were 1,500 or 2,000 people in attendance. There were a \nlot of people there for well over an hour.\n  A couple of things happened: First, this is a bill on the House side \nthat now has 224 cosponsors. That is over a majority. That is enough to \nget a discharge petition. This is the work of Marge Roukema, \nRepublican, and Patrick Kennedy, Democrat.\n  On the Senate side, the bill has 66 cosponsors. In addition, there \nare 200 organizations that support it. In addition, the majority of the \npeople are saying end the discrimination. That is what it was about. Do \nnot tell someone whose daughter is struggling with depression, and they \nare worried she might take her life: You only can have a few days in \nthe hospital and that is it. You can only see a doctor a few times and \nthat is it. Treat the illness like an illness, like any other illness, \nlike a physical illness. End the discrimination.\n  It was very moving. People came to say end the discrimination. They \ncame also to say it seems everyone is for it except the health \ninsurance industry. Obviously, they are trying to block it. People are \nsaying: We do not want to wait any longer.\n  My hope is the White House will be very involved in the negotiations. \nThe President has called for full mental health parity. That is very \nimportant. We need the help. Last time we passed it on the Senate side \nand put it in the appropriations bill of Labor, Health, and Human \nServices, it was blocked in conference. This time, my hope is that we \nwill get a chance to bring it to the floor this month. We have more \nthan enough support. The House must pass it. The White House will weigh \nin. It may not be 100-percent perfect, but what a difference it will \nmake.\n  Just to give some context, the people who came from all around the \ncountry, came to say the time is now. Just to give some context, I \nmentioned the New York Times, and the journalist should get a Pulitzer \nPrize for a three-part, front-page story. I could not bear to read it. \nIt talked about adult care in New York City. Just imagine, in other \nStates as well, people jumping out of windows because they do not get \nany care. They do not get pharmacological treatment--clients, men and \nwomen, adults in urine-stenched clothing day after day because of no \nadequate staffing; elderly people dying in the heat, in the United \nStates of America, in the year 2002. We can do better.\n  You asked me about the rally. Senator Domenici just came in, and it \nwas really wonderful. Then we had a vote, so we had to leave. But Nancy \nDomenici was, what do you say, emceeing it? My own concern is that \npeople drank enough water because it was so hot. But people are \ndetermined. People are determined to end the discrimination, to get \nthis legislation passed. It was wonderful. I think it was really \nimportant.\n\n  They are working very hard today as citizen lobbyists, talking to \nMembers of the House, hoping we will move to this legislation. That is \nwhat it is all about.\n  I see my colleague from New Mexico is here.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Minnesota \nare in the Chamber. The Senator from Minnesota was speaking on another \nsubject, and I asked him about the rally that I could not attend today, \nand he proceeded to tell us.\n  I want to spread on the record of this Senate the admiration and \nrespect I have for the two Senators, both differing in political \nphilosophies except that on this issue they are marching in lockstep to \nfruition. Because of their leadership and their advocacy, we are going \nto have, in this country, mental health care so someone who has a \nmental illness is going to be treated like someone who has a physical \nillness. They should be on a par. Because of the leadership of the two \nSenators, the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from New Mexico, \nthat is going to happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I did not quite get here in time to ask \nthe distinguished majority whip where we were in terms of the business \nof the Senate. Might I ask, what is the parliamentary situation? What \nis pending before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. An amendment of the Senator from Arizona was \nset aside by consent to recur at 2 o'clock.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/06/senate-section/article/S5129-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5129-S5132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   EXPORT-IMPORT BANK REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2001--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on the bill (S. 1372) and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n\n[[Page S5130]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the House to the bill (S. \n     1372) to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the United \n     States, having met, after full and free conference, have \n     agreed to recommend and do recommend to their respective \n     houses, that the Senate recede from its disagreement to the \n     amendment of the House, and agree to the same with an \n     amendment, signed by a majority of the conferees on the part \n     of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The report was printed in the House proceedings of the Record of May \n24, 2002.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference \nreport to accompany S. 1372, the Export-Import Bank Reauthorization Act \nof 2002.\n  The Senate passed its version of this legislation on March 14 by \nunanimous consent. The House passed its version, H.R. 2871, by voice \nvote on May 1, then amended the Senate version and requested a \nconference to resolve the differences between the bills. The conference \ncommittee met on May 21 and reached agreement on the conference report. \nThe House has now passed the conference report by a vote of 344-78, and \nit is before the Senate for consideration today.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this conference report. In \nmy view, it is a carefully developed and balanced piece of legislation \nthat makes a number of constructive changes to the Export-Import Bank \nAct, which is the charter of the Export-Import Bank. Before describing \nsome of those changes, I would like to thank my colleague, Senator \nBayh, the chairman of the International Finance Subcommittee of the \nSenate Banking Committee, for his very able leadership in moving \nforward this important legislation. Senator Bayh took a particular \ninterest in strengthening the adverse economic impact procedures of the \nExport-Import Bank, which is one of the most significant provisions of \nthis legislation. I would also like to thank Senator Hagel, the ranking \nmember on the International Finance Subcommittee, who is a strong \nsupporter of the Ex-Im Bank and contributed importantly to the \nprovision of the conference report dealing with market windows. Senator \nAllard also took a strong interest in this bill and sponsored the \namendment in the Senate which established an inspector general for the \nEx-Im Bank.\n  In addition, I want to thank Representative Oxley, chairman of the \nHouse Financial Services Committee, Representative LaFalce, the ranking \nmember, and Representative Bereuter, chairman of the International \nMonetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee, for their strong commitment and \nleadership in reaching agreement on this conference report.\n  I believe there is a general recognition by most members of the \nCongress, on a bipartisan basis, that the Export-Import Bank has an \nimportant role to play in U.S. trade policy. Ex-Im Bank financing helps \nU.S. exporters level the playing field against foreign competitors who \nbenefit from subsidized export financing from their governments. It \nalso gives U.S. negotiators important bargaining leverage in efforts to \nreach international agreements limiting the use of such subsidized \nexport financing. U.S. exporters are able to compete with great success \nin international markets on the basis of price and quality. However, \nwhen foreign exporters benefit from subsidized financing from their \ngovernments, the Ex-Im Bank is needed to help U.S. companies, and the \nworkers they employ, compete on a fair basis.\n  This conference report makes a number of changes to the charter of \nthe Export-Import Bank that I believe will strengthen the ability of \nthe Ex-Im Bank to carry out its important mission. I would like to \ndescribe briefly some of the most important changes.\n  The conference report extends the authorization of the Export-Import \nBank to September 30, 2006. This extension to 2006 is intended to take \nthe reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank out of the Presidential election \ncycle.\n  When the reauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank falls in the first year of \na President's term, it runs the risk that a new President will be \ntaking office, as occurred last year. In that case, a new \nadministration must struggle not only to put in place a new Chairman of \nthe Ex-Im Bank but also to cope with providing leadership for the \nreauthorization of the Ex-Im Bank as well. The conference committee \nbelieved that it makes more sense to put the reauthorization of the Ex-\nIm Bank in the second year of a President's term to assure that a new \nEx-Im Bank Chairman has been put in place and has been on the job with \nsufficient time to provide leadership for the reauthorization of the \nBank.\n  Tied aid is highly concessional financing provided by one country to \nanother that is linked to the purchase of goods or services from the \ndonor country. The U.S. government has targeted foreign government use \nof such financing as particularly harmful to U.S. trade interests, and \nhas sought to limit the use of tied aid through negotiations in the \nOECD. Congress created the Tied Aid Credit Fund in the Ex-Im Bank to \ndemonstrate to other countries that the U.S. would match their efforts \nto gain sales through the use of tied aid in order to level the playing \nfield for U.S. exporters and to provide leverage to U.S. negotiators \nseeking to reach agreements to limit the use of tied aid.\n  The conference report makes a number of significant changes to the \nTied Aid Credit Fund of the Export-Import Bank that I believe will \nstrengthen its effectiveness. The charter of the Ex-Im Bank requires \ncooperation between the Bank, which administers the Fund, and the \nTreasury, which leads U.S. negotiating efforts to limit the use of tied \naid. Section 9(a) of the conference report directs the Ex-Im Bank and \nthe Treasury Department to develop a set of principles, process, and \nstandards for the operation of the Tied Aid Credit Fund to assure its \nsmooth functioning.\n  The Ex-Im Bank and the Treasury made an extensive effort last year to \ndevelop an agreed set of principles, process, and standards for the \noperation of the Tied Aid Credit Fund which was submitted to the \nCommittee on Financial Services of the House of Representatives and the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate on July \n16, 2001. It is expected that the initial principles, process, and \nstandards for the operation of the Tied Aid Credit Fund required by \nsection 9(a) of the conference report will be those agreed to and \nsubmitted by the Ex-Im Bank and the Treasury last year.\n  In addition, the conference report amends the Ex-Im Bank Act to \nrequire that the Tied Aid Credit Fund be administered by the Bank ``in \nconsultation with the Secretary (of the Treasury) and in accordance \nwith the principles, process, and standards'' developed pursuant to \nsection 9(a) of the conference report. This replaces the language \ncurrently in the Ex-Im Bank Act providing that the Ex-Im Bank \nadminister the tied aid credit program ``in accordance with the \nSecretary's recommendations.'' This current language has been the \nsubject of a dispute between the Ex-Im Bank and the Treasury over \nwhether the language gives the Treasury authority to prevent or \noverrule a final decision by the Board of the Ex-Im Bank to extend a \ntied aid credit in a particular case.\n  The purpose of the conference report in removing this language is to \nmake clear that the Board of the Ex-Im Bank makes the final decisions \non extending tied aid credits. Section 9(a) of the conference report \nexplicitly states that once the principles, process, and standards are \nfollowed in a given case, ``the final case-by-case decisions on the use \nof the Tied Aid Credit Fund shall be made by the Bank.''\n  The conference report provides that in the extraordinary circumstance \nin which the President of the United States determines, after \nconsulting with the President of the Ex-Im Bank and the Secretary of \nthe Treasury, that the extension of a tied aid credit would materially \nimpede enforcing compliance with the existing OECD Arrangement \nrestricting the use of tied aid credits and facilitating efforts to \nnegotiate, establish, and enforce new or revised comprehensive \ninternational arrangements, then the Bank shall not extend the tied aid \ncredit. However, absent such an extraordinary action by the President, \nthe Ex-Im Bank shall make the final decisions on tied aid credits \ncases.\n\n[[Page S5131]]\n\n  Section 10 of the conference report explicitly expands the authority \nof the Ex-Im Bank to use the Tied Aid Credit Fund to respond to the use \nof untied aid by foreign governments to promote exports as if it were \ntied aid. The conference report also directs the Secretary of the \nTreasury to seek to negotiate an OECD Arrangement restricting the use \nof untied aid, and to submit a report to the Congress on the success in \ninitiating negotiations.\n  Section 10 of the conference report also amends section 10(a) of the \nEx-Im Bank Act to establish two basic tasks for the Tied Aid Credit \nFund. First, the Ex-Im Bank should match foreign export credit agencies \nwhen they engage in tied aid outside the confines of the OECD \nArrangement and when they exploit loopholes such as untied aid in order \nto provide the United States with leverage in efforts at the OECD to \nreduce the overall level of export subsidies. Second, the Ex-Im Bank \nshould support United States exporters when the exporters face foreign \ncompetition that is consistent with the OECD Arrangement on tied aid \ncredits but which places United States exporters at a competitive \ndisadvantage. The conference report also amends section 10(b)2) of the \nEx-Im Bank Act to require that the Ex-Im Bank administer the Tied Aid \nCredit Fund in accordance with these purposes.\n  Section 10 of the conference report also addresses the important \nissue of market windows. Market windows are government-sponsored \nenterprises (for example, government owned or directed financial \ninstitutions) which provide export financing at below market rates. \nHowever, the foreign governments--notably Germany and Canada--which \nsupport them claim that these enterprises are not official export \ncredit agencies, and thus not subject to the disciplines of the OECD \nArrangement. Currently, two government entities operate very active \nmarket windows. They are the German market window KfW and the Canadian \nmarket window, the Export Development Corporation, EDC. The result is \nthat these foreign market windows can provide subsidized export \nfinancing outside the OECD Arrangement and give their exporters a \ncompetitive advantage over U.S. exporters. Also, because these foreign \nmarket windows are not subject to the OECD disciplines, there is often \na transparency problem--it is difficult to find out the terms of the \nfinancing they provide.\n  The Ex-Im Bank Act currently authorizes the Ex-Im Bank to:\n\n       Provide guarantees, insurance, and extensions of credit at \n     rates and on terms and other conditions which are fully \n     competitive with the Government-supported rates and terms and \n     other conditions available for the financing of exports of \n     goods and services from the principal countries whose \n     exporters compete with the United States.\n\n  Since market windows are government-supported entities, the Ex-Im \nBank views its current statute as providing Ex-Im Bank authority to \nmatch market windows financing. The conference committee agreed with \nthat view. However, the conference committee believed it would be \nhelpful to make this authority explicit so as to remove any question \nabout Ex-Im Bank's authority and also to send a message to the foreign \nmarket windows of U.S. concern about their operations.\n  As a result, the conference report contains two provisions which \naddress market windows. The first provision directs the executive \nbranch to seek increased transparency over the acitivites of market \nwindows in the OECD Export Credit Arrangement. If it is determined that \nmarket windows are disadvantaging U.S. exporters, the U.S. would be \ndirected to seek negotiations in the OECD for multilateral disciplines \nand transparency for market windows.\n  The second provision authorizes the Ex-Im Bank to provide financing \non terms and conditions that are inconsistent with those permitted \nunder the OECD Export Credit Arrangement to match financing terms and \nconditions that are being offered by market windows if such matching \nadvances negotiations for multilateral disciplines and transparency \nwithin the OECD, or when market windows financing is being offered on \nterms that are more favorable than available from private financial \nmarkets. Ex-Im Bank could also match market window financing when the \nmarket window refuses to provide sufficient transparency to permit the \nEx-Im Bank to determine the terms and conditions of the market window \nfinancing. The conference committee understood that Ex-Im Bank has the \nauthority to match market windows financing that is consistent with the \nterms of the OECD arrangement.\n  In addition, the conference committee held the view that increased \ninformation was needed on the activities of foreign market windows. As \na result, the conference report specifies that the Bank's annual report \nto Congress on export credit competition should include information on \nexport financing available to foreign competitors through market \nwindows.\n  The conference committee believed that it was very important to make \nclear that the Ex-Im Bank has the authority to match market windows \nfinancing in order to allow U.S. exporters to compete on a level \nplaying field, and to direct the executive branch to seek negotiations \nin the OECD for multilateral disciplines and transparency for market \nwindows financing.\n\n  Section 10 of the conference report also makes significant changes to \nsection 2(e) of the Ex-Im Bank Act. Section 2(e) prohibits the Ex-Im \nBank from making a loan or loan guarantee to expand production of a \ncommodity for export by another country if the Ex-Im Bank determines \nthat the commodity is likely to be in surplus on world markets or the \nresulting production capacity is expected to compete with U.S. \nproduction of the same commodity, and the Bank determines that the loan \nwill cause substantial injury to U.S. producers of the commodity.\n  The conference report amends section 2(e) to prohibit the Ex-Im Bank \nfrom providing any loan or loan guarantee to an entity for the \nresulting production of substantially the same product that is the \nsubject of a countervailing duty or antidumping order under title VII \nof the Tariff Act of 1930, or a determination under title II of the \nTrade Act of 1974 that an article is being imported into the United \nStates in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of \nserious injury to the domestic industry producing an article like or \ndirectly comopetitive with the imported article.\n  The conference report also requires the Ex-Im Bank to establish \nprocedures regarding loans or loan guarantees provided to an entity \nthat is subject to a preliminary determination of a reasonable \nindication of material injury to an industry under title VII of the \nTariff Act of 1930. The procedure shall help to ensure that these loans \nand loan guarantees are not likely to result in a significant increase \nin imports of substantially the same product covered by the preliminary \ndetermination and are not likely to have a significant adverse impact \non the domestic industry. In addition, in making any determination \nunder section 2(e) that a loan or guarantee will cause substantial \ninjury to U.S. producers, the conference report requires the Ex-Im Bank \nto consider investigations under title II of the Trade Act of 1974 that \nhave been initiated at the request of the President, the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative, the International Trade Commission, the Senate Finance \nCommittee or the House Ways and Means Committee. The conference report \nalso requires the Ex-Im Bank to establish procedures to provide a \npublic comment period with regard to loans or loan guarantees reviewed \npursuant to those provisions.\n  The Ex-Im Bank Act currently requires that:\n\n       The Bank shall make available, from the aggregate loan, \n     guarantee, and insurance authority available to it, an amount \n     to finance exports directly by small business concerns which \n     shall not be less than 10 percent of such authority for each \n     fiscal year.\n\n  The conference report increases the requirement to 20 percent.\n  According to the Ex-Im Bank, in fiscal year 2000 small business \ncomprised 18 percent of the total value of all Ex-Im Bank financing \nauthorizations and 86 percent of all transactions supported by Ex-Im \nBank. In fiscal year 1998 these numbers were 21 percent and 85 percent \nrespectively.\n  The conference committee believed that the requirement for Ex-Im Bank \nsmall business financing could reasonably be raised to a level of 20 \npercent without causing disruption to Ex-Im Bank's lending programs, \nEx-Im Bank remains free to go above this level, as\n\n[[Page S5132]]\n\nit has in the past, but the conference committee was concerned that \nrequiring a higher level could have the unwanted effect of tying up \navailable Ex-Im Bank resources if the Ex-Im Bank could not achieve \nhigher levels of small business financing in a given year. The \nconference report also requires the Ex-Im Bank to conduct outreach to \nsocially and economically disadvantaged small business concerns, small \nbusiness concerns owned by women, and small business concerns employing \nfewer than 100 employees.\n  The conference report also makes a number of other significant \nchanges to the Ex-Im Bank Act. It establishes an inspector general for \nthe Export-Import Bank. It makes clear that the Ex-Im Bank's objective \nin authorizing loans, guarantees, insurance, and credits shall be to \ncontribute to maintaining or increasing employment of United States \nworkers. It increases the aggregate loan, guarantee, and insurance \nauthority for the Bank to $100 billion by 2006. The conference report \nalso requires the Ex-Im Bank to submit its annual competitiveness \nreport to Congress by June 30 of each year in order to ensure its \navailability for oversight, and requires that the competitiveness \nreport contain an estimate of he annual amount of export financing \navailable from other foreign government and foreign government-related \nagencies.\n  The conference report to accompany S. 1372, the Export-Import Bank \nReauthorization Act of 2002, makes a number of significant changes to \nthe charter of the Ex-Im Bank that I believe will greatly strengthen \nthe Ex-Im Bank's effectiveness as a tool to help U.S. exporters and the \nworkers they employ to level the playing field of competition in \ninternational trade, and strengthen the ability of U.S. negotiators to \nachieve meaningful international agreements to limit the use of export \nsubsidies. Taken together, these changes represent a major enhancement \nof the Ex-Im Bank charter. I strongly urge my colleagues to support the \nconference report.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for the \nconference agreement on the charter reauthorization of the Export-\nImport Bank of the United States.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on International Trade and Finance, I \nhave worked with my colleagues to craft a bill that creates a level \nplaying field for all U.S. companies. The conference agreement includes \na number of important provisions that will help make the Bank more \ncompetitive with other export credit agencies.\n  Although the Ex-Im Bank has played an important role in increasing \nour country's exports, there have been a few instances in which the \nBank has lent its support to exports that have helped foreign companies \nwho are engaged in dumping products into our domestic market. For this \nreason, I included a provision in the conference agreement that would \nprohibit the extension of a loan or guarantee to any entity subject to \na determination of injury under section 201 by the International Trade \nCommission, ITC or subject to a countervailing duty or anti-dumping \norder. Action by the President is not necessary. Additionally, it would \nrequired a heighten level of scrutiny and comment period for \ntransactions where a preliminary injury determination exists.\n  Since its creation in 1934, the Export Import Bank of America has \ncontributed greatly to the welfare and well-being of America's economy. \nI hope that we will allow the Bank to continue its function, and I \nencourage my colleagues to support reauthorization of this important \norganization.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to commend the conferees to \nthe Export-Import Bank Reauthorization, S. 1372, and particularly \nSenators Bayh and Dodd, for preserving language that helps protect the \nU.S. steel industry from illegal dumping.\n  By facilitating foreign purchases of U.S. goods and services that \nmight not otherwise be possible, the Bank helps promote economic growth \nat home and abroad. Since its creation in 1934, the Export-Import Bank \nof the United States, has helped several Illinois companies, such as \nCaterpillar and Motorola, finance exports to foreign countries. \nHowever, there have been some instances in which the Ex-Im Bank has \nlent support to foreign companies that have engaged in dumping \nproducts, including steel, into U.S. markets. Such support is \ninconsistent with our desire for a strong domestic steel industry and \nour belief in a level playing field for international commerce.\n  The reauthorization legislation that passed the Senate today requires \nsignificantly increased scrutiny of transactions that could adversely \nimpact domestic industries. Furthermore, it prohibits the extension of \na loan or guarantee to any company or country subject to a \ndetermination of injury under Section 201 by the International Trade \nCommission (ITC) or subject to a countervailing duty or anti-dumping \norder. This is a significant step forward and I am pleased to have \naided in this effort.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the conference report be adopted, \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements \nrelating to this be printed in the Record, without any intervening \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I advise the leaders and managers that I \nwish to bring up an amendment entitled, ``American Service Members \nProtection Act.'' I would think this Senator and perhaps those who are \ncosponsors--of which there are nine--would desire some time. We will \ntry to expedite this matter. I wonder if I could send it to the desk \nand ask it be the pending amendment and then defer to the leadership \nand others to see whether if I lay it aside I can get some----\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from Virginia, I have been told that a \nSenator on this side wants to be involved in his amendment. So I cannot \nagree now that we would have a queue to put his amendment in. We \nrecognize the Senator has a right to offer his amendment, but when the \nSenator does offer it, I will have to get the other Senator over here.\n  I say to the Senator from Virginia, the Senator from Arizona has \nindicated he has one or two more amendments he wants to offer, and that \nis the arrangement. If the Senator from Virginia has a subsequent time \nhe wants to offer the amendment, I certainly have no problem with that. \nBut if he offers it now, we will have to go into a quorum call and have \nthe other Senator come to the Chamber, and we will not be able to \nexpedite this process as much as we want.\n  Mr. WARNER. I wonder if the Senator standing next to the leader, who \nis a principal cosponsor, the Senator from Georgia, wishes to be heard \non this matter?\n  Mr. MILLER. After the Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. The Senator from Arizona was kind enough to give us \nnotice of two additional amendments, and we sequenced them. I urge the \nSenator to wait until that is over. We are going to establish \nsequencing of amendments after that time. There have been others \nwaiting, too, during the morning until this first series is over. I \nurge the Senator to cooperate with us, and we will put his in the \nsequence that comes next.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator from Alaska will yield, we have known the \nSenator from Virginia is going to offer an amendment. I think it would \nbe in everyone's interest, as suggested by the Senator from Alaska, \nthat after Senator McCain finishes with his amendments, we move to the \namendment of the Senator from Virginia and other amendments.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, that is most accommodating. If we can have \na gentleman's understanding that at the conclusion of the two \namendments by the Senator from Arizona, the amendment the Senator from \nGeorgia and I want to put before the Senate could be considered at that \ntime without binding the leadership.\n  Mr. REID. Without that being a unanimous consent request, we will do \nour best to put the Senator's amendment in the queue as quickly as we \ncan.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before the Senator from Virginia leaves \nthe floor, I say to him that we intend for sure to do one more \namendment. I want to discuss with the Senator from Texas if we have to \ndo an additional amendment because it is clear there is about a 30-vote \nceiling. The Senator and I have made our point.\n  Also, the Senator from Texas is probably going to at some point make \na budget point of order. How that falls into the queue the \ndistinguished managers of the bill will establish. In the interest of \nfull disclosure, I thought the Senator from Virginia should know that \nperhaps there may not be a second amendment, only the one we are about \nto offer, and the Senator from Texas is going to make a budget point of \norder.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3704\n\n(Purpose: To strike the appropriation for Agricultural Research Service \n                       buildings and facilities)\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have an amendment on behalf of myself, \nSenator Gramm of Texas, and Senator Smith of New Hampshire, which I \nsend to the desk and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain], for himself, Mr. \n     Gramm, and Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3704.\n       On page 2, strike lines 24 through 26.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the amendment that has been offered would \nremove extraneous items from the supplemental and emergency \nappropriations bill. In particular, I propose to remove language in the \nbill that provides $50 million for buildings and facilities \nconstruction at the National Animal Disease Laboratory at Ames, IA.\n  Mr. President, $50 million is designated to add new facilities to the \nNational Animal Disease Laboratory currently located in Ames, IA. The \ncurrent plans by the Agricultural Research Service, an estimated $380 \nmillion, will be utilized to construct new buildings and facilities to \nfurther animal disease research and related activities.\n  These new facilities are approved and sanctioned by the \nadministration with funding previously allocated in the fiscal year \n2002 budget. However, despite this support, the administration has \nstated its view that additional funding suggested in this supplemental \nbill is not an essential priority at this time.\n  According to the message sent by the President--to be totally \naccurate, the Statement of Administration Policy sent by the Executive \nOffice of the President, Office of Management and Budget:\n\n       Funding provided for the construction and renovation of an \n     Ames, IA, facility is redundant because a total of $90 \n     million has been provided for fiscal year 2002 as part of the \n     ERF and regular appropriations so that additional funding is \n     not needed in fiscal year 2002 and 2003.\n\n  The study of foreign animal diseases and controlling known and \nunknown animal diseases are clearly national and public health issues. \nAs part of the Government's efforts to improve its knowledge of disease \nagents and mechanisms, this institution and other related agencies \nserve an important purpose. The work is already underway as the \nadministration asserts. Adding an additional $50 million as part of \nthis emergency spending measure is neither required nor necessary.\n  This ongoing project will clearly be subject to additional \nappropriations in future years during the routine appropriations \nprocess. These particular renovations are not scheduled to be completed \nfor another 8 years.\n  The renovations are not scheduled to be completed for another 8 \nyears.\n  I find it difficult to believe that removing this $50 million earmark \nat a time when it is not needed will jeopardize its continued planning \nand construction. The report also indicates that this program was asked \nfor and funded long before the events of September 11.\n  I do not dispute the merit of a facility such as this. In 1998, it \nsays both agencies, the National Animal Disease Research Center and the \nNational Veterinary Services Lab, saw an excellent\n\n[[Page S5134]]\n\nnew opportunity to create a single new center encompassing all their \nwork. The joint plan promises to provide many advantages over separate \nnew facilities, including a large cash saving and much shorter \ncompletion time. The proposed facility will cost $375 million and an 8-\nyear completion plan beginning in 1999.\n  I am sure the National Animal Disease Center is an important project. \nI have no doubt in my mind it has merit. I also note that it was in May \nof 2001, I quote from the committee report, correspondence to this \ncommittee, the Secretary of Agriculture noted, that there is an urgent \nneed to renovate and modernize existing facilities in Ames, IA, since \nthe events of September 11, in view of the fact that the primary \nmission of this facility is research on highly infectious animal \ndiseases such as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, which is mad cow \ndisease, and others which terrorists might use with devastating results \nto the U.S. economy. The needs outlined by the Secretary have become \neven more pronounced.\n  I have heard a long catalog of threats. The one at the Smithsonian \nhas risen now to national consciousness, that insects in alcohol are \nnow one of our highest priorities and deemed an emergency, but I did \nnot know the spread of mad cow disease was one of the tools of \npreference for the terrorists. I understand that mad cow disease is a \nserious problem. I am fully aware of the events of Europe where \nthousands of cows had to be killed. But the administration, which is \nresponsible for the construction of these facilities, clearly states in \nthe President's veto threat that this $50 million is not necessary at \nthis time because it is an 8-year project.\n  I am sure the Senators from Iowa will rise, and the Senators from \nHawaii will rise, as will the Senators from whatever State that is \naffected by these projects will rise, and stoutly defend them and make \nit in the defense of freedom and democracy. The fact is that the name \nof this bill is to respond to the acts committed on September 11 and \nhow to prepare for further responses to them. I do not believe it is \nneeded in this supplemental appropriations bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. The supplemental provides $50 million in construction funds \ntoward the modernization of the National Animal Disease Laboratory in \nAmes, IA, under the Agricultural Research Service Buildings and \nFacilities account. The full $50 million is offset. This is not \ndesignated as an emergency. The money is fully offset. The total \nconstruction costs for modernization of this laboratory are estimated \nat $430 million. To date, including the $50 million in the \nsupplemental, the Congress will have provided $149 million.\n  Mission responsibilities of the Ames, IA, lab include the eradication \nor control of devastating diseases, including bovine tuberculosis; \nvaccine development; disease control strategies for scrapie; chronic \nwasting disease; and others.\n  The National Animal Disease Laboratory combines the research and \nregulatory responsibilities of the Agricultural Research Service and \nthe Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service.\n  The National Animal Disease Laboratory has been responsible for \nresearch on anthrax and it is the national research center responsible \nfor the prevention of mad cow disease in this country. Recent episodes \nof mad cow disease, foot and mouth disease, and others in the United \nKingdom, are stark evidence of the public health and economic disasters \nthat result from such outbreaks.\n  In a May 25, 2001, correspondence to the committee, the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture Secretary, Ann Veneman, stated:\n\n       There is an urgent need to renovate and modernize the \n     existing facilities at Ames. Grossly debilitated and \n     inadequate for animal health programs of high national \n     priority, these facilities must be modernized.\n\n  Supportive documents provided by the Secretary on May 25, 2001, \nstate:\n\n       If facilities in Ames are not modernized, both agencies \n     could lose their ability to respond to animal disease \n     emergencies.\n\n  On May 15, 2002, the Secretary again notified the committee on \nprogress of the NADL modernization, including the implementation of \nfast-track initiatives to begin construction of part of the laboratory \nin fiscal year 2003, and approval by the USDA Office of General Counsel \nof a justification for other than full and open competition to hire the \narchitectural/engineering firm.\n  In addition, on May 15, 2002, the Secretary notified the committee \nthat under the current schedule:\n\n       Construction of the animal health facility will be delayed \n     if less than $331 million is appropriated in fiscal year \n     2004.\n\n  So if we fail to provide the $50 million now in the supplemental, the \nCongress will be required to appropriate $232 million in the next 2 \nyears for this project, just to stay on the USDA's schedule. \nConstruction information from USDA has indicated that longer term \nconstruction schedules than the one now in place could result in an \nadditional $117.7 million in construction costs. So the committee has \nmade its judgment that this money is appropriate, and I hope that the \namendment will be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me be brief and try to put this \namendment in context. The President, as Commander in Chief, sent the \nCongress a request for some $28 billion of emergency funding; that is, \nfunding that we deem so critical that we are going to waive the Budget \nAct, increase the deficit, and spend Social Security money for the \npurpose of funding it, to basically try to respond to the attack on 9-\n11 and to try to prevent another attack.\n  The President made that request and the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee has now come forward with a bill that spends $4 billion more \nthan the President asked for; that underfunds his request for emergency \nitems by $10 billion. That overfunds nonemergencies by $14 billion.\n\n  There is no way on the floor of the Senate that we are going to get \nthis bill back in line with the President's request. Hopefully, that \nwill happen in conference. But the President has sent a letter saying \nhe is going to veto this bill because it spends $4 billion more than he \nasked, he does not give him $10 billion he wanted, and it gives him $14 \nbillion he did not want.\n  Obviously, it is within our capabilities and within the ingenious \nability of the Senate and Senators to make almost anything an \n``emergency.''\n  I make the following points about this building. First, the President \ndid not ask for it. The President did not include this in his emergency \nrequest. I assume he did not include it because, while he supported \nfunding it consistently in each budget, he did not believe it met the \nhigh threshold of a national crisis.\n  Second, it is not as if we are talking about money for research. We \nare talking about money for a building that will be built over an 8-\nyear period. It looks to me as if what we are seeing is an effort to \ntake this emergency bill and tack on money to speed up a project that \nwould be funded anyway.\n  Now maybe if we built this building in 7\\1/2\\ years instead of 8 \nyears there would be a benefit to come from it. I don't doubt it. That \nmight very well be. I am against animal diseases, so I might be a \nbeneficiary. Next year I might be in the goat business and there might \nbe a benefit directly in this for me.\n  But the question is, Is this such a dire emergency that it ought to \nbe funded in an emergency bill that is aimed at the threat of \nterrorism? A plausible case, even though the President did not ask for \nit, that if this were direct funding for research that we were going to \nconduct over the next 3 or 4 months, one might make a plausible case. I \ndon't believe you make a plausible case in a building that will be \nbuilt over the next 8 years, that giving it $50 million more now is an \nemergency.\n  Again, some people want to view this as Senator McCain and I are \ntrying to be tightwads and that we are trying to take out these \nprojects that have merit. I assume since we have been funding this for \na while, and intend to fund it for another period of years, that it \ndoes have merit. The question is, Is it a dire emergency? I don't \nbelieve it is.\n  Senator McCain and I could have gone on and on and on in offering \nthese little amendments. After this third\n\n[[Page S5135]]\n\none, we will have made our point. Our point is that no one cares. Our \npoint is, the fix is in, we have done this bill, and 31 people cared, \nbut the vast majority of Members of the Senate are not willing to try \nto trim this bill back.\n  I don't want to use up the time of the Senate. I want the President \nto sign an emergency bill. I personally believe we would get there \nquicker if we get it closer to what he requested. I don't understand \nwhy we want to move forward with a bill he said he would veto. Maybe it \nwill be fixed in conference.\n  After this vote, we will have made the point that the bottom line is, \nwhen it gets right down to individual programs, even in what is \nsupposed to be a dire emergency, a crisis, and even though the \nPresident did not request it, we just simply do not have the vote to \ntake these things out.\n  There is no lesson in the second kick of a mule and this is the third \nkick Senator McCain and I are experiencing. If you didn't learn \nanything from the first or second one, you are unlikely to learn \nanything from the third one. It would be our intention, I believe, that \nwe have a vote on this, and whatever happens here, happens. Then I have \na point of order if there are 60 votes for this bill, so as far as I am \nconcerned, it is off to the President and conference and see what \nhappens.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the question really before the Senate is \nwhether or not we are going to provide $50 million for the \nmodernization of the USDA national animal disease facility.\n  I have listened to the comments made by the Senator from Arizona and \nthe Senator from Texas and, of course, I listened to the statements \nmade by the distinguished chairman of our committee laying out why this \nis necessary.\n  I will not speak about any of the other amendments offered on this \nbill, but this one is of the utmost importance if we are concerned \nabout homeland security. Perhaps one of the most vulnerable parts of \nour country in terms of a terrorist threat that could have a multiplier \neffect more rapidly than anything else in affecting more people is our \nfood supply chain. That is the most vulnerable right now, and we all \nknow it.\n  The chairman of the committee has asked me as the chairman of the \nsubcommittee that funds Health and Human Services medical research and \nalso the agriculture subcommittee that is chaired by the distinguished \nSenator from Wisconsin, Mr. Kohl--and I serve on that--to focus on the \nbioterrorism threat to America. We have had hearings on it. We have \nlooked at this. The National Animal Disease Laboratory is, if not the \nkey, one of the key elements we will need to ensure the safety and \nsecurity not only of animals but the people of this country.\n  Again, I suppose some people say, sure, Harkin, you are defending it \nbecause it is in Iowa. I said some time ago that I was not responsible \nfor the National Animal Disease Lab being located in Iowa. That \npredates not my birth but it predates my coming to Congress. I can \nhonestly say that I don't care where this facility would be and I don't \ncare in which State it would be. I would be a strong supporter of this \namendment and for, as rapidly as possible, refurbishing and rebuilding \nthis National Animal Disease Laboratory, even if it were not in the \nState of Iowa. Keep in mind, this is a national laboratory. It is not \nan Iowa lab. It is a national laboratory. It is the premier veterinary, \nbiologic, and diagnostics lab anywhere in the world. But it is about 60 \nyears old. It is run down.\n  We found last year after the anthrax scare that permeated our country \nin our mail system that we had some very dangerous pathogens located in \na strip mall in Ames, IA, because the National Animal Disease Lab did \nnot have the facilities for it. That has since been taken care of but \ngives Members an idea for the need for this.\n  The National Animal Disease Lab should have been rebuilt and \nmodernized 10 or 15 years ago, probably more than that, but it was not. \nWe got a little complacent. But then when we saw what happened in \nEurope and Great Britain with hoof and mouth and BSE, it became more \nand more imperative that we not only rebuild the lab but do it very \nrapidly.\n  We started on that last year, but the events of September 11 have \ncompelled us to move even more rapidly.\n  The modernization of the national animal disease facilities is \ncritical for both homeland defense and America's defense against animal \ndiseases such as anthrax, brucellosis, salmonella, E. coli, many of \nwhich--in fact, all of which in these cases--can be transmitted to \nhumans and cause a lot of illness and death in our population.\n  So the importance of the facility is not in dispute. There are those \nwho say let's wait and do it later. We cannot wait and do it later. We \ndo not have that luxury right now because, as I said earlier, the most \nvulnerable part of our society right now, in terms of a terrorist \nthreat, is the food supply and the animal systems in our country.\n  Let me read from a USDA 2001 report to the Appropriations Committee \nto buttress that.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I am glad to yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that this $50 million in this bill \nis not designated as an emergency, it is fully paid for; is that right?\n  Mr. HARKIN. This is not an emergency; it is fully offset in the bill.\n  Mr. REID. So people talk about this not being an emergency. It is not \ndeemed to be an emergency in this bill, it is fully paid for; is that \nright?\n  Mr. HARKIN. It is fully paid for. The Senator is right. I am glad he \nmade the distinction.\n  There are those who say we don't have to do it now, we can put it off \nuntil later. The USDA said last year in its report to the \nAppropriations Committee:\n\n       USDA recognizes the swiftly increasing threats from known \n     and emerging diseases because of increased travel, trade, \n     production concentration, and pathogen resistance. A new \n     disease emerges, on average, once a year, requiring constant \n     vigilance and preparedness.\n\n  The report went on to quote the Animal Agriculture Coalition which \nnoted:\n\n       The modernization plan proposed by ARS and APHIS is crucial \n     to fulfilling the mission of USDA, specifically in ensuring a \n     safe food supply and expanding global markets for \n     agricultural products and services . . . if facilities in \n     Ames are not modernized, both agencies could lose their \n     ability to respond to animal disease emergencies. Because of \n     the safety concerns and levels of safeguards necessary to \n     work with animal pathogens, the work done in Ames is not \n     easily transferred elsewhere within USDA.\n\n  Before September 11, both the House and the Senate Appropriations \nCommittees had moved to provide an additional $40 million for the \ndesign of the facility.\n  With the tragedy of September 11, the need for modernization sharply \nincreased. The Senator from Texas mentioned before that it would be 8 \nyears before it would be done. The information we have now is if we \nmove rapidly we will have the facility done in 2006, that is 4 years \nfrom now.\n  The Senate Appropriations Committee wisely placed an additional $50 \nmillion for construction of the facility in this measure. That is \nbecause in these dangerous times we realize that America's food supply \ncould be the target of terrorism.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues some of the facts about the \nNADL and the important work it does. I think it would shed some light \non this debate.\n  The USDA Animal Health Facilities in Ames have the highest level of \nresearch capacity, expertise, and track record available in this area. \nIt also provides diagnostic expertise, technology transfer, and \ntraining in the event of an outbreak.\n  The National Veterinary Services Laboratories, in Ames, is the \nprincipal Federal diagnostic laboratory for animal diseases in the U.S. \nAs such, it is a reference point for the State and other diagnostic \nlaboratories, and provides training and testing. NVSL has recently been \ninvolved in West Nile virus diagnosis, mad cow disease diagnosis, and \nanthrax diagnosis. It has provided critical support to CDC in its \ninvestigations of human anthrax cases.\n  The Center for Veterinary Biologics in Ames has the national \nresponsibility for regulating and licensing all biologics for use in \nanimals. Their knowledge, expertise, and capacity to expedite vaccine \navailability in the event of a bioterrorist outbreak will be centrally \nimportant to provide tools for disease control. As an example, they\n\n[[Page S5136]]\n\nwere recently involved in anthrax vaccine issues during the recent \nterrorism scare.\n  Secretary Veneman recently said we do not need this money right now. \nBut, in a report she provided to Appropriations Committee in May, just \nlast month. She noted that under the lab's master plan, construction \nwould be delayed if less than $331 million is spent on the lab in \nfiscal year 2004, the start of which is less than 16 months away.\n  So the real question is, do we want to delay this in the hope that \nmaybe, somehow, terrorists will not attack our food supply chain, which \nis the most vulnerable part of our system right now?\n  I suppose if you wanted to just hope on that, maybe you could vote to \nsupport the McCain amendment. But I would not want to hope on that. \nWhen we know what to do, we know this is a national animal disease lab \nthat will respond and provide the necessary resources, first to help \nprevent any widespread terrorist attack on our food supply, especially \nour animal system of agriculture, and second to respond immediately if, \nGod forbid, anything like that should happen.\n  Providing these funds now would provide important flexibility to the \ndesign team and USDA to move forward with components of the facility at \na faster pace then in the original plan. Given the threat, sooner will \nbe much better than later.\n  And let's talk a little about the threat because those who are not \nfamiliar with agriculture might not understand its seriousness.\n  A new organism of nonnative or native origin, once introduced into \nthe United States animal populations, can initiate an uncontrollable \nepidemic due to the absence of vaccines or effective drugs, \nconcentration of animal feeding operations in the United States, and a \nlack of resistance in host animals.\n  This was evident with the introduction of West Nile virus in New York \nCity in 1999. The current situation in Great Britain with foot-and-\nmouth disease and bovine spongiform encephalopathy also underscores the \nneed to take every possible action to strengthen our animal health \ninfrastructure. That, by the way, is able to be transmitted to humans.\n  So this is a threat that we face. It is no less a threat than a \nterrorist taking a bomb on an airplane. It is no less a threat than \nterrorist activity that might involve any kind of explosives or what \nthey might try to do in that regard in the future. This threat is real. \nFrankly, our defenses are inadequate and we need to be about rebuilding \nthis laboratory and providing the kinds of resources that are needed, \nas I said, to prevent such an outbreak; second, to control it \nimmediately if something does happen; and, third, to develop the \nvaccines and responses necessary to keep it under control.\n  So again I say to my friend from Nevada, I thank him for pointing out \nthat this is fully offset. This is not an emergency. For the life of \nme, I don't understand why the President would not want to move ahead \nmore rapidly with the modernization and rebuilding of this National \nAnimal Disease Laboratory.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  It is my understanding when the Senator from Arizona completes his \nstatement, the Senator from Iowa is going to move to table the \namendment of the Senator from Arizona; is that true?\n  Mr. HARKIN. That is true, yes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I agree with 99 percent of what the \nSenator from Iowa just said.\n  Let us come back to what the amendment is all about. The amendment is \nabout $90 million that has already been provided for fiscal year 2002. \nIt is part of the regular appropriations. According to the President of \nthe United States--and I assume the Secretary of Agriculture who works \nfor him--if an additional money is needed for fiscal year 2002 or \nfiscal year 2003, there is additional money for research, inspection, \nand monitoring activities relating to bioterrorism. This is all the \nmoney that anybody believes is necessary for research, inspection, and \nmonitoring activities.\n  Again, I share the view of the Senator from Iowa about the dangers of \nbioterrorism. The Senator from Kansas, Mr. Roberts, who has been \ninvolved in this issue for many years, just approached me. I explained \nto him that this amendment in no way affects the moneys which are in \nthe bill for research, inspection, and monitoring activities. What it \nsimply does is take away money that is not needed for an 8-year \nconstruction project. That is what this money is for--construction \nwhich the administration and the President of the United States in his \nmessage to Congress say is redundant and because the money is already \npart of the regular appropriations process.\n  Again, perhaps this will accelerate construction of 8 years down to 7 \nyears. But it has no place on an emergency supplemental appropriations \nbill.\n  I would like to add that I filed 21 amendments which largely \nreflected the views put forth in the statement from the administration. \nI will not take the time of the Senate to read all of those amendments \nand objections that I have. I still feel very strongly that those \namendments filed, along with those of the Senator from Texas, are \nimportant amendments and would save tens or hundreds of millions of \ndollars of the taxpayers' money that were taken directly out of the \nSocial Security trust fund. It is now increasing the debt by leaps and \nbounds, but there is no point in taking up the time of the Senate by \nhaving votes that--as the last two did and I imagine this one would--\nget 30 or 31 Senators in support.\n  But I do think it is important that we are on record on this issue. I \nwill not waste the time of the Senate, but the American people deserve \nto know when the time comes--we are $100 billion in debt this year, and \nthe previous estimates were that we would have a surplus--that all of \nthis money is not being spent in the name of the war on terrorism.\n  There is no more need to add to unneeded moneys for the construction \nof these facilities anymore than there is an emergency in needing to \nchart the coral reefs off the State of Hawaii--nor is there needed a \nwaiver of the cost-sharing requirement for the biomass project; nor is \nthere needed $2 million to begin construction of an alcohol storage; \nnor is there a need for additional money for the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration.\n  We are going to give millions of dollars to Amtrak to repair cars \nthat were damaged more than 10 years ago in the name of an emergency \nsupplemental.\n  We are going to dig wells in the State of New Mexico--just in a \ncertain place in the State of New Mexico--when wells are running dry \nall over the Southwest, including my State. But we picked out a couple \nin the State of New Mexico that we are going to spend $3 million on in \nthe name of combating terrorism and the results of the attacks of 9-11.\n  The list goes on.\n  Professional training of Middle East journalists may be important, \nbut I would argue that it is probably not necessary on this bill.\n  We are going to have acceleration of advanced technology program \nawards; economic assistance for fishermen in the Northeast; the \nNational Water Level Observation Network. The list goes on and on. It \nis very unfortunate.\n  As I say, sooner or later, the American people, when they see this \nburgeoning deficit that looms ahead of us now in monumental \nproportions, which was not in any way contemplated 6 months ago, are \ngoing to want to know where the money went. They are going to want to \nknow where the money went. When they find out where the money went, \nwhether it be for Amtrak, or construction of apartments in Baltimore--\nwhatever they are--then I don't think they are going to be very happy \nwith our performance.\n  I have only been in Congress now for about 20 years. That is a short \ntime compared to a number of others in this body. But I have to tell \nyou, I have never seen spending like this going on, nor have other \nobservers observed this kind of incredible spending. The President of \nthe United States mentioned in his statement that Congress has already \nprovided $40 billion since September 11. Half of that money has been \nspent. The President requested an additional $27.1 billion. But that \nwasn't enough. We had to exceed that by some $4 billion--not to \nmention, as the Senator from Texas pointed out, that much of the moneys \nrequested were not\n\n[[Page S5137]]\n\ngranted and some $10 billion to $15 billion was used for purposes other \nthan that requested by the President.\n  I also hope this bill will be repaired in conference. I don't have \nvery much confidence in conferences. I think if you reviewed the record \nof what conferences do, they usually come out in the appropriations \nwith higher numbers of spending. I hope that this will be an exception \nto that general rule. I think, because of our inability to enact even \nthe smallest cuts and the smallest reductions, the President of the \nUnited States said he will veto the bill. That will hold up the whole \nprocess of these much needed funds to fight the war on terrorism.\n  I understand that the Senator from Iowa will move to table the \namendment. I will be glad to get that done so we can move on to other \nissues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, first, I wanted to say that I have a \ngreat deal of respect for the Senator from Arizona and for his keeping \nan eye on spending. I think he is to be commended for that. Sometimes \nit is a lonely job. I commend him for that.\n  I appreciate what he said. He said he agrees with 99 percent of what \nI had to say earlier. I guess the 1 percent just happens to be the time \nlimits.\n  But I will respond to my friend from Arizona by saying, first, that I \nwant to make it very clear. If there is not an emergency, we will fully \noffset it.\n  Second, it is not a project that just happened; it was considered to \nbe a project some time ago. But with September 11, and with the \nrecognition now that our food supply is extremely vulnerable, \nespecially animal agriculture more than anything else, because of the \nconcentration, because of the travel in and out of the country, and the \nability to transmit some of these very deadly kinds of pathogens that \ncan infect our animals in this country--and some of those can be \ntransmitted to humans--after September 11, it is vitally important that \nwe move ahead as aggressively as possible to rebuild this national lab.\n  Intellectually and honestly, even if it weren't in my State of Iowa, \nI would be saying the same thing the chairman of the Agriculture \nCommittee and the chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on health \nsaid. I don't care where it is. This needs to be done sooner rather \nthan later.\n  That is what the debate is all about: Do we want to make our food \nsupply safer sooner or take a chance and make it later? Do we want to \nincrease our ability to respond quickly to a terrorist attack to our \nfood supply sooner or do we want to do it later? That is what this is \nabout. By doing this, we can get this thing finished by 2006. I have a \ntimeline right here in front of me--by 2006; not 8 years, 4 years. \nQuite frankly, we ought to do everything we can to collapse the \ntimeframe as much as possible.\n  So, Madam President, I just close and ask unanimous consent that a \nletter dated today, June 6, by the Animal Agriculture Coalition, \nstrongly supporting the $50 million included in the Senate version of \nthe bill for the national animal disease facility, signed by a number \nof animal agricultural associations in the United States, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n\n                                 Animal Agriculture Coalition,\n\n                                                     June 6, 2002.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin: The undersigned members of the Animal \n     Agriculture Coalition (AAC) urge your support for the $50 \n     million in the Fiscal Year 2002 Department of Defense \n     Supplemental Appropriations bill for the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture (USDA) Animal Health Facility Modernization Plan \n     in Ames, Iowa. The complete modernization of important U.S. \n     Department of Agriculture facilities; the National Animal \n     Disease Center, the National Veterinary Services \n     Laboratories, and the Center for Veterinary Biologics, is \n     urgently needed to protect the U.S. animal agriculture \n     industries.\n       The Secretary of Agriculture issued a report on May 25 \n     assessing the scope and need of the Modernization Plan. The \n     report stated the ``urgent need to renovate and modernize the \n     existing facilities.'' The Secretary described four options \n     for modernizing the facilities. The AAC supports the \n     accelerated option of building the joint facilities in 6 \n     years at a cost of only $430 million, compared to 10-year \n     plans costing from $440 to $548 million.\n       These current facilities are antiquated, inefficient and \n     need to be replaced with a centralized modern facility, able \n     to meet the national animal agricultural needs for research, \n     diagnosis, and product testing for animal health. Only an up-\n     to-date animal health and food safety research facility will \n     ensure the safety of our national meat supply, allow the \n     United States to compete globally and have the systems in \n     place to respond quickly to disease outbreaks, such as those \n     faced in Europe.\n       We urge your support for the $50 million in the FY 2002 \n     Department of Defense Supplemental Appropriations bill for \n     the USDA Animal Health Facility Modernization Plan in Ames, \n     Iowa.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Feed Industry Association; American Horse \n           Council; American Meat Institute; American Society of \n           Animal Science; American Veterinary Medical \n           Association; Federation of Animal Science Societies; \n           Holstein Association USA, Inc.; National Association of \n           Federal Veterinarians; National Cattlemen's Beef \n           Association; National Chicken Council; National \n           Institute for Animal Agriculture; National Milk \n           Producers Federation; National Pork Producers Council; \n           National Renderers Association; United Egg Association; \n           United Egg Producers; U.S. Animal Health Association.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I now move to table the McCain amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Bingaman), \nand the Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Daschle), the Senator from \nMinnesota (Mr. Dayton) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Chair. Madam President, I see in the Chamber \nthe distinguished majority whip who has been, in a most courteous \nmanner, allocating time slots to those desiring to offer amendments. I \nwish to send an amendment to the desk, and my colleague from \nConnecticut has an amendment in the second degree.\n  I am joined by the distinguished Senator from Georgia as a cosponsor \nof the amendment. I would like to accommodate the distinguished \nmajority whip if he wishes to address the order of proceeding because \nour good friend, the Senator from Illinois, is seeking recognition.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate the Senator from Virginia yielding. I am \npleased the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Connecticut have \nworked out a procedure to dispose of this amendment one way or the \nother. It is my understanding that the amendment of the\n\n[[Page S5138]]\n\nSenator from Georgia will be called up, and the Senator from \nConnecticut will offer a second-degree amendment to that amendment. We \nshould move through this pretty quickly.\n  I would say, even though he is not on the floor, I do appreciate \nSenator McCain not offering his 15 amendments he had ready to offer, \nand he did not take a lot of time offering amendments. He stopped at \nthree, and I appreciate that. We are moving down the road.\n  Following the amendment of the Senator from Virginia, the Senator \nfrom Illinois has an amendment he will offer. That, to my knowledge, is \nthe only one we have on our side. I know Senator Graham of Florida is \ntalking about offering an amendment. We are about through on our side \nas far as amendments to offer. I am told the Senator from Texas, Mr. \nGramm, wants to make a point of order. We will be ready for that when \nthat is done.\n  My point is, we are moving through these matters quite quickly. If \neveryone continues to cooperate, there is no reason we should not be \nable to finish this bill tonight.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the majority whip, would it be appropriate, since \nthe Senator is directing traffic, to put me in the queue before Senator \nWarner and Senator Dodd so I can offer my amendment?\n  Mr. REID. We, of course, yesterday indicated that on the bill itself, \nwe would go back and forth, and the Senator from Virginia is offering \nthis amendment. It would be appropriate we go to this side and the \nSenator from Illinois would be next recognized. I will put that in the \nform of a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAHAM addressed the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. The Senator from Virginia has the floor. I have been \nyielding for the purpose of letting our distinguished leader and others \nget their points made. I think we are progressing. If I understand, the \nUC has been granted; am I correct in that, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The unanimous consent request has not been \ngranted.\n  Mr. WARNER. Is the Chair prepared to receive the vote of the Senate \non that? I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada did not have the floor \nand thus cannot propound the unanimous consent request. The Senator \nfrom Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Virginia \nyielded to me for the purposes of trying to move things through the \nSenate. Of course, he has no objection to my offering this unanimous \nconsent request. He has not lost the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, before the leader leaves the floor, if I \nmight regain the attention of our distinguished leader, I would be \nprepared to enter, not at this moment, but look at a time agreement so \nwe can move this process along. I hope we could explore that and advise \nthe Senator from Connecticut in due course because I have a series of \ncosponsors, which I am about to read. If those cosponsors desire some \ntime, I hope they will inform me very quickly. In that way, we can get \na time agreement on the principal amendment and then we can have a time \nagreement on the second-degree amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, why don't we submit the amendments and see \nhow the debate goes. We are under a time limit anyway, under cloture \nfor 2 hours, an hour for either side. There is a time limit, but \npossibly we can truncate that. Of course, the willingness of my friend \nfrom Virginia to accept the amendment would be very appealing to the \nSenator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3597\n\n (Purpose: To add the American Servicemembers' Protection Act of 2002)\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I send the amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Warner], for himself, Mr. \n     Helms, Mr. Miller, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n     Allen, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. Craig, Mr. Shelby, Mr. \n     Hagel, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. Frist, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3597.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in the Record of June 5, 2002, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3787 to Amendment No. 3597\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 3787.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for himself and \n     Mr. Leahy, proposes an amendment numbered 3787 to amendment \n     No. 3597.\n\n  The amendment follows:\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, add the following:\n       Sec. 2015. Nothing in this title shall prohibit the United \n     states from rendering assistance to international efforts to \n     bring to justice Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosovic and other \n     foreign nationals accused of genocide, war crimes or crimes \n     against humanity.\n       Sec. 2016. This title shall cease be effective at the end \n     of September 30, 2002.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3787, As Modified\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I send to the desk a modification of that \namendment which my colleague from Virginia is looking at. It is a \nslight modification of the amendment. Hopefully this modification will \nbe accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification? \nWithout objection, the amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n       At the end, add the following:\n       Sec. 2015. Nothing in this title shall prohibit the United \n     States from rendering assistance to international efforts to \n     bring to justice Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosovic, Osama \n     bin Laden, other members of Al Qaeda, leaders of Islamic \n     Jihad, and other foreign nationals accused of genocide, war \n     crimes or crimes against humanity.\n       Sec. 2016. This title shall cease be effective at the end \n     of September 30, 2002.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair. Madam President, why don't I allow my \nfriend from Virginia to make his case on his amendment, and then I will \nrespond to that by talking about what my second-degree amendment does. \nThat way we can have some order to the debate.\n  I know the Senator from Georgia wants to be heard on this as well. \nThere may be others who want to be heard. In fact, I invite my \ncolleague to look at the second-degree amendment. He might be willing \nto accept it. We can have a short debate on the amendment--it is a long \namendment, 29 pages. Nonetheless, we can focus on that amendment if the \nsecond-degree amendment is acceptable. I will let him look at the \namendment and make his case for the first-degree amendment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I think the normal way to proceed is for \nthe principal amendment to be addressed by the sponsor, myself, and the \ncosponsors, Mr. Miller, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Allen, \nMr. Hutchinson, Mr. Craig, Mr. Shelby, Mr. Hagel, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. \nFrist and Senator Sessions likewise.\n  This is a matter with which the Senate has considerable familiarity \nso I shall be brief in my remarks.\n  This amendment, the American Servicemembers' Protection Act, is \nnecessary to protect--I repeat, protect--our servicemembers and certain \nGovernment officials from prosecution--or that is potential \nprosecution--by the International Criminal Court, hereinafter referred \nto as the ICC, an institution which comes into effect on July 1, 2002, \nover the objections of the United States of America.\n  This amendment would protect U.S. military personnel and other \nelected and appointed officials of the U.S. Government against \npotential criminal prosecution by an international tribunal court to \nwhich the United States is not a party.\n  In light of our ongoing global war on terrorism, it is vital that the \nSenate adopt this important amendment to protect our brave \nservicepersons and others who are now being dispatched daily to the \nfarflung points of this globe in the battle against terrorism.\n  At the outset I would like to recognize the leadership of our \ndistinguished\n\n[[Page S5139]]\n\ncolleague, Senator Helms, who by necessity is absent today; otherwise, \nhe would be handling this. This is his legislation which I am \nprivileged and, indeed, honored to bring forth on behalf of my \ndistinguished longtime friend and colleague from North Carolina.\n  He has worked tirelessly on this issue for a number of years, and we \nall, every Member of this Senate, owe to him a debt of gratitude for \nkeeping this matter before the Senate and to be the ever watchful eye \non the steps this Senate must take to protect our servicepersons and \nothers.\n  President Bush has consistently--I repeat, consistently--opposed this \ntreaty. In May of 2002, a short time ago, President Bush notified the \nUnited Nations that the United States does not intend to become a party \nto the ICC.\n  However, since over 60 nations have ratified the treaty, the ICC will \nbe established and become effective on July 1 of this year. The \nInternational Criminal Court will have the power at that moment to \nproceed to indict, prosecute, and imprison persons anywhere in the \nworld accused by the Court of ``war crimes,'' ``crimes against \nhumanity,'' and ``genocide.''\n  In 2000 and again last year, Senator Helms introduced, and I \ncosponsored, freestanding legislation similar to this amendment. Last \nDecember, the Senate approved by a vote of 78 to 21--and I encourage my \ncolleagues to do their basic research on that vote to see how they cast \ntheir vote--a version of this legislation on the Defense appropriations \nbill. However, the provision was dropped in the conference. It is \nimportant to note that the administration supports this amendment. I \nrepeat, the President supports the amendment brought by myself and \nother colleagues, and the Departments of State, Defense, and Justice \nhave all been closely consulted and their views incorporated into this \namendment.\n  Also, an identical provision is contained in the House-passed \nsupplemental appropriations bill adopted by the House on May 24 of this \nyear.\n  I received a call from the distinguished chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Congressman Hyde, early this morning, expressing \nhis strong support of the Senate adopting favorably the amendment of \nthe Senator from Virginia.\n  This amendment seeks to protect American servicemembers, embassy \nofficials, and Government employees from the ICC, and preclude \ncooperation with the ICC so long as the Senate does not ratify the \ntreaty. This body, I repeat, will again have the opportunity, if for \nsome reason it is brought up, to ratify this treaty. However, the \namendment does allow, on a case-by-case basis, cooperation with ad hoc \ncourts provided--that is, ad hoc courts elsewhere in the world--they \nare created through the United Nations Security Council, examples being \nthose courts created by Yugoslavia and Rwanda.\n  I shall now outline key provisions of this amendment. First, no \nFederal or State entity, including courts, may cooperate with the ICC \nin law enforcement matters such as arrest and extradition, searches and \nseizures, discovery, asset seizure, financial support, transfer of \nproperty, personnel details, intelligence sharing, or otherwise render \nservices to the ICC.\n  No classified national security information can be transferred \ndirectly or indirectly to the ICC.\n  The United States must secure permanent immunity from ICC \njurisdiction for American personnel before they can participate in any \nUnited Nations peacekeeping operation or other arrangements must be in \neffect to protect U.S. peacekeepers from the jurisdiction of this \nCourt. The President may submit a national interest certification, \nhowever, effectively waiving this restriction if that is his judgment.\n  Another provision: No ICC treaty party can receive U.S. military \nassistance except for NATO countries and major non-NATO allies. The \nPresident again may waive this restriction for other countries that \nratify the treaty but then conclude agreements with the United States \nto protect our personnel from the Court. The President may also waive \nthis restriction if he determines that such waiver is important to the \nnational interest.\n  The President is authorized to use all means necessary and \nappropriate to bring about the release from captivity of U.S. or allied \npersonnel detained or imprisoned against their will by or on behalf of \nthis Court.\n  The President is urged to analyze existing alliance command \narrangements and develop plans to achieve enhanced protection from the \nICC for U.S. military personnel subject to such arrangements.\n  Let me quote from testimony given before Congress in 1998 by the lead \nU.S. negotiator on the ICC, Ambassador David Scheffer, a he explained \nthe danger posed by the Court:\n\n       Multinational peackeeping forces operating in a country \n     that has joined the treaty can be exposed to the court's \n     jurisdiction even if the country of the individual \n     peacekeeper has not joined the treaty. Thus, the treaty \n     purports to establish an arrangement whereby United States \n     armed forces operating overseas could be conceivably \n     prosecuted by the international court even if the United \n     States has not agreed to be bound by the treaty. Not only is \n     this contrary to the most fundamental principles of treaty \n     law, it could inhibit the ability of the United States to use \n     its military to meet alliance obligations and participate in \n     multinational operations, including humanitarian \n     interventions to save civilian lives.\n\n  In closing, let me also quote from a floor statement on this \nlegislation given by Representative Henry Hyde, chairman of the House \nInternational Relations Committee, on May 10, 2001:\n\n       The ICC threatens the sovereignty of our Nation. This \n     legislation has been endorsed by a who's who of the American \n     foreign policy establishment--a bipartisan group of some of \n     our wisest and most experienced exports on national security \n     matters, men and women who held high office in every \n     Administration since that of Richard Nixon. From Henry \n     Kissinger, George Shultz and Brent Scowcroft to Donald \n     Rumsfeld, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Zbigniew Brzezinski, they \n     all agree, and I quote from their letter, that This \n     legislation is an appropriate response to the threat to \n     America's sovereignty and international freedom of action \n     posed by the International Criminal Court.\n\n  This is an important amendment that deserves the support of all our \ncolleagues. We have a responsibility to protect our servicemembers and \nthe adoption of this amendment is the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. MILLER. Madam President, I rise to support the American \nServicemembers' Protection Act amendment. I am very pleased to join \nwith my distinguished colleague from Virginia in support of this \nlegislation, just as I was pleased to join with Senator Helms in \nworking with him and his staff on its behalf.\n  It might be worth noting that Senator Helms made a determined effort \nand has been making a determined effort to pass this legislation. I \nthink that is very admirable, and I would like to commend him again for \nhis leadership and wish him well.\n  I will not restate the details of this amendment since Senator Warner \nhas already articulated them so well, but I would like to make a few \nbrief points.\n  As Senator Warner mentioned, the Senate passed legislation similar to \nthis amendment as part of the 2002 Defense appropriations bill. The \nfinal vote was 78 to 21, which constituted a clear majority of this \nSenate. Unfortunately, the conference committee missed an opportunity \nto have this protective legislation in place before the International \nCriminal Court was ratified earlier this year. Now the International \nCriminal Court becomes effective on July 1, and American \nservicemembers, officials, and citizens will then potentially be \nsubject to a court to which we are not a party.\n  That is why, in a nutshell, this legislation is so important. We need \nsome degree of protection for our men and women in uniform and for \nother officials who sacrifice so much for our Nation.\n  This amendment is appropriately entitled the American Servicemembers' \nProtection Act because our war on terrorism could put our military at \nrisk of politicized prosecutions by the International Criminal Court. \nOther brave Americans who serve this country are also at risk, and this \nlegislation will protect them as well. I believe that as elected \nlawmakers we are obligated to safeguard them from this potential threat \njust as we would from threats on the battlefield. I also believe it is \nimportant for our military to know that Congress will not stand idly by \nwhile this questionable Court comes into existence.\n  Make no mistake about it, our servicemembers are very aware of the\n\n[[Page S5140]]\n\nimportance of this pending legislation. We must send them the clear \nmessage that they have our full support.\n  I can guarantee that if we do not get this done, and done soon, we \nwill look back and regret our inaction. I, for one, do not want to look \na parent in the eye and explain why their son or daughter is being \nsubjected to an international court on a trumped up charge of war \ncrimes.\n  The administration supports this amendment, as Senator Warner said, \nand so should we. Let us do the right thing again, as we did in \nDecember, and pass this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first let me explain my second-degree \namendment. In fact, I will read it because it is easier to read it than \ngo through an explanation.\n  At the end of the amendment being offered by my friend from Virginia, \nwe would add a new section that says:\n\n       Nothing in this title shall prohibit the United States from \n     rendering assistance to international efforts to bring to \n     justice Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosovic, Osama bin Laden, \n     other members of Al Queda, leaders of Islamic Jihad, and \n     other foreign nationals accused of genocide, war crimes or \n     crimes against humanity.\n       This title shall cease to be effective at the end of \n     September 30, 2002.\n\n  The reason for that last section is because presently, pending in \nconference, is this very issue, in the Department of State-Justice \nauthorization bill.\n  I do not understand why we are proceeding with this matter today. \nCurrently, we have in conference a debate going on over this very \nmatter, why should we now add it to an appropriations bill? If we pass \nthe Warner amendment, those who sit on the committees of jurisdiction \nof this matter will be excluded from the debate. This is not the place \nfor this amendment.\n  But first let me turn to my second-degree amendment. I hope my \ncolleagues might accept this second-degree amendment because I cannot \nbelieve, I do not want to believe, that if we apprehend, through the \ninternational community, people I have just mentioned on my list, that \nunder this bill we would be prohibited from assisting in the \nprosecution of Osama bin Laden, the Islamic Jihad, Saddam Hussein, and \nother members of the terrorist community in the world.\n  My amendment merely says that despite whatever else we have said, \nwhen it comes to prosecuting these people, we would participate and \nhelp, even though we are not a signatory or a participant in the \nInternational Criminal Court.\n  I hope my amendment is adopted and accepted. It seems to me, if not, \nwe will have to have a vote on this amendment as the second-degree \namendment to this bill.\n  And, now let me make a case against the underlying proposal. I remind \nmy colleagues this amendment is 29 pages long. This is a bill. This is \nnot an amendment. It deserves to be looked at.\n  Let me state what the bill does, and remember that our NATO allies \nhave signed this treaty, I read from the bill: It bars intelligence of \nlaw enforcement sharing, bars the transfer of intelligence of law \nenforcement information which specifically relates to matters under \ninvestigation by the ICC, to the ICC, or any government which is a \nparty to the Court.\n  That is stunning. We are going to bar intelligence sharing with the \nEuropean Community and our NATO allies because they have signed this?\n  Two, it restricts U.S. participation in U.S. peacekeeping. It bars \nU.S. participation and U.S. peacekeeping or peace enforcement \noperations unless the President certifies the action.\n  Third, it prohibits military assistance to any country that is a \nparty to the ICC. I have already mentioned NATO; and major non-NATO \nallies are exempted, as well as Taiwan, unless they have concluded an \nagreement to prevent proceeding against U.S. personnel.\n  Lastly, and this is one to pay attention to, this amendment \nauthorizes the President to use ``all means necessary and appropriate'' \nto free any U.S. personnel of NATO and major non-NATO allies, including \npersons working on behalf of nonallied nations detained by the ICC.\n  We now send troops to free people from the ICC? The Philippines is an \nallied nation, but there are terrorists in the Philippines. Now, in the \nfuture the UN could bring Phillipine terrorists to The Hague and try \nthem, and the United States, under this, you can make a case, would \nhave to go in and free them because they are an allied nation.\n  Do we really want to do that? Please read this bill. This goes far \nbeyond what may be a reasonable proposal of trying to guarantee the \nU.S. military personnel not be unfairly, unnecessarily, or unjustly \nprosecuted. The idea we are going to bar intelligence sharing, bar \nfinancial assistance, not going to participate in peacekeeping, and \nthat we are actually going to go in, not on behalf of just U.S. \npersonnel, but under this amendment, if adopted and agreed upon under \nthe supplemental appropriations bill, go in and free criminals when \nallied personnel are subjected to the ICC.\n\n  This is a 29-page amendment. This goes way beyond what I think my \ncolleagues believe we are trying to do. Please read this amendment. We \nare doing things quickly around here. It is a supplemental \nappropriations bill, and we are trying to rush it through.\n  If we are in conference dealing with this very same proposal or one \nlike it, which is the place to be doing it--and we wouldn't deal with \ndefense matters here or other issues. That is the reason we have a \nForeign Relations Committee. It is the reason we have a Commerce \nCommittee. It is the reason we have a Judiciary Committee.\n  So we are going to turn this matter over to the Appropriations \nCommittee and deny the other committees that have worked on this a \nchance to resolve it? That is not the way the Senate ought to be doing \nits business, in my view.\n  Let me give my colleagues a bit of history. It was the United States \nat the end of World War II, people like George Marshall and Harry \nTruman and Douglas MacArthur and Dwight Eisenhower and Arthur \nVandenberg, who stood in this Chamber and outside of it and argued for \nrebuilding Japan, rebuilding Europe with the Marshall Plan, setting up \nthe U.N. system, the World Bank, the IMF. And they did it in spite of \nhuge opposition. Only about 18 percent of the American public believed \nwe ought to have a Marshall Plan. But we had a leader with the guts of \na George Marshall and an Arthur Vandenberg and a Harry Truman who said \nit is the right thing to do. It may not be popular, but it is the right \nthing to do.\n  When you have 133 nations, and 67 others who have ratified an \ninternational court which we argued for, we ought to be trying to do \nsomething to make it work right.\n  I quickly add, if that treaty as written were before the Senate \ntoday, I would have a hard time voting for it. And my colleague from \nVirginia is right. When President Clinton signed that treaty, he \nrecommended it not be ratified as written. However, to say we should \nnot ratify it does not mean we should not work at it. And it does not \nmean you go around and penalize every one of your allies because they \nhave. We do protect service people. Each day we protect them. We have \nagreements, where our servicemen are located all over the world, on how \nthey would be handled should a matter arise, such as it has in Japan \nwith allegations of rape by servicemen. And we deal with those matters.\n  But the idea that we would walk away at the very hour we are trying \nto build support internationally for dealing with terrorists is absurd. \nI also note that we have been told flatly there will be no further ad \nhoc trials, the ICC is a U.N. system that has been set up so as not to \ngo through it on an ad hoc basis. It means for all the future efforts \nour recourse only is military action.\n  There are many who believe if we had an international criminal court \nin the early part of the 20th century, we might have been able to avoid \nsome of the tragedies that occurred. Listening to people such as Elie \nWiesel, today's proceedings are an insult to the Holocaust victims. \nElie Wiesel says this bill is an outrage, it is wrong. The people who \nwent through what they did as a result of the Nazis ought to understand \nthat we are trying to set up a system so that we might avoid that kind \nof atrocity being repeated.\n  This bill is poorly written. It is poorly crafted. It does great \ndamage to the\n\n[[Page S5141]]\n\nUnited States at a critical time when we are trying to build support in \ndealing with the issues of terrorism.\n  It should be fresh in our minds the fact that at the end of the cold \nwar, an explosion of ethnic brutality led to the necessity of creating \nad hoc tribunals in Rwanda and in Yugoslavia, but there was no means \navailable during those days to try the Idi Amins and Saddam Husseins of \nthe world and others who evade their nation's justice and avoid the \nresponse of the international community. With very few exceptions, the \nworld has stood helpless and silent in the face of such crimes against \nhumanity.\n  Finally, the world stands up. We have been begging to do it for half \na century, and they finally do it. They finally adopt the Rome treaty--\n133 countries, and 67 sign it. It goes into effect in a matter of days. \nThey are finally doing what we asked them to do for years. What do we \ndo? We walk away from it, and we threaten them. We tell them we will \nnot share intelligence. We tell them they do not get foreign aid or \nmilitary assistance, that we will deal with them in a harsh way. I \ndon't think that is wise. These are our NATO allies, European allies.\n  We should be rejoicing that finally--finally--at our insistence, with \nthe entry into force of this Court, any individual who commits \ngenocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity, will be on notice \nthat they will be prosecuted for those crimes.\n  So these thugs around the world who are doing what they are doing--we \nare finally getting the world to recognize we have to stand up to them. \nNow we are going to go after our allies and penalize them because they \nsigned the Rome treaty and because they believed that finally this may \nbe a way to proceed on some of these issues. We attack the Court and \nthose who have chosen to join it? We have nothing to fear from this \nCourt. We have nothing to fear about strengthening the rule of law.\n  That is what people such as Harry Truman, George Marshall, and \nDouglas MacArthur stood for. They believed it. We ought to be joining \nthem historically by opposing this amendment and encouraging the \nimprovement of this International Criminal Court, becoming a party to a \ngreat effort and not walking away from it.\n  I do not understand in many cases why our allies continue to support \nour efforts when we react to them as we are doing with these \namendments.\n  Last month, in fact, the Bush administration took the unprecedented \nstep of unsigning the International Criminal Court. Ironically, I \noffered an amendment at that time when we were debating the issue to \nsay I will accept this but give the President the authority to waive \nall of this. He only got 48 votes in this Chamber. This President--not \nthe past President, this President--got 48 votes in this Chamber, \ndeferring to the President to decide whether or not to invoke the \nprovisions of this particular bill. Here we are now even walking away \nfrom that.\n  I point out that when the President decided to unsign this treaty it \nwas an unprecedented act in the history of this Nation. I cannot find a \nsingle example in our more than 200 years of great history where an \nAmerican President of either party ever unsigned something like this. \nWhat does that say to the countries around the world that we get to \nsign treaties with us when they decide to unsign them in the future? \nWhat kind of precedent is that? You didn't have to ratify that treaty. \nBut for an American President to unsign it, while we encourage people \nto live up to their agreements when an American President signs them, \nis going to create real problems for us down the road, I predict.\n  On May 6, 2002, Under Secretary of State Grossman announced that the \nUnited States would make its objections to the ICC clear through \nnullification of its signature on the ICC's Rome statute and said the \nUnited States would seek agreements with other countries to remove \nAmerican servicemen.\n  Mr. Grossman also said:\n\n       Not withstanding our disagreements with the Rome treaty, \n     [again, the Rome treaty was our idea] the United States \n     respects the decisions of those nations who have chosen to \n     join the ICC.\n\n  Is this respecting these other nations, when we go down that list of \nthe provisions of this bill? Is this respecting those who have signed \nit? We bar intelligence or law enforcement sharing. We are not going to \nparticipate in U.N. peacekeeping in their countries. We are going to \nprohibit military assistance. And we threaten to use military force to \ngo in. That is respecting the decision of those who signed on to this \nagreement?\n  Ambassador Pierre Prosper, who is head of the War Crimes Office, \nsaid:\n\n       The President has made clear that what he wanted to do \n     today was make our intentions clear and to not take \n     aggressive action or wage war, if you will, against the ICC \n     or the supporters of the ICC.\n\n  Read that statement and then read this bill that you are going to \nvote on shortly and ask whether that is consistent with the \nadministration's position. Read what we do here under this amendment if \nadopted.\n  I wonder if our colleagues know the amendment that is being offered \nis called The Hague Invasion Act by our allies because of its extreme \nprovisions authorizing the use of armed force.\n  All but one other NATO nation completely and strongly backs the ICC, \nand the entire European Union has ratified the ICC and strongly \ndemarched the United States, indicating disappointment with the U.S. \nsignature nullification.\n  The amendment by the Senator from Virginia forces the United States \ninto a dangerous and counterproductive game of diplomatic chicken with \nour closest allies at a time when the alliance is already under great \nstrain, and throws salt in the open wounds of our closest allies in the \nwar on terror, and I think it is dangerous.\n  The amendment is a very complex amendment. It is 29 pages. There are \nwaivers within waivers which turn out not to be waivers at all because \nthe conditions of the waivers are unattainable in many instances. This \nis not an issue we should be considering as part of an emergency \nsupplemental appropriations bill, but as I said earlier, it truly \nbelongs in the conference where it is, with the members of the \ncommittees of jurisdiction debating it. This matter is in that \nconference. That is the place it ought to be considered.\n  The Warner amendment would prevent the United States from \nparticipating in peacekeeping or peacemaking activities pursuant to the \nUnited Nations in countries that happen to be members of the Court. \nThere is a significant amount of assistance in this bill for Colombia \non which we are voting here. I wonder if our colleagues know that \nColombia ratified this treaty on June 5 and is now a party with the \nCourt. President Pastrana said ratification with the ICC would send a \nmessage to the FARC, the revolutionary group in Colombia, that it would \nbe held accountable for the murder of 119 civilians who took refuge in \na church in that country. The Warner amendment would prevent the \nPresident from sharing national security information with a court or \nany country which is a party to the Court, absent assurance the \ninformation would not go directly or indirectly to the Court.\n  I don't think you could ever give that assurance. If faced with an \neffort to prosecute the FARC and Colombian request for assistance to go \nafter the people who murdered those 119 innocent civilians, under the \nprovisions of this amendment, if adopted, the United States would \nrefuse cooperation.\n  I think that is outrageous, I think that is sad, if it is adopted.\n  Mr. WARNER. Will the Senator yield for a quick question? Is there not \nincorporated in the amendment of the Senator from Virginia sufficient \nPresidential waiver to take care of every point the Senator has made?\n  Mr. DODD. I say to my colleague, you have to give assurance that none \nof this information either indirectly or directly would go to the Court \nin allowing for the prosecution of those people. I don't think the \nPresident could get that assurance. If you are going to be prosecuted \nin the Court and you are going to share information with the country \nthat wants them prosecuted, how can you give a waiver doing that? That \nis what I mean about this bill.\n  Mr. WARNER. Why would the Secretary of Defense have indicated----\n\n  Mr. DODD. It is my time. I will be finished in a minute, and then I \nwill give my colleague all the time.\n  Mr. President, may I finish?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n[[Page S5142]]\n\n  Mr. DODD. This is outrageous, this amendment. I urge my colleagues to \nread this. Read this, please, what we are about to do, here.\n  This has waivers within waivers. It is 29 pages of complex \ncontradictory provisions, in my view, that make it virtually impossible \nin many instances for any kind of waivers to be applied here. Further, \nthe amendment would also prohibit the United States from providing \nmilitary assistance to many countries that are parties to the Court, \nincluding such countries as Colombia, unless the President first takes \nthe step of waiving the provisions of that particular provision.\n  I would say what is going to happen, if our allies respond to this \nprohibition by barring the sharing of information they may have, which \nwe have a strong national security interest in having--we are sort of \nprovoking this kind of tit for tat, back and forth.\n  I don't believe that is the way to go. There are ways of improving \nthis treaty. This is not the way. This is about politics and votes in \nhere. This is not about making this a stronger agreement and doing \nsomething that would make our Nation proud.\n  I can only imagine what would have happened if this Senate had been \noperating in the days after the end of World War II, when only a few of \nAmericans supported the Marshall Plan, when it wasn't popular to do so, \nusing taxpayer money to rebuild Japan and rebuild Europe. In a sense, \nthat is what we are trying to do here; it is to rebuild an \ninternational community to deal with the issues of justice in the \nworld. We are now going to walk away from it entirely.\n  It has been further said you can set up ad hoc courts. No, you can't. \nThe U.N. system has established the ICC. That is it. Not ad hoc courts. \nThe ad hoc courts worked when there was no ICC. Now in the \nestablishment of an ICC, whether we like it or not, it is going to go \ninto effect in July. That is a fact. So the ad hoc courts are not going \nto be set up.\n  So when we go after these other people, or try to anyway, the only \nplace you can bring them is to the ICC. But by not being a part of \nthat, we take ourselves out of the game and leave ourselves only the \noption of militarily going after these people.\n  That may be a viable option if nothing else works, but I don't think \nyou want to exclude the option of taking these people to court under \nthe rule of law.\n  The ICC is now the only game in town. The bottom line is that the \nSecurity Council is unlikely to approve any new ad hoc tribunals when \nonce the ICC is established. When international efforts attempt to \nbring Saddam Hussein or Osama bin Laden or the Islamic Jihad to \njustice, what is the United States going to be doing? What about slave \ntraders and war criminals around the globe?\n  We will exclude ourselves from assisting in those efforts. That is \nwhat this amendment says. We will not be a party to it.\n  The Warner amendment gives the administration a war powers blank \ncheck. Section 3008 of the Warner amendment authorizes ``use all means \nnecessary and appropriate'' just as the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution \nauthorized all necessary means to release persons arrested by the ICC.\n  This is a huge giveaway of congressional war powers authority.\n  Do we really want to be giving open-ended authority to the executive \nbranch to put American servicemembers at odds with the forces of some \nour closest allies? Are we prepared to send troops, in a sense, to The \nHague? This extraordinary grant of authority in section 3008 just \ndoesn't apply to U.S. servicemen. It extends ``to any person working on \nbehalf of'' many foreign nations, including Egypt, Argentina, Jordan, \nSouth Korea, and the like. That goes way beyond what we are being told \nthis amendment accomplishes.\n  This amendment breaks faith with the Holocaust victims. Elie Weisel \nhas warned that this bill ``would erase the legacy of U.S. leadership \non international justice.'' Further, he said, for the memory of the \nvictims of the genocide and the war crimes, this bill must be defeated. \nThis comes from Elie Weisel. These are the people we ought to be \nlistening to when it comes to establishing an international criminal \njustice court to deal with crimes against humanity and genocide.\n  This amendment is bad for Israel. Israel signed the Rome Treaty, \nwhich is supported by the American Jewish Committee and the Religious \nAction Center to Reform Judaism. Most of Israel's concerns have already \nbeen favorably resolved through negotiations. But Israel is going to \nneed the United States as a fully engaged partner in future \nnegotiations over the definition of aggression and other issues. No \nmatter what one thinks of the ICC, it is clear that U.S. disengagement \nfrom the Court is bad for our ally in the Middle East at a critical \ntime, the State of Israel.\n  For all those reasons, I hope the second-degree amendment I have \noffered will be agreed to. That would at least provide us an \nopportunity to go after the people I have mentioned should they be \napprehended by the Court, and we could be a part of pursuing them.\n  It seems to me that in the absence of that we are going to look \nrather ridiculous in making a claim about seeking support for \nantiterrorism.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield for a question, if \nthe amendment of the Senator from Connecticut is agreed to, the Warner \namendment still stands. Will the Senator explain to the Senate the \nfinality of that, if both amendments are agreed to by the Senate?\n  Mr. DODD. If the Warner amendment is agreed to, I still have a \nproblem with it. However, I will read my amendment again.\n  It says:\n\n       Nothing in this title would prohibit the United States from \n     rendering assistance to the international efforts to bring to \n     justice Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosovic, Osama bin Laden, \n     and other members of Al Qaeda, leaders of Islamic Jihad, and \n     other foreign nationals accused of genocide, war crimes or \n     crimes against humanity.\n\n  Mr. REID. I also ask my friend, if both amendments are agreed to, the \nmatter of the Senator from Virginia would still be before the body, and \nhe could still go forward in the manner he anticipated with the \nexception that the Senator from Connecticut added. Is that right?\n\n  Mr. DODD. That is correct.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I wasn't able to hear the distinguished \nleader.\n  Mr. DODD. If I may reclaim the floor--and I will finish--the question \nof the Senator from Nevada was if my second-degree amendment is adopted \nas part of the Warner underlying amendment, does the Warner amendment \ngo forward?\n  I want to be honest with my colleagues. I think it is a better \namendment; that is, the Warner amendment is a better amendment if my \nadaptation is adopted as a second-degree amendment. Yet, I will still \nhave a problem with his amendment for the reasons I have outlined \nbeyond the adoption of it. It goes too far.\n  I will tell my colleagues that they could vote for the Warner \namendment with at least some comfort here should my second-degree pass.\n  Can you imagine the irony of this bill if my amendment is not \nadopted? If someone catches bin Laden and brings him to the \nInternational Criminal Court, the adoption of this amendment would \nprohibit us from assisting in that prosecution. I can't believe that we \nwould want on record that kind of a judgment.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question on \nthat point? Is there any way we can have a colloquy so we can inform \nthe Senate of what is taking place?\n  Mr. DODD. I want to make my point about this, and then I will be \nhappy to engage my friend in a colloquy.\n  Mr. WARNER. I am exhausted from listening.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from Virginia has a 29-page amendment. I didn't \nread the whole thing. If I did, that could take more time than my \nremarks. This is a bill; this isn't an amendment. I have an amendment. \nThis is a bill of 29 pages. It goes on and on. But read the bill. Don't \ncome over with this nice title, the American Servicemembers' Protection \nAct. How am I going to vote against that?\n  Read it, and then ask yourself whether or not you really want to be \nin a situation where ironically, in the same bill we are voting for aid \nto Colombia, who is a member of the ICC.\n  Under the provisions of this, barring some waiver, maybe as long as \nColombia didn't share any information either\n\n[[Page S5143]]\n\ndirectly or indirectly with the ICC, we then would have to cut off the \naid to them.\n  Remember that this proposal is presently in conference. What do you \nhave a Foreign Relations Committee for? What do you have a Commerce \nCommittee for? What do you have a Judiciary Committee for? If we are \njust going to adopt things on the appropriations bill, why not get rid \nof the authorizing committees?\n  What is the point? If I have to watch things being thrown on a \nsupplemental appropriations bill, why do we spend the hours in \ncommittee trying to work these things out if we come in and just wipe \nit out and adopt it on a supplemental appropriations bill, when \nnegotiators have no knowledge of the work that has gone into drafting \nthe language that is sitting in a conference, trying to resolve it?\n  Unless you are on the Appropriations Committee, you have nothing to \ndo with this stuff. Why bring up all of the authorizing controversies \nand throw them on here--to satisfy Tom Delay and the House leadership \nwho want to jam this thing through? That is what they want to do. There \nis no mistake about it.\n  This isn't a serious debate about where the United States ought to be \non a critical issue facing our country at a time when we were attacked, \nonly 9 months ago, by terrorists.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I have listened very carefully in a very \nquiet and dispassionate way to my friend from Connecticut. I have \nstudied his amendment. I have an observation, and then a question to \nput to my friend.\n  The first is, his amendment has two sections: Section 2015, and \nsection 2015 relates to any prohibition of the United States rendering \nassistance to international efforts to bring to justice Hussein, \nMilosevic, bin Laden, and so forth.\n  I say to by good friend that if you will look at my amendment, we \nhave a provision that begins actually on page 8, and I shall read it: \nAuthority to waive sections, and so and so, with respect to an \ninvestigation or prosecution of a named individual, and the President \nis authorized to waive the prohibitions and requirements of section \n3004 and 3006 to the agreed section prohibitions, and so forth.\n  This was carefully crafted in consultation with the Department of \nState to do precisely what the Senator from Connecticut desires to do \nin section 2015.\n  I think our amendment has taken care of section 2015.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WARNER. I yield only for the purpose of a response to my \nquestion.\n  Mr. DODD. You have to understand that, if you go on to page 9, line \n14, a waiver pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of the prohibitions and \nrequirements of section 3005 and 3007, and I refer back to page 6, 3005 \nand 3007.\n  There it says, ``authority to initially'' waive these sections. It \nsays, ``notifies the appropriate congressional committees''; and \n``determines and reports to the appropriate congressional committees \nthat the International Criminal Court has entered into a binding \nagreement.''\n  You have to get a waiver. You have to go back to the earlier waiver, \nand you have to get agreement by the ICC.\n  That is what I mean by this.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, in order to save the Senate time, I think \nthe amendment cares for the concerns that the Senator from Connecticut \nhas about 2015. But I make an offer to the Senator from Connecticut \nthat I amend my amendment to incorporate verbatim his section 2015. \nWould he have any objection if I put it in? I think that would \nalleviate his concerns. Then we have but one provision left in his \namendment to consider.\n  Mr. DODD. The only thing, 2016----\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am directing a question to 2015. Let us \nstay on that for a minute.\n  Mr. DODD. I want to respond as well. I appreciate that. The reason \n2016 is there is to say at least give the authorizers a chance to \ncomplete our work.\n  Mr. WARNER. That is a separate argument. Could we address them one at \na time? I put to my colleague the question: Would he have an objection \nif the Senator from Virginia sought to amend his amendment to include \nverbatim the provisions of the Senator designated as 2015?\n  Mr. DODD. My point is--I appreciate that--I want to also talk about \n2016.\n  Mr. WARNER. Fine. Can we do them seriatim?\n  Mr. DODD. No. Let's do them together.\n  Mr. WARNER. Well, we are not, Mr. President. The question is not: May \nI amend it to include 2016?\n  Mr. DODD. Section 2015----\n  Mr. WARNER. To facilitate the Senate moving ahead on this matter and \non the bill--you have raised this question--I am prepared to amend my \namendment to include 2015.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. Now, Mr. President, I formally put to the Senate the \nunanimous consent request that the Senator from Virginia may modify his \namendment to include verbatim section 2015 of the second-degree \namendment offered by the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the second part of my second-degree \namendment is critically important because it gives us a chance to \ncomplete our work as authorizers. By not including this--and my friend \nfrom Virginia has been candid enough to say they would not accept that \nas part of this agreement--then I, reluctantly, have to object to this \nunanimous consent request.\n  I am prepared to vote on the second-degree amendment, that we just \nvote on it. Members can decide whether or not they think this provision \nought to be a part of this amendment or not. But as an authorizer who \nhas worked hard at this, along with others--we are in conference--we \nhave a chance to come out of a committee with a product for which the \nSenate can be proud. I hope that is the case. To just sort of disregard \nthat and throw this on the appropriations bill is something I \nreluctantly have to object to.\n  So I urge we just have a vote on this second-degree amendment and \ncomplete the debate here and allow us to go to the Durbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia moves to table \nthe second-degree amendment and asks for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I share the serious concerns of the sponsors \nof this amendment about the potential for the International Criminal \nCourt to be used as a political weapon against our members of the Armed \nForces. This court, a permanent, international institution, is \nunprecedented in history. The International Criminal Court holds the \npower to indict and try individuals for war crimes, even if the person \nis a citizen of a country that is not a signatory to the treaty that \ncreates the Court. It is not difficult to see that rogue states may \nseek to indict Americans on frivolous charges simply as a means to \ngrind a political axe.\n  On May 6, 2002, the Bush administration renounced the United States' \nsignature on the Treaty of Rome, which creates the International \nCriminal Court. But because the treaty has been ratified by 60 other \ncountries, the Court will come into existence on July 1. Proponents of \nthis amendment are correct in saying that the United States should take \nsome action to protect our military personnel who serve abroad from \nunjustified prosecution by the Court.\n  But the amendment proposed to the supplemental appropriations bill \ngoes beyond protecting the members of our Armed Forces. It also \nauthorizes the President to ``use all means necessary\n\n[[Page S5144]]\n\nand appropriate'' to bring about the release of a ``covered person'' \nthat is being held for trial before the International Criminal Court.\n  Who is a ``covered person''? The amendment defines him to be an \nAmerican, or a foreign national of one of our allies. Is Congress \nreally prepared to issue a blanket authorization to allow the President \nto use ``all means necessary'' to rescue from prosecution a person from \ncounties like Argentina, Jordan, or Egypt?\n  There is no way that we could predict the circumstances under which a \nperson from one of these countries could be accused of war crimes. But \nthis amendment gives the President a congressional authorization to use \nour military to compel the release of a prisoner of the International \nCriminal Court before Congress even has a chance to examine if the use \nof force is justified. This is a dangerous and unwise delegation of the \nconstitutional powers of the legislative branch.\n  I must also question why this amendment is being proposed to the \nsupplemental appropriations bill. This very same amendment is included \nin the State Department authorization bill passed by the House of \nRepresentatives. This provision is now being deliberated in a \nconference committee. Further consideration of legislation relating to \nthe International Criminal Court would best be left to the conferees \nfrom committees of jurisdiction, including the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, rather than the members of the Appropriations Committee who \nwill be appointed to the conference on the supplemental appropriations \nbill.\n  To that end, I support the Dodd-Leahy amendment, which will limit the \nduration of the American Servicemembers' Protection Act to fiscal year \n2002 only. If the proponents of the American Servicemembers' Protection \nAct believe that there is an urgent need to pass this legislation, then \nthere should be no problem in accepting the Senators' amendment. The \nDodd-Leahy amendment would provide for a stopgap protection against the \nInternational Criminal Court until such time as the conferees to the \nState Department authorization bill complete their work. This is a \nreasonable limit to an intrusion into an issue that is being debated in \na conference committee.\n  While we must seek to preserve the sovereignty of the United States \nby protecting our citizens against prosecution in front of the \nInternational Criminal Court, a body which will operate without any \nchecks or balances from any branch of our government, this amendment \ngoes too far in delegating the constitutional responsibilities of \nCongress over authorizing the use of force. Furthermore, the \nsupplemental appropriations bill is not an appropriate legislative \nvehicle for addressing this issue. I urge my colleagues to support the \nDodd-Leahy amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding the Senator from Virginia has moved \nto table the Dodd amendment, and the yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Bingaman), \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Daschle) and the Senator from \nMinnesota (Mr. Dayton), are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms), and the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Campbell), are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Are there any other \nSenators in the Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 55, nays 40, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 139 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--55\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lincoln\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                                NAYS--40\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Corzine\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Bingaman\n     Campbell\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Helms\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. WARNER.

The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n                   Modification to Amendment No. 3597\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, at this time, the Senator from Virginia \nrenews his unanimous consent request to incorporate verbatim--and I do \nso on behalf of my distinguished colleague and cosponsor from Georgia, \nMr. Miller--to offer verbatim section 2015 of the second-degree \namendment offered by the Senator from Connecticut.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The modification is as follows:\n       At the end, add the following:\n       Sec. 3015. Nothing in this title shall prohibit the United \n     States from rendering assistance to international efforts to \n     bring to justice Saddam Hussein, Slobodan Milosovic, Osama \n     bin Laden, other members of Al Qaeda, leaders of Islamic \n     Jihad, and other foreign nationals accused of genocide, war \n     crimes or crimes against humanity.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's offer, and I did \nnot object. I want to make clear to people why we ended up voting on \nthe second-degree amendment.\n  There is in Congress, on the State-Justice authorization bill, a \nconference on this very matter. Many of us have spent weeks trying to \nget the House to join us to resolve this matter. They have refused to \nmeet. We included language that would force the House to meet with us \nor, under the supplemental, this language would die.\n  There is still a Defense appropriations bill and there is still a \nforeign operations appropriations bill to which this language can be \nadded. It is sad in a way that authorizers cannot meet on the \nauthorizing track to resolve policy matters; that policy matters have \nto be included on a supplemental appropriations bill. It is regrettable \nthat efforts are not made to force the authorizers to meet and work.\n  Maybe this Senate is so collapsed that there is no longer any need to \nauthorize. Every member of any authorizing committee: Henceforth know \nthat when similar provisions come up, I will join with my friend from \nVirginia and let it be done on appropriations bills, not authorizing \nbills.\n  I do not know why I serve on authorizing committees. I am half \ntempted to get off them. I do not know why I spend all these hours \nworking on these matters and staff working on these matters to have it \nincluded in a supplemental appropriations bill. Why does anyone serve \non these committees at all?\n  We are about to adopt a very delicate and important matter--29 \npages--which I promise no one here has read. There are not two people \nwho have read it. They are going to vote on it because it has a nice \ntitle.\n  It looks good in a 30-second spot. It is dangerous, and it is wrong. \nIt is terrible the Senate has come to this.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Mr. President, I will vote against the Warner amendment. \nLet\n\n[[Page S5145]]\n\nme state at the outset my view on several issues that this amendment \nraises.\n  First, I want to make clear that I do not support the International \nCriminal Court as it is constituted. The Rome Statute which creates the \nCourt is flawed, and it would be a mistake for the United States to \nbecome a party to the Court under the Statute. The President made clear \nlast month that the United States will not do so.\n  I do support protecting American servicemen and women. The Court \nstatute purports to provide jurisdiction over individuals from nations \nwhich have not become party to it. That is wrong as a matter of treaty \nlaw and of basic fairness. We can and must protect our servicemen from \nthe jurisdiction of this tribunal. I believe the President and \nSecretary Rumsfeld will do what is necessary to do so. We do not need \nthis amendment to allow a President to use ``a necessary force'' to \nforce any American servicemen from the custody of any international \ncourt.\n  I do not want to harm U.S. interest overseas. Many of our closest \nallies in Europe are strong supporters of this Court. This legislation \nwill further complicate our relationship with those friends. Moreover, \nit takes aim at allies outside of Europe with punitive measures.\n  Finally, I do not, as a constitutional matter, want to give carte \nblanche to any President to rescue even American individuals detained \nby the Court who are not citizens.\n  The amendment contains a sweeping authorization to the President to \nuse force to rescue not only Americans detained by the International \nCriminal Court, but also nationals of several allied countries.\n  The authority to rescue U.S. nationals, I submit, is probably \nunnecessary: most scholars would agree that the President has the \nauthority to rescue Americans abroad who are in serious danger from a \nforeign power or circumstance. If an American is detained by the Court, \nthe President will surely have the support of the Congress to take \nwhatever action necessary to rescue that servicemember.\n  The authority to rescue foreign nationals, such as an accused war \ncriminal from Australia or Egypt, is unwise. As a constitutional \nmatter, I am unwilling to give the President such a blank check to \ninvade the Netherlands--where this Court will be located. Only the \nCongress has the power to authorize such use of force, and we should \nnot do so in advance, without knowing all the circumstances.\n  I am also concerned about a provision which bars military assistance \nto countries which join the Court. This would apply, as the Senator \nfrom Connecticut noted, to our assistance to Colombia, a country we \nhave been strongly supporting with substantial military assistance. \nThis restriction may be waived on two alternative grounds, but I ask my \ncolleagues: why would we even consider cutting off aid to our ally in \nColombia because it made the sovereign choice to join the International \nCriminal Court?\n  This provision does not apply to our NATO partners, and certain non-\nNATO allies like Egypt, Israel and Japan. How can we tell our NATO \nallies or others that they are free to join the Court without fearing \nan aid restriction, but then turn around and tell other countries that \nthey could face penalties if they join the Court?\n  This provision is directly contrary to the position of the Bush \nAdministration. When the Administration announced its position on the \nInternational Criminal Court last month, Under Secretary of State Marc \nGrossman made it clear that the United States was going to ``respect \nthe decision of those nations who have chosen to join the ICC.'' This \nprovision to cut off military aid would violate that principle.\n  My bottom line is this: we should not join the Court as it is \ncurrently constituted. Its provisions purporting to extend jurisdiction \nto non-parties and the inclusion in the Statute of the crime of \naggression and sufficient reason to do so.\n  But this legislation is not necessary to protect our interests. \nPresident Bush has adequate powers to do that. It adds very little to \nthe powers he now possesses. But it could complicate our foreign policy \nwith friends in Europe and elsewhere. And it gives future Presidents a \nblank check to rescue foreign nationals detained by the Court. I think \nthat is a mistake, and therefore will vote no.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, as you know, on December 31, 2000, \nformer President Clinton signed the UN's Rome Statute that would \nobligate the United States to comply with the International Criminal \nCourt. I was disappointed in this action, and until President Bush \nformally notified the United Nations on May 6 that the U.S. would not \nbecome a party to the Rome Statute, I was prepared to fight the \nratification of this treaty if it was brought before the United States \nSenate.\n  The ICC contains fundamental flaws that we cannot ignore and \njeopardizes our service and diplomatic personnel. Whether conducting \nengagement activities, support operations, stability operations or \ncombat operations, we must ensure the protection of our servicemembers \nand officials of the United States involved in such matters as \nresponding to acts of terrorism, preventing the proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction, and deterring aggression. Many of these \nissues and the official actions taken by servicemembers and others \ninvolve protection of the national interests of the United States. We \nshould have every right to pursue those interests as a sovereign \nNation.\n  In order to accomplish this, we must pass the American \nServicemembers' Protection Act, ASPA, which has been offered as an \namendment to the pending bill by the ranking member of the Senate Armed \nServices Committee, Senator John Warner. I would like to commend my \ncolleague for his initiative and leadership on this issue. As he and \nothers would agree, failure to pass this Act will have a chilling \neffect on our ongoing commitments to peace, democracy and prosperity \nthroughout the world.\n  This amendment is necessary because U.S. withdrawal from the treaty, \nwhich we have already done, is not enough. Other countries may still \nattempt to force the United States to comply with the treaty's \nprovisions. As you may know, the treaty will go into effect on July 1 \nbecause the requisite number of countries have ratified the Rome \nStatute, notwithstanding our withdrawal from the treaty. What this \nmeans is that the International Criminal Court could exercise \njurisdiction over action crimes committed in the territory of a state \nparty, including those by citizens and servicemen of non-parties.\n  Thus, under Article 12 of the Rome Statute, the court would have \njurisdiction for enumerated crimes alleged to have been committed by \nU.S. citizens, including the U.S. servicemembers, in a country like \nAfghanistan. Clearly this is an important protection for our soldiers \ncurrently engaged in missions in that country.\n  Additionally, Article 5 allows parties to the treaty to define vague \ncrimes like ``aggression,'' but Article 121 also allows parties to the \ntreaty to opt-out of certain crimes. Article 121 does not afford that \nsame ``opt-out'' right to non-parties, including the United States. As \na result, U.S. servicemen and diplomats as well as other U.S. citizens \ncould be charged, tried, and jailed for crimes the U.S. had no part in \ndefining and crimes that parties to the threaties themselves are not \nbound by.\n\n  The American Servicemembers' Protection Act, ASPA seeks to protect \nthe United States from these coercive elements of the treaty, and \nprecludes cooperation with the International Criminal Court so long as \nthe United States is not a Rome Statute party. ASPA still permits \ncooperation with ad hoc courts created through the UN Security Council, \nsuch as the Yugoslav and Rwanda tribunals, and prosecution of future \nwar criminals. Such a tribunal created by the Security council at least \nprovides the U.S. with a veto option where we have a say in its mandate \nand are therefore about to ensure that war criminals will not escape \njustice.\n  From Sudan to China, Eastern Europe to South Asia, many of my \ncolleagues and I have devoted considerable time in the Senate to \nprotecting human right, democracy, and religious freedom. This treaty \nwould undermine the U.S. ability to promote and protect the ideals that \nwe have fought for: the values of democracy, freedom and open societies \nfor the people of the world.\n\n[[Page S5146]]\n\n  While this treaty may be well-intentioned, its vague language gives \nUN officials unchecked authority, and it imposes an unbearable burden \nupon the U.S.\n  This country's commitment to pursuing accountability for war crimes, \ngenocide and crimes against humanity is an important part of our \nforeign policy objectives and one that serves as a model for others. It \nwas through U.S. leadership that Nazi war crimes were prosecuted. It \nwas through U.S. leadership that Balkan war criminals in Bosnia-\nHerzegovina and Kosovo were brought to justice. If my fellow members \nwant to maintain America's ability to keep its international \ncommitments abroad, then we must protect our soldiers and our civilian \nleaders by passing the American Servicemembers' Protection Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Warner \namendment, but before the vote is taken, I understand there is at least \none colleague, my colleague from Virginia, who would like to have 5 \nminutes. Are there others who wish to indicate to the managers a desire \nto speak before that vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. WARNER. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. For the information of Senators, Senator Allen from \nVirginia wishes to speak on this underlying amendment for 5 minutes. I \ndo not know of anyone else who wants to speak on this amendment. We \nwill have a vote in the next few minutes on the underlying amendment.\n  Following that, next in order, by virtue of a unanimous consent \nagreement, is Senator Durbin. He has indicated he will speak for \nperhaps half an hour. There may be others who wish to speak. We will \nhave a vote sometime after that. We are going to have a series of votes \nin the near future. Members should remain close to the Chamber because \nwe are moving pretty well. It is yet to be seen whether we can complete \nour work tonight.\n  I will say to my friend from Connecticut, this was not in the Senate \nbill that is before this body. I just want to make sure the \nAppropriations Committee in the Senate is not blamed. This was put in \non an amendment from the floor. The Appropriations Committee did not do \nit.\n  I say to my friend, this was not put in by any member of the \nAppropriations Committee. It was put in by an authorizer. I say to all \nSenators, the Senator from Connecticut is an exemplary Senator who does \na great job on every authorizing committee he is on, but I want to say \ndo not blame the Appropriations Committee, because it did not put this \nmatter in the bill. It was offered separate and apart.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia has the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WARNER. Were the yeas and nays ordered?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator yield to the Senator?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Has the Dodd amendment, which reads, ``Nothing in this \ntitle shall prohibit the United States from rendering assistance to \ninternational efforts to bring to justice Saddam Hussein, Slobodan \nMilosovic, Osama bin Laden, and other leaders of al-Qaida, leaders of \nIslamic Jihad, and other foreign nationals accused of genocide, war \ncrimes or crimes against humanity,'' been made a part of what we are \nabout to vote on?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has been modified.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I assure the Senator it is. The Senator \nfrom Virginia made two attempts, failed on the first attempt for the \nvote, but succeeded on the second attempt just a minute or two ago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand the Senator from Virginia put \nforth a unanimous consent agreement that there would be a vote \nfollowing 5 minutes from the other Senator from Virginia. Is that \nright?\n  Mr. WARNER. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, the request was not made as a unanimous \nconsent.\n  Mr. REID. Then I would propound that as a unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment that my \ngood friend, Senator Warner of Virginia, has offered. I am a cosponsor \nof this act and a cosponsor of this amendment, along with my friend, \nSenator Miller of Georgia. I continue to believe that the International \nCriminal Court poses a threat to the sovereignty of the United States \nand the individual freedoms of America.\n  Americans do care about the rest of the world. The rest of the world, \nthough, can make their own decisions. The Europeans, if they want to \nmerge their currencies, can do so. It does not mean we have to put our \ndollar in with their currency. We have a right to control our own \ndestiny and the sovereignty and fair justice administered in our \ncountry.\n  This International Criminal Court would have the jurisdiction to \npunish individual American officials for foreign policy and military \nactions of the U.S. Government. The laws and the rules of this treaty \ndo not offer fair and equal justice, nor do they offer the due process \nrights guaranteed and protected under our Bill of Rights.\n  The mechanism used to introduce and try cases in this Court is an \nindependent prosecutor, who would be one who is not really accountable \nbut would be given the autonomy to enforce justice as that prosecutor \nsees fit. Placing such power in the hands of one individual is not only \nill advised, it runs contrary to the very foundation of justice upon \nwhich our country was built upon.\n  For example, if the international prosecutor believes a U.S. court's \ndecision was inadequate or incorrect, then this prosecutor is \nauthorized to indict the alleged human rights abuser and demand a new \ntrial in the International Criminal Court. This is all contrary to the \nlaws of the constitutions of our States and the Constitution of our \ncountry for the last 225 years. Elected officials ought to protect and \nuphold our rights. In reality, this ICC, or Rome Treaty, would erect an \ninstitution superior to our courts in this country and in our States.\n\n  In considering whether to enact an amendment that would protect \nAmericans from this international treaty, we need to consider the \nvalues and goals of the international prosecutors and the international \njudges. It is unlikely persons given such authority will hold the same \nvalues as the United States. Consider the fact that the Rome Treaty was \nsigned by Iran, Iraq, Sudan, and Syria, among others. All of these \nnations have extremely questionable records when it comes to justice, \ndue process, and equality. I believe we should consider the parties \ninvolved when considering any international treaty.\n  Senator Dodd mentioned Elie Wiesel and Israel. Israel mostly has its \ntroops focused in its homeland. The United States has its spread across \nthe world.\n  The amendment of Senator Warner, the American Servicemembers' \nProtection Act, is supported by the following organizations: The \nNational Guard Association of the United States, the Air Force \nSergeants Association, the Army Aviation Association of America, the \nAssociation of the U.S. Army, the National Military Family Association, \nEnlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States, Fleet \nReserve Association, the Gold Star Wives of America, Jewish War \nVeterans of the USA, the Marine Corps League, the Marine Corps Reserve \nOfficers Association, the Military Order of the Purple Heart, the Navy \nLeague of the United States, the Retired Officers Association, the \nUnited Armed Forces Association, the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the \nUnited States, and others.\n  I believe the former President, Mr. Clinton, made a serious mistake \nwhen he signed the Rome Treaty in the last days of his administration. \nPresident Bush wisely rejected the Rome Treaty\n\n[[Page S5147]]\n\nand notified the United Nations that the United States would not be \nratifying or participating in the accord. Unfortunately, the number of \nratifying nations is rising and the ICC will come into existence on \nJuly 1 of this year. It is why we must pass this amendment.\n  We are all working in unity to fight corruption, hatred, and \ndictatorships around the world. With the amendment that has been added, \nour position is clear and we will fight war criminals.\n  In closing, I will quote Mr. Jefferson when he stated:\n\n       It is the right of every nation to prohibit acts of \n     sovereignty from being exercised by any other within its \n     limits . . .\n\n  I urge my colleagues to exercise that right, protect our sovereignty \nand our men and women in the military in supporting this amendment.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n3597, as modified.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Bingaman), \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Daschle), and the Senator from \nMinnesota (Mr. Dayton) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms), the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Campbell), and the Senator from \nOhio (Mr. Voinovich) are necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from Ohio \n(Mr. Voinovich) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIllinois is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3729\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3729, which was \npreviously filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3729.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n       On page 55, beginning on line 13, strike ``$100,000,000'' \n     and all that follows through ``Provided, '' on line 17 and \n     insert the following: ``500,000,000, to remain available \n     until March 31, 2003, which may be made available as a United \n     States contribution to the Global Fund to combat AIDS, \n     Tuberculosis, and Malaria: Provided, That the entire amount \n     is designated by the Congress as an emergency requirement \n     pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended: Provided \n     further,''.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nSpecter and Boxer be added as cosponsors of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I want to clarify this amendment because some have followed this \nissue. I have made a decision this evening to change the amount that I \nam asking for in this amendment. I want to clarify it for the record so \nthere is no question in the minds of my colleagues as to what this \namendment will do.\n  Currently, in the supplemental appropriations bill there is $100 \nmillion for the global AIDS epidemic. It was my original intention to \nincrease that amount to $700 million. But after consulting with Senator \nFrist and others, I decided that we should come together to try to work \ntogether on a bipartisan basis at a lower number to make certain we do \neverything in our power to have the resources to fight this global AIDS \nepidemic.\n  I hoped we could come together and offer a bipartisan amendment with \nSenator Frist relative to a funding level of $100 million. \nUnfortunately, we were not able to reach that agreement today. However, \nin the interest of drawing as many together--Republicans and \nDemocrats--to support this measure, I have reduced the amount which I \nhave requested to $500 million. I believe more is needed, but I am \nasking for $500 million as part of this supplemental appropriation to \ndeal with the global AIDS epidemic.\n  I will tell my colleagues that this vote is not only important, but \nit is not going to be an easy vote. I anticipate procedural motions to \nbe made on the floor which will ultimately require 60 votes to pass \nthis amendment. I hope my colleagues will join and agree with me that \nit is an emergency amendment; that it deserves emergency status; that \nit deserves the vote of at least 60 Members of the Senate tonight.\n  Is there anyone in this Chamber and is there anyone following this \ndebate who can seriously question whether the global AIDS epidemic is \nan emergency? Clearly, it is.\n\n  At the end of 2001, more than 40 million people in the world were \nliving with HIV. Some estimates range from 42 million to 45 million.\n  But there is another statistic worth reflecting on. It is estimated \nthat 95 percent of the people currently infected in the world today \ndon't know they are infected. Think of that for a moment. Think of the \nconsequences of that in terms of the spread of this deadly disease.\n  There is a chart which shows a summary of the estimated 40 million \ninfected with HIV/AIDS at end of the year 2001. In North America, \n940,000; in the Caribbean, one of the fastest growing areas in the \nworld for the AIDS epidemic, 420,000; 1.4 million in Latin America; 1 \nmillion in eastern Europe and central Asia; 1 million in east Asia and \nthe Pacific; 6.1 million in South and Southeast Asia; 470,000 in \nwestern Europe; 440,000 in north Africa; then comes sub-Saharan Africa \nwith over 28 million people currently infected with HIV/AIDS.\n  It is our estimated that there are some 15 million AIDS orphans in \nsub-Saharan Africa alone. Think of that. Children who have lost one or \ntwo parents to the AIDS epidemic--15 million.\n  In 2001 alone, 5 million people were newly infected with HIV, more \nthan 95 percent of whom live in Third World countries, in the \ndeveloping world. The majority of these new infections occur in young \nadults--especially women. Most of them are young people. Many don't \nknow they have it. More than 13 million children are orphaned, and 3 \nmillion died. Each day in the world, 8,000 people die from AIDS, and \n6,000 from tuberculosis and malaria.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to start bringing together a clear \nnational sentiment--perhaps global sentiment--to do something \nsignificant when it comes to dealing with this AIDS epidemic.\n  Consider for a moment the Global Fund. There was the suggestion by \nKofi Annan and world leaders that we make a special effort to fund \nprograms around the world to deal with AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.\n  Two years ago, the United States contributed $300 million to this \nGlobal Fund. This year we reduced the amount that we contributed to a \nfigure of $200 million.\n\n[[Page S5148]]\n\n  You have to ask yourself: Why would you reduce the amount you are \nspending fighting the global AIDS epidemic through the Global \nFund? There is no good explanation.\n\n  I had before the Appropriations Committee on Foreign Operations, on \nApril 24, a man I respect very much, Secretary of State Colin Powell.\n  I stated the following:\n\n       . . . Mr. Secretary, Senator Specter and I are going to \n     offer an amendment to the supplemental for $700 million \n     more----\n\n  That was our original amendment----\n\n     committed to multilateral and bilateral efforts on AIDS as an \n     emergency appropriation. I just can't think of money that we \n     could spend more wisely than to try to stop the pace of this \n     [global] epidemic.\n       I think the American people understand this, too. This \n     isn't a problem in some other part of the world. This is a \n     problem of our world; a problem that is sadly an airline \n     flight away from being delivered to the United States every \n     hour of every day. I hope that we can have the support of the \n     administration for $700 million.\n\n  This was in April of this year, a question I asked of Secretary of \nState Colin Powell.\n  Let me read you his reply:\n\n       I will pass that on to my colleagues downtown and see what \n     we can do as it comes through, but I couldn't agree with you \n     more, sir.\n\n  Secretary of State Colin Powell has been a real leader. Sometimes he \nhas not been the most popular person in this administration with some, \nbut he certainly understands the gravity and scope of this crisis. And, \nas he said, he couldn't agree with me more in terms of funding to fight \nthis epidemic.\n  We need to show real leadership in this Chamber. We need to step \nforward and say--not only to America, but to the world--that this is \nour chance and this is our opportunity.\n  The global summary of the HIV/AIDS epidemic I have shown you. Let me \nalso show you this chart: About 14,000 new HIV infections every day in \nthe year 2001. As I said, more than 95 percent in developing countries; \n2,000 are in children under 15 years of age; about 12,000 are in \npersons aged 15 to 49 years, of whom almost 50 percent are women, 50 \npercent are between the ages of 15 and 24.\n  Two years ago, I made a trip to Africa. I went there to look at other \nissues. I really was not focused on the global AIDS epidemic. I went \nthere to look at feeding programs and microcredit programs that I am \ninvolved with in my committees.\n  I went to South Africa, Kenya, and Uganda. And I can tell you, in a \nvery brief period of time I realized there is no other issue in Africa \nthan the AIDS epidemic. I saw things and witnessed experiences there I \nwill never forget.\n  In Kampala, Uganda, there is a clinic known as the TASO clinic. Each \nday, hundreds of Ugandans come into this clinic who are already \ninfected with HIV, and some are dying from AIDS. These are men and \nwomen who understand their time on Earth is limited. They come in for a \nlittle help, some basic drugs and medicine, and they go about their \nlives. We met with them, sat down with them.\n  One of my colleagues here on the floor a few minutes ago said, it \nmust have been very depressing. It was depressing, yes, to think that \nso many people's lives would be shortened because of this deadly \ndisease. But at another level, it was inspirational. Here are people \nwho have absolutely nothing on Earth--nothing.\n  If one of us should hear that we have been diagnosed with a serious \ndisease, there are things we can do, doctors to see, hospitals to \nvisit, research to inquire about, medicines that might give us a \nchance. None of that is true for most of the victims of HIV and AIDS in \nAfrica and around the world.\n\n  I can recall standing there as a choir of infected people in the \nclinic came together to sing to us a chorus. That is not unusual in \nAfrica. They sing when they greet you; they sing when you leave; they \nsing all the time. And as they sang the songs that they had written, a \nyoung woman stepped forward, who was clearly thin, who did not have \nmuch time left, and, in the most angelic voice, sang a song she had \nwritten entitled ``Why me?'' I will never forget that--why him? Why \nher? Why me?\n  You say to yourself, isn't this a hopeless situation? If they don't \nhave the medicine, if they don't have the medical care, if they don't \nhave the hospitals, what can we do? We cannot provide the Magic Johnson \ntherapy to every infected person in Africa. It would be too expensive. \nWe could not monitor it. But, trust me, there are things we can do and \nthings that help.\n  Ten years ago, when Uganda realized their problem, 30 percent of the \nnew mothers were found to be infected with HIV--30 percent. They \ndecided, as a government, to do something about it: A public education \ncampaign, condoms, talking to people about the dangers of unprotected \nsex.\n  In a matter of 10 years, with this basic effort, they reduced the HIV \ninfection rate among new mothers to 15 percent. That meant that the \nnumber of children infected with AIDS and HIV was cut in half by the \nsimplest methods, the most direct methods.\n  The message I am trying to deliver to my colleagues is this: The \nmoney we spend on the global AIDS epidemic will save lives. We know it \nwill. We have made a commitment to this. But the commitment does not \nmeet the scope of the problem. The commitment does not reach to try to \ncatch an epidemic that is galloping away from us. We are taking small \nsteps forward saying, well, we are doing something in the United \nStates, and this epidemic is galloping away from us across the world.\n  (Ms. CANTWELL assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Did I hear correctly that the Senator from Illinois \nindicated we had reduced spending on AIDS for this fiscal year? There \nis an increase across the board in several different components. Does \nthe Senator realize that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes. I say to the Senator, what I said was, we reduced \nour contribution to the Global Fund from $300 millon a year ago to $200 \nmillion in this year. Our total expenditures for HIV and AIDS worldwide \nare in the range of $850 million.\n  Mr. STEVENS. We have $300 million right now, Madam President, in this \nfund. The House bill has $100 million in addition, and we have $100 \nmillion in this. Does the Senator realize we are willing to go up to \nanother $100 million?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might say to the Senator from Alaska, any additional \ndollars are appreciated. But the point I am trying to make is, even \nincreasing our contribution to the level of $200 million is totally \ninadequate in response to this global epidemic. I am going to quote----\n  Mr. STEVENS. Just one last question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Does the Senator realize how much we are contributing to \nthe research base for AIDS in the world, how much we are spending from \ndefense, NIH, from a series of accounts, in terms of basic research for \nAIDS?\n  Mr. DURBIN. To the Senator from Alaska, I would say, yes, we are \nmaking a contribution as a nation. What I am asking the Senate to \nconsider is whether it is adequate, whether it is adequate in terms of \nthis global AIDS epidemic.\n  Let me say to my colleague from Alaska, and others, that just a few \nmonths ago two of my colleagues in the Senate--Senator Frist and \nSenator Helms, who cannot be with us this evening because he is \nrecovering from a recent medical problem--came to the same conclusion \nthat I have come to this evening. Both Senator Frist and Senator Helms \nsought a $500 million increase for AIDS.\n  That is the amount I am asking. It isn't as if I have come up with an \noutlandish and outrageous figure. Dr. Frist, who is a Member of the \nSenate, supported the same level of funding. Senator Helms said it as \nwell. In fact, he offered an editorial to the Washington Post which was \nnothing short of inspirational. He was widely quoted across the United \nStates, saying that--and I am going to read this because I think, in \nfairness to Senator Helms, this is a very important quote.\n  Senator Helms, our colleague, in his Washington Post editorial, said:\n\n       In February I said publicly that I was ashamed that I had \n     not done more considering the world's AIDS pandemic. I told \n     this to a conference organized by Samaritan's Purse, the \n     finest humanitarian organization I know of.\n\n  Senator Helms, I would like to say, if you are following this debate, \nthis amendment, the level of funding which\n\n[[Page S5149]]\n\nyou suggested, is the right thing to do. It is still the right thing to \ndo.\n\n  For a variety of reasons, there has been a change of heart by some in \nterms of asking for $500 million. I might say to my colleagues, the \nproblem is not diminishing. The problem is growing geometrically, and \nwe are responding arithmetically. We are providing a little bit more \nand a little bit more, and this epidemic is raging across the world.\n  We talk a lot about the security of the United States. I spent a \nwhole day in the Judiciary Committee. The Intelligence Committee I \nserve on also met. Can we be more secure in the United States if \ncountries around the world are being destabilized by the AIDS epidemic? \nHow are they destabilized? Frankly, if you lose one out of five adults \nto AIDS, if you have millions of AIDS orphans, children who grow up on \nthe streets, little girls who end up turning to thievery and \nprostitution to survive, little boys with no parental supervision \nbecause their parents have died from AIDs, who become part of these \nwarring gangs in Africa and the Third World, ripe targets for \nterrorism, how does that make America safer? I don't think it does.\n  In fact, just the opposite is true. We are, in fact, less secure as a \nnation. Let me also quote two other members of the administration who \nhave addressed this issue. The Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nSecretary Thompson, March 29 of this year:\n\n       The scourge of AIDS threatens to destroy economies, social \n     systems, and the very fabric of local communities. There is \n     no question that as a country, the United States must engage \n     with other nations and across all sectors to fight the most \n     devastating public health pandemics of the modern age.\n\n  That was Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson.\n  Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neil has been in the news for the last \nseveral weeks touring Africa with Bono, a member of the Irish rock band \nU2, who has been one of the world's leaders on this issue, who came to \nvisit me and so many other Senators to talk about this issue. He \ninvited Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill to come with him to Africa, see \nthe AIDS epidemic firsthand. Let me quote Treasury Secretary Paul \nO'Neill:\n\n       Nowhere is this more urgent, and more heartbreaking, than \n     the struggle against AIDS. In South Africa I saw mothers with \n     AIDS caring for babies with AIDS, even when proven, \n     inexpensive drugs are available to stop transmission between \n     mother and child. I saw the dedication of nurses and doctors \n     treating people with AIDS, and their patients' struggle to \n     survive.\n\n  That was Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill.\n  Why is it that the leaders in this administration can travel around \nthe world and speak forthrightly about this terrible epidemic, yet this \nSenate is hesitant to put funding into fighting the global AIDS \nepidemic at a level that gives us a chance to make a real difference?\n  When I spoke earlier about what we can do and used Uganda as an \nexample, I also went to Mulago Hospital in Kampala. I saw research \nprojects underway there that are nothing short of miraculous. If a \nmother is pregnant and diagnosed with HIV, there is a high likelihood \nthat her infant will also be HIV positive. But they have found a very \nsimple drug called nevirapine. If the mother goes into labor, she takes \nthe drug and the baby, as soon as it is born, is administered the drug. \nThey are finding remarkable results in terms of saving the baby's life.\n\n  Whether you are pro-life or pro-choice, whatever your position may \nbe, isn't that the right thing to do, for the United States to be \ninvesting with other countries to try to stop this transmission of AIDS \nfrom mother to child?\n  A proposal came to the Global Fund from Nigeria to support the \nactivities of six centers focusing just on this, to stop the \ntransmission from mother to baby. These centers will have the capacity \nto test an estimated 14,000 women for HIV and provide this \nantiretroviral therapy to 912 HIV positive mothers to protect their \nbabies from infection. Finally, the centers will link families with \ncomprehensive care and counseling services.\n  This is what the Global Fund does: Identifies projects all around the \nThird World where we have victims of HIV and tuberculosis and malaria \nto come up with proven, effective therapies to save their lives.\n  Why is it important that we provide more money to this Global Fund? I \nwill tell you why. Because as of last night or the night before, the \nGlobal Fund ran out of money. It had allocated all the money for this \nyear. It is gone. It is down to zero. The $500 million which we are \nproposing in this amendment can be used by the administration to \nreplenish the money in the Global Fund.\n  We currently know that there are at least $370 million of outstanding \nprojects that weren't funded, and we know a new round of applications \nwill be coming in in just a few months. We know that down the line even \nmore money will be needed.\n  As much as we have done as a nation, we should and can do more. We \nabsolutely must do more in terms of the impact this funding is going to \nhave on the world in which we live.\n  The Global Fund fights, of course, not only AIDS but TB and malaria. \nI know my colleague from California, Senator Boxer, has been a leader \nfrom the start on HIV/AIDS in the United States and around the world \nand has focused, as well, on tuberculosis as a scourge in many Third \nWorld countries--and malaria. I will credit her, as we served on the \nHouse Budget Committee together many years ago, with being the first \nperson who made me consciously aware of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n  Little did I know I would be standing on the Senate floor next to her \nin this situation, but here we are--a nation which has fought its own \nbattle against the HIV/AIDS epidemic and looks out at a world where \nthis epidemic is virtually out of control.\n  The Global Fund, suggested by Kofi Annan at the United Nations, is a \nfund that encourages countries around the world to put in their \ncontribution. Do you know the first country that every other nation in \nthe world looks to to see whether this is a good idea, worthy of \ninvestment? The United States. If the United States will put up \ntaxpayers' dollars, hard-earned money from our taxpayers to fight the \nglobal AIDS epidemic, nations around the world follow suit.\n  The opposite is also true. If we don't put the money in, the Global \nFund lags, falls behind, in allocations. This Global Fund has rules \nthat were set down by USAID, Department of State. It has been approved \nby our Government. There is no question that it is a good agency that \ndoes a lot of great work. Frankly, they are running out of money. They \nhave none currently available.\n  When they gave countries around the world 7 weeks to prepare \nproposals for the Global Fund to fight HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, \nthey received $5 billion in funding requests. We are asking ourselves \nwhether $200 million from the United States is enough? It is not. It \nclearly isn't. We need to do more.\n\n  I think we can do more. This fund has a stupendous resource gap. It \nis being forced to triage important proposals that have been subjected \nto vigorous review. The Global Fund may be forced to reject plans that \nwould save lives immediately around the world.\n  Over 100 country proposals have been submitted. The fund just can't \nfinance it. Over a 5-year window, the Global Fund received $5 billion \nin applications. Billions more are coming.\n  I want to commend my colleagues, Senators Frist, Helms, Specter, \nBoxer, Wellstone, and others, who have shown a real consciousness and \nsensitivity to this problem. I beg you, think for a moment before we go \nhome this evening, having passed this supplemental emergency \nappropriations bill, should we not consider the greatest health \nemergency in the world today?\n  Shouldn't the United States say: We will continue to lead by example? \nIt isn't as if this is an unpopular idea. They took polls across the \nUnited States and asked the people of America what they thought we \nshould be doing in terms of our international commitments. The people \ncame back in polling and said: Second to stopping the illegal flow of \ndrugs in the United States, there is nothing that we should spend more \nmoney on when it comes to fighting HIV and AIDS around the world.\n  The American people understand this. They get it. It isn't a problem \nin some faraway land. It is a problem that may have started in Africa, \nbut it quickly spread around the world and is now growing at a \nproportionate rate\n\n[[Page S5150]]\n\nthat many of us never imagined would be possible.\n  International health experts at the UNAIDS, World Bank, and the World \nHealth Organization have supplied us data on what would be needed to \nmake a serious intervention in this crisis. This amendment we are \noffering tonight tries to meet that.\n  A few weeks ago, Bono, who I mentioned earlier, came to Capitol Hill \nand visited a lot of our offices and created quite a stir. This man, \nwho is internationally known for his musical ability, has developed an \ninternational reputation for fighting this AIDS epidemic. He is a very \nlikable man. I said: You have become a constant pest on Capitol Hill. \nEvery time we turn around, there is Bono opening up another door to \nanother office--whether the Senator is a Republican or a Democrat--\nconvincing them we have to do something. He is doing the Lord's work, \nGod's work. But all of those trips and all of the work he has done is \nworth little if we don't follow through this evening by voting for this \nadditional $500 million.\n  This debate is about more than posing for photographs with Bono. This \namendment is about making a real commitment, a tangible commitment, an \neffective commitment to a global epidemic. Can we make a difference? In \nlarge and small ways, we can.\n  I went to a clinic in South Africa outside the city of Durban, up in \nthe mountainside. It was one of the most basic health clinics I had \never been to. They didn't have much--very little technology and few \ndrugs. I saw people there suffering from burns and a young woman who \nwas clearly dying from HIV.\n\n  Then I met with a group of about 25 or 30 who lived in the villages \naround the clinic. They sat lined up in neat rows and watched this \nvisitor, a Senator from the United States, come before them. They \nwanted to make a presentation to me. They made a presentation of a \nyoung woman who was brought forward.\n  She was very thin and obviously very sick. She was clearly nervous to \nbe addressing this crowd and standing before these people from the U.S. \nShe stood there and buttoned her shirt up to the top of her neck and \nshe was shaking.\n  She said: I have Tuberculosis. I have been very sick for several \nyears, and I have come to this clinic. Then she paused and she said: I \nhave AIDS. I don't know what is going to happen to my children. When \nshe said those words, ``I have AIDS,'' there was a gasp in the audience \nbecause in South Africa, sadly--a country that is overwhelmed with the \nAIDS epidemic--a few years before, a woman was stoned to death when she \nadmitted she had AIDS. She was beaten to death by the villagers. It \ntook real courage for that woman to tell this crowd she had AIDS. They \njust don't speak of it.\n  As she was sobbing, they sat her down next to me on a bench, and I \nreached my arm over and put it around her shoulder, and the audience \ngasped again. A doctor stood up and said: Look at this now. I am \ntelling you, if you touch her, you will not be infected. He said: This \nman from the United States has put his arm around her. I am telling \nyou, it is safe to touch people who have AIDS.\n  That is what the level of ignorance is when it comes to this epidemic \nin some parts of the world.\n  My friends, those scenes I will never forget. My colleague in the \nSenate, Senator Frist, has been there himself and has worked in these \nclinics and has performed surgeries in Africa understands this. That is \nwhy the amendment he offered for $500 million is a good amendment. It \nis one that he and Senator Helms believe in very much, very \npassionately. I believe in it, too.\n  I bring this to the floor tonight in the hopes that the 25 colleagues \nin the Senate who signed a letter with me to Chairman Byrd and Senator \nStevens urging them to commit more money to the global AIDS crisis in \nthis emergency supplemental, and many others, will think about the \nimpact this vote will have not just on the Senate, but on the world. We \nhave a chance tonight--a small chance, perhaps, with one vote--to have \nan impact on literally millions of people around the world, to save \nlives of people we will never meet.\n  We can break the cycle of hopelessness and despair generated by the \ndeath spiral of AIDS in so many nations. I invite my colleagues to join \nme.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have a number of people who wish to \nspeak on this issue: The Senator from Tennessee, the Senator from Ohio, \nthe Senator from Minnesota, the Senator from California. I am \nwondering--because Members have been calling both cloakrooms--if we can \nget an idea as to how long the Senators wish to speak so we can have \nsome idea when the vote will take place. If I may, I ask the Senator \nfrom Ohio, does he wish to speak?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I was just here listening to this interesting debate.\n  Mr. REID. How about the Senator from Tennessee?\n  Mr. FRIST. I will be offering an amendment later tonight related to \nthis amendment. I would like about 15 minutes, in which case I could \nhandle both of them.\n  Mr. REID. Could the Senator speak now for 15 minutes?\n  Mr. FRIST. Yes, 15 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. How much time does the Senator from Minnesota want?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. About 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Illinois be recognized for 10 minutes, the Senator from Minnesota \nfor 5 minutes, the Senator from California wants 15 minutes, the \nSenator from Tennessee for 15 minutes, the Senator from Pennsylvania \nfor 10 minutes, the Senator from Alaska for 5 minutes, and the Senator \nfrom New Mexico for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I would like 10 minutes at the conclusion of \nwhich I expect to offer the motion.\n  Mr. REID. We will have the Senator from West Virginia be the last \nspeaker. I ask the Parliamentarian to advise the Chair how much time \nremains.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One hour ten minutes.\n  Mr. REID. So we will vote on this at approximately 7:45?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that we have a vote on Senator \nByrd's motion to waive at 7:45 tonight.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Reserving the right to object, I request that my time \nprecede Senator Byrd's.\n  Mr. REID. That would be appropriate as comanager of the bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, we have several amendments yet. Is there \nany hope of completing action on this bill tonight?\n  Mr. REID. We are going to complete action on the bill tonight.\n  Mr. BYRD. I wonder if Members will be agreeable to cutting their time \non this amendment to some extent. I am willing to cut mine in half.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Durbin can cut his in half, also. He agrees to do \nfive. Do I hear 12?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I will save my own remarks for another time.\n  Mr. REID. How about the Senator from California, is 12 minutes OK?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Absolutely.\n  Mr. FRIST. I can handle both of mine later tonight in a 15-minute \nperiod.\n  Mr. REID. That is fair. We need a little time to determine what time \nthe vote is. So we have Senator Durbin for 5 minutes, Senator Byrd for \n7\\1/2\\ minutes, and Senator Domenici with nothing.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I am cut out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is 57 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. So we can vote at about 7:25. I ask unanimous consent that \nthe vote on or in relation to the Durbin amendment occur at 7:25, or \nwhenever the time is yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I rise to accomplish two objectives: To \nspeak in response to the pending amendment and to briefly introduce \nwhat I plan to do later tonight. In the interest of time, I will try to \nachieve both of those objectives in the next 15 minutes. If the Chair \nwill notify me when I have 3 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, first, the Senator from Illinois has \neloquently outlined the challenge, what I consider to be the greatest \npublic health challenge clearly of this generation. I say public health \nchallenge to\n\n[[Page S5151]]\n\nus as Americans, but equally importantly to us as citizens of the \nworld.\n  The statistics he mentioned are right on target, and they tell the \nbest picture globally of this scourge against which we are fighting a \nlosing battle. Every 10 seconds someone dies of HIV/AIDS, but every 10 \nseconds there is a new infection in two individuals--two new \ninfections. We have no cure. There is no cure for HIV/AIDS.\n  Second, I agree with the Senator from Illinois, we need to do more. \nThere is absolutely no question in my mind that we have to invest, and \nwe have to invest as the United States, as the global leader. Our \nleadership is critically important for other nations to see, for \nprivate companies to see, and for individuals to see so they will be \nparticipants.\n  I agree with the Senator from Illinois that the dollars we spend on \nHIV/AIDS can do something that really no amendment I have seen on the \nfloor today can with absolute certainty do, and that is to save lives. \nIf resources are handled appropriately when we fight global HIV/AIDS, \nmalaria, and tuberculosis, then each dollar invested, I am absolutely \nconvinced, will save the lives of innocent children who are infected \nwith this virus. This little virus is so adaptable; it moves 100,000 \ntimes faster than our own defense systems and tens of thousands of \ntimes faster than the best medicines we apply to it. So it is a major \nchallenge for us all.\n  The Senator from Illinois mentioned Senator Helms, and I want to come \nback to that because I will be offering later tonight a Helms-Frist \namendment. Our amendment was initially spelled out, at least its \nframework, in the editorial in March from which the Senator from \nIllinois quoted. Our amendment focuses on mother-to-child transmission, \nand our amendment would, I believe, give greater flexibility to the \nPresident than the amendment that is now before the Senate.\n  The Senator from Illinois mentioned Secretary Powell, Secretary \nThompson, and Secretary O'Neill, and I will add to that list the \nPresident of the United States. We have an opportunity which I think is \nunheralded, unprecedented, in that we are bringing all elements of \nmodern society together; all political elements, both conservative and \nliberal; the private sector; the public sector; leaders around the \nworld; the very best of our pharmaceutical companies; the entertainers \nof the world, all coming together with a spotlight, a focus on a battle \nwe are losing today in a global sense.\n  If there is a point of order later tonight on this underlying \namendment, I will support it, but not because of the amount of money in \nthe amendment. The $500 million is too little for where we need to go. \nThe magnitude of the problem is big, and the money we are talking about \nis tiny. Yet we do need to recognize where the money is coming from, \nand at what rate it is going to be spent. That $500 million is \nsomething that Senator Helms and I both believe in, but, again, we have \nto recognize what we do tonight is not the answer; it is just another \nstep in a very long journey.\n\n  I am going to support the point of order against this amendment, but \nnot because of lack of support for the Global Fund. I think it is the \nbest, most innovative, most creative way to pull together the \ninternational community. It is not a U.S. fund. It is not a United \nNations fund. It is not a World Bank fund. It is a Global Fund \nindependently administered. It was started a year ago. We need to raise \na lot of money for it and have it distributed with good peer review. A \nlot of that money is going out today.\n  I will be asking my colleagues to support the point of order on this \namendment, and then I will ask for their support of an amendment by \nSenator Helms and myself which will be offered after we dispense with \nthis amendment.\n  Why? Because I believe our amendment is more focused. It centers, \nthough it does not commit all the money to, mother-to-child \ntransmission.\n  Secondly, our amendment gives greater flexibility over the use of \nthese funds. The funds will be under the direct control of the \nPresident of the United States.\n  And thirdly, these funds will have a more direct impact on saving \nlives. I am convinced of that. By focusing on mother-to-child \ntransmission, which the Helms-Frist amendment does, we can calculate \nthis impact.\n  The story goes like this: There are 800,000 innocent children born \nevery year into a world of HIV/AIDS, and they become infected. Of every \n1,000 pregnant, HIV-infected women who go through delivery, about 200 \nHIV/AIDS babies will be delivered infected with HIV. If you use \nnevirapine, a single dose for the mother and one for the child, that \nnumber is cut in half. That is why I know a program focused on mother-\nto-child transmission will ultimately save lives. For every one \nthousand births to 1,000 HIV positive women, 100 children can be saved \nfrom HIV infection. That is why I can say this and be so definite.\n  I mentioned the team that is in place in this administration, and I \nwill reinforce what the Senator from Illinois said when he mentioned \nSecretaries Powell, Thompson, and O'Neill. The President's commitment \nis there to provide more resources, not just to the Global Fund, which \nis important, but resources for our much more comprehensive approach \nfor fighting HIV/AIDS, multilateral and unilateral efforts that include \nprevention, response, care, and treatment. I do believe we have to link \nall of those approaches for an effective response; no longer can we say \njust prevention.\n  The President has increased financing dramatically in the year and a \nhalf he has been President. He has promised to do more. He has shown a \nreal empathy for the victims of HIV/AIDS, and he has shown a detailed \nunderstanding, to me in our conversations, of the treatments available. \nHe is surrounded, as the Senator said, with people who share that \ncommitment and that desire to do everything possible given the \ntechnology, given our understanding, given what we have learned over \nthe last 20 years.\n  Twenty years ago, we did not even know the virus existed. Now we are \nsaying it is the No. 1 problem. Amazing. Twenty years ago, in 1981, \nnobody had ever heard of HIV/AIDS. But with the President of the United \nStates, under his leadership and with this team, with our support and \nthrough such cooperative efforts as the Helms-Frist amendment to \nincrease funding on mother-to-child transmission, we can make a \ndifference.\n  Why are we here today? We agree--Senator Durbin, Senator Specter, and \nthe cosponsors of the bill--we all agree and the reason is simple. The \nglobal requirements to combat HIV/AIDS are far greater than the \ninternational level of commitment. But it cannot be solved with just a \nU.S. commitment. It has to be an international commitment. Part of the \nHelms-Frist amendment will require a matching from other countries and \nentities to leverage the money we invest. We need to lead, and we will \nlead, but we will lead the global community together.\n  The amendment which I am offering tonight is the work of Senator \nHelms. He could not be with us tonight. He recently underwent open \nheart surgery. And I am please to report that he is recovering well. I \nknow he wanted to be here tonight to offer this amendment.\n  He first announced our intention to take this initiative on March 24 \nin a Washington Post article. Part of it has been quoted tonight.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 24, 2002]\n\n                    Jesse Helms--We Cannot Turn Away\n\n                           (By John Overmyer)\n\n       This year more than half a million babies in the developing \n     world will contract from their mothers the virus that causes \n     AIDS despite the fact that drugs and therapies exist that \n     could virtually eliminate mother-to-child transmission of the \n     killer disease.\n       It is my intent to offer an amendment with Sen. Bill Frist \n     (R-Tenn.) to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill \n     to add $500 million--contingent on dollar-for-dollar \n     contributions from the private sector--to the U.S. Agency for \n     International development's programs to fight the HIV-AIDS \n     pandemic. The goal of this new money will be to make \n     treatment available for every HIV-positive pregnant woman. As \n     President Bush would say, we will leave no child behind.\n       There is not reason why we cannot eliminate, or nearly \n     eliminate mother-to-child transmission of HIV-AIDS--just as \n     polio was virtually eliminated 40 years ago. Drugs and \n     therapies are already provided to many in\n\n[[Page S5152]]\n\n     Africa and other afflicted areas. Only more resources are \n     needed to expand this most humanitarian of projects.\n       The stakes could not be higher. Already in many African \n     nations an entire generation has been lost to AIDS. Mother-\n     to-child transmission of HIV could eliminate another. \n     Although reliable numbers are hard to come by, experts \n     believe that more than 2 million pregnant women in sub-\n     Saharan Africa have HIV. Of these, nearly one-third will pass \n     the virus on to their babies through labor, child-birth or \n     breast feeding, making mother-to-child transmission of AIDS \n     the No. 1 killer of children under 10 in the world.\n       There will be obstacles to achieving universal availability \n     of drugs and therapies. Many African nations lack the \n     infrastructure and trained personnel to deliver health care \n     on this scale. Some governments may not be cooperative. My \n     amendment will provide the administration with the \n     flexibility to deliver the necessary assistance while \n     addressing these obstacles. For instance, if the new Global \n     Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria is deemed the \n     most efficient way to deliver assistance, then the president \n     can transfer money there.\n       The United Nations has already set an ambitious goal of \n     reducing the portion of infants infected with HIV by 20 \n     percent by 2005 and by 50 percent by 2010. We can \n     accelerate these efforts, saving hundreds of thousands of \n     lives, with a larger investment of public and private \n     funds now. Private contributions, either financial or in \n     kind--such as the donations of the drug nevirapine by the \n     German pharmaceutical company Boehringer Ingelheim--are an \n     essential part of a successful anti-AIDS strategy.\n       In addition, national commitment is absolutely essential. \n     The government of Uganda can serve as an example. Through the \n     leadership of Uganda's first lady, Janet Museveni, that \n     country has cut in half its HIV infection rate.\n       In February I said publicly that I was ashamed that I had \n     not done more concerning the world's AIDS pandemic. I told \n     this to a conference organized by Samaritan's Purse, the \n     finest humanitarian organization I know of. Indeed, it is \n     their example of hope and caring for the world's most \n     unfortunate that has inspired action by so many. Samaritan's \n     Purse is led by Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham--both of \n     whom I count as dearest friends--but the organization was \n     founded by the late Bob Pierce. Dr. Pierce's mission was to \n     ``Let my heart be broken with the things that break the heart \n     of God.'' I know of no more heartbreaking tragedy in the \n     world today then the loss of so many young people to a virus \n     that could be stopped if we simply provided more resources.\n       Some may say that, despite the urgent humanitarian nature \n     of the AIDS pandemic, this initiative is not consistent with \n     some of my earlier positions. Indeed, I have always been an \n     advocate of a very limited government, particularly as it \n     concerns overseas commitments. Thomas Jefferson once wrote \n     eloquently of a belief to which I still subscribe today: that \n     ``our wisdom will grow with our power, and teach us, that the \n     less we use our power the greater it will be.''\n       The United States has become, economically and militarily, \n     the world's greatest power. I hope that we have also become \n     the world's wisest power, and that our wisdom will show us \n     how to use that power in the most judicious manner possible, \n     as we have a responsibility to those on this earth to \n     exercise great restraint.\n       But not all laws are of this earth. We also have a higher \n     calling, and in the end our conscience is answerable to God. \n     Perhaps, in my 81st year, I am too mindful of soon meeting \n     Him, but I know that, like the Samaritan traveling from \n     Jerusalem to Jericho, we cannot turn away when we see our \n     fellow man in need.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I will quote from the article. This is \nSenator Helms:\n\n       In February I said publicly that I was ashamed that I had \n     not done more concerning the world's AIDS pandemic. I told \n     this to a conference organized by Samaritan's Purse, the \n     finest humanitarian organization I know of. Indeed, it is \n     their example of hope and caring for the world's most \n     unfortunate that has inspired action by so many. Samaritan's \n     Purse is led by Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham--both of \n     whom I count as dearest friends--but the organization was \n     founded by the late Bob Pierce. Dr. Pierce's mission was to \n     ``Let my heart be broken with the things that break the heart \n     of God.'' I know of no more heartbreaking tragedy in the \n     world today than the loss of so many young people to a virus \n     that could be stopped if we simply provided more resources.\n\n  Those are Senator Helms' words from the Washington Post article. The \nHelms-Frist amendment provides those resources, focusing on mother-to-\nchild transmission where we know we will have a measurable impact in \nsaving lives.\n  The American public shares the desire to help our fellow men and \nwomen across the world. It is a moral imperative of saving innocent \nlives. We live in a world where drug resistant strains of AIDS, of \nmalaria, and of tuberculosis, all of which are addressed in this Global \nFund, are really one economy airline seat away from our shores. There \nare many reasons for us to fight this fight. It will take more \nresources.\n  The Helms-Frist amendment, which will be introduced later tonight, is \nfocused on three things: No. 1, a requirement that the new funds be \nfocused on reducing mother to child transmission of AIDS, a problem \nwhich lends itself to immediate action with what we know will be an \nimmediate response of saving lives, and that is the emergency component \nof this legislation.\n  No. 2, a grant of authority to the President to spend the money to \noptimize the impact of all the AIDS-fighting efforts in our Government. \nIn other words, unlike the Durbin amendment, it does not say that this \nmoney goes into just the Global Fund, but it does give the President \nauthority to assess at that point in time how best to spend that money \nto get the greatest impact.\n  No. 3, the Helms-Frist amendment, which will be coming later tonight, \nhas a requirement that funds not given to the Global Fund--and indeed \nthe President can put these funds into the Global Fund but moneys not \nput into the Global Fund, indeed have to be matched by sources other \nthan the U.S. Government. The reason being to leverage and maximize our \nsupport.\n  I have a letter I would also ask unanimous consent to be printed in \nthe Record. It is to me from Senator Helms, dated June 5.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                             United States Senate,\n\n\n                               Committee on Foreign Relations,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 2002.\n     Hon. Bill Frist, M.D.,\n     U.S. Senatee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Bill: Dot and I--indeed all the Helmses--are grateful \n     to you for your support and counsel. I can truthfully report \n     that I am feeling better each day.\n       Obviously, I cannot be in the Senate to introduce our \n     amendment to add $500 million to the fight against HIV. On \n     matters relating to global disease your demonstrable \n     leadership in the Senate and in Africa has made us more aware \n     of the great needs around the world.\n       The Samaritan, on his way from Jerusalem to Jericho, could \n     not turn away from his fellow man in need. My friend, neither \n     can we. You and I know the stunning facts: Nearly one million \n     children are infected by HIV each year from their mothers \n     during labor, delivery or breast feeding. Our amendment will \n     prevent hundreds of thousands of innocent young people from \n     being infected in this manner.\n       I wish you and the rest of our colleagues all the best as \n     you deliberate on this important matter. Thank you, dear \n     friend.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                            Jesse.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Basically he says:\n\n       Obviously, I cannot be in the Senate to introduce our \n     amendment to add $500 million to the fight against HIV. On \n     matters relating to global disease, your demonstrable \n     leadership in the Senate and in Africa has made us more aware \n     of the great needs around the world.\n\n  The rest of the letter I will refer my colleagues to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Because of limited time, let me get through and then I \nwill come back to answer the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. FRIST. In summary, we have worked together on how to increase \nfunding above the level in the underlying bill in a way that we know in \npart will be a first step of what has to be done with leadership by the \nUnited States in this global endeavor.\n  I have been working over the last several days with the staff of the \nPresident of the United States, and I am delighted that sometime over \nthe next several weeks--or next several days--a major initiative will \nbe introduced by this administration addressing many of the issues that \nare the underlying reason for proceeding with this amendment.\n  Again, I will leave it to the administration to talk about this new \ncommitment that they will unveil shortly, a multiyear plan to bring \nsubstantial new resources to this effort. This is not the final word.\n  The amendment offered tonight, whether it is the Helms-Frist \namendment or the Durbin amendment, is not the final word on AIDS. We \nare going to be coming back to this again and again. This is not an \neasy problem. This is not an easy challenge. I am absolutely convinced, \nworking in this body, working with the House in a bicameral, bipartisan \nway, which is represented tonight, with this administration, that we \ncan pull the very best out\n\n[[Page S5153]]\n\nof the United States of America and the global community in order to \ndefeat this little tiny virus, a challenge and a fight that currently \nwe have not quite been able to do.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FRIST. Absolutely.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to ask the Senator when he offers his \namendment, how much money will be in the amendment?\n  Mr. FRIST. We initially filed, as the Senator knows, $500 million, \nwhich is a sum that I think is appropriate in terms of addressing the \nissues, having them in the field very shortly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Which is the amount----\n  Mr. FRIST. The amendment in the underlying bill, not your amendment \nor mine, as the Senator pointed out earlier, is $100 million. As I \nunderstand it, the amendment of the Senator would take that up to a \ntotal of $500 million.\n  Our amendment will take $100 million on top of that with an \nunderstanding, as I said earlier, that funds comparable to that $500 \nmillion will be laid out by the administration over the next 2 weeks.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am sorry. I do not understand. The total amount that \nthe Senator from Tennessee is going to offer for this is $500 million?\n  Mr. FRIST. It is $100 million in addition to $100 million that is in \nthe underlying bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So $200 million?\n  Mr. FRIST. That is correct, $200 million totally. We will be striking \n$100 million in the bill, replacing $200 million. The Senator will \nstrike $100 million and will have $500 million.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank Senator Durbin for his amendment, and Senator \nBoxer and other supporters. I am a little confused by the remarks of my \ncolleague from Tennessee. As I understand the Durbin amendment, this is \n$500 million that goes to the administration, which can then decide \nwhether it wants to put it into this Global Fund or it wants to put it \ninto other programs. That is up to the administration. We hope they \nwill put it into the Global Fund because right now this Global Fund has \na deficit of $3.5 billion.\n  This is what I think is the issue for all Senators who are going to \nvote: I think the question is whether or not when we have a situation \nwhere today HIV/AIDS claims the lives of 8,000 people, today 13,000 \npeople become newly infected with HIV, and my colleague is talking \nabout an amendment that I am still not clear is $100 million or $200 \nmillion.\n  The Durbin amendment, which I am proud to support, calls for $500 \nmillion. My God, given the magnitude of this crisis, given the \nmagnitude of what all this means in personal terms--I keep hearing my \ncolleague talk about mother to child transmission and the need to have \nprevention, yes, but there are also many people who need treatment.\n  The Durbin amendment says tonight the Senate does something, that we \nlive up to being our own best selves, that Democrats and Republicans no \nlonger just give the speeches and no longer say we care so much, but we \nback up our rhetoric with the resources.\n  In all due respect, the vote is simple. Do we believe, given this \nhuge gap and how little we have contributed, that we ought to give this \nadministration $500 million to work with so that our Government can \nplay a much stronger and more positive role, or would we vote against \nthis amendment, which means we are not providing anywhere near the \nresources?\n  There will be another amendment later calling for much less, $100 \nmillion or $200 million, and then there is some discussion about how in \nthe future there will be more. But we do not vote on the basis of the \nfuture. This is not an abstraction. There are a lot of people \nthroughout the world who are suffering, a lot of people who are dying, \nand the Durbin amendment puts us on record that we, the Senate, tonight \nare going to make a significant commitment. I cannot believe that we \nwould not get the vote for this amendment. It is time for all of us to \nsort of live the words we speak. That is what this amendment calls for \nus to do.\n  One more time, this goes to the administration, giving it the \nflexibility. We certainly can talk about mother to child transmission, \nwe also can talk about treatment, but the most of all is that finally \nthe Senate goes on record with a real commitment of resources. That is \nthe least we can do. So I speak for the Durbin amendment and hope it \nwill get a strong vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to support \nthe amendment to add $500 million to fight global AIDS. When we take a \nlook at the statistics, what has happened in the world, there are 40 \nmillion people who are living with HIV/AIDS, including 2,700,000 \nchildren. AIDS claimed the lives of an estimated 2,300,000 Africans \nlast year alone.\n  Africa is not alone in this struggle. Almost 1 million new infections \nwere reported in south and Southeast Asia last year. These alarming \nstatistics are reminiscent of the early stages of the epidemic in sub-\nSaharan Africa, and we cannot wait any longer.\n  What is required is a global effort. It has to be worldwide. We know \nthat it is a matter of leadership for the United States as the most \npowerful country in the world and as the world's leader to provide \nsubstantial funding. The estimates are that some $5.6 billion will be \nnecessary over the next 5 years. There are commitments of only $2.1 \nbillion, leaving a deficit of $3.5 billion. This deficit has to be \nfixed.\n\n  The AIDS epidemic is decimating entire countries, leaving a power \nvacuum, leaving countries in turmoil. The human factor is overwhelming.\n  As the lead sponsor, Senator Durbin, pointed out in the opening of \nhis speech, what happens if you are diagnosed with AIDS, a killer. If \nyou are in Africa or in other Third World countries, it is hopeless, \nunless someone comes to the rescue. On humanitarian principles, \nsomething which the industrial countries ought to assume the \nresponsibility for, when it comes to political considerations, and AIDS \nis decimating an entire country, it is a matter of a vacuum, where \ndictatorships breed, where there are terrorist bodies, where there is \nanarchy. That is very much contrary to the national interests of the \nUnited States.\n  Beyond the humanitarian aspects, there is a definite national self-\ninterest on the part of the United States. You might not necessarily \ncall it national security, but if there is turmoil and you find al-\nQaida taking hold of a country which has a power vacuum, it could be \ncategorized broadly as a matter of national security.\n  I believe this is an important debate, and I believe one way or the \nother the United States Government is going to come to a $500 million \nfigure. When the figure was talked about as to $700 million, it seems \nto me, having spent 22 years in the conferences, in the negotiations \nwith the House, with the $200 million we would have ended up with $500 \nmillion or perhaps less. The rule has been if the House comes in at \n$200 million, whatever the Senate comes in at, there is a tendency \nconsistently to split the difference. That will leave the figure low.\n  One most impressive statement was made by Senator Helms, who has not \nexactly been a proponent of funding for HIV/AIDS, for many reasons \nwhich we need not go into now. Senator Helms came out with a proposal \nto have $500 million. It seems to me that is a benchmark. One might say \nit is a minimum benchmark or one might say it is a maximum benchmark. \nWhen Senator Helms made the public statement with such feeling at a \ntime, as he put it, when he was near the point of meeting his Maker, he \nwanted to take a stand on something that was very important for \nhumanitarian purposes, and as a matter of basic fairness and basic \ndecency that a country which can afford it should undertake.\n  We are a very wealthy country with $10 trillion gross national \nproduct and a national budget of $2.1 trillion. With leadership on $500 \nmillion, that could be an inspiration for other industrial countries to \ncome forward and do the right thing. That is why when Senator Durbin \napproached me weeks ago on this amendment, I told him to count me in.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this figure.\n\n[[Page S5154]]\n\n  In closing, I thank my colleague from California, Senator Boxer, for \ngenerously yielding to me, although she has been here all afternoon. I \nhave been occupied, as has the Presiding Officer, with the FBI Mueller-\nRowley hearings.\n  I thank the Senator and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, before my colleague from Pennsylvania \nleaves, I wanted him to hear my comments. What he has done is shown \nthat this is a national security issue. We know when people are sick \nand desperate there can be a void in a country and people can do \ndesperate things. I associate myself with the remarks of the Senator.\n  Madam President, we talk about many issues in the Senate. There are \nmoments when we know there is a particularly important issue, sometimes \nmore parochial to our State. I say tonight that I am very proud to \nstand with Senator Durbin and Senator Specter. This is a Durbin-\nSpecter-Boxer amendment to provide $500 million for the fight against \nAIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria.\n  I was very stunned when I heard what happened to this debate. For \nweeks, I was elated that Senators Helms and Frist were going to support \na $500 million number. And then when I heard that Senators Durbin and \nSpecter were going to say we have to do even more, I felt so good \nbecause I thought at the minimum we will get the $500 million that we \nso desperately need for these diseases.\n  Then I find out the whole playing field has changed. We are in a \nsituation now that is quite troubling.\n  I will tell a story about a woman named Elizabeth Glaser whom I met \nmore than a decade ago, a beautiful woman, a young woman, a new mother. \nShe had a child, and in the hospital needed to have a blood \ntransfusion. Those were the years when no one knew that you could pick \nup HIV through a blood transfusion. Lovingly nursing her daughter, \nAriel, she was at a high point in her life. She then had another child, \na son, still not knowing anything was wrong. Elizabeth, therefore, \nfaced a situation with her husband, Paul. They had three family members \nHIV positive: The mother, the son, and the daughter.\n  Elizabeth Glaser was a fighter. A lot of us knew her around here. She \ncame here and begged us to do something. She focused on the whole issue \nof AIDS and, of course, on the transmission of the virus from mother to \nchild. The Pediatric AIDS Foundation was formed and they became the \nleaders in finding a way to stop the transmission.\n  My colleague, Senator Durbin has talked about it; Senator Frist has \ntalked about it.\n  Let me state how far we have come. We can really stop this epidemic \nin its tracks in most of these mother-to-child transmissions. The cost \nof this drug is a few dollars a dose. When Senator Frist says his \nalternative will make more money available to stop transmission, he is \nincorrect. I hope that the record has been corrected. Senator Durbin's \namendment allows the funding to go in whatever way the administration \nwishes. If they want to take the entire $500 million, if that is their \nchoice, they could spend it in that fashion. So do not stand up here \nand say: If you want to stop the mother-to-child transmission, support \nthe Frist amendment.\n  No, support the Durbin amendment. It is very important to do this. A \nlot of people did not know, and Senator Durbin talked about it, that \nAIDS and tuberculosis go hand in hand. If you look at the statistics, \nthey are stunning. Tuberculosis is the leading cause of death among \npeople who are HIV positive. Up to 50 percent of people with AIDS \ndevelop TB because HIV infection severely weakens the immune system.\n\n  This is a very small world we live in. We are reminded of it every \nsingle day. We knew it when planes came over and smashed into the World \nTrade Center. As soon as we could respond, we were in Afghanistan.\n  The fact is, it is a small world, and if anyone in this body thinks \nthat having so many people impacted with tuberculosis doesn't impact \nthe health of America, they are wrong. Therefore, what we are doing \nhere by addressing these three diseases, is, yes, to help the people \nall over the world who have HIV and AIDS, and who have tuberculosis, \nbut also to help those who get malaria, which kills around a million \npeople every single year.\n  TB is a disease we thought we had eliminated. In fact, in the Western \nWorld we largely did, with the development of antibiotics in the 1950s. \nBut the disease made a comeback, and I saw it in my State of \nCalifornia, where local public health officials never thought they \nwould ever have to worry about TB again. But they are worried.\n  I say to my friends on the Appropriations Committee who have turned \ntheir back on this $500 million, think about these numbers. In the year \n2000, there were 16,000 TB cases in the United States of America that \nwere reported to the Centers for Disease Control.\n  In my own State of California, 20 percent of those cases exist there. \nTB is an airborne disease. You can get it when someone coughs or \nsneezes. It is a small world. So don't think, if you vote against the \nDurbin amendment, it doesn't have an impact here at home, because it \nhas an impact here at home. We are talking about tuberculosis, we are \ntalking about AIDS/HIV, and we are talking about malaria.\n  The good news is that TB can be cured. There is a treatment called \nDOTS, D-O-T-S. It has been shown it can produce cure rates of 95 \npercent, even in the poorest countries. That means if we can stop TB in \nthese countries--and people who get on the planes sit next to our \npeople on the planes who do not have TB--we will be a far healthier \nnation.\n  I think there are times here when it makes sense to act \nincrementally. I have seen that. Sometimes there are problems, and you \nsay there are 10 things we should do to solve a problem, let's do 2 of \nthese every year and we will get there.\n  Sometimes you have to act boldly. Certainly we have seen our country \nunite and do that in the face of what happened on 9-11. We did it \nmilitarily. We liberated a country. We made sure that, to the greatest \nextent possible, we got to the root cause of what happened to us. And \nwe continue, every day, to act boldly, or we certainly should, whether \nit is taking a look at how we can make our intelligence agencies better \nor making sure airport security is as tight as it could be, making \nsure, as my friend in the chair wants to do, that we protect people \nfrom a chemical plant being attacked or a nuclear powerplant being \nattacked. We are acting boldly. At least I believe most of us are.\n  Why would we shirk from acting boldly in the face of these epidemics?\n  We spend a lot of time around here on things that make a difference \naround the edges. But when historians write about today, I think it \nwill be written, if we do the right thing, that we made a decision that \nwound up saving millions of lives; that we made a decision as the \nleader of the free world to alleviate suffering, to alleviate disease, \nto stop children from having to be orphans.\n\n  I will talk about my friend Elizabeth Glaser. She passed away from \nAIDS. Her daughter passed away. And we are all fighting to see that \nthat is not going to be the fate of her son because he is getting the \nadvantage of the wonderful treatments we have.\n  How can we not act to make sure that every child and every woman and \nman gets that same chance? How can we do that when we have the ability \nto do it? It is either you pay now or you pay later. I thought Senator \nSpecter was right when he said: What you do when you turn your back on \na crisis such as this is you open the door for people to wreak havoc \nwith countries to fill a void, where people are desperate. They cannot \nget involved. They are just trying to find out how to live, to survive, \nto make sure a child is not deprived of family.\n  My daughter went to Uganda and got back about a week ago. She fell in \nlove with the place and told me she did not meet one person in her \ntravels who had not experienced a deep, tragic loss of a family \nmember--not one person, and she spoke to many people.\n  This is a test of our leadership. I did not expect to be here on the \nfloor.\n  I ask for 20 additional seconds.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator Byrd has told me----\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield 20 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I just believed we were going to have that $500 million. \nSenator Helms wrote from his heart and\n\n[[Page S5155]]\n\ntalked about it. Senator Frist talked about it. Suddenly, what has \nhappened? What has happened is we are losing our boldness. I do not \nwant to see it happen.\n  I urge support for this very important amendment, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding under the unanimous consent that I \nhave 4 minutes 40 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Senator Byrd and Senator Stevens have 5 minutes each \nbefore we come to the vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to add as cosponsors to this \namendment: Senators Specter, Daschle, Leahy, DeWine, Kerry, Kennedy, \nBoxer, Sarbanes, Feinstein, Mikulski, Clinton, Dodd, Lieberman, \nTorricelli, Levin, Schumer, Landrieu, Biden, and Corzine. \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. What is the difference between $500 million and $200 \nmillion in the global AIDS fight? I do not believe for a second $500 \nmillion is going to turn back the global AIDS epidemic; no, I do not. \nBut I will say to my friend Senator Frist, you know as well as I do \nwhat a $300 million difference means. It means money going into the \nGlobal Fund from the United States that can be leveraged to induce even \ngreater contributions from countries around the world. It means $300 \nmillion more that will be spent for mother-child transmission, for \ntreatment to deal with HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria.\n  I came to this debate asking, in my mind, for $700 million, and I did \nnot think it was an outrageous request, even though it was emergency \nspending. I concluded, watching the amendments on the floor of the last \nseveral days, I could lose; I could lose $700 million. So I went to \nSenator Frist and I said: Listen. My name on this proposal is \nsecondary. What is important is to get the $500 million. I'll join you. \nI'll walk away from my amendment. I will be a cosponsor of your \namendment. I will give up whatever publicity might come from it. Who \ncares? Let's get the job done.\n  We talked about it until just a few hours ago when, to my surprise, \nthe $500 million Helms-Frist amendment became $200 million.\n  What happened? In all these months, has the need decreased? Of course \nnot. The need has increased. So I come to the floor today to offer this \namendment for $500 million.\n  I say to my colleagues to please think twice. There will be a \nparliamentary point of order made in a few moments by Senator Byrd. I \nunderstand it. He is chairman of the committee. He is protecting the \ncommittee. Even though I serve on it, I understand it.\n  But think for a minute. Are you going to let a procedural vote stop \nthe investment of $300 million--more than Senator Frist is going to \noffer--$300 million in the Global Aids Fund that can be used across the \nworld to save lives? Of all the items we vote for day in and day out, \nwe have to walk down there many times and vote for things for our \ncolleagues from other States, and ask, Is it really worth it? We are \nloyal. We do it. You know in your heart of hearts that this is the kind \nof money that should be spent by America to make a difference. That is \nwhy the United States leads the world, not just in military power and \nwith its economy but in our values. We define our values by our \npocketbook and how we spend it. Tonight, $500 million can make a big \ndifference. It can make a difference in places around the world that \nyou will never see.\n  But I will tell you this. Take a moment in your life and go to these \nThird World countries. Look right into the eyes of these mothers and \ntheir children and you will never have any question about a $500 \nmillion vote.\n  I went to a place in Kampala where they were putting together a \nmemory book. I sat on a porch with mothers as they showed me the \nscrapbooks of their lives which they were putting together to leave for \ntheir children playing in the yard. The mothers were dying of AIDS. \nThey wanted that little child playing in the yard to remember who they \nwere in the years to come.\n  That is the tragedy of AIDS. That is the reality of AIDS. That is why \nwe need $500 million.\n  I implore my colleagues. I have come to this floor so many times but \nnever with so much depth of feeling about the importance of what we are \ngoing to do.\n  Let us not negotiate the difference and bid this down. Let us do what \nwe know is right in our hearts and minds and leave tonight with the \npassage of this appropriations bill feeling that the United States once \nagain continues to lead the world in fighting the global AIDS epidemic \nso our children and our grandchildren will not see that great scourge \nthat travels around the world.\n  I close by saying to you: I salute all of my colleagues--Democrats \nand Republicans--who joined me. I thank them for their support. But \nplease, for the sake of the millions of people around the world who are \nnow feeling that they are so alone, give them a helping hand with a \n$500 million investment in hope.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Daschle be added as a cosponsor \nof this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. CORZINE). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the information of the Senate, Senator \nDaschle has been absent from today's session because he was attending \nthe graduation of his son Nathan from Harvard Law School.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, am I next in line?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, after listening to a lecture in 1983 \nabout a new problem called AIDS, I came back to the Senate and asked \nthat $50 million be dedicated to basic research on this subject. Today, \nI can tell the Senate that right now we have in this year's budget \nalone $12.5 billion committed to AIDS.\n  I have heard people talk about research for women, infants, and \nchildren; about the need for remembering the children; and, the fact \nthat this bill, as Senator Boxer said, has an impact here at home. It \ncertainly does. No one can criticize what we have done about AIDS, no \none.\n  I visited with Bono and said: Yes. We will help with AIDS \ninternationally. We started that fund with a contribution in the year \n2001. We then increased it for 2002, and we are going to increase it \neven more for 2003.\n  The House has responded also with more money to help with AIDS. We \nare going to respond, I hope, and increase this amount even more than \nwe did. We put in $100 million more. This will increase it again by \n$200 million more. That will make it a $300 million effort for this \nyear in addition to what is already proposed and already in the system.\n  But let me summarize for the Senate what we are doing.\n  FDA has $77,700. The Health Resources and Services Administration has \n$1.918 billion. Look at what they are doing. They are doing a Care \nGrant Program, an Early Intervention program, Research for Women, \nInfants, and Children, AIDS Education and Training Centers, Dental \nServices, Counseling, Testing & Partnership Notification, Ricky \nRay Hemophilia Relief Fund. We have the Indian Health Service, another \n$3 million; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, $938 million, \nand, in total, NIH, $2.5 billion. That covers a whole series of \ninstitutes of health. But the main thing is there is a limit to what we \ncan do in the world to deal with the world's problem.\n\n  I believe we should do more, and we are going to do more. But it has \nto be staged. It has to be increased in a way and be spent in a way \nthat encourages other countries to come forward, too.\n  When we went to visit the World Food Program in Rome this year, we \nfound that the United States is now paying 60 percent of all the costs \nof the World Food Program. We used to pay 12.5 percent. Why are we \npaying 60 percent? Because we kept increasing, and as we increased, the \nother nations of the world decreased their effort.\n  That is exactly what is going to be happening here. If we don't stage \nit, if we don't ask the world to come forward and join us to deal with \nthe problems of AIDS in the world, more and more they will say: Let \nUncle Sam do it.\n\n[[Page S5156]]\n\n  I am all for our doing our part, but our part is to match others in a \nworld effort to deal with AIDS. We are doing it. We are doing more than \nthat.\n  Our budget today of $12.5 billion for the year 2002 alone--not \ncounting this money--is half of what the world is spending. There is \nspace here for some comments about what we should do and how we should \ndo it. But to just genuflect and come in and say, we need $200 million, \n$500 million, or we need $700 million--we can't handle that in terms of \nthe partnership we have in the world in dealing with AIDS; if we do, \nthey will do the same thing they did in the World Food Program. They \nwill pull back and say, you wanted to do more; go ahead and do more.\n  It is not only 60 percent that we are spending on the World Food \nProgram. It doesn't include the money we spend on food under the \nmilitary accounts which our military people provide throughout the \nworld, such as in Afghanistan.\n  There is a limit. The limit is: What shall we do under an emergency \nappropriations bill dealing with money that should be spent before \nSeptember 30?\n  No matter what anyone else has said, this money probably cannot be \nspent before September 30. We will deal with more money within a month. \nWhen the bill is before the Senate, I am certain there will be an \nrequest to increase at by at least another $\\1/2\\ billion.\n  Let no one say this Senator has not done everything possible to deal \nwith AIDS. The answer is the cure and the answer is research. The \nanswer is not putting money out in the world before the world is ready \nto join us in a partnership to deal with AIDS worldwide.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this chart be printed in \nthe Record.\n\n                             ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME (AIDS) PROGRAM LEVEL\n                                             [Dollars in

Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of \nincreasing funding for HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment programs \nin the developing world.\n  The funding put forward in this amendment is essential to assisting \nresource poor countries in confronting the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n  The HIV virus has infected over 40 million people worldwide, with \nover 95 percent of those infected living outside of the United States.\n  HIV/AIDS is now the leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa. In \nsub-Saharan Africa alone, an estimated 25.3 million people are living \nwith HIV/AIDS and 2.3 million died of HIV last year alone.\n  Unless we take a leading role in the international community in the \nfight against HIV/AIDS, it is possible that sub-Saharan Africa will be \nwiped-out, with profound political, economic, social, and security \nconsequences for the United States.\n  AIDS is a major problem not only in Africa, which has received so \nmuch attention in the press, but also in India, Southeast Asia, China, \nto name but a few countries impacted.\n  The AIDS pandemic is devastating, and quite literally wiping out, \nmany countries.\n  According to some analysis, AIDS will reduce economic growth by up to \n1 percent of GDP per year and consume more than 50 percent of health \nbudgets in the hardest-hit countries.\n  The world has not seen an epidemic of this severity since the bubonic \nplague, and it is going to take everyone in the global community, \nworking together, to halt the spread of the HIV virus.\n  There can be little doubt that HIV/AIDS is a health emergency of \nmonumental proportions.\n  I believe that the United States has a responsibility to assist \nresource poor countries in gaining the funding necessary to provide \npeople infected and affected by HIV/AIDS with access to the services, \nsuch as drug therapy, necessary to save lives.\n  It is clearly in the interest of the United States to prevent the \nfurther spread of HIV/AIDS.\n  This is not just a humanitarian issue, but also one of global \nsecurity. In 2000, the National Intelligence Council reported that new \nand reemerging infectious diseases will pose a rising global health \nthreat and will complicate U.S. and international security interests \nover the next 20 years.\n  A CIA commissioned study by the State Failure Task Force found that a \nhigh infant death rate is one of the best indicators of impending \ninstability and state collapse.\n  The global HIV/AIDS crisis is certainly an emergency and worthy of \nfunding as an emergency designation as part of the Fiscal Year 2002 \nAppropriations Supplemental. It is an emergency for the people of sub-\nSaharan Africa. It is an emergency for the people of West Africa. It is \nan emergency for the people of India.\n  Let's invest more funding in these countries now before we have to \nadd more countries to the growing list of countries experiencing an \nemergency due to the HIV/AIDS crisis.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in support of the amendment by the \nSenator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, to provide urgently needed help \nin the international battle against the AIDS pandemic. AIDS is the \nfourth leading cause of death in the world. This terrible disease ends \nlives, destroys families, undermines economies, and threatens the \nstability and progress of entire nations.\n  We must carry the fight against AIDS to every corner of the globe. \nAnd the Durbin amendment would help the United States and the world to \nmeet this extraordinary challenge.\n  We in America know of the pain and loss that this disease cruelly \ninflicts. Millions of our fellow citizens, men, women, and children, \nare infected with HIV/AIDS. And far too many have lost their lives.\n  While we still seek a cure to AIDS, we have learned to help those \ninfected by the virus to lead long and productive lives through the \nmiracle of prescription drugs.\n  But this disease knows no boundaries. It travels across borders to \ninfect innocent people in every continent across the globe.\n  We have an obligation to continue the fight against this disease at \nhome. But we should also share what we have learned to help those in \nother countries in this life-and-death battle. And we must do all we \ncan to provide new resources to help those who cannot afford today's \ntherapies.\n  As we sought to enforce child labor laws at home, we also worked to \nprotect children abroad. As we developed new ways of promoting \nchildren's health and public health, we have shared these life-saving \ndiscoveries with other countries in need.\n  And once again, we are called upon to open the doors between nations \nto do all we can to halt the spread of AIDS, and to treat those \ninfected by it.\n  Twelve years ago, this country demonstrated its commitment to the \ncare and treatment of Americans living with AIDS by passing the Ryan \nWhite Care Act. Since that time, community-based care has become more \navailable, drug treatments have been developed that nearly double the \nlife expectancy of HIV positive individuals, and public campaigns have \nincreased awareness of the disease. Yet, advances such as these remain \nlargely the privilege of wealthy nations.\n  AIDS inflicts a particular toll on developing countries. Globally, 40 \nmillion people have HIV/AIDS, and the overwhelming majority live in \npoor countries. Sub-Saharan Africa is the most affected region, where \nnearly all of the world's AIDS orphans live. AIDS robs poor countries \nof the workers they need to develop their economies. They lose teachers \nneeded to combat illiteracy and train their workers for modern \nchallenges. Africa has lost seven million farmers needed to meet the \nfood needs of entire nations. AIDS plunges poor nations into even \ndeeper, more desperate poverty.\n  Governments can make the difference in battling this epidemic. Where \ngovernments in poor countries have been provided resources to fight the \nspread of AIDS, infection rates have dropped 80 percent. But these \ncountries cannot turn the corner on AIDS on their own. Their \ngovernments must be provided the technical assistance and resources to \ncarry out anti-AIDS campaigns. They need financial help to afford \nexpensive anti-retroviral drugs. And drug companies must do their part \nto make these drugs more affordable to the poor.\n  In addition, more public education is needed. A UNICEF survey found \nthat most young people still have not heard of AIDS or do not \nunderstand how the disease is transmitted. By speaking out, our \ngovernment can help to lift\n\n[[Page S5158]]\n\nthe stigma and taboo surrounding the disease and save lives.\n  The challenges are great, but not insurmountable. The epidemic is in \nits early stages. In most regions of the world, the prevalence rate is \nstill less than one percent of the population. But we cannot delay. It \nonly took 10 years for the HIV/AIDS population to double in the Russian \nFederation. And in South Africa, the rate increased from 1 in 100 \npeople to 1 in 4 in one decade.\n  Senator Durbin's amendment gives much needed support to fund the \nprograms that fight international HIV and AIDS.\n  By supporting this amendment to increase the funding for bi-lateral \nAIDS prevention, care and treatment, as well as the United States \ncommitment to the global fund, we will be helping to address the global \npublic health crisis and maintain international stability.\n  I thank Senator Durbin for offering the amendment, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would like at this time to engage in \na colloquy with the chairman of the Agriculture Subcommittee on \nAppropriations, Senator Kohl, regarding the use of non-fat dry milk as \na source of nutritional assistance to countries ravaged by the AIDS \nepidemic.\n  It is widely understood that the AIDS pandemic is having a \ndevastating impact on people the world over. Since the onset of the \nepidemic, 22 million people worldwide have died. An estimated three \nmillion people die from AIDS-related causes every year. Another 40 \nmillion people presently are living with HIV/AIDS, and although there \nare some signs that the incidence of HIV may be stabilizing in sub-\nAfrica and elsewhere, the rate of infection remains alarmingly high. In \nfact, 95 percent of HIV/AIDS victims reside in developing nations--86 \npercent of the total live in sub-Saharan Africa.\n  Children are at risk on an unparalleled scale, with HIV/AIDS \ndramatically increasing the number of infant and child deaths. Nearly \n2.7 million children under the age of 15, and 11.8 million young people \naged 15-24 are living with HIV/AIDS. More than 540,000 children were \ninfected in mother-to-child transmission in 2000, and a baby born and \nnursed by an HIV-positive mother has a 25 to 35 percent chance of \nbecoming infected.\n  Further, most experts agree that nutrition is a co-fact in HIV \nprogression: poor nutritional status and infection affect the immune \nsystem and interact with each other; and it helps protect against \nopportunistic infection and malignancies. Since the immune system \nrequires protein to function properly, and protein needs increase \nduring times of stress and infection, HIV-positive individuals should \nhave two or more servings of low or non-fat milk or yogurt with active \ncultures. In addition, many believe that dairy products should \naccompany anti-retroviral drugs to boost the nutrition of HIV-positive \nmothers, increase the effectiveness of the drugs, and help mothers give \nbirth to healthy children. I believe there is a opportunity to address \nthis need within the Department of Agriculture in the form of non-fact \ndry milk currently in great surplus within USDA, the value of which is \ndeteriorating as the cost of storage is increasing.\n  Mr. KOHL. I appreciate the Senator raising this issue. It is my \nunderstanding that the United States has more than one billion pounds \nof surplus non-fat dry milk in storage that has been acquired at an \naverage cost of over 90 cents per pound, for a total cost approaching \n$1 billion, and storage costs of $1.5 million per month and growing. \nThis surplus milk deteriorates rapidly, going out of condition in about \nthree years, when it must be sold for a cost of only a few cents per \npound.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I believe that the Secretary of Agriculture, at this \ntime, has the authority to dispose of dairy surpluses, such as the ones \nmentioned by my colleague, for direct feeding programs to mothers and \nchildren living with HIV/AIDS and communities heavily impacted by the \nHIV/AIDS pandemic. Therefore, I strongly believe that the Secretary of \nAgriculture should make available funds for the provision of 100,000 \nmetric tons of surplus non-fat dry milk to combat HIV/AIDS, focusing \nespecially on HIV/positive mothers and children. Careful consideration \nshould be given to local market conditions, so as not to undermine the \nsecurity and stability of the indigenous diary production and \nprocessing sectors of these communities, and no funds or commodities \nshould be used in any programs that would substitute dairy products for \nbreast feeding.\n  We know that there is a dire need for nutritional assistance for \nfamilies affected by HIV/AIDS. In addition, without action, this milk \nwill remain in storage. It seems clear that we have been presented with \na unique opportunity to do something positive in the world. I believe \nthat to do nothing is not an option. We have the food and the \ntechnology. Now is the time for action.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank my colleague for his passionate statements on this \nsubject. I agree that the Secretary of Agriculture has the \nresponsibility to use here authority to help those in need when the \nopportunity arises, as it clearly has in this case, and support the \ncomments of the Senator from Minnesota. I look forward to working with \nmy colleague on this issue.\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/06/senate-section/article/S5159-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5159-S5195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n[[Page S5159]]\n\nSenate\n\n          SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2002\n\n                              (Continued)\n\n\n                           amendment no. 3729\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support \nthe amendment introduced by Senators Durbin and Specter with \ncosponsorship by several colleagues and myself. The amendment would \nincrease the amount of money in this emergency appropriations bill for \nseveral purposes related to combating the most pernicious infectious \ndiseases confronting humankind today.\n  The amendment would raise the U.S. contribution to the Global Fund to \nCombat AIDS, Turberluclosis and Malaria, increase the resources of our \nCenters for Disease Control for prevention, treatment, control of, and \nresearch on HIV/AIDS, and provide funds for child survival, maternal \nhealth, and other programs to combat tuberculosis and to address the \nconsequences of the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n  The United States of America contributed last year to the Global Fund \nand correctly urges other developed countries to participate actively \nand generously in that global initiative. Nevertheless, I feel we can \nand must do more to overcome the debilitating effects of these diseases \non societies that are struggling.\n  The dimensions of the global HIV/AIDS crisis are overwhelming. At \ncurrent rates of infection, it is estimated that 100 million people \nwill have had HIV/AIDS by 2005. More than 36 million people are \ncurrently infected with the virus and 22 million people have already \ndied from it, more than the number of soldiers killed in all major wars \nof the twentieth century. Thirteen million children worldwide have lost \none or both parents to AIDS, and that number is expected to triple to \n42 million by 2010. In 10 African countries life expectancy has dropped \nby more than 20 years, which is almost entirely as a result of AIDS \ndeaths. In China, the number of people with HIV increased by 69 percent \nin 1999 and another 37 percent in 2000, according to official \nstatistics, and nearly 80 percent of those testing positive for \ninfection are between 20 and 40 years of age. In Russia, Ukraine and \nthroughout the Commonwealth of Independent States, HIV increased five \ntimes between 1997 and 1998; in 1999, the region recorded the highest \nincrease in HIV infection in the world.\n  The AIDS pandemic is having a disastrous impact on economic growth \nrates, public services and private companies, impoverishing millions of \nfamilies and orphaning children and rolling back hard-won social gains \nin human development, including life expectancy, income and education. \nIt is unprecedented in its destructive impact on regional development, \nbecause it kills so many adults in the prime of their working and \nparenting lives, it decimates the workforce, fractures and impoverishes \nfamilies, orphans millions, and shreds the fabric of communities. In \nits wake it leaves desperation--one of the greatest threats to peace \nwithin and between peoples and nations.\n  In the face of this challenge, the United States should not treat the \nmajor global initiative against infectious disease as a bargaining \ntable at which to challenge other governments' commitment and \ngenerosity. We should lead by example. It is in our national interest \nand consistent with the humanitarian values of America that we \ncontribute substantially to the global fight against infectious \ndisease. I hope all my colleagues will vote to do so by adopting this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, have other Senators spoken on this \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All other Senators have spoken on the \namendment.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, \nhas offered this amendment, and I think he has spoken for a good cause. \nHe is a very highly respected member of the Appropriations Committee, \nthe committee that I chair.\n  I salute him for speaking out on this matter. I have listened to the \npoignant cases that he has referred to of persons who have been \ninfected with AIDS. There is no question but that the cause for which \nhe speaks is one which the world should be greatly concerned about.\n  But there is a limit, in the first place, to our ability as a nation \nto fund even the good causes. We can only do so much. And regardless of \nhow much we might appropriate today for this purpose, we can never \nappropriate enough. There will never be enough money in the U.S. \nTreasury that we can utilize for this purpose. There will never be \nenough to fully deal with this pandemic.\n  So, Mr. President, I salute the distinguished Senator from Illinois \nfor his determination, for his humanitarianism, and for the appeal that \nhe has made in this matter. But I have to oppose the amendment. We have \na bill here that has been carefully worked out on a bipartisan basis. \nThe ranking member and I, and all the members on his side of the aisle \nand the members on my side of the aisle--including the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois--have worked laboriously to produce a bill that \nwill bring the necessary appropriations for the protection of the \nhomeland.\n  The President made a request, and based on the very thorough hearings \nthat were conducted by my full Committee on Appropriations, we have \nenlarged over and above the President's request. But we think we are \nacting judiciously and based on the hearings of the people at the local \nlevel: the firemen, the policemen, the health service, the medical \npersonnel. And we have listened to the Governors and the mayors\n\n[[Page S5160]]\n\nand seven of the Cabinet officers of this executive branch, and the \nDirector of FEMA.\n  It has been a long and tenuous ordeal as far as I am concerned. I \nhave been working on this bill for months. I think it is important we \nget it to conference, and that we get it on the President's desk.\n  Now, the President sent word to this committee last year that he did \nnot need the additional moneys this committee was proposing for \nhomeland defense. And Mr. Tom Ridge wrote me a letter saying they did \nnot need the money, did not need more money. But we appropriated $4 \nbillion more for homeland security last year, and the President signed \nthat bill. And that money has been well spent. It is producing results. \nAnd it is making a difference.\n  We think we have acted judiciously and very carefully in this \ninstance. So we are adding moneys this year over and above the \nPresident's request. But we have a responsibility, as elected Members \nof this body, elected by the American people, elected by the people of \nour States, to use our judgment; that is what we are doing. No \nPresident sends any Senator here--no President, whether he be Democrat \nor Republican. I would say this if we had a Democratic President. We \nhave only our own judgment. And we do the best we can to represent the \npeople.\n  How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Chair.\n  I have to oppose the amendment. And so I will make a point of order. \nI hope Senators will support the point of order and will oppose any \nmotion to waive.\n  Section 205 of H. Con. Res. 290, the fiscal year 2001 concurrent \nresolution on the budget, created a point of order against an emergency \ndesignation on nondefense spending.\n  Now, I was against the kind of vote that is required to support that. \nBut that is what we have. And I am going to use it. I am going to use \nthat point of order. It is the same point of order I used against an \nequally good cause when Senator Kennedy had his amendment before the \nSenate with respect to summer schools.\n  The amendment contains nondefense spending with an emergency \ndesignation.\n  Pursuant to section 205 of H. Con. Res. 290, the fiscal year 2001 \nconcurrent resolution on the budget, I make a point of order against \nthe emergency designation contained in the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator withhold for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, I will.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that immediately \nfollowing the next vote, if Senator Durbin's amendment is not agreed \nto, Senator Frist be recognized to offer his amendment No. 3725; that \nhe be permitted to modify it with the changes that I now send to the \ndesk--they are at the desk--that there be 5 minutes for debate, equally \ndivided, between Senator Frist and Senator Byrd, and 5 minutes under \nthe control of Senator DeWine; and that at the conclusion of that time \nthe Senate vote, without any intervening action or debate, in relation \nto the Frist amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, I \nwould like to add to the unanimous consent request that I be given 2 \nminutes in response.\n  Mr. REID. That is appropriate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator modify his request?\n  Mr. BYRD. Reserving the right to object, if the emergency designation \nfalls on this point of order, there still has to be another point of \norder which should be immediate. And I hope the distinguished whip will \ntake that into consideration in his request.\n  Mr. REID. I would accept the suggestion of the Senator from West \nVirginia that that be part of the unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request, as \nmodified?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pursuant to the point of order raised by \nthe Senator from West Virginia, I move to waive section 205 of H. Con. \nRes. 290, the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2001, \nfor purposes of the pending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Bingaman), \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Daschle), and the Senator from \nMinnesota (Mr. Dayton) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) and the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Campbell) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 46, nays 49, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 141 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Boxer\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     DeWine\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Smith (OR)\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--49\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Breaux\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Byrd\n     Carper\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hollings\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Johnson\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Miller\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Snowe\n     Stevens\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Bingaman\n     Campbell\n     Daschle\n     Dayton\n     Helms\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. On this vote, the yeas are 46, the nays are \n49. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn not having voted \nin the affirmative, the motion is rejected. The point of order is \nsustained. The emergency designation is removed.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, it remains necessary to make a point of \norder against the amendment under section 302(f) of the Congressional \nBudget Act. Section 302(f) is the point of order against spending in \nexcess of the relevant 302(b) allocation, and there is no general \npurpose discretionary headroom in the allocation of any subcommittee.\n  Therefore, I make the point of order under section 302(f) of the \nBudget Act, as amended, that the amendment provides spending in excess \nof the relevant subcommittees' 302(b) allocation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained. The amendment \nfalls.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3725, As Modified\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, under the order, I now call up amendment \nNo. 3725, with a modification now at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Frist], for Mr. Helms, for \n     himself and Mr. Frist, proposes an amendment numbered 3725, \n     as modified.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase the amount provided for the Child Survival and \n            Health Programs Fund, and to impose conditions)\n\n       On page 55, strike lines 10 through 19, and insert the \n     following:\n       For an additional amount for the ``Child Survival and \n     Health Programs Fund'', $200,000,000, to remain available \n     until expended: Provided, That such funds shall be\n\n[[Page S5161]]\n\n     made available only for programs for the prevention, \n     treatment, and control of, and research on, HIV/AIDS: \n     Provided further, That special emphasis shall be given to \n     assistance directed at the prevention of transmission of HIV/\n     AIDS from mother to child, including medications to prevent \n     such transmission: Provided further, That of the funds \n     appropriated by this paragraph, the President, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of State, may make such \n     contribution as the President considers appropriate to the \n     Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria to be \n     used for any of the purposes of the Global Fund: Provided \n     further, That funds appropriated by this paragraph, other \n     than those made available as a contribution to the Global \n     Fund, shall not exceed the total resources provided, \n     including on an in-kind basis, from other donors: Provided \n     further, That not more than seven percent of the amount of \n     the funds appropriated by this paragraph, in addition to \n     funds otherwise available for such purpose, may be made \n     available for the administrative costs of United States \n     Government agencies in carrying out programs funded under \n     this paragraph: Provided further, That funds appropriated by \n     this paragraph shall be subject to the regular notification \n     procedures of the Committees on Appropriations: Provided \n     further, That the entire amount is designated by the Congress \n     as an emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) \n     of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of \n     1985, as amended: Provided further, That the entire amount \n     shall be available only to the extent that an official budget \n     request that includes designation of the entire amount as an \n     emergency requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the \n     Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as \n     amended, is transmitted by the President to Congress.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask for a clarification. In terms of the time agreement, \njust so our colleagues will know what has been agreed to, I understand \nI have 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. And then the opponents have 2\\1/2\\ minutes and then 5 \nminutes for Senator DeWine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. Then Senator Durbin has 2 minutes after that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, Senator Jesse Helms wrote me a letter \nyesterday regarding the Helms-Frist amendment. In that letter he said:\n\n       You and I know the stunning facts: Nearly one million \n     children are infected by HIV each year from their mothers \n     during labor, delivery, or breast feeding. Our amendment will \n     prevent hundreds of thousands of innocent young people from \n     being infected in this manner.\n       I wish you and the rest of our colleagues all the best as \n     you deliberate on this important matter.\n\n  Again, that was Senator Helms in a letter to me yesterday that was \nentered into the Record earlier tonight.\n  For my colleagues, our amendment very simply strikes, on page 55, \nlines 10 through 19, and replaces that section with $200 million, $100 \nmillion more than in the underlying bill, to add to the U.S. effort to \ncombat the ravages of global HIV/AIDS.\n  The amendment does three things:\n  No. 1, it requires that the new funds be focused on reducing mother-\nto-child transmission of HIV/AIDS, a problem we know how to respond to, \nthereby greatly reducing the ravages of HIV/AIDS in innocent newborns.\n  No. 2, it grants flexible authority to the President in spending the \nmoney so as to optimize the impact of the AIDS-fighting efforts of our \nGovernment.\n  No. 3, it requires that this money be leveraged through funds matched \nby sources other than the U.S. Government in order to maximize their \nimpact.\n  Mr. President, this is a straightforward amendment that recognizes \nthe travesty, the tragedy, and indeed the challenge we have before us \nin combating HIV/AIDS globally. Every 10 seconds, one person dies. \nEvery 10 seconds, there are two new infections. Globally we are losing \nthis battle.\n  Finally, in the next several days, the President will introduce a \nmajor initiative addressing global HIV/AIDS that will be devoting \nincreased resources with a strategic plan to combat HIV/AIDS.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding I have 2 minutes \nunder the unanimous consent agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will not use the full 2 minutes.\n  Clearly, I believed very strongly that $500 million was the right \nnumber. It was the number Senator Frist and Senator Helms proposed. It \nwas a number I compromised to offer to the Senate, but it was not \naccepted. I am disappointed, but I urge all of my colleagues, Democrats \nand Republicans, to join in supporting the Frist amendment. It will add \nanother $100 million. We need every penny we can get.\n  Senator Frist believes, and he has told me, the administration is \ngoing to come through with even more money on their own. I sincerely \nhope he is right, and I hope we can all stand and applaud the \nadministration for doing that.\n  I urge all of my colleagues now to join in supporting the Frist \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of increasing \nfunds to respond to the HIV/AIDS pandemic. I cannot think of a more \npressing humanitarian and health emergency than this global crisis. \nThat is why Senator Frist, I, and others have worked with Senator Helms \nto propose this amendment to significantly increase the U.S. \ncontribution to the global AIDS fight.\n  At the end of the day, all of us are working for the same objective: \nTo substantially increase our overall funding level and to work towards \nalleviating the continued suffering caused by this epidemic. Quite \nsimply, we have a moral obligation to do so.\n  Many of my colleagues have already come to the Chamber and painted \nthe very disturbing and realistic picture of the impact this disease is \nhaving worldwide, particularly on children. In the year 2000, the U.S. \nAgency for International Development released a study which concluded \nthat over 34 million children worldwide have lost one or both parents \nto AIDS or related causes.\n  USAID further estimated this number will increase to 44 million \nchildren--44 million--by the year 2010. Yet as alarming as these \nnumbers are, they hardly begin to tell the whole story. Today, nearly 3 \nmillion children are infected with the virus. Last year, over 800,000 \nchildren contracted HIV/AIDS, primarily from mother-to-child \ntransmission.\n  While the problem is especially profound in sub-Saharan Africa, many \nchildren who are contracting the disease are living right in our own \nbackyard in the Caribbean, in nations such as Haiti and Guyana. I have \nseen firsthand, as have many of my colleagues, the devastation this \ndisease causes. I have seen it in Haiti, a nation with the second \nhighest prevalence of HIV/AIDS in the world, second only to sub-Saharan \nAfrica.\n\n  In the year 2000, an estimated 250,000 Haitians, out of a population \nof only 8 million, are estimated to be currently living with AIDS. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control projections, Haiti will \nexperience up to 44,000 new HIV/AIDS cases this year. That is at least \n4,000 more than the number expected in the United States, a nation with \na population nearly 35 times larger.\n  In Haiti, HIV/AIDS already has orphaned 163,000 children, a number \nexpected to skyrocket to between 323,000 to 393,000 over the next 10 \nyears. Haiti also continues to suffer from an unbelievably high HIV \ntransmission rate from mother to child, and, of course, 65 percent of \nthe infants born with the disease, we know, will die within the first \nyear.\n  This truly is a tragedy because we know that the transmission of HIV \nfrom mother to child can be substantially reduced with proper \ncounseling and proper medication. The reality is that millions of \nchildren are dying, and we can do something about it. We must do \nsomething about this.\n  Now is the time to work to end the human tragedy caused by \npreventable, treatable diseases around the world. We have a moral \nobligation to fight HIV/AIDS, and I believe we must show the leadership \ntoday by tackling the problem in our backyard and around the world.\n  I thank all of my colleagues who have come to this Chamber to talk \nabout this issue and show support for dealing with this problem. I \nthank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S5162]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). Who yields time?\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, who has the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide authority regarding the availability of funds for \n the Department of Defense for counterterrorism activities in Colombia)\n\n       At the end of chapter 3 of title I, add the following:\n       Sec. 307. (a) Availability of Funds for Assistance for \n     Colombia.--In fiscal year 2002, funds described in subsection \n     (b) shall be available for the following purposes:\n       (1) To support a unified campaign against narcotics \n     trafficking and against activities by organizations \n     designated as terrorist organizations, including the \n     Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the National \n     Liberation Army (ELN), and the United Self-Defense Forces of \n     Colombia (AUC).\n       (2) To take actions to protect human health and welfare in \n     emergency circumstances, including rescue operations.\n       (b) Funds.--The funds described in this subsection are as \n     follows:\n       (1) Funds available to the Department of Defense in this \n     Act for assistance to the Government of Colombia.\n       (2) Funds available to the Department of Defense in \n     appropriations Acts enacted before the date of the enactment \n     of this Act for assistance to the Government of Colombia that \n     remain available for obligation.\n       (c) Construction.--The authority in subsection (a) is in \n     addition to any other authority under law regarding the \n     availability of assistance to the Government of Colombia.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, on behalf of my colleagues, Senators \nDeWine, McCain, Miller, Thompson, Sessions, Rockefeller, Bayh, Nelson \nof Florida, Nelson of Nebraska, and Allard, I rise today to offer an \namendment to provide the Department of Defense the authority necessary \nto support Colombia's war against narcotics trafficking and terrorist \nactivities.\n  September 11 served as a horrible moment in history--a moment that \nrevealed the evils, the hatred, and the degree to which those who wish \nto do us harm are prepared to go. Unfortunately, this reality is not \nlimited to North America. It is not limited to the Middle East or to \ncentral Asia. It is a global phenomenon.\n  The United States, at home and around the world, must do better with \nour intelligence, law enforcement, and foreign policy efforts. We must \ndo more as well to work with our allies.\n  In Latin America, the evil hand of terror has been an everyday \nreality for too long, a fact which I believe most Americans of the \nUnited States will find stunning, but not to Americans\n\n[[Page S5163]]\n\nwho live in other parts of the Western Hemisphere.\n  In the year 2000, over 44 percent of all of the worldwide incidents \nof terrorism against U.S. citizens and U.S. interests were committed in \none country. That country was Colombia. Three groups that were \nresponsible for these atrocities are all on the U.S. Department of \nState's list of foreign terrorist organizations. These attacks pose a \nthreat to the democratic institutions of Colombia, to the stability of \nLatin America, and to the security of the Western Hemisphere.\n  The Taliban and al-Qaida networks derived much of their funds from \nthe illegal narcotics trade--heroin, primarily. But the linkage is no \nmore pervasive anywhere in the world between illegal narcotics and \nterrorism than it is in Colombia where former guerrillas have evolved \ninto drug trafficking terrorists.\n  That is why a large number of our colleagues and I are offering this \namendment that would allow the Department of Defense to use its \nappropriated funds to provide additional equipment, training, and \nintelligence to Colombia to combat both narcotics trafficking and \nterrorism.\n  Current law allows the U.S. equipment and funds from the Department \nof Defense to be used solely for counterdrug operations.\n  In Colombia, the reality is that the line between narcotics and \nterrorism is extremely thin. It is virtually mythical.\n  The House of Representatives has already passed an authorization bill \nas part of the legislation that we consider this evening, and these \nauthorities to expand the use of defense funds to combat the twin evils \nof narcotics and terrorism are provided in the House bill; these \nauthorities are being aggressively sought by the President of the \nUnited States.\n  The administration seeks more explicit legal authority to support \n``Colombia's unified campaign against narcotics trafficking and \nterrorist activities.''\n  This provides greater flexibility to counter the threat from groups \nusing narcotics trafficking to fund both terrorist and criminal \nactivities.\n  I assure our colleagues that I am not proposing any changes to \nprevious requirements in human rights, certifications, and limits on \npersonnel--civilian and military. And in no way am I suggesting the \nDepartment of Defense deploy U.S. troops to a combat role.\n\n  The Government of Colombia, both under its current President, \nPresident Pastrana, and under its newly elected President, Alvaro \nUribe, has stated its intention to carry the war to the terrorist drug \ntraffickers.\n  What we are being asked to do is to allow equipment that has been \nprocured in part with funds from the U.S. Department of Defense to be \nused in both wars, terrorism and narcotics.\n  These counterterrorism efforts will not hurt our counternarcotics \nprogram. In fact, they will be of great assistance to our \ncounternarcotics program.\n  The Department of Defense has assured me that it remains committed to \na robust counternarcotics program in Colombia, and it will bear that in \nmind as the details are developed regarding the use of defense-funded \nequipment, training, and intelligence for counterterrorist missions.\n  I am also pleased, despite the rampant violence in Colombia on May 26 \nof this year, that the citizens and Government of Colombia carried out \ndemocratic elections which were deemed by international standards and \nobservers to be free, fair, and the expression of the will of the \nColombian people.\n  When the United States first authorized Plan Colombia in 2000, we \nmade a commitment. The commitment was to help our Colombian neighbors \nin their long struggle against the drug trade and the violence it \ncauses. Anything less than that would not only be a violation of our \npromise to be good neighbors but a neglected front on the war against \nterrorism.\n  I ask my colleagues to support Colombia, an important democratic and \nhemispheric ally by supporting this amendment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, at a time of bipartisan agreement that the \nColombian government must pursue a unified campaign against the narco-\ntrafficking and terrorist threat to Colombia's democracy, the Senate \nAppropriations Committee has chosen to deny the Administration's \nrequest for the authority to support our Colombian ally.\n  As my colleagues know, our assistance to Colombia is channeled \nthrough both the State and Defense Departments. To the President's \ncredit, American policy has dispensed with the illusion that the \nColombian government is fighting two separate wars, one against drug \ntrafficking and another against domestic terrorists. The democratic \ngovernment of Colombia has long insisted that it is the nexus of \nterrorists involved in the drug trade that threatens Colombian society. \nAmerican policy now recognizes that reality, and abandons any fictional \ndistinctions between counter-narcotic and counter-insurgency \noperations.\n  Our government properly allies itself with the Colombian people \nagainst the narco-terrorists who threaten the government they elected, \nand the system of government that rejects the violent and absolutist \naims of those who would overthrow it by force of arms. We in the United \nStates have a considerable stake in the Colombian government's success, \nfor the narcoterrorist state the enemies of the Colombian government \nwould establish would present a compelling national security threat to \nthe United States in our own hemisphere.\n  Congress has shown an admirable commitment to supporting the \nColombian government's campaign to bring basic security to its people. \nBut America's commitment has been limited to providing training and \nassistance to combat drug production and trafficking. The \nAdministration has requested not new money but new authority to use \nappropriated funds to combat narco-terrorism. Yet this Supplemental \nAppropriations bill grants that authority only to the Department of \nState, and places overly restrictive and burdensome constraints on that \nauthority.\n  Our amendment would provide the Administration the authority it has \nrequested, in consultation with the Congress, to use appropriated funds \nto support a unified campaign by the Colombian government against drug \ntrafficking and terrorist insurgency. The House-passed version of this \nbill provides both the departments of State and Defense with this \nauthority for the current fiscal year. The Senate bill would leave in \nplace existing restrictions prohibiting use of Department of Defense \nassistance in the war against the FARC and the ELN. Our amendment \nmirrors the President's request to provide the Department of Defense \nthe authority to use funds already appropriated for this purpose to \nsupport our Colombian ally. I hope the conference committee to this \nbill will provide the Administration with this authority.\n  In a presidential election last month, the Colombian people gave \ntheir leadership a clear mandate to defeat narco-terrorism by electing \nAlvaro Uribe as President. President-elect Uribe campaigned on a \nplatform of decisively defeating the FARC terrorists, who have shown \nlittle interest in a negotiated, peaceful solution to the war they have \nbeen waging against Colombia's government for four decades.\n  This is not an authoritarian regime located in a far-off corner of \nCentral Asia. This is a democratic government, one of the longest-\nstanding in our hemisphere, that has allied itself with the United \nStates in order to defeat the threat to our common values posed by the \nFARC and the ELN terrorists, as well as by AUC paramilitary forces \nwhose abysmal human rights record rivals that of their opponents.\n  Under existing law, human rights conditionality and restrictions on \nthe American military presence in Colombia remain in effect on all U.S. \nassistance to that country. Our amendment would ensure that existing \nAmerican funds appropriated to support American policy in Colombia \nreflect the reality that the Colombian government is not simply \nfighting a drug war.\n  It is estimated that one million would-be voters in Colombia could \nnot express their preference at the ballot box last month due to FARC \nviolence and intimidation. The number of political candidates who have \nbeen intimidated, abducted, or murdered for their ambition to serve \ntheir people is staggering. One presidential candidate, Ingrid \nBetancourt, remains a hostage to\n\n[[Page S5164]]\n\nthe FARC, who abducted her on the way to a campaign rally in February.\n  On May 2, 2002, a rocket fired by FARC guerrillas killed 117 \ncivilians taking refuge in a small church. Forty of the dead were \nchildren. Colombian officials call it the worst single loss of civilian \nlife in the nation's 38-year civil war.\n  President-elect Uribe has been given a clear mandate by his people to \ngive them back their country. Our values and our interests require us \nto support our ally. There is an important role for the United States, \nnot only to provide assistance and technical support to the Colombian \npolice and armed forces, but also to exercise our influence to ensure \nthat our values triumph over both terrorist violence and paramilitary \nbrutality.\n  These values are worth fighting for. We should stand proudly with the \npeople of Colombia in their struggle.\n  To reiterate Mr. President, the situation in our own hemisphere in \nregard to Colombia is a very serious one. We are understandably worried \nabout events between Pakistan and India, Afghanistan, et cetera. The \nsituation in our own hemisphere as regards Colombia is of the utmost \nseriousness because that is where the drugs come from that destroy the \nminds and bodies of our children.\n  On May 2, 2002, a rocket fired by FARC guerrillas killed 117 \ncivilians that were taking refuge in a small church. Forty of the dead \nwere children. Colombian officials call it the worst single loss of \ncivilian life in the nation's 38-year civil war.\n  It is estimated that 1 million voters in Colombia couldn't express \ntheir preference at the ballot box last month due to FARC violence and \nintimidation. The number of political candidates who have been \nintimidated, abducted, or murdered for their ambition to serve their \npeople is staggering.\n  One Presidential candidate, Ingrid Betancourt, remains a hostage to \nthe FARC who abducted her on the way to a campaign rally in February.\n  I understand the reluctance of Members of this body to relax certain \nrestrictions that are associated with our assistance to Colombia. I \nhope all of my colleagues will review the situation as it exists \ntoday--a direct threat to the security of the United States of \nAmerica--if Colombia collapsed in a civil war between different \nparties.\n  There is the ELN, the paramilitary, the FARC, and there is the \nGovernment. They are all fighting amongst one another, and the FARC \nrecently being rejected from the sanctuary they were granted, I \nbelieve, is a mistaken policy on the part of the Colombian Government.\n  We now have a new President, Alvaro Uribe, who is committed to using \nwhatever sources and means necessary to bring peace and stability back \nto its country.\n  Again, I don't want to take the time of the Senate at this late hour. \nIt is in our national security interests to see some kind of Government \npeace and stability restored to Colombia because that is where the \ndrugs are coming from that are killing our kids.\n  I hope in the days ahead we will devote some of our attention to the \ncountry of Colombia and see what the United States can do not only to \nhelp these people who are literally afraid to leave their own homes, \nbut to try to combat the great threat of narcoterrorism and the flow of \nnarcotics, which is another aspect of our war on terrorism that we need \nto do whatever is necessary to combat.\n  I thank Senator Graham not only for his amendment but for his \ncontinued involvement in the affairs of our hemisphere.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I will speak for a couple minutes.\n  I say to Senator Graham, I rise to congratulate him, and not only for \nthe amendment. And whatever happens to it tonight, its destiny is \nalready determined. We have already waited too long. It is time that \nsome of us, especially those of us who come from States that are not \ntoo far from the other hemisphere, where mostly Hispanic Americans live \nand work--to have that hemisphere as if it were not really our friend \nand we should not be concerned about it is truly one of the giant \nmistakes we make. And every year that passes we say something about \ndoing better.\n  But I believe the situations are going to get even worse, and sooner \nor later--let's hope sooner--the United States will do something while \nwe are still acceptable down there and while we can still be of some \nsignificant positive impact.\n  I say to Senator McCain, I heard his remarks. And I have heard them \nbefore. I think it is time, with real vigor and enthusiasm, with \nresources and leadership, we consider this hemisphere to be a big part \nof America's foreign involvement. Why so far away when we have problems \nin abundance so close? Why neighbors thousands of miles away and no \nacts of friendliness to those who are really our neighbors?\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute to introduce a bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Domenici pertaining to the introduction of S. \n2599 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first, I note to my friend from Ohio, I \nam going to call up an amendment shortly.\n  Does the Senator wish to make a comment on the last amendment?\n  Mr. DeWINE. Just a couple comments on the amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I defer to my colleague from Ohio so he \ncan make comments on that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague from the State of Florida \nfor his leadership on this amendment. Once again, he is correct. Once \nagain, he is a leader on issues having to do with this hemisphere, \nhaving to do with the drug problem.\n  We have a lot at stake in Colombia. Colombia is our neighbor. We do a \nlot of trade with Colombia. This is, I believe, the second oldest \ndemocracy in this hemisphere. It is a country that obviously borders \nthe Panama Canal. It is a democracy, though, that is in peril. It is a \ndemocracy that has at least three very tough groups gnawing at it, \ntrying to overthrow the Government, trying to grab pieces of the land \nof Colombia. These are three very tough, tough groups: the FARC, the \nELN, and the paramilitary.\n  So a lot is at stake in Colombia. Colombia is important to us because \nthis is one of the countries that is a major supplier of drugs into the \nUnited States. So what happens down there is important.\n  We have seen something develop in Colombia in the last few years that \nI do not know we have seen anywhere in the world; that is this very \nclose relationship, over now an extended period of time, between the \ndrug dealers and the terrorists. They are working literally hand in \nglove in a synergistic relationship.\n  Unfortunately, as we try to help our friends in Colombia, we have \ncreated an artificial barrier in our law. That barrier creates a \ndistinction between the use of our money to help to deal with terrorist \nproblems or our use of the money to deal with narcotics problems. It \nsays, in effect, we can use it for one but we cannot use it for the \nother. That makes absolutely no sense.\n  It is time we take that artificial barrier down because really the \nproblem is one and the same. And they are the same people. It is time \nwe recognize that and that we stop handcuffing the use of our aid, \nhandcuffing the Government of Colombia as it literally fights for its \nsurvival.\n  So I congratulate my colleague on this amendment. It is time, \nfrankly, that we face up to the reality of what is really going on in \nColombia and help this ally of the United States to try to preserve \ndemocracy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to make some remarks on the \nColombia amendment.\n  Mr. NICKLES. That is fine. I inform my colleagues, we only have a \ncouple more amendments that will require votes. Mine is one of them. We \nwill try to do that in the very near future. Certainly, if my colleague \nfrom Alabama wants to make remarks, go ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I will be very brief. This is a very \nimportant\n\n[[Page S5165]]\n\nmatter. Colombia is a longtime ally of the United States. It is the \nsecond oldest democracy in the Western Hemisphere. Its former \nPresident, President Pastrana--a wonderful person--worked exceedingly \nhard to try to build a peace process that would work. After everything \nhe tried, he could not make that occur.\n  The new President has been elected. President Pastrana--before he \nleft office--admitted that they had to fight to preserve their \ndemocracy. Democracies frequently have to do that.\n  We have a $9.5 billion trading relationship with Colombia. It is an \nimportant ally, an important democracy. It is key to South America. We \nmust do what we can to assist them as they now wage a life-and-death \nstruggle to preserve their democracy and their economy.\n  Mr. President, just 10 days ago the people of Colombia overwhelmingly \nexpressed their desire to fight the scourges of terrorism and narcotics \ntrafficking, that have killed tens of thousands of their countrymen \nover the past forty years, by electing Alvaro Uribe as their new \nPresident. President-elect Uribe has stated that he intends to double \nthe size of the Colombian Army and the Colombian National Police and to \ncall up thousands of reservists to fight the terrorists. This is \nexactly what the United States has been asking the Colombians to do for \nmany years now.\n  Included as part of this Supplemental request is proposed legislation \nthat would remove the ``counter-narcotics only'' restriction on the use \nof helicopters and other military equipment and assistance that the \nUnited States provides to Colombia.\n  The pending Amendment provides authority to the Department of \nDefense, as well as the Department of State, to provide assistance to \nthe government of Colombia as they fight their war against terrorism.\n  The Department of State has designated the Revolutionary Armed Forces \nof Colombia--FARC--the National Liberation Army of Colombia--ELN--and \nthe United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia--AUC--as foreign terrorist \norganizations and has specifically identified the FARC as ``the most \ndangerous international terrorist group based in the Western \nHemisphere.'' On March 18, 2002, Attorney General John Ashcroft \nannounced the indictment of three leaders of FARC with conspiracy to \nimport cocaine into the United States and to manufacture and distribute \ncocaine in Colombia with the intent of exporting it to the United \nStates. To all of these actions I say ``Amen''.\n  Transnational terrorism is a threat to freedom throughout the world. \nMany of these groups have been working together for years to share the \nlessons of terror and mayhem. They have searched for new sources of \nincome and have become inextricably involved with transnational \ncriminal syndicates who traffic in weapons and drugs and provide \nresources for extortion and money laundering.\n  This is a global phenomenon and must be fought on a global scale. One \ncountry that has been fighting this war against terrorism for the past \nfew decades is Colombia. Colombia is one of our closest Allies and we \nmust come to her aid. They need our help in terms of intelligence \nsharing, equipment and training.\n  Why should the United States help Colombia? The answer to this lies \nnot only in the fact that it is the source for prodigious quantities of \ncocaine, heroin, and marijuana, but Colombia is the second oldest \ndemocracy in the Western Hemisphere, next to our great country. \nColombia is a friend and ally of the United States who has been \nfighting for its very survival against a variety of threats, ranging \nfrom drug cartels, terrorist organizations and Marxist insurgents for \nover forty years. It is a nation of 40 million people and is a source \nof significant trade with the US. The United States is Colombia's \nprincipal trading partner with over $9.5 billion in annual trade \nbetween our two nations. When we help Colombia secure its own territory \nfrom the threat of overthrow from the Marxist narco-terrorists, we will \nalso help stabilize the neighboring countries in the Andean region from \nspillover effects of the drug trade and insurgency.\n  There are more acts of terrorism committed in Colombia every day than \nin all the other countries of the world combined. And make no mistake \nabout it, the forces that are acting to overthrow the democratically \nelected government of Colombia are terrorists. While their \norganizations did have their genesis as a ``people's revolution'' with \nMarxist ties they are now no more than terrorists. General Fernando \nTapias, Commander of the Colombian Armed Forces, stated recently that \nwhile the Army in the 1960s and 1970s used to find the writings of Marx \nand Lenin in the documents captured during raids on FARC hideouts now \nall they find are receipts and documentation of the smuggling of drugs, \npre-cursor chemicals used to process cocaine and weapons shipments.\n  The FARC, ELN and AUC get the vast majority of their funding from \nnarcotics trafficking. All three of these groups also obtains large \namounts of money from the terrorist tactics of kidnapping and \nextortion. FARC has extensive ties with international terrorist and \ncriminal organizations. Right now there are three members of the Irish \nRepublican Army in the custody of the government of Colombia after they \nwere arrested for providing training to the FARC on bombmaking and \nother terrorist tactics.\n  Colombian President Andres Pastrana was elected in 1998 on a platform \nthat called for making peace with the Marxist guerrillas that have \noperated in his country since the 1960s. He has engaged in negotiations \nwith the FARC and the ELN since before he took office. In fact, \nPresident Pastrana, in an act of good faith, gave total control of a \npiece of central Colombia the size of Switzerland, which was supposed \nto remain demilitarized, to the FARC as an enticement for continuing \nnegotiations. In the four years since President Pastrana opened \nnegotiations the FARC has continued to engage in narcotics trafficking \nand terrorist activities. In fact, in the past few months they have \nengaged in countless terrorist attacks throughout the country that have \nkilled hundreds of people. The FARC is responsible for the kidnapping \nof Colombian presidential candidate Ingrid Betancourt, who they still \nhold hostage. They tortured and murdered Colombian Senator Martha \nDaniels who was attempting to negotiate the release of two kidnapping \nvictims. And just a few months ago, they attempted to assassinate \nPresident-elect Alvaro Uribe with a car bomb that killed three civilian \nbystanders. In the face of these acts of terrorism, President Pastrana \ndeclared an end to peace negotiations and reclaimed the demilitarized \nzone that he ceded to the FARC. When the Colombian Armed Forces re-\ncaptured this territory they found that terrorists had been using the \nterritory for all kinds of illegal activity. The Colombian Army found \n27 new airstrips that were used for drug and weapons transports, \nnumerous drug laboratories and storage areas for pre-cursor drug \nprocessing chemicals, several training bases for terrorist activities \nthat were used by international terrorist organizations, and evidence \nthat 14 new guerrilla units had been established and trained in this \n``demilitarized'' zone. This was also the area where the FARC had \nlanded several hijacked aircraft and drastically increased the \nproduction of coca. So it is now undoubtedly clear that the FARC is not \ninterested in serious negotiations and does not want peace. They are \nonly interested in maintaining and expanding their narcotics funded \nterrorist activities.\n  The United States must do the right thing and support our friends and \nallies in Colombia. The government of Colombia has categorically stated \nthat they do not want US troops to come and fight their war for them. \nThey are willing and able to destroy this threat to their country and \nthe world. I am glad that the Administration has made the decision to \nrequest the removal of the counter-narcotics restrictions on our aid to \nColombia. Colombia is looking into the abyss and this threatens the \nentire Andean region.\n  Congress needs to pass this legislation so that we can keep up the \npressure on terrorists within our own hemisphere and across the globe.\n  I thank the Senator from Florida for his leadership. I am pleased to \njoin with him and stress this is an exceedingly important matter for \nus.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n[[Page S5166]]\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, everyone has spoken on one side.\n  I ask for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, one other perspective: For the record, \nthe FARC and ELN are involved in narcotrafficking up to their eyeballs. \nFor the record, the paramilitary and the AUC are involved in \nnarcotrafficking up to their eyeballs. For the record, two-thirds of \nthe extrajudicial killings last year were by the AUC and the \nparamilitary. And for the record, there is one documented case after \nanother after another about the military and the paramilitary being all \ntoo connected.\n  So before we provide direct military assistance and weapons that can \nbe used in counterinsurgency by the military, we ought to take a real \nclose look at what is going on in Colombia. I wanted to say that \ntonight. We will have debate later.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 3569 Withdrawn\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, offering this amendment was for the \npurpose of affording our colleagues an opportunity to express their \nstrong opinions and to indicate to the American people the great \nimportance of the relationship between our Nation and the peoples of \nColombia for our mutual well-being. As our colleague from Minnesota has \njust said, this is an issue that deserves full debate.\n  Given the hour of the night, given the fact that it is my hope that \nwhen this matter reaches conference, the Senate conferees will look \ncarefully at the proposals that our House colleagues have already \nadopted to allow the use of Department of Defense-funded equipment in \nthe war against terrorism as well as the counternarcotics war, I will \nask to withdraw the amendment and hope we will have an opportunity at a \nfuture date to have a full debate on the United States relationship \nwith Colombia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, for the information of our colleagues, we \nare getting closer to finalizing this bill. To my knowledge, there are \npossibly two additional amendments that will require rollcall votes. I \nalso think the time for debate on both of those can be fairly brief. We \nwill have a managers' amendment, and I guess we will have a vote on \nfinal passage.\n  I don't think we would have come this far had it not been for the \nvery competent and capable leadership of Senators Byrd and Stevens as \nwell as my colleague and friend, Senator Reid. To finish this bill, \nfrankly, for this many amendments and for the most part with votes \ntaken in one day is pretty remarkable.\n  I make one editorial comment. I thank the managers for supporting an \namendment offered by Senator Inhofe and myself dealing with $12 million \nfor restoration of the I-40 bridge in Oklahoma which was hit by barge \ntraffic. It caused 14 fatalities, the largest number of fatalities of \nany bridge accident in U.S. history. It also shut down east-west \ntraffic into our State. This is one of our major east-west corridors. \nIt is a major inconvenience not just for our State but for the entire \ncountry. We have some money, as requested by the Department of \nTransportation, in this bill. I thank my colleagues for their \nassistance in that proposal. Also, I particularly thank my colleague, \nSenator Inhofe, who is on the authorizing committee and worked very \nhard to make that happen. I compliment him for it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3588\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 3588 be called \nup.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Nickles] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3588.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To restore the discretion of the President to agree with \n             Congressionally-designated emergency spending)\n\n       Strike section 2002 of the bill.\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, this amendment is very straightforward. \nIt would strike section 2002 that is on page 116 of the bill. Section \n2002 deals with the emergency provisions in the bill.\n  I have been in the Senate for 22 years. We have never done this. Ever \nsince we have had emergency provisions in the bill, we have never done \nit. The impact of the amendment is that it prohibits the President from \nspending any money, any nondefense emergency spending in the bill \nunless he spends it all. That is not the way we have done emergencies \nunder the Clinton administration. That is not the way we have handled \nemergencies under President Bush's administration since 1990.\n  I will read the language in the bill on page 116:\n\n       Any amount appropriated in this Act that is designated by \n     Congress as emergency requirement pursuant to section \n     251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit \n     Control Act of 1985, as amended, shall not be available for \n     obligation unless all such amounts appropriated in this Act \n     are designated by the President, upon enactment of this Act, \n     as emergency requirements pursuant to that section.\n\n  What that means is, for nondefense, there are some sections in this \nbill and in the President's requirements calling for emergency \ndesignations. This says if he spends any of it, he has to spend it all. \nWe have never done this before. We didn't do that in the Clinton \nadministration. The Clinton administration had emergency requests every \nyear. We granted almost all of them plus some.\n  This President requested the emergency designation. He came to \nCongress and actually requested $24.47 billion in emergency assistance, \nemergency appropriations, and an additional 2.7 under contingency \nemergency appropriations. He requested that. We are getting ready to \ngive him more.\n  What has happened is, the House has already passed a bill. They \npassed a bill at $29 billion. The President's total was 27. The House \ncame back and said: We will give you the $27 billion you requested, and \nwe will do an additional $1.5 billion for defense. But the additional \n$1.5 billion for defense was under contingency. If the President \ndeclared it an emergency, he could spend it. But if he didn't, he \nwouldn't. So the President is basically saying: He still is getting his \n$27.3 billion of emergency assistance. He doesn't have to spend that \nadditional $1.5 billion. That is the way we have done it.\n  In other words, when we go into emergency spending, the special \ndesignation means it doesn't count. We have budgets every year. Until \nthis year, we have passed budgets. Those budgets have had targets. But \nwhen we have an emergency, we say it doesn't count towards the caps; we \nare going to waive it because there is a special emergency. Maybe we \nhave had an earthquake, a fire, a flood, serious damage, so we call \nthat an emergency. They were not budgeted, they were not planned, they \nwere not expected, such as the World Trade Center incident of 9-11. We \nhad a very significant, as a matter of fact, $40 billion emergency that \nwe paid for last year. But it was with the concurrence of the President \nand the Congress.\n  Now in this case we are saying: Mr. President, that is fine, we will \ntake your emergency, but you have to take all of our emergencies or you \ndon't get any of yours on nondefense. We have never done that before, \nto my knowledge.\n  I used to be on the Appropriations Committee. I happen to still be on \nthe Budget Committee. The Budget Committee should be outraged by this. \nEvery once in a while one committee kind of exceeds jurisdiction or \ngoes into the jurisdiction of another committee. That is what we are \ndoing right here. We have never had a supplemental appropriations bill, \nto my knowledge, that had language like this.\n\n  Incidentally, this has the attention of the administration. The \nadministration's position basically states that they will veto the bill \nif this is in there. I will read from the administration's statement of \npolicy dated June 4, the first page:\n\n       In addition, the bill severely constrains the President's \n     ability to fund emergency homeland requirements by compelling \n     him to release nonemergency money provided in the bill. If \n     the supplemental appropriation bill were presented to the \n     President in its current form, his senior advisors would \n     recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n\n[[Page S5167]]\n\n\n  That is on the first page. On the third page of the statement of \nadministration policy it says:\n\n       The Senate version of the bill also unduly restricts the \n     President's prerogatives in numerous areas. First, it \n     requires the President to designate all or none of the \n     nondefense funding contained in the bill as an emergency. The \n     Budget Enforcement Act provides that the President retain \n     control over the release of emergency funds added by Congress \n     to ensure that the funds respond to critical emergency needs. \n     By contravening in this long established budget enforcement \n     mechanism, the Senate would require the President to waste \n     taxpayers' dollars on low priority, nonemergency items in \n     order to access vital, high priority homeland security \n     recovery funding.\n\n  It is very clear, the administration is adamantly opposed to this \nprovision. This is as direct a veto threat as we have had from this \nadministration in their time in office. It is reversing a precedent we \nhave followed on emergency spending for the last 13 years.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. NICKLES. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Can he give an example, to those of us who are not \nexperts on the budgetary process, of what the President might not \ndecide to spend and then would be forced to spend?\n  Mr. NICKLES. To give an example--I appreciate the question--there are \na lot of things in this bill. My friend from Arizona pointed out a \ncouple of them earlier today. There is one where the President said, \nsome of these provisions don't relate to homeland security, including \n$11 million to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, \nNOAA, for economic assistance to New England fishing and fishing \ncommunities; $26.8 million for the USGS survey for urban mapping \nactivities. The administration said that is not urgent; it wasn't \nrequested.\n  If section 2002 is not stricken, those things will have to be funded \nor you don't get funding for New York City. You don't get funding for \nhomeland security needs that are requested. There is billions of \ndollars in here that the President did request that we are putting in \njeopardy because of this bill's ``all or nothing'' approach.\n  We do that on normal appropriations. We don't do it on emergency \nbills. The reason we don't do it on emergency bills is that the \nemergency bills are outside the budget. They are special. They are \nfigures over and above set spending levels. We have agreed to a budget. \nWe have agreed to caps. We shake hands. That is what we are going to \nabide by. But when it comes to emergencies, we say we are going to \nwaive the budget. The budget no longer applies. Therefore, caps no \nlonger apply.\n  This is the national emergency. That is what we passed, the $40 \nbillion following the World Trade Center. It is a national emergency. \nWe agreed to do it. Usually, we do it with overwhelming majorities, if \nit is truly an emergency. This is saying, well, before you get part of \nthat emergency, you have to take the entire thing.\n  All I am saying is that previous Presidents have always said we have \nto concur. When we made the budget deal--and this goes back, I tell my \ncolleagues to Andrews Air Force Base in 1990. That basically said if \nyou are going to have caps, cases in which we have an emergency might \npose a problem. So we put in emergency provisions, and you can waive \nthe caps if there is truly an emergency, and that could be designated \nif it is agreed upon by both Congress and the administration.\n  Now we are saying if Congress has it in there, Mr. President, you \nhave to take it all, or you don't get a dime. I think that is an \ninfringement on the budget process.\n  I think the emergency process all together is a big waiver of the \nbudget, a big way to get around budgets, one of the reasons why \nspending can grow astronomically. It has grown dramatically over the \nlast few years. If we allow this provision, I think we are opening up \nthe door to greater abuse of the emergency provisions.\n  Very quickly and briefly I urge colleagues to strike section 2002 and \nkeep the emergency provisions we have had for the last 13 years at \nleast the same as they are. Let's not change them. We have a new \nPresident. Why should we curtail his authority, vis-a-vis his \npredecessors? I think that would open the door to a lot of spending and \nabuse of the emergency process. I urge my colleagues to strike section \n2002.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, let me try to set this in historical \ncontext. In 1990, in the so-called budget summit agreement, a decision \nwas made to allow the Congress and the President, acting jointly, to \ndeclare items emergency items and, therefore, allow the spending on \nthat item to operate outside the budget process. In other words, where \nthe President and the Congress agreed that something was an emergency, \nthen the budget process did not apply. But what was required to make it \nan emergency was two things: The President said it was an emergency and \nCongress said it was an emergency, and the combination of the two \ntriggered the exemption.\n  Now, I have been here a long time, and my memory fades, but I don't \nbelieve that we have ever had a provision such as the one in this bill \nbecause in this bill we have a situation where there is $14 billion of \nfunding that the President did not say was an emergency. Congress says \nit is an emergency and, therefore, by the definition of the emergency \nwaiver that was written into permanent law in 1990, this $14 billion \nwould not qualify. It would not qualify because it only has half of the \naction that is required to provide the emergency. It has Congress \nsaying it is an emergency, but the President says it is not an \nemergency.\n  This bill gets around that 1990 permanent law provision by saying the \nPresident has a choice. He can take the whole bill as a deemed \nemergency or he cannot spend any part of it as an emergency. In other \nwords, it overrides the President's prerogative in this process by \nsaying to him that under the law you had to say it was an emergency and \nCongress had to say it was an emergency, and you had to be talking \nabout the same thing. But now we want to spend $14 billion that you say \nis not an emergency. We have $18 billion in the bill that you say is an \nemergency and we say is an emergency. But we are not going to let you \nspend that $18 billion unless you spend our $14 billion and say it is \nan emergency. So this is a complete perversion of that emergency \nwaiver.\n\n  Now, I have to say that the waiver has been probably the most misused \npart of every budget that has been adopted since 1990. If I had known \nthen at Andrews Air Force Base what I know today, I would have never \nagreed to this waiver because it has been abused over and over again. \nBut it has never been abused--at least to the best of my knowledge--the \nway it is being abused today because the President is being forced to \nmake this an emergency, even though he did not designate it, in order \nto get the genuine emergency money which he designated and Congress \napproved. I think this really perverts the process, and I really \nbelieve this amendment ought to be adopted.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How long has the Senator been involved in budgetary \nissues?\n  Mr. GRAMM. For 24 years.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And the Senator has never seen anything like this in \nthose 24 years?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Not that I can recall. So many things have gone by my old \neyes; there may have been something, but I don't remember it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. As the Senator knows, we will not have a budget this \nyear.\n  Mr. GRAMM. It sure enough looks like we are not going to have one.\n  Mr. McCAIN. With this new wrinkle, or new provision, in the \nappropriations bill, that really does give all power to the \nAppropriations Committee, even overriding any authority that the \nPresident might have, doesn't it?\n  Mr. GRAMM. In one sense it does, and in one sense it doesn't. In all \nfairness, this doesn't make the President spend a single penny of this \nmoney. But he cannot spend a penny of it unless he designates all of it \nin an emergency. The way this is being used, it doesn't make the \nPresident spend the money, but it says that if the President is going \nto spend the $18 billion that Congress and the President agree on as \nbeing an emergency, he cannot spend a penny of that unless he also \ndesignates this $14 billion that he says\n\n[[Page S5168]]\n\nis not an emergency. The Appropriations Committee says it is an \nemergency and, obviously, if Congress passes it, we will say that. So \nthe President has to spend it as an emergency if he is to get a penny \nof the $18 billion. But he could, theoretically, under this, sign the \nbill and then not spend any of it. But, obviously, it puts him in the \nposition that he cannot get this $18 billion of homeland security funds \nunless he takes this $14 billion he doesn't want and counts it as an \nemergency so it doesn't come under the budget process, and that is the \nperversion of the system I was talking about.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I don't like to drag out the debate, but I ask the \nSenator this. This seems to me like it is almost a constitutional \nissue.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Well, there is certainly a separation of powers issue. \nWhether it gets to the constitutional level or not, I don't know. The \npoint is, this is taking away the President's role in the emergency \ndesignation by changing the system so that he cannot get any of the \nmoney, even the amount we agree is a genuine emergency, when the \nPresident says so and we say so. Therefore, by law, that makes it an \nemergency. He cannot get a penny of that money unless he takes the $14 \nbillion that he says is not an emergency, but he has to say it is an \nemergency to get the other $18 billion.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Texas and \nother Senators--I believe the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma made \nthe same statement--say that this is a precedent. Am I correct?\n  Mr. GRAMM. As far as I am aware, it is a precedent. As I said, I \nhaven't gone back and researched it, but I don't remember one.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me state to the Senate the real precedent. It was \nenacted by this Congress when it was under the control of the \nRepublican Party--both Houses--in 2001. It was in title I of the bill \nmaking appropriations for Kosovo and other national security matters.\n  Here is what the provision said at that time:\n\n       Section 126. Any amount appropriated in this chapter that \n     is designated by the Congress as an emergency requirement \n     pursuant to section 251(B)(2)(a) of the Balanced Budget and \n     Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended, shall not \n     be available for obligation unless all--\n\n  Not just part--\n\n     unless all such amounts are designated by the President upon \n     enactment of this Act as emergency requirements pursuant to \n     such section.\n\n  That was the precedent, and I voted for it, and the Senator from \nTexas voted for it.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Are you sure I voted for it?\n  Mr. BYRD. I voted for it then, and I am for it now.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If the Senator will yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Oh, I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I do not know if I voted for it or not, but it was a bad \nprecedent.\n  (Laughter.)\n  Mr. BYRD. I have been to many a revival meeting, and when the altar \ncall came, the Senators hit the sawdust trail. The Senator remembers \nBilly Sunday, that great evangelist. So that is a time for admitting \none's errors. Maybe I was in error then, but I voted with the \nRepublican-controlled Congress and against my own President in that \ninstance.\n  What we are doing here tonight is certainly not a precedent. We are \njust following in the wake. It was that language that gave us the idea. \nThat was the precedent. Without that, we might not have thought of \nthis.\n  Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment to strike \nsection 2002 of the bill. Congress should be proud of the lead it has \ntaken in funding homeland defense programs that will help prevent, \ndetect, and respond to potential terrorist attacks.\n  Last year, we acted on a bipartisan basis to provide $10 billion for \nhomeland defense programs. Last year, in the face of a veto threat from \nthe President, this Congress, this Appropriations Committee added $4 \nbillion more than what was requested by the President. That money is \nbeing well spent, and it is making a difference. The veto was \nthreatened then. So we have heard that before.\n  We have a responsibility to use our own judgment in behalf of the \nAmerican people, in behalf of the security of this homeland. We should \nmake our own judgment. No President sends any Senator here. Calling him \nthe Commander in Chief, if you will--that is what the Constitution says \nhe is, but I do not think that has a thing to do with this bill.\n  I have heard that term thrown around here today, the ``Commander in \nChief.'' No Commander in Chief sends me here. No Commander in Chief \nsends the Senator from Vermont here. No Commander in Chief sends the \nSenator from Louisiana here. No Commander in Chief sends the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas here. He comes here by virtue of the \nwisdom and good judgment of the good people of Texas. Thank God. We are \nnot made or unmade by any President. I have served not under but \ncertainly with, I believe, 10 or 11 Presidents. None of them sent me \nhere, Democrats and Republicans.\n  I have stood by the principles that I see as being important \nprinciples in upholding the prerogatives of this institution and the \nConstitution, and I have stood against; I have opposed the wishes of \nDemocrat Presidents in this regard, and I opposed those Republican \nPresidents. It does not make any difference to me who is President. He \nputs on his trousers just like I put mine on, two legs at a time, two \nlegs at a time. Some say you cannot do that, but you can.\n\n  (Laughter.)\n  I have tried it. You can. If you do not believe it, just sit down in \na chair and pull them on both legs.\n  (Laughter.)\n  I like this man from Texas. He will smile, he will yield, and he is \nnot only a good Senator, but he is a good sport.\n  Mr. President, I have seen Presidents come and go. I have never bowed \nand scraped to any of them. I do not expect the people to bow and \nscrape to me, and I do not expect to do that to any President. I am for \nusing Robert Byrd's judgment, as far as my votes are concerned. Paul \nSarbanes will use his own judgment.\n  We are not here at the beck and call of any President, even if he is \nthe Commander in Chief. We have our own judgments on this. This \ncommittee, on a bipartisan basis, supported by the Republicans, 14 of \nthem, and 15 Democrats, reported out this bill. We had hearings. Those \nhearings were attended by Republicans and Democrats to ask questions. \nWe heard people from the local level. I have said this before but \nshould say it again. We heard the firefighters. We heard the policemen. \nWe heard the health personnel. We heard mayors. We heard Governors. We \nheard county commissioners. We heard seven Department heads in the \nexecutive branch. We heard the Director of FEMA. And based on those \nhearings, this committee, in its considered judgment, elected to \nincrease the amount by $3 billion.\n  We increased the amount by $4 billion last year. That money has made \na difference. I have stated already what is being done with that money, \n$4 billion more than the President requested. This year it is $3 \nbillion more.\n  Let's use our own judgment. Let's not be here at the beck and call of \nany President. I am here because the people of West Virginia sent me \nhere, and so is every other Senator here because of the people of their \nState.\n  I hear all this business about Commander in Chief. I get a little \ntired of hearing Commander in Chief, Commander in Chief. Under the \nEnglish history, there were commanders in chief all over the continent, \nall over the islands. So they were called commanders in chief. So what, \nCommander in Chief.\n  The Constitution says the Congress will enact the laws. It will have \nall power herein provided to enact laws. It says that the Congress will \nmake the appropriations of moneys. So let's use our own judgment.\n  Mr. President, I will not be much longer. I emphasized in my opening \nremarks on this bill that Congress came together on a bipartisan basis \nto increase funding for homeland defense programs, and that funding is \nnow making a difference.\n  I do not understand why my friend from Oklahoma, who offers this \namendment, would want to give the President what would essentially be a \nline-item veto. In other words, he can pick and choose. No, when it \ncomes to defense,\n\n[[Page S5169]]\n\nthere will be emergencies, but when it comes to homeland defense, \nnondefense spending, then he can pick and choose. He does not have to \ncall that an emergency.\n  What do Senators think will happen? The President, in my judgment, \nwill certainly support the making of an emergency on defense moneys, \nbut when it comes to homeland defense, he may or he may not. So why \nshould we give him that authority to pick and choose? The Supreme Court \nturned down the line-item veto which I opposed on this floor and which \nseveral Senators here--Mr. Sarbanes and Mr. Reid and others--opposed. \nNow we have it in a different form. This is a kind of line-item veto. \nThe President can pick and choose. I am not for that.\n  Which programs would the President choose not to make available? The \nfirefighter equipment and training funds? The port security grants? The \nmoney for the Coast Guard? The money for the Customs Service to inspect \ncargo containers overseas when we currently inspect only 2 percent of \nour imports? Or how about the money for making sure our first \nresponders, our police, our fire and emergency medical care personnel \nhave communications equipment that is interoperable?\n  The one thing we do know is that the President has already designated \nas an emergency $1.6 billion for foreign aid. Why would we want the \nPresident to have the authority to use the emergency designation for \n$1.6 billion of foreign aid but not require him to designate the \nhomeland defense fund as an emergency?\n  This amendment is not just about homeland defense. If this amendment \nwere adopted, it would allow the President to not release $275 million \nfor veterans' medical care. How about that? It would allow him not to \nrelease the $80 million for the Sierra Grande fire victims. How about \nthat? It would allow him not to release $1 billion for the Pell grant \nshortfall. How about that? Do we want to give the President that kind \nof authority? No, not I.\n  I want to assure all Senators that there is precedent for this \nlanguage, as I indicated at the beginning of my remarks. I urge all \nSenators to stand by their priorities, stand by their people back home, \nand oppose this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, the Senator from West Virginia, our \nchairman, is correct. I was chairman of the committee at the time we \nimposed the same requirement on the past President. I have further \nmemories of some of the bills we have passed in which we said the \nPresident could not spend specific monies until he had obligated \nothers. We have had ways through our career in appropriations of making \ncertain that the congressional priorities were met as the President \nexecuted his powers under the Constitution.\n  I have another reason for supporting the provisions in the bill. I do \nsay parenthetically I know the House of Representatives has the same \nfeelings as expressed by the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator from \nTexas. We are probably going to have to work out some sort of a \ncompromise before the bill is through.\n  I want a bill that will be signed by the President, but my problem is \nthis: After the disasters of September 11, the President requested \nfunds from the Congress, and he requested $10 billion--no hearings, no \nstrings attached, just $10 billion, no accounting whatsoever to the \nCongress. We granted that. He then also wanted another $10 billion, and \nthis time we said we would like to know how he was going to spend it, \nso we agreed that we would get an accounting for those monies after \nthey were spent, which is entirely contrary to existing law and our \nprocedures.\n  Following that, he asked for more money. As the Senator from West \nVirginia said, we added $4 billion to the monies he requested, and that \nmoney was in accordance with the normal procedures. Every dime the \nPresident asked for was appropriated.\n\n  When we look at what we have done this year, we have labored hard \nover the debate on homeland security. I am delighted to hear the \nPresident's proposal tonight about the creation of a new Department of \nHomeland Security. I think most of us have wanted that from the very \nbeginning. In any event, we have also had some priorities that have \ncome to us from our various States and from people who have been \ninvolved in security in the United States for a long time, and they \nhave pointed out a great many things.\n  One, for instance, is the incompatibility of our communications \nsystems. Our communications systems are not national. As a matter of \nfact, if we think about it, every function of government--Federal, \nState and local--in the United States awards the contracts to the \nlowest bidder. There is no requirement that when they buy radios or any \nkind of communications equipment, they be able to communicate with the \npeople in the next county, let alone the next State or let alone \nnationally. We found that out in New York when so many of the fire \ntrucks and ambulances that came into New York could not be used because \nthey could not answer the dispatcher. No one could tell them where to \ngo or what to do.\n  In hearings, we have discovered from FEMA, the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, the horrendous burden we have now of trying to make \nfirst responders capable of interacting with anybody who comes to help \nthem. That is something that has not been done so far. We have some \nmoney in the bill to start that process.\n  My point is this: We are entitled to have some say in what is spent \nnow to prevent further emergencies and to deal with those as they come \nup, God forbid, when they do come up. I believe we are entitled to say \nto the President, we have worked with you, we have tried to work with \nyou, but we have some priorities we ask you to recognize and to concur \nin. If it were not for the fact that we have the necessity of going to \nan emergency because the existing budget does not allow us any further \nfunds--by that I mean we had a budget for this year, we have fulfilled \nthat budget--any amounts in addition to that now must be by virtue of \nan emergency. The President himself requested these monies on the basis \nof an emergency or they were offset partially.\n  What we are saying in this bill is, after these hearings, after the \nlong debates we have had, both last year and now on this subject, we \nhave some priorities. We want the President to recognize those, and we \nwill allocate the monies we believe should be allocated before we agree \nto this additional money that he wants.\n  I know the OMB does not like that. They do not like it any more than \nI like it every time when we make a change in an appropriations bill, \nthat is called a congressional add-on. That request is something made \nby an elected representative to the Congress and not made by request \nfrom some unknown bureaucratic and the millions of people who work for \nthe Departments. Anything they want comes through, and no one \nchallenges it. No one challenges it at all.\n  The appropriations process affects about 3 percent of the total \nbudget. Our budget now is about $700 billion for this year. We change \nless than 3 percent. In terms of the total budget of the United States, \ntotal expenditures, $1.7 billion, if one looks at it, we do not even \ncontrol half of that in terms of the appropriations process anymore. \nThe entitlement created by the Finance Committee, the Ways and Means \nCommittee, spent $1.1 billion this year. We will spend about $700 \nbillion through the total process of the appropriations, but we are \ngoing to change less than 3 percent.\n\n  On this bill, we have changed a little less than $4 billion. Last \nyear, we changed $4 billion in the bills that were signed.\n  Now, what is all the hullabaloo about? Are we entitled to have any \nrole in setting the priorities for spending for homeland defense? Are \nwe allowed to have any priorities in terms of spending of the balance \nof the monies that are available to us through offsets in this year?\n  I would like to work it out with the bureau of the budget, and I \nwould like to have some accommodation of views. One of the \naccommodations I want is that if we make a recommendation pursuant to \nour constitutional powers to spend specific money in a specific way, it \nis not going to be put aside because it is a congressional add-on but \neverything that has been requested by\n\n[[Page S5170]]\n\nsome agency of the Federal Government is going to be spent without any \nfurther review.\n  Of all the monies that come through this Congress, the monies in the \nsupplemental appropriations bill get more attention than anything else. \nWe pass 13 bills, and we pass them usually very quickly. They are \npretty well debated among us. But in terms of the items in them, they \ndo not get the attention that the supplemental bills do. The \nsupplemental bills, of necessity, are additions to the current year. We \nhave authorized expenditures and appropriated expenditures for this \nyear. This adds to that amount.\n  I think the Senator from West Virginia deserves a lot of credit for \nhaving stood for the proposition that we should not enlarge this bill \nbeyond the scope that the President will approve. We have had to vote \nagainst things that each one of us agrees with. Twice today we voted \nagainst things on a point of order that we would like to see approved, \nbut because of our roles we must hold the line and try to get a bill \nthe President will approve.\n  When we get to conference, we will try to get a bill the President \nwill approve. I know he wants this bill. I know the Nation needs this \nbill. I regret that it does not have the debt ceiling change in it. I \nregret that we do not have a provision that establishes some mechanism \nfor handling the 13 bills we have yet to handle in this Congress. We do \nnot have a budget yet. Before we start the process for appropriations, \nI hope we have it. I hope the Senate will let us take this to \nconference.\n  I have said to my friend from West Virginia, the chairman of our \ncommittee, I know we want to get the President to sign it and currently \nhis people say he is objecting to this very much.\n\n  But in the final analysis, maybe we can select out of this whole bill \nsome of the things that will be available and go back to the old \nprovision we used to use. In other words, he cannot get the money he \nwants until we obligate the money we want. I did that as chairman \nseveral times with a President of a different party.\n  What is wrong with doing it now when the roles are changed? My \nfriend, as chairman today, has accorded himself with great distinction \nas chairman of the Appropriations Committee in facing up to the \nproblems we have had today. I intend to stay with him and make a motion \nto table this amendment.\n  First, I want to give time to anyone who wants a chance for a \nrebuttal.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I don't want to make a rebuttal but try to save the Senate \na little time. The only thing I know that remains to be done is a point \nof order against the bill. I don't think it will change a single vote. \nIf we could agree to let me make the point of order and then have these \ntwo votes back to back, we could save people some time--if we wanted to \ndo that.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is above my pay grade.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I move to table.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent that I be able to make a point of \norder against the bill and that, when that point of order is made, the \nSenator from Alaska be immediately recognized to move to table the \npending amendment, and that those two votes occur back to back, with \nthe vote on the motion to table to occur first and then the motion to \nwaive this point of order to occur second. By doing it that way we save \npeople some time. Given that it is 9:30, that would probably be \nwelcome.\n  Mr. BYRD. How much time did we have for making some comments?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I don't need to make any. If you want to make some \ncomments, you have all the time you need.\n  Mr. BYRD. I will want to move to waive the Gramm point of order for \nnondefense emergency in the bill.\n  Mr. GRAMM. If that unanimous consent request is agreed to, I would go \nahead and then make a point of order and the Senator can move to waive \nit.\n  Mr. BYRD. Is the Senator going to make any remarks in support of his \npoint?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I would say we have spoken all day. I think people know \nwhat the issue is. This really questions whether everything in the bill \nis an emergency. It is that simple. As provided in section 205(b) of \nHouse Con. Res. 290, I raise a point of order against the emergency \ndesignation on the nondefense spending items.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I move to waive the Gramm point of order.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am in opposition to the amendment to \nstrike section 2002 of the bill. Congress should be proud of the lead \nthat it has taken in funding homeland defense programs that will help \nprevent, detect and respond to potential terrorist attacks. Last year, \nwe acted together on a bipartisan basis and provided $10 billion for \nhomeland defense programs, $4 billion more than was requested by the \nPresident.\n  Last December, President Bush threatened to veto the Defense \nAppropriations bill if it contained funding for homeland defense \nprograms that he regarded as excessive. Last November, Homeland \nSecurity Director Tom Ridge wrote me and said, ``no additional \nresources beyond what the President has already requested are needed at \nthis time.''\n  Yet, as I emphasized in my opening remarks on this bill, the Congress \ncame together on a bi-partisan basis to increase funding for homeland \ndefense programs and that funding is now making a difference. Over \n2,200 more INS border agents and Customs inspectors are being hired. \nThe INS is now implementing a system for tracking foreign students in \nthis country. Our police, fire and medical personnel are getting better \ntraining and equipment for detecting and responding to potential \nbiological, chemical or nuclear attacks. The FBI is hiring hundreds of \nnew agents. 750 more food inspectors and investigators are being hired. \nThe number of ports with Food and Drug Administration investigators is \nbeing doubled. 324 additional protective personnel are being hired to \nprotect our nuclear weapons complex, and additional resources are being \nspent on efforts to destroy or secure nuclear materials overseas.\n  I do not understand why the Senator offering this amendment would \nwant to give the President what would essentially be line item veto \nauthority over the homeland defense funds contained in this bill. If \nthis amendment is adopted, the President would be able to completely \ndisregard the priorities contained in this bill.\n  Which programs would the President choose not to make available, the \nfirefighter equipment and training funds, the port security grants, the \nmoney for the Coast Guard, the money for the Customs Service to inspect \ncargo containers overseas when we currently inspect only 2 percent of \nour imports, or how about the money for making sure that our first \nresponders, our police, fire and emergency medical care personnel have \ncommunications equipment that are interoperable?\n  One thing we do know is that the President has already designated as \nan emergency $1.6 billion for foreign aid. Why would we want the \nPresident to have the authority to use the emergency designation for \n$1.6 billion of foreign aid but not require him to designate the \nhomeland defense funds as an emergency?\n  And this amendment is not just about homeland defense. If this \namendment were adopted, it would allow the President to not release \n$275 million for Veterans Medical Care. It would allow him to not \nrelease the $80 million for the Cerro Grande fire victims. It would \nallow him to not release $1 billion for the Pell grant shortfall.\n  Finally, Mr. President, I want to assure all Senators that there is \nprecedent for this language. In fact, two years ago, the Republican \nHouse and the Republican Senate approved substantially the same \nlanguage on a fiscal year 2000 supplemental appropriations bill for \nPresident Clinton. I supported that bill, when the conference\n\n[[Page S5171]]\n\nreport passed the Senate on a voice vote.\n  I urge all Senators to stand by their priorities and oppose this \namendment.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I move to table the amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Bingaman), \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Daschle), and the Senator from \nMinnesota (Mr. Dayton) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms), the Senator from Colorado (Mr. Campbell), and the Senator from \nSouth Carolina (Mr. Thurmond) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, the Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3759\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senate \namendment No. 3759 relating to resources for the Food and Drug \nAdministration be recalled.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, for many years now, it has been abundantly \nclear to many of us that one of the most important Federal agencies, \nthe Food and Drug Administration, FDA, is woefully underfunded. It was \nfor that reason that I reluctantly agreed to pharmaceutical user fees \nin 1992, even though I preferred that safety and efficacy review of new \ndrugs remain a government function.\n  Integrally related to the operations of the FDA are the agency's \nfacility needs. Studies dating back to 1976 have cited serious \ndeficiencies in FDA's facilities. For example, one 1976 FDA study found \nthat the condition of agency laboratories at five of nine locations \nwere ``unacceptable.'' Another two labs were found to be ``marginal,'' \nand the remaining two were cited as ``generally suitable'' with some \nmarginal deficiencies. Many of these deficiencies remain today.\n  As long ago as 1988, the Labor and Human Resources Committee \nrecognized this fact by approving legislation I authored, S. 2468, the \nFood and Drug Administration Revitalization Act. Enacted in 1990 as \nPublic Law 101-635, this\n\n[[Page S5172]]\n\nlaw improved FDA's resources in a number of areas, including, most \nimportantly, granting the Secretary and the General Services \nAdministration enhanced authority to modernize and improve FDA's real \nproperty needs.\n  I still recall the motivation for that legislation as if it were \ntoday, the shocking reports we read about FDA facilities being \nscattered across far-flung locations. I remember hearing of renowned \nscientists literally working in converted chicken coops. More recently, \nin 1996, one FDA official testified before that Congress that FDA was \nscattered in more than 40 buildings, many with outdated and \nunacceptable laboratories, in more than 18 different locations. For an \nagency that is responsible for one-quarter of every consumer dollar, \nfor an agency that makes decisions that are literally life and death, \nthat was--and is--simply unacceptable.\n  A number of us, including Senator Mikulski and Senator Kennedy, and \non the House side, Representative Connie Morella, have been working to \naccomplish a consolidation of the FDA headquarters in one location. It \nis our belief that this enhanced, state-of-the-art facility will enable \nthe agency to operate more efficiently. In short, we will be enabling \nagency personnel to do the job that the American people expect of them.\n  Through the Base Realignment and Closure Act process, the Naval \nSurface Warfare Center in White Oak, Maryland, was transferred to the \nGeneral Services Administration (GSA). This property will be used \npursuant to the FDA Revitalization Act to consolidate new laboratories, \noffice buildings, and support facilities of FDA's most important \nfunctions: the Office of the Commissioner; the Office of Regulatory \nAffairs; the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research; the Center for \nDevices and Radiological Health; and the Center for Biologics \nEvaluation and Research. If there were a dietary supplement center, I \nfeel certain it would go there as well. I was encouraged to learn that, \nunder the most recent plan, 6,235 headquarters personnel would be \nlocated in over 2.3 million square feet of office and laboratory space.\n\n  Unfortunately, though, our history of financial support for the \nconsolidation is not as promising. For example, by 1994, a total of \n$325 million had been provided for the project, but $228 million of \nthat was rescinded in FY 1995 based on concerns about the scope of the \nproject as well as its location. The current budget only proposes $5.5 \nmillion for FY 2003, delaying the project by an estimated year and \nresulting in almost $23 million in increased costs due to commercial \nlease extensions, delays in design and construction, and the impact on \nmanagement and inspection of the project.\n  This delay would have the most adverse effect on the Center for \nDevices and Radiological Health, CDRH, which occupies seven leased \nbuildings in Rockville. Efficient operations of CDRH are critically \nimportant for my home state of Utah, which is proud to be the home base \nfor literally dozens of thriving medical device manufacturers. They \nneed to be able to count on FDA to maintain its gold standard review of \ndevices to assure the public of their safety and efficacy. This is \nincreasingly hard for FDA personnel to do, given that one of the two \ndevice labs is about 40 years old and in need of considerable \nattention. In fact, I am advised by the GSA that this CDRH lab is in \n``extensive disrepair''. The ventilation system is old and at risk of \nfailure, and the owner has blocked even temporary repairs.\n  The unfortunate events of September 11 have made this consolidation \neven more crucial. Many FDA facilities are currently leased and \nphysical security varies by building. The new complex will improve \nsecurity dramatically, both for current employees, and for the 128 \nadditional headquarters personnel funded by the counter-terrorism \nappropriation.\n  In short, I remain discouraged by our lack of progress on this \nproject over the last 15 years or so. I recognize that resources are \nconstrained, but providing the FDA with necessary resources to assure \npublic health and safety is a very important government function that \nneeds to be funded.\n  In an effort to provide new funds for this project, and to reassure \nthe thousands of FDA employees that we are behind them and their \nimportant work, earlier this week Senators Mikulski, Kennedy and I \nproposed that the record $500 million settlement resolving quality-\ncontrol problems at four Schering-Plough factories be devoted to the \nFDA consolidated headquarters. We believe it is entirely fitting that \nthis pharmaceutical money be used to improve the operations of the FDA, \nrather than being dispersed into the general receipts of the Treasury.\n  Unfortunately, it now appears that a budget point of order would be \nlodged against our amendment, despite its important purpose. Therefore, \ndeferring to the guidance of our colleagues on the Appropriations \nCommittee, and recognizing the administration's serious concerns about \nthe overall costs of the bill, I am reluctantly recalling this \namendment. However, I am encouraged that the subcommittee chairman and \nranking Republican member have indicated their willingness to work with \nus during formulation of the FY 2003 Treasury-Postal bill, and we \nintend to work closely with them to provide this necessary funding in \nthe weeks to come.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada objects.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Reserving the right to object, I am sorry; I did not hear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may not reserve the right to \nobject.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. I asked unanimous consent the call of the quorum be \nterminated.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are going to try to work our way through \nthis in various stages. The first stage is a group of amendments that \neveryone has agreed to--good guys, bad guys, those in between.\n  I send this list of amendments to the desk and ask the clerk to read \nthem individually, report them individually.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendments.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3676, As Modified\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Leahy, for \n     himself and Mr. McConnell, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3676, as modified.\n\n  Mr. REID. I waive further reading of the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 67, line 19, strike ``established'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``committed, in writing, to establish''.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3677\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada, [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Leahy, for \n     himself and Mr. McConnell, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3677.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 67, line 17, strike ``inaugurated'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``elected''.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3678\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada, [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Leahy, for \n     himself and Mr. McConnell, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3678.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 67, line 15, strike ``certify'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``report.''\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3679\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada, [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Leahy, for \n     himself and Mr. McConnell, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3679.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 68, line 12, after ``or'' insert ``United States''.\n\n[[Page S5173]]\n\n                    Amendment No. 3680, As Modified\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada, [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Leahy, for \n     himself and Mr. McConnell, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3680, as modified.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 68, line 6, strike ``dedicated'' and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``committed, in writing, to support''.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3696\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada, [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Leahy, for \n     himself and Mr. McConnell, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3696.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 63, line 15, strike ``or subsequent Acts''.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3697\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada, [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Leahy, for \n     himself and Mr. McConnell, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3697.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 60, line 4, strike ``and equipment'' and insert in \n     lieu thereof ``, equipment and related assistance''.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3698\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada, [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Leahy, for \n     himself and Mr. McConnell, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3698.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 63, line 19, strike ``may'' and everything that \n     follows through ``Initiative'' on line 20, and insert in lieu \n     thereof ``shall be made available for any of the programs and \n     activities identified in clause (i) to improve the lives of \n     the Colombian people''.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3715\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada, [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Leahy, for \n     himself and Mr. McConnell, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3715.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 63, line 12, strike ``ownership share of'' and \n     insert in lieu thereof ``financial interest in''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say to all the Members, these \namendments are offered on behalf of Senator Leahy. I think without \nexception they have been cosponsored by Senator McConnell.\n  Mr. LOTT. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. As I indicated to the Senators, the two managers approve \nthese amendments, and they have been through the cleansing operation. \nThese amendments have been available for people to look at. One I \nlooked at changes the word ``election'' to ``inauguration,'' dealing \nwith the matters in Central or South America.\n  So I think it would be to everyone's best interests--I don't think we \nneed to go through each one of these and debate them. That is because \nwe also know then we are going to ask consent that a list of the \nmanagers' amendments on which we have not had general agreement, that \nwe will ask that be sent to the desk after we get this accepted, and \nthen there will be rulings on the germaneness of a number of these that \nhave not been approved.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I have an inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I wanted to inquire if the Senator would consider \namendment No. 3581, to which I believe there is no objection. Although \nit may not be technically germane, I do not believe there is objection \nto No. 3581, to add to that list.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Louisiana, we have been told by the \nParliamentarian that is not germane. We would have to pass that and we \nmight have trouble doing that at this time.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I understand that, just as long as we have had \nopportunity to consider it, is my question.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, let us adopt a group of amendments. We \nare going to get to a number of amendments like yours that are \nnongermane. These have been approved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield, I would say your amendment No. \n3581 is on a list that would be given an opportunity to be considered, \nor acted on in some way, once we get this noncontroversial list that \nwas offered agreed to. We are trying to move forward on the process.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Mississippi. I understand it \nhas no objection, so I wanted to make sure it would have a chance to \ncome up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the amendments that have just been \nsent to the desk be adopted en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, the \namendments are adopted en bloc.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3676, as modified, through 3680, as modified, \n3696, 3697, 3698, and 3715) were agreed to en bloc.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would say to all Members, this is a very \nimportant bill. We know that or we would not be working going on the \nmidnight hour. There has been a tremendous amount of work done by staff \nand by the two managers of the bill. We are now at a stage where the \nend is in sight. Just because that is the case, it doesn't necessarily \nmean we are going to get to the end.\n  I ask the cooperation of all Members to work with us here a little \nbit. If there is something we feel strongly about, we will explain to \nthem why the managers, or the subcommittee chairs, other Members did \nnot accept their particular amendment. Of course, the Chair is the one \nwho rules on whether or not they are germane.\n  So I ask we move through these as rapidly as possible. I yield to my \nfriend, the Republican leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. I know the hour is late and Members would like to try to \nfind a way to bring this to conclusion. I know this is not the ideal \nway to proceed. But I ask Senators at this point to be cooperative.\n  Many of us might have an amendment or amendments we would like to \nhave included. If they are not germane or they have been objected to \none way or the other, there will be other bills. This is not the last \nopportunity.\n  I hope we will cooperate at this point with Senator Reid and the \nMembers who are involved on both sides and bring this bill to a \nconclusion. If any Senator starts objecting and insists on votes, the \nhorse is out of the barn and we will never end it.\n  This is an important bill. We have done good work. It is time to \nbring it to a conclusion. I hope all Senators will wait for another \nopportunity if they didn't get their nongermane amendments on this \nbill.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is not normal Senate procedure. \nNormally in the Senate there is an indefinite time. We have a definite \ntime. This bill is going to end either tonight or at 5:30 tomorrow \nafternoon. We are going to finish the bill. It is not a question of \nbeing able to hold up this bill because this bill is going forward. The \nPresident wants it. The two managers worked hard. The House is waiting \nfor it to be brought to conference.\n  The list of amendments commonly referred to as ``the managers' \namendment'' I know causes people's hair to bristle at the back of their \nneck. But that is what this is. The managers worked on this for about 7 \nhours. Senator McCain and Senator Gramm have been going through it for \nabout 3 hours. The staff has worked. We now have this list that has \nbeen culled.\n  We would like to go through these. There are some to which the \nrespective parties have agreed. Some will fall because they are not \ngermane.\n  I ask for the cooperation of the two managers of the bill. Senator \nStevens is ready, it is my understanding, to move through these. He has \na list of those that have been accepted. He has a list of those that \nare nongermane.\n  I ask if the Senator from Alaska is ready to move through this \npackage. Senator Byrd and I have spoken to the ranking member. He has \nworked with Senators Gramm and McCain.\n\n[[Page S5174]]\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in order to facilitate this, I send to \nthe desk a list of the items that the Parliamentarian has ruled are not \ngermane. I ask the Parliamentarian to examine that and confer. These \nhave been ruled as not germane. There are eight of them.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: Has the Parliamentarian confirmed that those \nhave been ruled to be not germane?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n\n  Amendments Nos. 3558, 3581, 3584, 3604, 3625, 3740, 3744, and 3745, \n                            Recalled En Bloc\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I will read the list so Senators know \nwhat is on the list: amendment No. 3558 by Senator Murray; amendment \nNo. 3581 by Senator Landrieu; amendment No. 3584 by Senator Stabenow; \namendment No. 3604 by Senator Hollings; amendment No. 3625 by Senator \nCochran; amendment No. 3740 by Senator Hollings; amendment No. 3744 by \nSenator Durbin; and amendment No. 3745 by Senator Sarbanes. Those are \nthe eight that have been ruled to be nongermane.\n  It is my understanding that if those amendments were called up and \nobjection was made the Parliamentarian would rule them not be germane \nand not in order to be considered at this time. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I ask if any Senator objects if I ask those amendments \nbe withdrawn at this time?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Is the Senator proposing these amendments? Is there objection?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Parliamentary inquiry: Is Senator Landrieu's amendment, \nNo. 3581, the $2.5 million requested to eliminate the need to recover \nfunds from States under the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and \nBill of Rights Act? Is that the right amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is my understanding that the Senator from Texas and \nthe Senator from Arizona object to that. Is that correct?\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is correct. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Has the Senator from Alaska offered that \namendment?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I am prepared to offer a request that all \nof those amendments be withdrawn as they would be knocked down if \ncalled up.\n  I recall those amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has asked that those amendments be \nrecalled.\n  Mr. STEVENS. All eight en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n   Amendment Nos. 3559, 3568, 3591, 3593, 3598, 3602, 3607, 3614, as \n  modified; 3615, 3616, 3624, as modified; 3631, 3632, 3653, 3656, as \n modified; 3657, 3658, 3665, 3666, 3667, 3669, 3682, 3702, 3716, 3754, \n              as modified; and 3766, as modified, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I send to the desk the list. There is a \nlist of amendments that were proposed by Senators and that were \nexamined by the majority and minority of the Appropriations Committee \nand which they agreed to accept. Those that sought to review the list \nhad no objection to the amendments on this list. I ask that these \namendments be called up and considered en bloc and adopted en bloc.\n  I am pleased to read the list, in case anyone has any question of \nwhat is on it: amendment No. 3559 by Senator Hutchison; amendment No. \n3568 by Senator Nelson of Florida; amendment No. 3591 by Senator Biden; \namendment No. 3593 by Senator McConnell; amendment No. 3598 by Senator \nClinton; amendment No. 3602 by Senator Torricelli; amendment No. 3607 \nby Senator Bunning; amendment No. 3614 by Senator Wyden; amendment No. \n3615 by Senator Daschle; amendment No. 3616 by Senator Byrd; amendment \nNo. 3624 by Senator Wellstone; amendment No. 3631 by Senator Kyl; \namendment No. 3632 by Senator Kyl; amendment No. 3653 by Senator \nSessions; amendment No. 3656 by Senator McConnell; amendment No. 3657 \nby Senator Kohl; amendment No. 3658 by Senator Harkin; amendment No. \n3665, my own amendment, amendment No. 3666; my amendment, No. 3667; my \namendment, amendment No. 3669 by Senator Kerry; amendment No. 3682 by \nSenator Kohl; amendment No. 3702, another amendment that I offered; \namendment No. 3716 by Senator Leahy; amendment No. 3754 by Senator \nHutchinson; and amendment No. 3766 by Senator Craig.\n  Those are the amendments that have been agreed to. No objection has \nbeen raised to date by any Senator.\n  I ask that this list of amendments, together with modifications that \nhave been filed with the list, and the statements made on each of the \namendments by Senators involved be printed in the Record. I ask \nunanimous consent that these amendments be called up en bloc and agreed \nto en bloc.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there are \nsome amendments on this list that have not been included. As soon as we \ncomplete this, we will discuss those, if necessary, one by one.\n  Mr. STEVENS. There are other amendments that are in sort of an \nuncertain category.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I have an \ninquiry of my friend from Alaska. It is my understanding that amendment \nNo. 3657 is not in a dubious category, is germane, and is supported by \nboth managers.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is the number?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Amendment No. 3627. It has to do with flood damage repairs \nfor six States that both managers have supported--and it is germane--\nincluding Missouri, Kentucky, West Virginia, Virginia, Illinois, and \nMichigan.\n  Mr. STEVENS. What is the amendment number?\n  Mr. LEVIN. No. 3627.\n  Mr. STEVENS. No. 3627, unfortunately, was objected to by two Senators \nwho wish to be heard on it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I understand it is a germane amendment which the managers \nhave supported; is that correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. It is on another list. It is supported by both managers. \nAnd it is germane.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. STEVENS. But there is an objection to be heard.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There will be then another list offered?\n  Mr. STEVENS. There is another list right behind this one. But this is \nthe agreed-to list that we submitted to those who wished to review the \nmanagers' package. The managers' package was composed of amendments \nthat had been referred to the subcommittees involved, checked, on a \nbipartisan basis, by the subcommittees, reviewed by Senator Byrd's \nstaff, my staff, and by the two of us personally, submitted to those \nwho wished to review it, and this is the agreed-to package with no \nobjection to be raised to date to any one of them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the amendments?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Reserving the right to object for purposes of inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida reserves the right to \nobject.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Amendment No. 3747, which has been ruled germane, relates \nto an emergency for additional U.S. marshals.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes, that is germane. It has the approval of the \nmanagers in the subcommittees. There are two Senators who wish to \nobject. That would be subject to debate. It is in that undecided \npackage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the package of the \nSenator from Alaska?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Durbin). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple remarks about the \nprocess we are going through right now as we are finishing up. We \nshould not be doing this. This is a managers' amendment. A managers' \namendment is intended for technical amendments. Now the Senator from \nTexas and I are causing heartburn for everybody around the Senate who \nhas an amendment they think is worthy.\n  The amendment should have been brought up and voted on and put in the \nnormal process. Instead, because of the egregious practice that has \nbeen going on, I pointed out many times last year, when I said, What is \nin the managers' amendment? Nobody knew. There were 32 specific \nearmarked projects in an appropriations bill.\n  The Senator from Texas and I decided we wanted to see what was in the \nmanagers' amendment. I have forgotten how many there were--90 to start \nwith, somewhere around 90 amendments to start with. Some of them were \n$10 million; some, $20 million; some, $50 million; some were $120 \nmillion out of the highway trust fund--all in ``managers' amendments.''\n\n[[Page S5178]]\n\n  I don't like staying here late at night any more than any of my \ncolleagues do. Why don't we try going through the normal process? An \namendment that is worth $120 million is worthy of debate and voting on, \non the floor of the Senate, and not to be included in a managers' \npackage. Then we have to get our staff, the Senator from Texas and I, \nand make everybody mad because we object to them.\n  If these amendments had been brought up in the normal procedure, \nnobody would have been angry because then we would have voted these \namendments up or down. Instead, we have now a practice where there is a \nmanagers' amendment which in anybody's definition includes technical \namendments to the bill where there are huge changes, and many of them \npolicy changes.\n  I am sympathetic to the Senator from Oregon who wants to keep the \nsearch and rescue in the State of Oregon. It is an important issue to \nhim. Where is it? It is in the managers' package, a policy change where \nwe are going to dictate to the U.S. Air Force.\n  What I hope my colleagues have learned from this, at 20 minutes to \nmidnight on a Thursday night, is that we would go through the normal \nprocess, have the amendments considered, vote up or down, the managers' \npackage being purely technical amendments as they are intended, and we \nwouldn't have this problem that we are in today.\n  There is enormous heartburn here on the part of some of my \ncolleagues. I understand that. These are important issues to them.\n  I say to the Senator that this is an important issue, whether search \nand rescue is available in the State of Oregon at Mount Hood where a \ndisaster took place. Instead, we are supposed to decide the situation \non the basis of germane or nongermane. We should not be doing this. I \nhope the lesson is that we take up amendments and vote on them up or \ndown, and not in a managers' package from now on, which is how it is \nsupposed to be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Arizona makes good \npoints, and he has made his points throughout the debate. Are we now \nprepared to complete action on this last list of amendments so we can \nget to final passage? He has made his point, and is right, but now we \nhave to bring this to a reasonable and quick conclusion. Are we ready \nto do that?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am ready for the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. At the end of the last supplemental, by a clerical \nerror, one of the amendments that was offered by the Senator from New \nMexico was clerically left off. We did not discover that until the next \nmorning. We told the Senator that we would accept that amendment and be \nsure it was on the next supplemental. Now, we have done that and it has \nnow been ruled not germane. It is amendment No. 3718, and it was \narguably not germane. There is an indication now that it is not \ngermane.\n  I ask the Senate to allow us to keep our commitment to Senator \nDomenici. It would have become law in the last supplemental but for a \nclerical error.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we take up amendment No. 3718 and that \nit be before the Senate for consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, the amendment is clearly \nnot germane. I don't know what kind of deals were made among the \nmembers of the Appropriations Committee. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, is there any way to appeal that?\n  Mr. LOTT. If the Senator will yield, one way is to appeal to the \nSenator from Arizona. I ask the Senator to reconsider. We have a senior \nSenator here who is in this position not because of his own fault. He \nhad a commitment made to him by senior members on both sides of the \naisle. They are trying to keep that commitment. We should honor that, \nwhether it is Republican or Democrat, no matter where you are from or \nwho it is. I urge the Senator not to object to that request under these \nconditions. I would be here defending or keeping a commitment to the \nSenator from Arizona if he were the one involved. I don't know what the \nsubject is, but I ask the Senator to reconsider. I make the request \nagain that it be accepted by unanimous consent, and I make that appeal \nto the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Republican leader has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I had a parliamentary inquiry. Was that \nmatter subject to appeal?\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, it is my understanding that \npost----\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no appeal of the objection to the \nunanimous consent request.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I want to make a proposal that I think is \nreasonable. The Parliamentarian has now ruled on the remaining \namendments, as to whether they are germane or whether they are subject \nto a point of order, which would bring them down, and that is only true \nin the case of one of Senator Byrd's amendments.\n  I want to propose that all those that are germane we accept by \nunanimous consent and that all those that are not germane fall. They \ncould bring them up, we could raise germaneness. The Chair already \nruled they would be struck down. We will have wasted 2 hours of time, \nand we would end up with exactly the same result. I am not sure if we \nvoted on some of these germane ones they would pass. But it is almost \nmidnight. I want to propose that all of the items on the list that are \ngermane be adopted by unanimous consent or as modified--in the form \nthat the Chair has it--that we adopt them, and those that are not \ngermane we drop, and we would finish our business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a list of amendments. We have all \ngone to the Parliamentarian and gone over them individually. They have \nlooked at these several times to determine whether or not they are \ngermane. I will call up each individual amendment, ask whether or not \nit is germane, and that will leave some, as the Chair already ruled, \nand the others will fall.\n  I ask if amendment No. 3595 offered by the Senator from Rhode Island, \nMr. Reed, is germane.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Is the Senator asking consent?\n  Mr. REID. No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment would not be germane.\n  Mr. REID. That amendment falls; is that right, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the amendment were called up, the Chair \nwould rule that it is not germane.\n  Mr. REID. I make the point of order that it is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is not pending. If the amendment \nwere called up and pending, the Chair would rule that it is not \ngermane.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3595\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 3595 by Senator Reed \nof Rhode Island.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no objection in order to calling up \nan amendment. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Reed, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 3595.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n[[Page S5179]]\n\n       (Purpose: To provide funds to enhance security for public \n                       transportation operations)\n\n       On page 94, line 19, after ``Commerce'' insert ``Provided \n     further, That, not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Under Secretary for Transportation \n     Security shall report to Congress (1) the amount of \n     Transportation Security Administration funds dedicated to \n     improving public transportation security, (2) the number of \n     full-time Transportation Security Administration personnel \n     engaged in improving public transportation security, and (3) \n     a plan for improving the security of our Nation's public \n     transportation systems''.\n\n  Mr. REID. Will the Chair rule on the germaneness of that amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is not germane.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I want to ask my friend a question.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will be glad to yield to my friend for a \nquestion, without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I cannot follow this process. Whatever \nyou say about germaneness or not, I want to bring my amendment up to be \ndiscussed. We can take 2 minutes, and then you can do with it what you \nwant. I am not going to stand here and have my amendment possibly \ndisposed of while the process for proceeding is not clear. I have the \nfloor now and----\n  Mr. REID. You do not have the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Can I borrow it from you?\n  Mr. REID. I have the floor. I know that is tough, but that the rule \nhere.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will come to order. The Senator \nfrom Nevada yielded for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I yielded with my right to retain the floor. Nothing \nunusual is happening. We have a list that we are going to go through \nwith amendments that have been deemed to be nongermane. That will leave \nthose that are germane that we will deal with.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. My two are not germane. One of them would have been \nadopted by the Senate but for a clerical error. Are you going to let \nthe Senate listen to that statement?\n  Mr. REID. I will say that we have heard statements by Senator \nStevens, not only publicly here on the floor, but before the \nParliamentarian and a number of other Senators. I believe Senator \nDomenici's cause is just, but the rules of the Senate are going to \nknock this out.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I ask if you would give me 2 minutes right now, and I \nwill not talk anymore.\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield to my friend, and I will retain \nthe floor following that 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the Senator from New Mexico is recognized for 2 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I want to say to all of you that what happened to me \nshould not happen to any of you. I have been here almost 30 years. If \nsome of you were here 60 years, I hope it doesn't happen to you. I \ndon't care why a Senator leaves the floor at the end of a bill, or \nwhether Senator John McCain, who is objecting now, had some reason to \nleave the floor, or if he didn't like the process and he stomped out of \nhere mad like he does sometimes.\n  The truth is that a managers' amendment with 20 or 30 managers' \namendments in it, with my name on the list, and Senator Bingaman, \nincidentally--Senator Bingaman was sitting right over there, and we did \nnot catch it, as the manager read it. We thought it was included in the \nlong list.\n  We get up the next day and to our surprise, something that we had \naccomplished, that we thought was very important, was not in the bill \nand did not get attached, and the conferees said they could not \nconsider it. But they said the next appropriations bill that comes, we \nwill help you.\n  I could not get help because we entered into an early-on cloture, \nwhich we do not do. I should have expected it, but it never happens \nthat early. It happened, and all of us got shut out, and we were urged \nby our leadership to help with that. I thought we should not. I thought \nwe should wait 2 or 3 days. But the leader asked me, and I said: OK, \nlet's close it down early.\n  I got closed down, and now I have a Senator or two, because they do \nnot like my amendment, sitting here telling you they do not believe \nme--that is what they are saying--or they do not believe Ted Stevens \nwho believed me.\n  Is that what they are saying? I hope they are not saying that. And \nyou can smile if you like, but there is nothing to smile about. It is \nvery serious, and you get a frown on your face like me more frequently \nthan I do.\n  Excuse me for violating the rules for addressing him in the singular. \nI should say the senior Senator from Arizona, and I am sorry about \nthat.\n  The Democratic part of this team from New Mexico could not be here \ntoday, or he would stand before you and even tell you he is more in awe \nthan I, when the next day or day after we talked and we said, well, it \nwould get done. No, it is not there. Somebody forgot to put it in. It \nwas all ready. I suggest there ought to be some way to fix this.\n  I am going to tell you as my time expires, for those who are going to \nobject like this, they better get up early in the morning. They better \nget here when the appropriations bill comes up because amendments I \nhave in the future are not going to wait around to the end. You are not \ngoing to have all this power.\n  This approach has given you power beyond anything you have, and you \nare complaining about the processes we have that are inordinate and \nwrong. It is not right to have one or two Senators who would have had \none or two votes but for cloture. That is all they would have had and \ncould not have denied my amendment the way they are doing tonight with \nthe help of a Parliamentarian who takes the facts not into \nconsideration because he could not. He cannot listen to me. I never \nsaid one thing to the Parliamentarian tonight. Your ruling is right or \nwrong, but I am telling the Senators, it is not right.\n  I am not going to lose, so you just wake up because the next \nappropriations bill that comes through here we are going to vote on the \nDomenici amendment. And I hope you have a lot of people thinking like \nyou do because you are going to lose.\n  It is going to be a matter of 1 month or 2 months, and this amendment \nis going to be adopted. And I am going to go to the conference, and it \nis going to stay in. I thank you for listening and sorry I bothered \nyou. Good night.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Point of parliamentary personal privilege since my name \nwas used.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada has the floor.\n\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from New Mexico, I have worked most of \nmy entire career in the Senate shoulder to shoulder with the Senator. \nWe had good fortune to be chairmen and ranking members of the Energy \nand Water Appropriations Subcommittee, and the Senator from New Mexico \nhas always treated Democrats and Republicans very fairly.\n  I am disappointed. I understand the reason the Senator from Arizona \nis objecting. I do not agree. Senator Domenici, the senior Senator from \nNew Mexico, I can say from a personal perspective, has always been very \nfair. I can say this personally. If this happened to someone else----\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask the Senator from Nevada if I can have a point of \npersonal privilege to respond to my name being used?\n  Mr. REID. He would have gone to the wall. I am disappointed that \nSenator Domenici is not going to be given an opportunity. I will be \nhappy to work with him in the future, I think as well as everybody in \nthe Senate.\n  I do not think there was anything said that in any way diminished the \nstature of the Senator from Arizona. I think Senator Domenici had a \nright to object. I ask if we can----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is it your decision to make whether I can respond to \nstatements made about me?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to yield to the Senator from Arizona for 2 \nminutes without losing the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I guess there is no point in me responding \nas to whether I should smile or not smile. The reason why I objected to \nthis amendment was not because of frivolous reasons. This amendment was \ngoing to expand the eligibility of the airline loan guarantee program \nto include the manufacturers of small jet\n\n[[Page S5180]]\n\nturbo fan aircraft. I am proud to be a member of the Commerce Committee \nand proud to have worked with Senator Hollings as we, working with the \nadministration and the airline industry, came up with the airline and \nairport security bill, which was an important piece of legislation, a \nvery vital piece of legislation following September 11.\n  We considered extending the small airline guarantee program to \ninclude manufacturers of small jet turbo fan aircraft at the time of \nthe consideration and the hearings in the authorizing committee, and we \nrejected that idea. So I certainly objected because we had gone through \nscrutiny of this issue in the proper authorizing process.\n  I objected to an expansion of the program without authorization or \nwithout a hearing, and I will continue to object to changes in \nauthorizing legislation on which we worked very hard in the committee \nof jurisdiction. That is the reason why I objected to an expansion of \nthe program which was unwarranted by the legislation that was passed by \nthis body by a vote of 98 to 0. It has nothing to do with my feelings \ntoward Senator Domenici or any other Senator in this body.\n  If I have offended Senator Domenici, obviously I deeply regret that. \nI do have a higher obligation to do what I can to make sure the people \nI represent are adequately represented and according to my best \njudgment.\n  I thank the Chair and Senator Reid for allowing me to respond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are now at the point in the proceedings \nwhere I think we have a good offer from the Senators from Texas and \nArizona. There are certain amendments in this list that have been ruled \ngermane tentatively by the Parliamentarian, and the Chair would rule \nthat way. There are some ruled nongermane.\n  The proposal is that those amendments that have been ruled germane \nwill in effect be accepted upon voice vote. Those not germane will \nfall. They will fall anyway. There is nothing we can do if the \nParliamentarian rules them nongermane. Then they are gone. There is no \nneed to go through that process.\n  I ask everyone's patience and cooperation that we accept by unanimous \nconsent the proposal made by the Senator from Texas.\n  May I have the attention of the Senator from Texas? I would like the \nattention of the Senator from Texas. It is my understanding the Senator \nfrom Texas has said those amendments the Parliamentarian has \ntentatively ruled as being germane would be accepted; those that are \nnongermane would fall.\n  Mr. GRAMM. That is right.\n  Mr. REID. I ask my friend, on amendment No. 3691, what is the \npleasure of the Senator?\n  Mr. GRAMM. No. 3691: That amendment is, as far as I know, germane.\n  Mr. REID. It is germane.\n\n\n    Amendments Nos. 3585, As Modified; 3596, As Modified; 3613, As \n    Modified; 3627, As Modified; 3691, As Modified; 3733, 3747, As \n                           Modified; En Bloc\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that amendments Nos. 3585, as \nmodified; 3596, as modified; 3613, as modified; 3627, as modified; \n3691, as modified; 3733, and 3747, as modified, be called up en bloc as \nbeing germane amendments.\n  Mr. STEVENS. As modified.\n  Mr. REID. As modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Is there objection to the \nconsideration of these amendments en bloc and their adoption?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, was 3581 included in that?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No. 3581 was not included.\n  Mr. REID. It is not on the list at all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to consideration and \nadoption of the en bloc amendments that have been listed by the Senator \nfrom Nevada?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 3585, as modified, 3596, as modified, 3613, as \nmodified, 3627, as modified, 3691, as modified, 3733 and 3747, as \nmodified) were agreed to as follows:\n\n\n                    amendment no. 3585, as modified\n\n  (Purpose: To provide that certain funds appropriated for the United \nStates Customs Bureau Service be used to reimburse State and local law \nenforcement agencies that have provided Federal assistance to personnel \n                       along the Northern Border)\n\n       On page 102, line 15, after ``amended'' insert ``: Provided \n     further, That $10,000,000 is authorized for reimbursing State \n     and local law enforcement agencies that have provided \n     necessary Federal assistance to personnel of the United \n     States Customs Service, along the Northern Border of the \n     United States''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                    amendment no. 3596, as modified\n\n       On page 79, after line 6 insert the following new proviso:\n\n               Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\n\n\n                           program management\n\n       ``: Provided further, That of the funds made available \n     under this heading in Public Law 107-116, $3,000,000 shall be \n     awarded to the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine for \n     activities associated with an in-home study of self-\n     administered high frequency chest oscillation therapy for \n     patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                    amendment no. 3613, as modified\n\n (Purpose: To provide for the transition of the naval base on Schoodic \nPeninsula, Maine, to utilization as a research and education center for \n                         Acadia National Park)\n\n       On page 37, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       Sec. 307.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LOTT. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I ask whether the remaining amendments fall? I ask the \nRepublican leader, is there any need to do more? I think we should move \nto third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. LOTT. The point is being made that the remaining amendments have \nbeen ruled to be nongermane. Therefore, they automatically would fall. \nThere is no appeal or vote on that, and therefore we should proceed to \nthird reading and pass the bill.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I ask my colleagues from----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I do know that Senator Gordon Smith and \nSenator Wyden of Oregon have an amendment they were concerned about. \nTheir amendment would fall as nongermane, but if they would like to \nmake a point at this time I think we would have to give them that \nopportunity.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield.\n  Mr. NICKLES. They would have the right to ask unanimous consent for \nthe amendment to pass. If there is no objection, the amendment would be \nadopted. If someone raises a point of order on germaneness, their \namendment would fall.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Republican leader yield?\n  Mr. LOTT. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Enzi also wishes to make a statement. It is \nmidnight and tomorrow is another day. People can prepare statements and \nput them in the Record and say whatever they want to say. I have been \npretty nonchalant throughout the last several days, but I will tell \neverybody that I am going to object personally to any other amendments \nat this stage, and I think there are a lot of people who will join with \nme.\n  We are through with this legislation. Let us get to third reading and \nget it over with.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I would----\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I believe I have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader has the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. I will yield.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I was going to ask, is what we agreed to that we were \ngoing to take all the germane ones and drop the nongermane ones?\n  Mr. LOTT. That is what we have done.\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I will yield the floor so others can be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: If we go to third \nreading, are we not still under cloture? Could Members not make \nstatements up to their eligible time before the bill is called up for \nactually a final vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. STEVENS. My suggestion is we go to third reading and let people \ntalk and find out when you want to have the final vote.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator from Alaska yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. Tomorrow is another day. We will pass the bill and people \ncan come and talk all day tomorrow if they want.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Either way. I think Members are still entitled to their \ntime on cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to make a very brief point. If my \ncolleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, would listen, I say to the \nSenator, a while back he talked about a managers' amendment should be \npurely technical amendments. I wanted to make a point. The arbitrary \ndistinction of nongermaneness at this late hour is something I think is \ngoing to throw away some amendments that should have been adopted. An \namendment, for example, that I offered, 3689, was offered prior to \ncloture. It is purely technical, has no money attached to it, is out of \npreviously appropriated funds that deals with two transmission studies. \nIt corrects an error that existed in prior legislation. So it is purely \ntechnical and no one would argue it is not technical. Creating an \narbitrary distinction of saying those things that are nongermane shall \nnot be considered means that those small issues I have offered \npreviously, for example, in this amendment, that was approved by both \nthe minority and the majority, they said to me, yes, this is fine, we \naccept the amendment, this kind of an amendment that is purely \ntechnical now falls because of an arbitrary distinction that we say \nnongermane amendments are gone.\n  I only want to make the point to my friend from Arizona, I agree with \nhim on a lot of issues but this clearly is technical; it is clearly \nsomething that should be a part of the managers' package and was agreed \nto by both the majority and minority and now is going to fall under \nthis arbitrary distinction at midnight. I do not think that is fair.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am in sympathy with the Senator. I voted against \ncloture. It was your leader who filed cloture and we voted on it long \nbefore I wanted cloture to be invoked. You would not have that problem \nif it had not been for your leadership that filed cloture at the \nearliest I have ever seen on an appropriations bill.\n  I am in sympathy and would like to work with the Senator to get this \nworthwhile technical amendment approved.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, to try to assist Senator Reid in bringing \nthis to a conclusion----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thought I yielded to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota still has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand the point the Senator made. I was only \nmaking the point if, in fact, the managers' amendment is for technical \namendments, really purely technical amendments, and I offered this \nprior to cloture, was told by the majority and the minority, yes, we \naccept it, there is no problem, this is not spending money, it is \nspending previously appropriated money, a total of $400,000, and deals \nwith an error when, in fact, the distinction on the nonreimbursable \nportion of it should be in bill language, or the managers' language, \nwhich is where it was, this corrects that. It is exactly what, in my \njudgment, the Senator said ought to be in the managers' package. I hope \nthe Senator will reconsider at least on 3689 and allow this to be put \nin the managers' package this evening or allow it to be approved this \nevening.\n  Mr. President, I would make that request to ask if my two colleagues \nwould agree to that--I know they have reviewed it. The majority and \nminority have reviewed it and have approved it. It is not spending a \ndime. It simply corrects an error. I would hope very much that they \nwould agree to approve this amendment.\n\n  My point is this, an arbitrary distinction of nongermane at this \npoint is unfair to those who offered their amendments prior to cloture. \nI understand the point my friend from Arizona made about cloture, but I \nhope he understands that those of us who came prior to cloture, offered \nour amendments and were told by the Republican and the Democratic \nleaders on the floor, yes, we accept it, it is a good amendment, we \napprove it, at that point I would have expected that this amendment \nwould be approved and not now at midnight be objected to by someone on \nthe floor of the Senate.\n  So I again ask if we might have some cooperation at least on an \namendment\n\n[[Page S5182]]\n\nthat was approved previously by everyone in the Senate, to my knowledge \nprior to cloture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Will the Senator yield the floor?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, I am asking consent if my colleagues might not \nagree to include 3689. The Republicans and the Democrats have \npreviously accepted it. It does not spend a dime. Can we not, with \nrespect to this distinction, agree to accept this amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRAMM. Yes, I am going to have to object. The point is the way we \ngot----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The way we got----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, do I still have the floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota retains the \nfloor.\n  Mr. REID. The objection has been heard. Is that right?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand objection has been heard. I still have the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection has been heard.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Again, let me make the point that coming to this point in \ntime and saying that the amendments that the Parliamentarian says are \nnot germane represents some distinction that has relevance when we have \noffered these prior to cloture, I understand technically why this is \nbeing done but substantively it is unfair, in my judgment.\n  The Senator talks about the unfairness of coming to the end of this \nprocess and having a managers' package that has a bushel of paper \nattached to it. There is another unfairness that exists as well, and \nthat unfairness is being perpetrated by those who come to the floor and \ncreate artificial distinctions at the twelfth hour and they say, oh, \nnow, by the way, something that has previously been approved to we \nobject to, especially in circumstances where we thought this amendment \nhad already been approved. I think we can get by with this once, but it \nwill not happen again, in my judgment, because there are other ways to \ndeal with it.\n  I say to my colleague from Texas, I think it is unfair. He has a \nright to object, of course, but I think it is unfair, and I hope he \nwill not ask similar consideration some day.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Of course I will yield.\n  Mr. GRAMM. The way we were able to draw the delineation at the end of \nbusiness tonight was the decision that we would take all the germane \namendments and we would drop all the nongermane amendments. The problem \nis, when we take that delineation and start making exceptions, then \neverybody gets unhappy.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Yes. Mr. President, exceptions will require some judgment \nI agree, but the migraine headache around here for a number of people \nhas been that managers' packages include things other than technical \namendments. My point is, this amendment is technical, has been agreed \nto by everybody, was offered precloture. I understand it would require \nsome judgment, amendment by amendment, to deal with these, but it seems \nto me that is why we are here. But if the objection stands, I guess I \naccept that. We will be back, and I guess we will pass it at some point \nin the future.\n  I will make the final point. I do not think we ought to be here again \non some future bill having just a couple of people deciding what they \nare going to accept, even in circumstances where purely technical \namendments which have been approved previously by Republicans and \nDemocrats in the Senate are going to fall.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LOTT. In an effort to try to facilitate what needs to be done to \nbring this to a conclusion, I will yield 1 minute to two or three \nSenators who feel a need to say a few words, but I retain the floor. \nThen we will move to a third reading immediately after that.\n  Without losing my recognition on the floor, I yield to the Senator \nfrom Oregon 1 minute.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank Senator Lott.\n  Mr. President, a lot of Members went the route of the managers' \namendment because we like to accommodate the requests of our \nappropriators, and to be accommodating to them we did not bring it up. \nFrankly, I have just learned a lesson here: I have to force a vote \nduring the course of this bill. I have relied upon the good faith of \nTed Stevens--and his faith is good. He stood by me the whole time.\n  Ron Wyden and I are talking about a national emergency that we think \nexists in our area. You saw on national TV an Air Force Reserve \nhelicopter crash trying to save nine people, all but three of whom lost \ntheir lives. The day before, they saved a person on Mount Rainier. This \nis almost a daily occurrence. The Air Force proposes to move away from \nthe Northwest. We need it there. We need it there. When we have the \nchance to bring this issue up again in another context, I hope you will \nremember us. It is one of the few military assets the State of Oregon \nhas at all.\n  Mr. LOTT. Without yielding the floor, I yield 1 minute to Senator \nWyden.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Two points. First, the position Senator Smith and I have \ntried to convey will cost the taxpayers no money, but what Senator \nMcCain is talking about will cost taxpayers money. Second, there are no \nobjective criteria for the project. There would be if the Smith-Wyden \nproposal went forward because we laid out basic criteria for dealing \nwith life in Oregon. These people are saving lives. That is what people \nall over this country saw on national TV.\n  Now, without any objective criteria and in a way that will cost \ntaxpayers money, we are not even having a chance to debate a bipartisan \namendment. That is regrettable. We ought to be following the example \nthat Chairman Byrd and Senator Stevens have followed. That is what \nSenator Smith and I have tried to be a part of. We will be back on this \nfloor again and again and again. Let us put the Senate on notice. We \nare going to stay here all the way through this session until this gets \ndone.\n  Mr. LOTT. I propose to recognize the Senator from Wyoming for 1 \nminute and then the Senator from Louisiana for 1 minute, and then I am \nprepared to yield the floor for third reading.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized for 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Parliamentarian for spending a couple of hours \ntoday helping me understand the difference between nongermaneness under \ncloture and nongermaneness on bills that are not under cloture. It is a \nvery difficult distinction, and I can appreciate the work done.\n  I have been trying to get livestock assistance for all the people in \nthe third year of drought in the West. It is extremely critical.\n  Mr. President, I wish to discuss the Enzi-Grassley-Hagel amendment \nNo. 3737 to H.R. 4775, the supplemental appropriations bill. This \neffort seriously acknowledges the plight of our farmers, ranchers and \nworks to ensure the future of our rural communities by providing an \navenue of desperately needed assistance.\n  Our amendment funds the Livestock Assistance Program for disaster \nexperienced in 2001 by reinstating the farm bill payment limitations \npassed by the Senate in February 2002.\n  One of the most difficult responsibilities we all have as Senators is \nprioritizing the targeting of a very limited set of resources. Just as \na firefighter prioritizes by deciding which homes to save and which are \nalready on the edge of destruction, or a doctor faced with an emergency \nor disaster reviews the wounded to determine who most needs his help, \nwe are often called upon the make difficult and important decisions \nthat at times may be highly unpopular. This is one of those times our \nchoice may be difficult and demanding, but it is also very, very clear.\n  Just as that firefighter and the doctor need to make decisions that \nhave a tremendous impact on lives and livelihoods, our amendment makes \na similar priority decision that the farm bill conference failed to \nmake. This amendment is all about taking care of the folks back home in \ntimes of trouble. Without the assistance provided under this amendment, \nthe Congress is clearly deciding who will be the winners and\n\n[[Page S5183]]\n\nwho will suffer the consequences of being the losers. I encourage my \ncolleagues to think about the current structures of the farm bill and \nhow it pits neighbor against neighbor. The farm bill perhaps \nunintentionally set the winners and condemned the losers to lose in the \nmarketplace. It set up a scenario in which one homestead's rent will be \npaid and the children in another home will end up watching their \nbelongings go to the highest bidder in an auction.\n  Wyoming livestock producers are facing a third year of drought. In \nresponse, some have begun liquidating their stock while others face the \nloss of their homes. Just days ago, USDA Secretary Ann Veneman declared \nall but three Wyoming counties primary and secondary disaster areas for \n2002. That's an important step, but the amendment before us was written \nto address the 2001 disaster year! Producers that sold or reduced their \nherds in the first year of the drought have been unable to buy \nreplacements. The 2-year tax relief provision available to offer short-\nterm relief from forced sales will soon run out. Now evern more \nproducers are being forced to sell their livestock in irrational \nmarkets due to the prohibitively expensive price of hay and their \nejections from drought-stricken public grazing lands.\n  A forced livestock sale significantly decreases a rancher's future \nprofitability because it decreases the number of production units, \nsheep and cattle on the ranch. A forced sale also dilutes genetic \nquality. Many ranchers utilize stringent genetic improvement plans to \ndifferentiate their product. A forced sale can flush years of careful \nrecord keeping and genetic improvements out through the sale barn in 1 \nday.\n  In its refusal to acknowledge this grave disaster, the farm bill \nconference report did not accurately represent the priorities of the \nSenate. It did not fund emergency disaster assistance to the Nation's \nlivestock producers and it included a payment limitation that favors \nthe corporate producer over the family farmers and ranchers who make \nthis country great. Our amendment reinstates the Senate's position on \npayment limitations on farm bill payments and uses the savings to \noffset emergency feed assistance to livestock producers for drought \ndisaster.\n  The Livestock Assistance Program is a program available to livestock \nproducers in counties that have been declared disaster areas by the \nPresident or Secretary of Agriculture. It provides minimal financial \nrelief to livestock producers that are experiencing livestock \nproduction loss due to drought and other disasters--but only if there \nis money in the fund. Once LAP is funded, producers apply for relief \nand a formula splits the available monies accounting to their needs. It \nassists all producers who qualify, but the extent of the assistance \nthat is avaialble is limited by the program funding and the number of \napplicants. The more applicants there are across the country, the \nsmaller the individual payment.\n\n  In fiscal year 2001, the Livestock Assistance Program was funded at \napproximately $430 million for fiscal year 2000 drought assistance. In \nWyoming, 933 producers received $7,752,029 in assistance from those \nfunds at an average of $8,313 per producer. Nationally, it provided \nassistance to about 186,000 producers at 88 percent of their grazing \nloss for drought and other disasters experienced in 2000. The need was \nsimilar in 2001, but the program was not funded in appropriations.\n  The farm bill conference report did include an amendment I offered to \nauthorize the livestock feeding assistance. With its passage, the \nSecretary of Agriculture now has the authority to use that program to \nprovide assistance to livestock producers. The program is no longer ad \nhoc. Using this authorization and funding from the Enzi-Grassley-Hagel \namendment, Secretary Veneman will be able to initiate and deliver feed \nassistance to livestock producers.\n  As a fiscal conservative, the last thing I want to do is further \nincrease supplemental spending over the administration's request. \nRather than advocate additional emergency spending, we have worked \nwithin the parameters of the President's request to fund this urgent \nneed without using new monies. We are doing this by using an offset the \nSenate has already approved by rollcall vote.\n  On February 7 of this year, the Senate voted in support of farm bill \npayment limitations 61-33. The amendment limited total dollar payments \nto an average of $250,000. The farm bill conference report too \ngenerously increased the limitation to $360,000.\n  It is important to ensure federal agricultural aid is available to \nthose who need it most. My personal philosophy supports targeting \nfederal assistance to the neediest farmers and those with greatest risk \nof losing their livelihoods. I have difficulty accepting the notion \nthat farmers require assistance to the tune of $360,000 when I know \nthere are struggling ranchers in Wyoming and other cattle states that \nreceive almost nothing. The Enzi-Grassley-Hagel amendment equalizes \nthis wide gap in farm bill payments and directs federal agricultural \naid to ranchers in dire need.\n  Farm Bill payments were not intended to subsidize every acre of every \nfarm nor every bushel produced. The American taxpayer should not be \nasked to keep large corporations or weekend hobby farmers in silk \noveralls and gold-plated pitchforks. Farm assistance was intended for \nand must continue to be directed at small and medium producers, family \nfarmers who truly need help. Our rural communities depend on farms and \nthe farms, in turn, depend on their communities. Too many small farms \nare not receiving the assistance that is needed while large multi-\nmillion dollar corporations continue to receive federal funds for every \nacre they take over. Payments to large corporations have nothing to do \nwith good farm policy but good farm policy has everything to do with \nfamily farms.\n  In Wyoming, farmers, ranchers, and communities as a whole are \nstruggling through yet another year of drought and another year of fear \nand endless worry. Will we hear them? Will we respond with good farm \npolicy that will assist those in need and keep people on the farm? It \nis a difficult task but it is our responsibility to set priorities and \nsave our neighbors from ruin. We can do that by equalizing the gap in \nfarm bill payments so we can provide direct aid to ranchers in real \nneed. That is what the Enzi-Grassley-Hagel amendment does and it's what \nthe American people expect us to do.\n  By supporting our amendment, you are again casting a vote accepting \nfarm bill payment limitations. You are bolstering your earlier votes to \nprovide sorely needed drought relief to livestock producers largely \nignored in the farm bill conference report. The choice is simple and \nhas already been made.\n  I hope the leaders will propound a unanimous consent that allows \nthese amendments to be brought up, statements to be placed in as though \ngiven live, and then withdrawn, so we can make sure we have statements \nin the Record. That would save time.\n  Mr. LOTT. I yield to Senator Landrieu.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I appreciate the patience of this body. The reason I \nhave been tenacious about this is that this amendment affects 37 \nStates. It is a technical correction to disability councils. The \nSenator from Texas and the Senator from Arizona, because of rule \nXXVIII, there is no way to correct this. It is a technical amendment. \nIf it is not fixed tonight, it will not get fixed; it cannot be fixed \nat conference and will affect 37 States. These are not huge amounts of \nmoney, but these councils do not have a lot of money for the disability \ncouncils in 37 States.\n  It was passed and agreed to by the managers and ranking members. \nAgain, because of the germaneness issue, we have been left out, which \nis unfortunate.\n  I thank you for your patience, but I wanted to clarify this \namendment.\n  The supplemental appropriations bill includes authorizing language \nthat will address a technical error in the Developmental Disabilities \nAssistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000. The language will \nreestablish a hold harmless provision that was included prior to its \ninadvertent omission from the reauthorizing bill enacted in 2000.\n  The bill also includes $2.5 million for this purpose. However, this \nadditional budget authority is fully offset by a reduction in funding \nfor NIH buildings and facilities.\n  This amendment is needed to address the funding formula error \nrecently identified by the Department of Health\n\n[[Page S5184]]\n\nand Human Services. For the past 2 years, the Department of Health and \nHuman Services allocated funds to states councils on developmental \ndisabilities as if a hold harmless provision still was in effect. In \nfiscal year 2001, this error caused 17 councils to receive higher grant \nawards than allowed under the statute. Last year, 23 councils were \noverpaid. The additional funding provided in this amendment will hold \nthese states harmless from reductions.\n  Senator Kennedy and Senator Gregg, the chairman and ranking member of \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions are supportive \nof this technical change.\n  The amounts for 37 states are as follows:\n       (1) For Alabama, $91,709.\n       (2) For Alaska, $3,626.\n       (3) For Arkansas, $25,849.\n       (4) For Colorado, $36,547.\n       (5) For Connecticut, $126,810.\n       (6) For Delaware, $3,626.\n       (7) For the District of Columbia, $3,626.\n       (8) For Hawaii, $3,626.\n       (9) For Idaho, $3,626.\n       (10) For Illinois, $119,542.\n       (11) For Indiana, $15,537.\n       (12) For Iowa, $120,529.\n       (13) For Kansas, $12,297.\n       (14) For Kentucky, $90,248.\n       (15) For Louisiana, $219,989.\n       (16) For Maine, $3,626.\n       (17) For Massachusetts, $107,858.\n       (18) For Mississippi, $68,539.\n       (19) For Missouri, $1,166.\n       (20) For Montana, $3,626.\n       (21) For Nebraska, $9,104.\n       (22) For Nevada, $3,626.\n       (23) For New Hampshire, $3,626.\n       (24) For New Jersey, $2,530.\n       (25) For New York, $631,640.\n       (26) For North Dakota, $3,626.\n       (27) For Ohio, $130,898.\n       (28) For Oklahoma, $39,826.\n       (29) For Pennsylvania, $400,847.\n       (30) For Rhode Island, $3,626.\n       (31) For South Dakota, $3,626.\n       (32) For Tennessee, $27,398.\n       (33) For Texas, $25,633.\n       (34) For Vermont, $3,626.\n       (35) For West Virginia, $221,412.\n       (36) For Wisconsin, $13,861.\n       (37) For Wyoming, $3,626.\n                                  ____\n\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding further debate on this matter is \nended.\n  Mr. ENZI. Would the leader consider propounding a request to put \nstatements in the Record?\n  Mr. REID. Senator Enzi asked that Members desiring to place \nstatements in the Record be allowed to do so.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     federal transit administration\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to thank \nSenators Byrd and Stevens for their stewardship of this Supplemental \nAppropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 2002. Their stalwart support of \nSeptember 11 recovery efforts has substantially benefited millions of \nAmericans, and I support their efforts wholeheartedly.\n  Mr. President, Senator Clinton, Senator Torricelli, Senator Corzine \nand I would like to take a moment to engage our colleague in a \ncolloquy.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my colleague for his kind words and would be happy \nto engage in a colloquy with the Senators from New York and New Jersey.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, the events of September 11 had a \ndisastrous effect on Lower Manhattan's mass transit infrastructure. The \nMetropolitan Transportation Authority serves roughly one third of the \nentire Nation's commuters. Twelve of its subway stations below Chambers \nStreet were incapacitated as a direct result of the attack, and the \ncurrent, damaged state of the MTA's systems affects many of its 360,000 \nriders each day.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, my own State of New Jersey was \nseverely impacted by the disruption to major transportation systems \ncaused by the terrorist attacks. Before September 11, 66,000 New Jersey \nresidents had commuted daily to Lower Manhattan through the World Trade \nCenter PATH Station. The loss of this station has severely strained \nmany of New Jersey's rail, bus, and ferry systems, which will continue \nto operate above capacity for the foreseeable future.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, providing steady and reliable \ntransportation for workers into and out of New York City is vital to \nthe economic recovery of the region. We are pleased that the Committee \nhas provided $1.8 billion that will be dedicated solely to rebuilding \nthe infrastructure connecting New York and New Jersey residents with \nLower Manhattan.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, this funding will be directed to the \nconstruction of a new intermodal station, which is a critical component \nof the recovery effort for the New York Metropolitan Area. Such a \nfacility will be essential not only to the residents and employees \nbased in Lower Manhattan, but for the thousands of families who will \nvisit whatever memorial will be erected in memory of those men and \nwomen who were killed in the attack on the World Trade Center.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my colleagues for their thoughts on this matter, \nand am gratified that we are able to provide such critical support for \nthis intermodal transportation center.\n\n\n                       chemical demilitarization\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, the Senators from Maryland, Senators \nSarbanes and Mikulski and I would like to engage the chairman of the \nDefense Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Inouye, in colloquy on \nfunding for the chemical demilitarization program.\n  I rise today to express my strong support for funding to be included \nin the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill to accelerate the \ndestruction of chemical weapons stored at U.S. Army facilities. \nFollowing the tragic events of September 11, I worked with a number of \nmy colleagues, including Senators Mikulski and Sarbanes of Maryland, in \nurging the Army to find alternative methods for accelerating the \ndisposal of our Nation's chemical weapons stockpile consistent with the \nhighest safety and environmental standards. Since that time, the Army \nhas come forward with proposals to accelerate the neutralization of \nchemical weapons stored at the Newport Chemical Depot in my home State, \nand the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. There are presently 1,269 \ntons of VX agent located at Newport, and 1,621 tons of bulk mustard \nagent stored at Aberdeen. Let us be clear, the nearly 3,000 tons of \nchemical agent stored at these two sites poses a dangerously attractive \nterrorist target and a grave threat to millions of citizens.\n  The Army has plans to accelerate disposal of these chemical agents by \nmore than 2\\1/2\\ years but needs additional funds for the remainder of \nfiscal year 2002 to do so. If funding is provided in the supplemental, \nthe Army can alleviate the fears of these communities, and millions of \nour constituents, by the end of next year. I firmly believe this \nrequest falls within the purview of enhancing homeland security in the \npost-September 11 world in which we live.\n  Ms. Mikulski. I join with the Senator from Indiana in supporting \nadditional funding to accelerate the chemical demilitarization program. \nThis is an urgent homeland security need.\n  There is no question whether the United States should destroy the \nchemical weapons stockpiles at Aberdeen Proving Ground and other sites \naround the country. Congress made that decision in 1986. The United \nStates is also a signatory of the Chemical Weapons Convention. That \ntreaty binds the United States and 144 other countries to destroy \nchemical weapons stockpiles. We have 10 years from the time the \nChemical Weapons Convention came into force--until 2007--to complete \ndestruction.\n  I have worked for decades to ensure that we destroy chemical weapons \nin a way that is safe for the workers, safe for nearby communities, and \nsafe for the environment. After extensive research, the Army developed \na chemical demilitarization process to destroy the bulk mustard agent \nstored at Aberdeen Proving Ground.\n  Last October, I joined with Senator Bayh and Senator Sarbanes and \nother colleagues in urging President Bush to strengthen the security of \nthe nation's chemical weapons storage sites. We recommended several \nmeasures, including expediting construction of agent destruction or \nneutralization facilities, consistent with the highest environmental \nand safety standards.\n  We now have National Guard troops guarding chemical weapons storage \nsites. I am grateful for that added security, but that's not a long-\nterm solution. In fact, it adds to the cost of delay.\n  The Army also came up with plans to accelerate chemical \ndemilitarization. Under that plan, all of the mustard agent stored at \nAberdeen Proving Ground would have been destroyed by the end of this \nyear. The Defense Department wanted funding for this effort\n\n[[Page S5185]]\n\nincluded in the President's supplemental request, but OMB rejected that \nproposal. I am not sure why OMB would reject an effort to make our \ncountry safer and save money, but that is what happened.\n  We have the opportunity here to address that deficiency, to fulfill \nthe Pentagon request. We have the opportunity to address a very real \nhomeland security need. I am proud to join with Senator Bayh and \nSenator Sarbanes in this effort.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I am pleased to join with my colleagues, Senator Bayh \nand Senator Mikulski, in calling for the funds necessary to expedite \nthe Army's chemical demilitarization program. Clearly, this is a matter \nof great importance to ensuring the continued health and safety of \nmillions of Americans.\n  I have long recognized the environmental and health hazards posed by \nthe chemical agents stored at Aberdeen Proving Ground and Army \nfacilities throughout the country and I have been a strong and \nconsistent supporter of the efforts to eliminate the Nation's chemical \nweapons stockpile in the most environmentally sensitive manner \npossible. The critical need to dispose of the stockpiles has only \nintensified as a result of the events of September 11, 2001, for I \nbelieve the continued storage of these agents only increases the \nvulnerability of our citizens to acts of terrorism.\n  In this regard, I was pleased to learn of the Army's decision to \nexpedite the process of neutralizing the chemical agents at both \nAberdeen and Newport. In my view, doing so is a step in the right \ndirection and the decision represents a real win-win situation for all \ninvolved. Not only does accelerated demilitarization eliminate the high \nrisks associated with storing such agents in a highly populated region, \nit results in considerable savings for the Department. Further, it \neliminates costs associated with continued National Guard protection \nand the construction of new structures to protect stored agent. \nFinally, it helps us meet our obligations as signatories to the \nChemical Weapons Convention.\n  Like my colleagues, I am most concerned with the decision of the \nOffice of Management and Budget not to include the Department of \nDefense's proposal for funding for chemical demilitarization in the \nPresident's supplemental request. In my view, expeditiously removing \nthe threat posed by these chemical agents is a critical step in the \nefforts to ensure our domestic security.\n  Mr. BAYH. While we are prepared to offer an amendment to provide \nfunding for the Army to accelerate chemical demilitarization, we would \nbe willing to withdraw the amendment if the Chairman of the Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee would be supportive of funding for the \nArmy's Chemical Demilitarization program during the conference on the \nsupplemental.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I support the Army's decision to expedite destruction of \nour Nation's chemical weapons stockpile in a safe and cost efficient \nmanner. As the Senators from Indiana and Maryland know, the Army \nplanned to reprogram existing funds this year to accelerate destruction \nat Aberdeen and Newport, and I would have support such a request. \nHowever, I would ask my colleagues to refrain from offering their \namendment, and want to assure them that I will support funding for the \naccelerated destruction of chemical agents stored at Newport and \nAberdeen in conference when the opportunity arises.\n  Mr. BAYH. I appreciate the chairman's willingness to be of help on \nthis matter and am aware of his concerns regarding the Army's failure \nto reprogram existing funds this year. I also want the chairman to know \nthat we appreciate how hard he worked to ensure that the defense title \nof the supplemental was consistent with the administration's request.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I appreciate the support of the Senator from Hawaii and \nlook forward to working together with him in conference to fund the \naccelerated chemical demilitarization effort.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the chairman for his continued assistance in \nthis regard.\n\n\n  rebuilding the eighth air force headquarters at barksdale air force \n                                  base\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to engage my colleague, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, \nSenator Inouye, in a colloquy on the importance of rebuilding the 8th \nAir Force Headquarters at Barksdale Air Force Base, LA. This historic \nbuilding, which housed the Mighty 8th Air Force, was devastated on \nMarch 12, 2002, by a fire that burned for more than 12 hours. It is \nimperative that the Mighty 8th see its headquarters rebuilt as soon as \npossible. Over 53,000 airmen served in the Eighth Air Force, including \nthe B-52, B-1, and B-2 crews who have provided air superiority over the \nskies of Afghanistan in Operation Enduring Freedom. Additionally, key \nNational Guard units patrolling the skies in Operation Noble Eagle also \ncall the 8th Air Force home.\n  I believe that it is critical to the Air Force to rebuild the 8th Air \nForce Headquarters at Barksdale Air Force Base. The 8th Air Force is \ncrucial to our warfighting capabilities, and it is imperative that \nconstruction begin to rebuild the 8th Air Force Headquarters \nimmediately. I think my colleague would agree on the need.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I certainly do agree that construction must not be \ndelayed. I am also aware of the tremendous role the 8th Air Force has \nplayed in the war in Afghanistan.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I appreciate your kind words for the 8th Air Force. \nThey are welcome at this time of need for the 8th Air Force. I have \nbeen notified that the facility repair costs for the 8th Air Force \nHeadquarters will total $19.3 million for fiscal year 2002. I am \nconcerned as to how this money will be made available, especially when \nservice budgets have been stretched thin because of the war on \nterrorism. Will the Air Force be able to fund and begin construction in \nfiscal year 2002?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I would say to my friend from Louisiana, that I \nunderstand her concern that such an important military resource be \nrebuilt as soon as possible. I want to let you know that the Air Force \nhas notified the Senate Appropriations Committee by letter that the Air \nForce will commit $19.3 million to an operation and maintenance project \nat Barksdale Air Force Base, LA, to repair the 8th Air Force \nHeadquarters Facility.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. That certainly is welcome news. I received a similar \nletter, but I have seen little action from the Air Force leadership. \nThe men and women in the 8th Air Force have worked diligently since the \nfire destroyed their headquarters, despite the fact that they have been \ndisplaced for several months. Much like so many of us in the Hart \nBuilding simply wanted for our staffs to be able to return to their \ndesks following the anthrax attacks, I just want those at 8th Air Force \nHeadquarters to be able to return to their normal workplace.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I agree with the Senator that those of us with offices in \nthe Hart Building know the feeling of being left without adequate \noffice space, but the Senator from Louisiana should be pleased to know \nthat the Air Force has committed to rebuilding the 8th Air Force \nHeadquarters beginning in fiscal year 2002.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I need the chairman to clarify how some other costs \nassociated with the reconstruction of the 8th Air Force Headquarters \nwill be funded. In fiscal year 2002, an additional $3.5 million is \nrequired for clean-up costs from the fire. Furthermore, as you can \nimagine, the fire destroyed hundreds of computers, expensive \ncommunications equipment, and office furniture. The Air Force estimates \n$3.5 million will be needed in fiscal year 2003 and fiscal year 2004 to \nreplace this valuable equipment. How will the men and women at the 8th \nAir Force Headquarters see that the site is cleaned up this year and \nthat office and communications equipment are purchased in the next two \nyears?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I assure the Senator from Louisiana that, within Air \nForce appropriations for fiscal years 2002 and 2003, sufficient \nresources will be available to fund the requisite outfitting of the \nrestored 8th Air Force Headquarters.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Again, I thank the Chairman for his assistance and \ntaking this time to address my concerns. The people at Barksdale Air \nForce Base, the people of Louisiana, and I appreciate your efforts, and \nI look foward to working with you on other vital issues in the future.\n\n[[Page S5186]]\n\n reimbursement by the postal service of anthrax-related costs incurred \n                        by health care providers\n\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise to enter into a brief colloquy \nwith the distinguished chairman of the Senate Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Treasury and General Government, Senator Dorgan, and my \ncolleague from New Jersey, Senator Corzine, regarding reimbursement by \nthe Postal Service of anthrax-related costs incurred by health care \nproviders in New Jersey.\n  Mr. Chairman, as your know, last fall our Nation experienced the \nworst biological warfare attack in American history when terrorists \nused the mail system to send deadly anthrax spores to various political \nand media targets. New Jersey--where all of the tainted letters were \nmailed--was literally at the frontlines of the anthrax crisis, and New \nJersey health care providers bore the brunt of responding to the \ncrisis. Indeed, the Postal Service urged its employees to seek testing \nand antibiotic therapy at New Jersey hospitals, and these hospitals \nresponded promptly and effectively, providing invaluable health care \nservices to affected employees and customers. Unfortunately, despite \nassurances from the Administration that the Postal Service would \nreimburse these costs, the Postal Service has not reimbursed any of the \ncosts.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is my understanding that the committee is aware of \nthe costs incurred by New Jersey health care providers and encourages \nthe Postal Service to meet the need to reimburse the costs incurred by \nthem in responding to last fall's anthrax crisis.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator from New Jersey is correct.\n  Mr. CORZINE. As my colleague, Senator Torricelli, has noted, last \nfall health care providers in New Jersey responded quickly, effectively \nand responsibly to the anthrax crisis in New Jersey, yet they have not \nbeen reimbursed for the care they provided. Failure to reimburse these \nvery real costs places a significant burden on these providers.\n  Failure to reimburse is troubling because in many cases the Postal \nService directed its employees to these hospitals for care. For \nexample, the Postal Service instructed employees to report to the \nRobert Wood Johnson University Hospital at Hamilton for anthrax \ntesting. As a result, Robert Wood Johnson Hospital ultimately incurred \n$651,500 in costs for treating 1,400 postal service employees and \ndispensing over 3,500 prescriptions for antibiotics. Seven months \nlater, the Postal Service has not reimbursed Robert Wood Johnson for \nthe lifesaving health care it provided.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is my understanding that the committee believes that \nthe Postal Service has received adequate funding to address the anthrax \ncrisis and that the Postal Service is encouraged to meet its \nobligations to New Jersey health care providers.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I agree with both my colleagues that this matter needs to \nbe resolved. I understand that the Postal Service has been in contact \nwith the hospital's administrator to arrange a meeting to review the \ndata supporting the reimbursement request. The Postal Service informs \nme that this is a necessary step as any funds the Postal Service pays \nto any entity are subject to an audit by the Postal Inspector General. \nI am confident that once this review is completed, this issue will be \nresolved to the satisfaction of the parties involved.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for his \nclarification of this issue and his leadership on this vital homeland \nsecurity supplemental appropriations bill.\n  Mr. CORZINE. I, too, thank the Senator from North Dakota for his \nassistance on this matter that is so important to New Jersey health \ncare providers.\n\n\n                      Foreign Assistance Spending\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, as the United States fights this war \nagainst terrorism--and puts in place the programs called for in this \nemergency supplemental for homeland defense and on-going military \noperations in Afghanistan and elsewhere--we can't overlook the fact \nthat global poverty is a contributing factor and a breeding ground for \nterrorism, and that if we are to be successful in this war the United \nStates must significantly increase its foreign assistance spending \ncommitments.\n  Several of my colleagues and I had hoped to be able to do so on this \nemergency supplemental. Unfortunately, this does not appear to be \npossible.\n  But we want to be clear that we remain committed to this goal, and \nintend to work through the normal appropriations process to see this \nhappen.\n  It is in our country's national interest to bring aid and \nfunctioning, free-market democratic institutions to countries and \nregions that might otherwise wallow in poverty, be preyed on by \nfanatics, or provide safe havens for terrorists.\n  I see one of my colleagues in these efforts, Senator DeWine, and \nwould ask him his thoughts on the importance of this issue in \nsafeguarding U.S. national interests.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I would like to echo what my colleague from California \nhas said. Providing humanitarian assistance is in our national \ninterest, and it is also the right thing to do. We have a moral \nobligation to help ease the suffering that billions of people are \nfacing around the world. We have an obligation to help those in the \nworld who are suffering at the hands of evil leaders and corrupt \ngovernments.\n  We know that chaos, poverty, hunger, political uncertainty, and \nsocial stability are the root causes of violence and conflict around \nthe world. We also know that if used correctly, our foreign assistance \nis a vital foreign policy tool to prevent violence and conflict. Our \nforeign aid can be used to fight global terrorism and foster political \nstability, food security, rule of law, democracy, and ultimately peace \naround the world. When applied effectively, foreign assistance works.\n  One of the many lessons of the tragic September 11th terrorist \nattacks is that we must not wait for a nation to implode before we take \naction. We must not wait for a nation's people to suffer from poverty, \ndisease, hunger, despotic leaders, or corrupt governments.\n  Yet, tragically, despite its importance and immeasurable value, our \noverall foreign affairs budget has been stagnant for the past 20 years. \nAnd in real dollars, it has gone down. That is a mistake.\n  I ask my colleague from California, what level does U.S. foreign \nassistance spending stand at today?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. United States foreign assistance spending today is \njust eight-tenths of 1 percent of the budget with less than six-tenths \nof 1 percent going to humanitarian assistance and economic development.\n  And yet, 2.8 billion people on this planet live in abject poverty--\ngetting by on $2 a day or less. That's less than a cappuccino at \nStarbucks. Close to 1 billion people are undernourished; 1.2 billion \nlack access to even safe drinking water; and 2.5 million do not have \naccess to adequate sanitation.\n  In the wake of September 11, I introduced a resolution to triple our \nforeign aid budget over the next 5 years, a resolution which was passed \nby the Senate just this week.\n  So I was pleased when president Bush committed to increasing the \nUnited States foreign aid by an additional $10 billion over 4 years, \nbeginning in 2004. The President is to be commended for this \ninitiative.\n  But although this additional funding represents a significant \nincrease in foreign aid it is still well short of historic levels, and \nwell short of the level I believe is needed to engage and win the war \nagainst terrorism.\n  In 1946, the United States devoted 3 percent of its Federal budget to \nforeign assistance--a high water mark which was reached again under the \nKennedy administration.\n  But since then, spending has gone downhill. According to a \nCongressional Budget Office report entitled ``The Role of Foreign Aid \nin Development,'' United States spending on foreign assistance has \nfluctuated from year-to-year but has been on a downward path since the \n1960's. A tripling of our foreign aid budget--a level that I consider \nto be appropriate and which the Senate is now on record as supporting--\nwould simply bring it back in line with historic levels.\n  If the United States is to be successful in the war on terrorism--if \nwe are to be successful in helping to spread democracy and free-markets \naround the\n\n[[Page S5187]]\n\nglobe--we must be willing to step up and bear the burden of leadership.\n  Even looking beyond the humanitarian rationale--which I believe is \nsufficient reason alone for action--the United States will never be \nsecure in a world in which: Sub-Saharan Africa is ravaged by the AIDS \npandemic; more than half the people of the world go to bed hungry every \nnight; civil wars are a constant; and where failed or failing states, \nunable to meet the needs of their peoples, and allow terrorists and \nterrorism to thrive.\n  Reducing poverty, promoting equitable economic growth, and developing \ndemocratic institutions advances United States national security \ninterests. The failure to address these issues through a significant \nincrease in foreign assistance spending, and the resulting risk of \nsocial, economic, and political instability and violence, places United \nStates national security interests and the welfare and safety of United \nStates citizens at risk.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the days and years \nahead to address this important issue, and to assure that U.S. foreign \nassistance spending levels are appropriate to the challenges that our \nnation faces and our leadership position in the international \ncommunity.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague. Our foreign assistance is \nabsolutely critical for people in war-ravaged, politically unstable, \nimpoverished nations. The children, the elderly, and the civilian \npeople are not responsible for the political and economic turmoil in \ntheir homelands, but they are the ones who always end up suffering the \nmost. I look forward to working with you to continue to help these \nfolks around the world. We have a moral obligation to stay committed to \nthese people.\n\n\n                             litening pods\n\n Mr. DASCHLE. I wish to briefly discuss with the distinguished \nchairman of the Senate Defense Appropriations Committee the LITENING \ntargeting pods--an issue of some concern to the Air National Guard in \nmy state and many others around the country.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I am delighted to discuss LITENING pods with the majority \nleader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As the chairman knows, on April 24th, in testimony \nbefore the Senate Appropriations Committee, the Air National Guard \n(ANG) identified the procurement of 24 additional LITENING II targeting \npods as their number one priority. At the present time, U.S. ANG \nfighter components equipped with the LITENING II targeting pods are \nparticipating in Operation Noble Eagle and Operation Enduring Freedom. \nBy all accounts, the ANG aircraft are performing their combat missions \nwith great success, due in large measure to the fact that the pods \nprovide the aircraft with a precision target capability. As a result, \nthe Air National Guard has established a requirement to equip \nadditional ANG aircraft with the LITENING II pods. The South Dakota \nNational Guard has indicated to me that their mission effectiveness \nwould be greatly enhanced if we were to outfit their aircraft with \nthese pods. Other Senators from other states have heard a similar \nmessage from their Guard units. We all agree that the procurement of an \nadditional 24 LITENING II AT pods will greatly increase the Guard's \nability to carry out its combat missions.\n  Having said this, I am well aware of the many difficult decisions the \nAppropriations Committee made in crafting this Supplemental. Resources \nare not limitless and difficult choices must be made--both in the \ndefense portions of this supplemental as well as the regular defense \nappropriations bill. As we wrap up debate on this important measure and \nbegin preparing for conference, I hope we will do all we can to provide \nour military with all the resources and tools they need to fight and \nwin the war on terrorism. Given the combat performance of the LITENING \nII pods and the high priority the ANG places on acquiring more, I hope \nwe can reach an agreement to procure 24 additional targeting pods for \nthe Guard.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I am aware of the testimony to which you refer and the \nimportance the Guard attaches to acquiring additional targeting pods. I \nwill gladly work with the Majority Leader to secure funds for \nadditional LITENING pods for the Air National Guard.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senate for his support on this important \nmatter.\n\n\n                     States Devastated by Flooding\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern with \nlanguage contained in the report accompanying the Emergency \nSupplemental Appropriations Act, specifically under the Watershed and \nFlood Prevention Program. During the month of May, much of the Midwest, \nand the State of Indiana in particular, was devastated by heavy rain \nand flooding. In our home state, a disaster declaration has been \nrequested for a total of 33 counties. Many of these areas were under \nwater for weeks and FEMA has recently completed its assessment of \ndamages.\n  I hope my friend from Wisconsin will add Indiana to the list of \nstates under the Watershed and Flood Prevention Program that have been \nadversely affected by flooding.\n  Mr. LUGAR. I join with my colleague from Indiana to express my \nconcern about the flooding situation in Indiana. A number of Indiana \ncommunities are working to recover from damages caused by recent \nflooding. Should the Conference Committee include a listing of specific \nstates in the final Conference report under this program, I hope \nIndiana will be included.\n  Mr. KOHL. I understand and am aware of the concerns expressed by my \ncolleagues from the State of Indiana, and want to assure them that \nIndiana is among the states for which NRCS has identified need and for \nwhich assistance is provided through this appropriation.\n  Mr. BAYH. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin and am happy to assist \nhim with any information that he might need to ensure that Indiana's \nconcerns are adequately addressed in the conference.\n\n\n                  Medicare Reclassification Amendments\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have just looked over a list of \namendments to the supplemental appropriations bill and noticed that \nseveral fall within the jurisdiction of the Finance Committee.\n  I am most concerned about several hospital reclassification \namendments that were filed. The House bill included reclassifications \nfor hospitals in New York and Pennsylvania counties, and that has only \nfueled the fire of other members to get their ``rifle shot'' fixes in \nthe bill too.\n  I oppose these provisions, and I believe that Ranking Member Grassley \nshares my policy concerns.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Absolutely. There is an administrative structure \nalready in place for hospitals and counties to seek these \nreclassifications. This process was put into the Medicare statute \nspecifically to review and adjust payments to hospitals that might be \ndisadvantaged under the current system.\n  Unfortunately, hospitals often seek a legislative remedy either \nbefore they have exhausted this administrative avenue or after they \nhave been turned down by the Classification Review Board because they \ndon't meet the standards.\n  It is also my observation that including one hospital or one county \nwill only invite dozens of other hospitals and counties to seek similar \npayment increases, regardless of whether such a fix is warranted.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Not to mention that these reclassifications are unfair to \nother hospitals. Reclassifications from rural to urban counties are \nbudget neutral. That means that every change we make will decrease \npayments to all other hospitals. My Montana hospitals are not \nenthusiastic about shouldering the burden of financial gains for \nhospitals across the country.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Hospitals in Iowa are already concerned about payment \nlevels compared to more urban states. It is not acceptable to me to \nlower payments to them for the benefit of hospitals in other states \nthat are already much higher paid. One approach we should consider for \nrifleshots is to require budget neutrality to be applied only to \nhospitals in the area into which the county is reclassified, or perhaps \nto all hospitals in that state. In other words, if hospitals in certain \nNew York counties want to be reclassified into New York City, then the \nbudget neutrality payment reductions could be applied to New York City \nhospitals, or to all hospitals in New York State, rather than to the \nrest of the country.\n\n[[Page S5188]]\n\nThat might help bring some discipline to this issue.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is not a bad idea, and something that maybe the \nFinance Committee ought to look into.\n  Let me close by adding that the Finance Committee, and not the \nAppropriations Committee or any other Committee, should be making these \npolicy decisions.\n  The Finance Committee has worked to safeguard and improve the \nprograms under its jurisdiction. Any requests for additional changes to \nthese programs, including further increases in provider payments or \nchanges in payment for individual hospitals or counties, need to be \nexamined with great care.\n  Our committee intends to address Medicare payment policy issues this \nyear. Given that there is an opportunity to consider legislation to \nchange Medicare provider payment policies in the coming months, we do \nnot believe there is any reason to take action on any legislation that \nis not of a time-sensitive nature at this time.\n  Therefore, we will object to the consideration by the Senate until \nthe material in question is removed.\n  As I have said in the past, I look forward to working together in a \nbipartisan fashion on all of the other Medicare, Medicaid, and health \nissues that the Congress will be working on this summer and fall.\n\n\n                     metropolitan statistical areas\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman of \nthe Committee, Senator Byrd, in a colloquy regarding the inequities in \nMedicare reimbursement rates that many hospitals in Pennsylvania are \nexperiencing.\n  Many Northeastern Pennsylvania hospitals are facing substantial \noperating losses. This region's hospitals are extremely dependent on \nMedicare reimbursements and are experiencing one of the most rapid and \ndramatic shifts to managed care in the country. While almost no \nhospital in the Nation has been left untouched by the cost pressures \ninflicted by the Balanced Budget Act, hospitals in Schuylkill County, \nScranton-Wilkes Barre-Hazelton, Williamsport and Sharon, Pennsylvania \nface unique situations.\n  Scranton-Wilkes Barre-Hazelton and Williamsport are being reimbursed \nat 12% less than their neighbor--the Geisenger medical center--because \nGeisinger has been reclassified as part of the Harrisburg Metropolitan \nStatistical Area. The Sharon medical center is having difficulty hiring \nskilled workers because they are located only 12 miles from the Ohio \nborder. The Sharon reimbursement rate is unacceptably low compared to \nthe reimbursements received by the Ohio hospitals.\n  Last year, during conference deliberations on the FY 02 Labor, Health \nand Human Services and Education appropriations bills, the conference \nwas prepared to include the provision to correct the inequities faced \nby these hospitals. However, during that conference, word came that if \nthe provision was included, the conference report would be subject to a \npoint of order under Rule XVIII and on those grounds, you objected to \nthe provision. At that time, I left the conference and came down to \ntalk to you. You understandably said that you could not agree to the \nprovision because Rule XVIII had to be observed. At my request, you did \nstate that you would give very serious consideration to including it in \nthe FY 02 Supplemental Appropriations bill.\n  Mr. BYRD. The Senator is correct. You and I had a discussion \nregarding the unique situation facing the Pennsylvania hospitals and I \nsympathized with the plight of these hospitals. However, because your \nreclassification provision would have violated Rule XXVIII, which \nprecludes matter from being included in conference agreements unless \nrelevant language was contained in either the House or Senate version \nof the appropriation bill, we were unable to accommodate your \nprovision.\n  Mr. SPECTER. This year, Mr. Chairman, the FY 02 supplemental \nappropriations bill that passed the House on May 24, 2002, does include \ntwo Medicare provisions which would reclassify some Pennsylvania and \nNew York Hospitals.\n  Mr. BYRD. This is a matter that is in conference. I will give it \nserious consideration. However, I shall point out that the Chairman and \nRanking Member of the Senate Finance Committee have written to me, \nopposing inclusion of any items in this Supplemental that fall within \ntheir committee's jurisdiction.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chairman of the Committee. I intend to work \nout language in the conference that will be acceptable to all parties \nand include the reclassification provisions for these Pennsylvania \nhospitals.\n\n\n                         arkansas river bridge\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senators Byrd, \nStevens, Shelby, and Murray for their help in providing the necessary \nfunding for the repair and reconstruction of the Arkansas River bridge \non Interstate 40 which was hit by a barge on the morning of May 26. As \nmy colleagues are aware, the accident caused a catastrophic failure of \nthe bridge structure and resulted in several sections of the bridge \ncollapsing. Tragically, 14 lives were lost before the traffic crossing \nthe bridge was stopped.\n  Interstate 40 is a major east-west route for personal vehicle traffic \nas well as commercial trucking. According to the American Trucking \nAssociation, approximately 40% of the traffic on I-40 each day is \ntrucks. The estimated cost to just the trucks delayed by the detour is \nestamated by ATA to be $480,000 per day. That does not even consider \nthe cost to passenger traffic as a result of the delay. Lengthy travel \ndelays are exaggerated by the fact that the immediate area around the \nbridge is rural and alternate routes are only two lanes.\n  According to transportation statistics, the chances of an accident \noccurring on a narrow two lane road is double when compared to a four \nlane divided highway. Complicating that of course is the added problem \nof the increased truck traffic.\n  Mr. President, we are facing not only a major east-west traffic \ndisruption and all the corresponding economic consequences, but the \nelements are in place for a serious safety hazard. The potential for \nfurther loss of life cannot be overstated.\n  It is because of these reasons that I was happy to work with the \nAppropriation committee in securing the emergency spending for Oklahoma \nto reconstruct the bridge.\n  This reconstruction is eligible for reimbursement under the Emergency \nRelief program with the Federal Highway Administration. Unfortunately, \nthat program has a $108 million backlog which means that Oklahoma could \nnot reasonably expect to be reimbursed in a timely manner. Because \nOklahoma highway resources are fully committed, it would be impossible \nto get the repairs on the bridge done quickly if they could not on a \nquick reimbursement. This language addresses not only the Oklahoma \nemergency but also the backlog of existing needs in the Emergency \nRelief program.\n  I see my Colleagues, Senator Nickles is also wanting to speak on \nthis, so I yield the floor to him.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I would first like to thank President \nBush for providing the down payment of $3 million to begin the process \nof the recovery. I would also like to thank Senators Byrd, Stevens, \nShelby and Murray for their help in providing the remaining $12 \nmillion. This is the appropriate way to respond to an emergency.\n  Interstate 40 is one of the nation's vital east-west links. This \ntragedy not only took lives, but also is causing hardships and major \neconomic disruptions in surrounding communities.\n  I applaud Senator Inhofe for his efforts. I am pleased that we could \nwork together to secure the additional funds for the bridge repair and \nall other associated costs.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, included in the supplemental is foreign \nassistance for Turkey. My colleagues and I recognize and appreciate \nTurkey's contributions to our war on terrorism and the reconstruction \nof Afghanistan.\n  We are also aware of a recent meeting in Iceland between the foreign \nminister of Turkey and Armenia, and encourage additional efforts to \nimprove bilateral relations. I fully support the President's April 24, \n2002 statement calling for Turkey to restore economic, political and \ncultural links with Armenia. I have already communicated to both the \nSecretary of State and the Secretary of Defense my hope that confidence \nbuilding measures--including\n\n[[Page S5189]]\n\nopening a rail link between Kars, Turkey and Gyumri, Armenia--can be \nagreed upon and implemented. Opening the border is in America's \nnational interests, as I believe it may help America in our war on \nterrorism.\n  The benefits of resolving regional disputes greatly outweigh the \nmaintenance of the status quo. In short, regional stability not only \nenhances U.S. security interests, but also contributes to economic, \npolitical, and social development in Turkey and throughout the \nCaucuses.\n  Turkey and Armenia have an opportunity to make meaningful progress in \ntheir bilateral relations--and they have my support and encouragement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the President's statement be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                                              The White House,\n\n                                       Washington, April 24, 2002.\n       Today, we commemorate an appalling tragedy of the 20th \n     century, the massacre of as many as 1.5 million Armenians \n     through forced exile and murder at the end of the Ottoman \n     Empire. These horrific killings left wounds that remain \n     painful for people in Armenia, in Turkey, and around the \n     world. I join the Armenian community in America and across \n     the globe in mourning this horrendous loss of life.\n       Today is an occasion for the world to reflect upon and draw \n     lessons from these terrible events. It is a day for \n     recognizing that demonizing others lays the foundation for a \n     dark cycle of hatred. Transcending this venomous pattern \n     requires painful introspection about the past and wise \n     determination to forge a new future based on truth and \n     reconciliation. In this spirit, I look forward to Turkey \n     restoring economic, political, and cultural links with \n     Armenia.\n       The United States greatly values the contributions that \n     Armenians make to our national life. With faith and courage, \n     generations of Armenians have overcome great suffering and \n     proudly preserved their centuries-old culture, traditions, \n     and religion. The United States is also deeply grateful for \n     Armenia's swift and decisive cooperation in the war against \n     terrorism.\n       Just as the United States reached out to the Armenian \n     people to provide shelter and freedom early in the last \n     century, so did Armenia extend a supportive hand to the \n     American people in the immediate aftermath of September 11. \n     Our two peoples stand together in this fight in support of \n     values that define civilization itself.\n       I am also very proud of America's strong support for a free \n     Armenian state, whose citizens enjoy the fruits of peace and \n     increasing prosperity. In the months to come, America will \n     continue to increase its security cooperation with Armenia \n     and with Armenia's neighbors to combat terrorism and pursue a \n     lasting and just settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, \n     which will strengthen peace and stability in the Caucasus. \n     The United States will also continue its strong support for \n     Armenia's efforts to develop democratic and free market \n     institutions, and to deepen its integration into the Euro-\n     Atlantic community.\n       On behalf of the American people, I send warm wishes and \n     expressions of solidarity to the Armenian people on this \n     solemn day of remembrance. Together, our nations look with \n     hope and determination toward a future of peace, prosperity, \n     and freedom.\n                                                   George W. Bush.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to S. 2551, legislation \nmaking supplemental appropriations for further recovery from and \nresponse to terrorist attacks on the United States for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 2002, and for other purposes.\n  On March 21, the President submitted to Congress a $27.1 billion \nrequest for emergency funding to continue to fight the war on terrorism \nand respond to the September 11 attacks on our country. It was a \nprudent request and one that should have been quickly acted upon. The \nlegislation passed on May 24 by the House of Representatives closely \ntracked the President's request. Unfortunately, the majority in the \nSenate has chosen a much different course of action and constructed a \nwasteful amalgamation of pork.\n  The President asked for emergency funding for critical resources to \nsupport the war on terrorism and secure the homeland as we recover and \nrebuild. Yet the product before the Senate includes scores of unneeded \nitems that cost billions of dollars--all classified as an \n``emergency.'' The numbers speak for themselves. The Senate \nAppropriations Committee reported out a bill that spends $3.8 billion \nmore than requested by the President, for a total of over $31 billion. \nMore significantly, by reshuffling priorities, the committee failed to \nfund $10.4 billion in emergency spending items that the President had \nrequested, and instead decided to fund $14.6 billion in spending items \nnot included in the President's request. Most astounding is the fact \nthat each Federal agency is allocated more money than the President \nrequested except for one--the Department of Defense. I cannot support \nthis bill.\n  Fortunately, it will never be enacted into law. On June 4, the \nadministration sent the Senate a Statement of Administration Policy. \nPointedly, the letter says that, ``[i]f the supplemental appropriation \nbill were presented to the President in its current form, his senior \nadvisors would recommend that he veto the bill.'' Our efforts to \nimprove this legislation have been thwarted by the Majority. \nConsequently, this legislation should be vetoed by the President if it \nreaches his desk.\n  It is important to remember the context here: that the Federal \nGovernment is facing a potential deficit somewhere in the range of $100 \nto $150 billion. Spending needs must be met, but they must be met in a \nresponsible manner. This bill truly fails the test of fiscal \nrestraint--with every extra dime, it should be noted, coming out of the \nSocial Security surplus. It is worth mentioning that some of the most \nvocal supporters of this bill are those very same Senators who \nroutinely lament efforts to return taxpayer dollars to the American \npeople in the form of tax relief. In fact, this bill costs--in spending \nfor this year alone--30 times more than what it would cost to make \nrepeal of the death tax permanent. It is deeply disappointing to me \nthat those Senators who reflexively label tax relief ``fiscally \nirresponsible'' are the quickest to turn right around and spend it on \nunnecessary items in the name of an ``emergency.''\n  The fact is that the great majority of these questionable add-ons are \nfor purposes that have absolutely nothing to do with national defense, \nhomeland security, or antiterrorism efforts--for example, $11 million \nto the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, for \neconomic assistance to New England fishermen and fishing communities; \n$2 million for the Smithsonian to begin design of an alcohol storage \nfacility for specimens; $50 million for renovating the Ames, IA animal \nresearch lab; $45 million for Amtrak; $40 million for monitoring animal \nhealth and enhancing pest detection; and $2.5 million for charting the \nHawaiian coral reefs. This is just a small sample of an exhaustive list \nof funding for programs totally unrelated to homeland security.\n  As the administration's SAP accurately states, ``[t]he President's FY \n2002 emergency supplemental request was targeted at this year's \nimmediate emergency needs and funding in addition to this request is \nnot warranted at this time.'' The SAP continues by stating that the \nSenate bill ``includes scores of unneeded items that total billions of \ndollars--all classified as `emergency.' The bill adds unrequested funds \nfor numerous programs and projects throughout nearly all of the Federal \nagencies.''\n  What's more, the bill, by requiring that the President designate as \nemergency items ``all or none'' of its nondefense funding items, unduly \nrestricts the President's authority. Under the Budget Enforcement Act, \nthe President is supposed to have control over the release of emergency \nfunds added by the Congress to ensure that the funds respond to \ncritical emergency needs. By contravening this long-established budget \nenforcement mechanism, the Senate would require the President to waste \ntaxpayers' dollars on low-priority, nonemergency items in order to \naccess high priority homeland security and recovery funding. Thus, this \nlegislation prohibits the President from designating anything for \ndefense--such as ammunition and medical stocks--as an emergency, unless \nunrequested items--like alcohol collections and coral reef charting--\nare also designated as emergencies.\n  Expansion of government often occurs during times of war. We have a \nfundamental responsibility to the American people, however, to use only \nthose additional resources necessary to counter the threat to our \ncountry. It is not our place to use the current emergency as a veil for \nour own special interest initiatives. Unfortunately, the Senate \nsupplemental appropriation funding bill breaks faith with the American \npeople, and accordingly, I vote my conscience. I vote no.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday's terror attack in the Middle\n\n[[Page S5190]]\n\nEast is tragic and heartbreaking. A car packed with explosives and \ndriven by a Palestinian terrorist blew up next to a bus near the town \nof Afula in northern Israel, killing at least 17 people and wounding \ndozens more.\n  This act of terrorism came on the 35th anniversary of the 1967 \nMideast War.\n  The Palestinian terrorist group ``Islamic Jihad'' claimed \nresponsibility for the attack, which occurred during CIA Director \nGeorge Tenet's trip to the region. It is clear that extremists are \nactively undermining any prospects for peace with Israel.\n  PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat--by virtue of his inability to reign-in \nextremists and terrorists--is becoming increasingly irrelevant in the \npeace process. It is time for Arafat to lead the Palestinians to peace, \nor to pass the mantle to someone who will.\n  The amendment I offer will allow Israel to use the funds appropriated \nin the supplemental bill in the most targeted and effective manner to \ncounter terrorism that is claiming innocent lives and destroying \nprospects for peace in that region.\n  As this aid is provided through the Economic Support Fund (ESF) \naccount, its use is restricted in a manner that does not address our \nally's most pressing counterterrorism needs--non-lethal equipment vital \nto defending civilian populations from terrorist attacks.\n  Section 531(e) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 expressly \nprohibits the use of ESF funds for ``military or paramilitary \npurposes''. I do not believe that it is the intention of the Senate to \nhamstring the ability of Israel authorities to counter the clear and \never-present danger posed to Israeli civilians by homicide bombers.\n  My amendment provides for the transfer of ESF funds for Israel in \nthis bill to the ``Nonproliferation, Anti-Terrorism, Demining and \nRelated Programs'' account, which will allow for the purchase of non-\nlethal equipment that will contribute to countering acts of terrorism \nagainst the Israeli people. This includes bomb detection, x-ray, and \npersonnel protection equipment, among other essential items.\n  Let me be clear that the defensive nature of the assistance provided \nto Israel in this supplemental bill is unchanged by my amendment, as is \nthe overall amount provided for counterterrorism programs and \nactivities.\n  Mr. President, Americans understand the devastation caused by \nextremists bent on waging jihad against the world's democracies. We \nknow the pain of surprise attacks, and the collective suffering of a \nnation following the slaughter of innocent civilians.\n  During these difficult times, the people of Israel should know that \nthey do not stand alone. We have a common enemy in terrorism. And we \nwill fight--and win--as many battles as it takes to protect the freedom \nand democracy both the American and Israeli people enjoy.\n  Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in keeping in our \nthoughts and prayers the victims and their families of this latest \nterrorist attack.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I address some of the concerns I have \nwith H.R. 4775, the Fiscal Year 2002 Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations Act.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the cost of \nPresident Bush's emergency spending request is pegged at $28.4 billion. \nThis Senate bill we are considering is almost $4 billion more than what \nPresident Bush requested in his emergency supplemental request to \nCongress. And even though the Senate bill we are considering is \nbillions more than what the President requested, we still aren't even \nfully funding $10.4 billion in emergency spending requested by the \nPresident. We are shortchanging the President $10.4 billion in this \nbill from his emergency spending request to help fight the war on \nterrorism, yet we are piling on $4 billion in new funding in special \nprojects which is not at all designated as emergency spending by the \nPresident.\n  The bill's priority funding of non-emergency measures, while ignoring \nthe President's full request for emergency funding to fight terrorism \nand ensure the safety of our citizens, just doesn't make sense to me. \nThe real kicker is this, Mr. President, despite the $4 billion of \noverfunding in this bill, only one federal agency did not receive more \nmoney than requested by President Bush--the Department of Defense. The \npurpose of this bill is to provide the President with emergency funding \nto help fight the war on terrorism, and in this bill we are refusing to \nfully fund the Department of Defense's needs to help us fight this war. \nThat point baffles me.\n  As well, I am disappointed that we were unable to address some \nserious budgetary issues facing the Senate. We have no fiscal year 2003 \nbudget resolution or discretionary spending caps as we venture towards \ncommittee and floor consideration of our 13 appropriations bills. For \nthe first time since 1974 the Senate has failed to pass a budget \nresolution. This is embarrassing and a bit disgraceful. It is not \nsimply a problem for the Senate alone. The lack of a budget resolution \nis the potential problem of every American. For without a budget \nresolution and discretionary allocation limits, we are essentially \nwalking Americans down a path scattered with deficit and debt \nlandmines.\n  Let me just touch on how bad things have gotten lately with our \nNation's checkbook. Last year, CBO anticipated and predicted a $313 \nbillion surplus for fiscal year 2002. And now, we all know we are \nfacing a gaping deficit. We will borrow and spend all of the $168 \nbillion Social Security surplus and at the same time have to borrow \nabout another $137 billion from the private markets. So the bottom line \nis that we are going to have to borrow over $300 billion. And this is \nnew debt stacked on top of the whopping $6 trillion debt we already \nhave.\n  Now we can all cross our fingers and hope that we are going to \nexperience a long economic recovery which will allow us to balance our \nfederal checkbook and say goodbye to deficits and debt, but that just \nisn't smart and fiscally prudent. If there is no timely recovery with \nthe growth rate we all would like to anticipate, then the deficits are \ngoing to get bigger and bigger and make it all the harder in the future \nto curb spending and get any reign on fiscal restraint. I know some of \nthese choices aren't easy to make, but we have to make them.\n  Earlier today we had the opportunity to pass a provision on this bill \nto institute some fiscal discipline by imposing some enforceable \ndiscretionary spending caps. Unfortunately, this provision failed. \nHopefully, somehow soon before we trek down the appropriations process, \nwe can set some limits on spending and live within our means.\n  The White House has released a Statement of Administration Policy for \nthe Senate on this bill. President Bush say he will veto this bill \noutright because of the lack of fully funding his emergency requests, \nand because there are many extraneous spending provisions in the bill \nthat he did not request.\n  In fact, here is a quote from President Bush regarding the \nsupplemental bill. He say, ``It's important that we get a supplemental \nout and, frankly, a supplemental that doesn't bust the budget. And \nwe'll be looking forward to working with senators, to explain to them \nthat the supplemental ought to focus on emergency measures, measures \nthat are needed to fight the war, to button-up the homeland. But the \nsupplemental shouldn't be viewed as an opportunity to load it up with \nspecial projects.''\n  I am hopeful that when we eventually get to conference with the House \nof Representatives, that the conferees work to report a bill out which \nremoves the non-emergency spending, fully funds the President's \nemergency spending request, and addresses the fact that we have set no \nlimits on discretionary spending for fiscal year 2003.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for time allotted to me to address my \nconcerns with this bill.\n  Mr. MILLER. Mr. President, before we invoked cloture on the \nsupplemental appropriations bill today, it had been my intention to \noffer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution, which I believed was a very \nimportant statement about our commitment to fiscal constraint and \nresponsibility. Senate rules now prevent my amendment from being \nconsidered, so I want to go on record regarding the amendment, our \nbudgetary situation and the need to tighten our belts.\n\n[[Page S5191]]\n\n  The bill we are considering, S. 2551, a bill making supplemental \nappropriations for Further Recovery From and Response to Terrorist \nAttacks on the United States, was scored at $30.9 billion or roughly $4 \nbillion over the President's request of $27.1 billion. While this bill \nrecognizes the need to fund emergency homeland requirements and has \nmany worthwhile things in it, one could argue that some of its contents \nare questionable at best.\n  Now, I realize that ``pork'' and other unfavorable terms for specific \nprojects are clearly in the eyes of the beholder. But where does it all \nstop?\n  I am sure that we could all justify, even enthusiastically promote, \nprojects in our own states that most members might think loony or \nwasteful. Whether it is Federal marshals, summer school, hospitals or \njars of alcohol on the Mall, they are all important, but where does it \nstop? It is one thing to spend money for these types of things when you \nhave money, but quite another when your broke or in debt. That is why \nwe must have strong controls and a cap on what we can spend. I was \ndisappointed that the Senate rejected such controls yesterday voting \ndown the Feingold-Gregg amendment. I haven't been here long, but I do \nknow that if we don't enact some spending controls, things will get out \nof control quickly.\n  There is a general acknowledgement that a short-term budget deficit \nmay be necessary to provide the appropriate resources to fight the war \non terrorism. But at the same time, we need to look at the impact of \nthis very supplemental appropriations bill on our domestic spending and \nour budget deficit.\n  Therefore, I had intended to offer a sense-of-the-Senate resolution \nwhich basically said that the total of the fiscal year 2003 \nappropriations bills should have been reduced by the amount we spend \nover the President's request as determined by the Congressional Budget \nOffice. If this supplemental ends up being $3.8 billion higher or $4.2 \nbillion, or whatever the number is over the President's $27.1 billion \nrequest, then the Senate should agree that we would reduce our total \nappropriations figure by that amount in the upcoming appropriations \ncycle. It is not a scientific formula, just a start down the path of \nfiscal responsiblity--a concept that seems to have lost its \npreeminence.\n  So, while I will not offer this amendment today, I will promote this \nidea in the coming weeks and fight for real progress during the \nupcoming appropriations process.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I strongly support helping New England \nfishermen and their communities, and by that I mean helping them now, \nwhen they need it, not later this year or next year, but now. And I \nwant to thank our distinguished Chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee Senator Byrd and the Ranking Member Senator Stevens. I would \nalso like to thank Chairman Hollings of the Senate Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary and the \nSubcommittee Ranking Member, Senator Gregg, for their steadfast support \nof the New England fishermen and for including provisions to help \nfishermen and fishing communities in New England recover from the \neffects of a devastating lawsuit which is already having severe \neconomic consequences in New England.\n  The entire New England groundfish industry is reeling from a lawsuit \nthat was finally decided on May 23. I would like to point out that the \nfishing season starts on May 1, so the fishermen and the shore side \nindustry learned the rules by which they must live less than a month \ninto the season. It's hard to plan a fishing season under those \ncircumstances. And the ramifications reach beyond just our fishermen. \nWe have over 1,000 active groundfish boats in New England employing \nthousands of fishermen, and economists estimate that for each job on a \nfishing vessel we have four jobs on shore to support the industry.\n  In addition, Massachusetts Bay, the prime inshore fishing grounds for \nthe small day boats from our North Shore, South Shore and Provincetown \nfleets have been closed since January 1. The area was scheduled to open \nin May, but the court order extends that closure. These fishermen and \ntheir families are struggling and have barely made it through the \nwinter. Now, when May comes around they are unable to go fishing, earn \nsome money and pay the bills. These families need help now!\n  I want to be clear. We are not backing away from our obligation to \nprotect New England's fisheries. I know as much as anyone that this is \na federal resource. We have an obligation to protect it and preserve \nit, to ensure that generations of New Englanders have the opportunity \nto fish and to protect a Federal, natural resource that belongs to all \nAmericans. But at the same time, we are seeking some help for the \npeople and communities who bear the brunt of these necessary \nconservation rules. These people need some financial assistance while \nwe make the transition to sustainable fishing.\n  I would like to point out that it is not just the New England \nfishermen who are hurting. As I mentioned earlier, for every job at sea \nin Massachusetts, economists estimate that we have four shore side jobs \nto support the industry. This includes net makers, processors, ice \ndealers and boat maintenance facilities. I should add that part of the \ncourt order increased the mesh size from 6 inches to six and \\1/2\\ \ninches for all nets used to catch groundfish. This is great for \nconservation because it reduces the catch of undersized fish, however \novernight every fishermen had to replace his nets. That means that all \nof the net makers with 6 inch mesh were now sitting on hundreds of \nthousands of dollars of worthless inventory. For the typical gillnetter \nin New England this means they all have to come up with $10,000 before \nthey can go fishing. Remember, these are all small, family-owned \nbusinesses and in some cases these are people that have not been \nworking since January 1. These people need some help!\n  Again I wish to thank Senators Byrd, Stevens, Hollings and Gregg for \ntheir stalwart support of these hardworking fishermen and their \nfamilies.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the provisions in this supplemental that provide financial aid to \nthe New England groundfish fishery. This crisis is not caused by \nnatural disaster, but by the failure of our fisheries management system \nto effectively manage marine resources and dependent industries.\n  I worked with my colleagues from Massachusetts, Rhode Island and New \nHampshire to get this funding in the bill. And I want to thank the \nChairman, Senator Byrd, and the Ranking Member, Senator Stevens, for \nunderstanding the need for this funding.\n  The bill includes $11 million for economic assistance to fishermen \nand fishing communities affected by Federal closures and restrictions \non fishing. My State of Maine will receive $2 million as a result of \nthis provision. States have the option of developing locally-\nappropriate spending plans for this money or asking NMFS to distribute \nthe money, to ensure that it goes to those who need it most.\n  It also provides $5 million for direct economic assistance to those \nin the industry affected by court-ordered management measures, in \nreturn for their participation in activities that support port and \ncoastal security. In this way, we can meet two important goals, helping \nfishermen who temporarily cannot fish and helping coastal communities \nparticipate in national security efforts.\n  Over the past several months, New England fishermen have been \nwatching their livelihoods disappear. Litigation was brought against \nthe National Marine Fisheries Service for not rebuilding stocks fast \nenough, and this litigation ended in court-ordered management measures \nthat would have resulted in more than 4,000 lost days at sea for \nMaine's fishermen alone. The court ignored the negotiated settlement \nreached by the interested parties and issued its ruling five days \nbefore the fishing season started.\n  These numbers pale in comparison to the economic, cultural, and \nhistorical value of the New England groundfish fishery. In Maine alone, \n26,000 people have jobs directly related to the fishing industry and \nlast year groundfish alone accounted for $17.7 million in fish \nlandings. Nationally, the fishing industry contributes over $7 billion \nto the U.S. economy.\n  While the Judge reconsidered her original ruling and adopted the \nnegotiated settlement, the number of days\n\n[[Page S5192]]\n\nthat fishermen can target groundfish is reduced by a minimum of 20 \npercent. And that translates into thousands of lost fishing days and \nmillions of dollars lost to the regional economy.\n  The economic assistance in this bill will not fix the flaws in the \nmanagement system, but it will help our fishermen through a difficult \ntransition period while we fix the management problems that left NMFS \nfacing 104 lawsuits at the beginning of May. I am the Ranking Member of \nthe Commerce Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee, and I am working with \nChairman Kerry to get the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Act preauthorized \nso that we can stop managing our fisheries by litigation.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I would like to address the Senate today \nwith regard to the amendment offered by Senators Kennedy, Smith, and \nBoxer on Wednesday, June 5. As you know, this amendment would provide \n$150 million in emergency spending for the 21st Century Community \nLearning Centers program for summer school programs. While I do support \nthis program, I do not support the amendment offered by Senator \nKennedy.\n  The supplemental appropriations bill is designed to be a vehicle for \nemergency spending measures, most often funding for the defense of the \nUnited States. I am particularly disappointed with the Senate's version \nof the supplemental appropriations bill because it contains increased \nappropriations for every Federal department except for the Department \nof Defense while we are at war against terrorism.\n  In my opinion, funding for summer school programs simply does not \nqualify as emergency spending worthy of placement in the supplemental \nappropriations bill. It is highly likely that school districts and \nother eligible grantees would not even get the funds in enough time to \neffectively utilize them. I do recognize that many States have been \nfaced with difficult financial decisions because of constrained budgets \nand that many have had to cut summer school programs. The regular \nappropriations process for education programs is the appropriate time \nfor the Senate to determine the appropriation for the 21st Century \nCommunity Learning Centers program.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to briefly describe an \namendment that I filed to the fiscal year 2002 Emergency Supplemental \nAppropriations bill currently before the Senate. Simply, my amendment \ndealt with the Food and Drug Administration's `Pediatric Rule,' which \nthe agency issued in 1999 to require that companies conduct clinical \ntrials in which children are the subjects for drugs that may provide a \nhealth benefit for the pediatric population. After discussing my \namendment with several colleagues, I have decided not to offer it at \nthis time. I believe, however, that this is an important issue that \nmust be settled this year.\n  In 1999, FDA issued new regulations requiring pediatric studies of \ncertain new and marketed pharmaceutical and biological products. The \nagency determined that most drugs had not been adequately tested in the \npediatric population. The 1999 rule requires that manufacturers of \ncertain products provide sufficient data and information to support the \ndirections for pediatric use for claimed indications. The pediatric \nrule filled an important gap in FDA's regulation of drug and biologic \nproducts. I know that many of us have been concerned about the lack of \nimportant pediatric information on marketed drug products.\n  The rule and the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, which was \nenacted in January of this year, have different provisions, though they \ncomplement each other in important respects. The Best Pharmaceuticals \nfor Children Act provides incentives for companies to test products in \nchildren and provides them with six month pediatric marketing \nexclusivity for products approved for pediatric use. The statute does \nnot require any pediatric testing. In addition, the rule includes \nbiological products in its requirements whereas the statute does not. \nMany of the new products that may provide significant health benefits \nto the children of this country are biologics. And the statute only \nallows each product to be considered once in its lifecycle, which means \nthat FDA cannot request information on any pediatric uses not \nanticipated at the beginning.\n  I understand that the Secretary of Health and Human Services supports \nthe continued enforcement of the pediatric rule and that he so stated \nin a Labor Health and Human Services Appropriations Subcommittee \nhearing earlier this week.\n  Congressional action ensuring that the pediatric rule remains in \neffect for the foreseeable future is necessary and appropriate, and I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues in the coming weeks on this \nissue.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was very disturbed to learn that the \nAppropriations Committee included language in the Emergency \nSupplemental that would direct the Department of Transportation to work \nwith the Immigration and Naturalization Service and State motor vehicle \nauthorities to implement a policy with respect to immigrant eligibility \nfor drivers licenses. This decision was made without any consultation \nwith the Committee of jurisdiction. The issue of immigrant access to \ndrivers licenses is a complex one, implicating road safety, as well as \nquestions of immigration, discrimination and racial profiling. It is a \ncontroversial issue that is being addressed by almost all state \nlegislatures and about which there has yet to develop a national \nconsensus.\n  My reading of the provision is that this language applies solely in \nthe case where a State elects to move towards the policy on \nnonimmigrants referenced by the Report. In such a case, the Committee \nintends to direct the Department of Transportation to act as a liaison \nbetween the state motor vehicle department and the INS to facilitate \nimplementation of the State's policy.\n  This language should not be intended as a mandate to the states, nor \naffect in any way the States' discretion to determine which of their \nresidents is eligible for a drivers license. Indeed, there is no \nstatute on the books authorizing the Department of Transportation to \nlimit, entice, or otherwise influence a state's discretion to provide \ndrivers licenses to immigrants. Moreover, there are no funds in the \nbill itself or elsewhere that have been authorized for such purposes.\n  Finally, the language does not authorize the Department of \nTransportation or the Immigration and Naturalization Service to publish \nregulations or guidelines for States to follow, nor does it require any \nparticular action either by the Department of Transportation or by the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service.\n  Everyone agrees that drivers licenses must provide accurate and \nreliable proof of one's identity and ability to operate a motor \nvehicle. However, tying drivers licenses expiration dates to visa \nexpiration dates will not enhance our security. Sophisticated \nterrorists with substantial financial resources are likely to have the \nability to obtain drivers licenses when necessary, regardless of \nrestrictions like those discussed in the Supplemental.\n  Moreover, State drivers license issuing agencies should not be in the \nbusiness of verifying immigration status, as determining immigration \nstatus is very complicated with serious ramifications for all non-\ncitizens. The term nonimmigrant itself is a technical legal term that \nleads to much confusion. Errors will likely result as motor vehicle \npersonnel attempt to interpret complicated immigration law provisions. \nDistinguishing between immigrant, nonimmigrant, and other applicants, \nas well as understanding when visas expire, is complicated and very \ndifficult without proper training. Furthermore, nonimmigrant visas do \nnot have uniform documentation nor do they have a simple expiration \ndate.\n  Experience has shown that when public officials are required to check \nimmigration status, Latinos, Asians, and others who appear to be \nforeign are asked to produce additional documentation or have their \ndocuments more closely scrutinized. This behavior often results in \ncivil rights violations, frequently involving U.S. citizens and legal \npermanent residents.\n  While security concerns are extremely important, we need to consider \nthe negative consequences of linking drivers licenses to immigration \nstatus.\n  Mr. President, this legislation on supplemental appropriations for \nfurther recovery from and response to terrorist attacks on the United \nStates for fiscal year 2002 provides $15 million for the State \nDepartment to create a new\n\n[[Page S5193]]\n\nhigh school exchange program for students from predominantly Islamic \ncountries. The program that will be established with this funding is \nbased on S. 2505, the Cultural Bridges Act, which Senators Lugar, \nLeahy, Chafee, Dodd, Hagel, Gordon Smith, Cochran, Brownback, Jeffords, \nDurbin, Feingold, and I introduced on May 10.\n  One of the clear lessons of September 11th is that our government \nneeds to do more to ensure that future generations in the Islamic world \nunderstand more about American values and culture. A recent Gallup poll \nin nine predominantly Muslim countries revealed strong anti-American \nattitudes. Nearly 1.5 billion people live in the Islamic world, and if \nwe ignore these sentiments, we do so at our own peril. If we try to \naddress the problem directly, by teaching American values to students \nfrom the Islamic world, we have a chance, in the long run, of changing \nnegative attitudes. It's a long process, which September 11th has \ntaught us we must begin now.\n  There are no better ambassadors for American values than Americans \nthemselves, and student exchange programs have proven to be an \neffective tool in reaching out to the next generation of leaders. As \nSecretary Powell said in his August 2001 Statement on International \nEducation Week, ``I can think of no more valuable asset to our country \nthan the friendship of future world leaders who have been educated \nhere.''\n  In October of last year, President Bush spoke eloquently about the \nneed to reach out in friendship to children and the Islamic world. In a \nspeech to students at Thurgood Marshall Extended Elementary School, the \nPresident said that America is ``determined to build ties of trust and \nfriendship with people all around the world--particularly with children \nand people in the Islamic world.''\n  To facilitate the President's goal of reaching children, this \nsupplemental appropriations bill provides the funding that is essential \nfor the State Department to create a new program for high school \nstudents from the Islamic world to study in the United States. No \nfederal program currently exists to facilitate such student exchanges \nwith ever-increasing numbers of youth in the Islamic world.\n  There are many benefits to reaching out to students while they are \nyoung and open-minded to enhance mutual cultural understanding and \ntolerance. Today's high school students are tomorrow's leaders, and we \nneed to begin working with them now to inform their attitudes about our \ncountry.\n\n  In January 20, 2002 op-ed in the Washington Post, a former Fulbright \nscholarship recipient from Egypt expressed concern that his university \nin Egypt was and continues to be fertile ground for recruiters from \nterrorist or extremist organizations. Our challenge is to provide young \nstudents with the opportunity to learn about America, participate in \nall aspects of American family life, and understand our values before \nthey reach that stage.\n  The high school student exchange program that will be developed with \nthis funding will be modeled on the State Department's highly \nsuccessful Future Leaders Exchange Program (FLEX), which brings \napproximately 1,000 students ages 15-17 from the Newly Independent \nStates to the United States each year to attend an American high school \nfor a year and live with an American family.\n  The FLEX program has been extremely effective in shaping attitudes \namong the students selected to participate from the Newly Independent \nStates. A 1998 U.S. government study, which compared Russian FLEX \nalumni with other Russian youth of the same age, indicated that the \nFLEX alumni are more open to and accepting of Western values and \ndemocratic ideals. They are more likely to want to become leaders in \nand to make a contribution to their society. They tend to be more \noptimistic about the future of their country--especially its evolution \nto a more democratic, rule-of-law society--than other Russian youths.\n  Significantly, the FLEX program has been successful in the six \npredominantly Islamic countries from the Newly Independent States--\nAzerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and \nUzbekistan. More than 1,500 students from those Muslim countries have \nstudied and lived in the United States since the program began. FLEX \nalumni in Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan are teaching English in their \nhome countries, and alumni in Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have been \ninvolved in activities to develop democratic practices. Given the track \nrecord in these countries, there is every reason to believe that a high \nschool student exchange program would succeed throughout the Islamic \nworld.\n  Like the existing student exchange program for the Newly Independent \nStates, and consistent with the Cultural Bridges Act, this new program \nshould require participating students in high school exchanges from the \nIslamic world to be selected competitively and in a manner that ensures \ngeographic, gender, and socio-economic diversity. To qualify, students \nshould be tested extensively and interviewed under State Department \nguidelines. As with the FLEX program, the State Department should work \nwith experienced American non-governmental organizations to recruit, \nselect, and place students and will remain in close contact with the \npublic high school, American host family, and American non-governmental \norganizations while the students are in the United States.\n\n  Importantly, consistent with the Cultural Bridges Act, all students \nand visitors participating in programs authorized in this legislation \nshould be admissible under all immigration laws and procedures. \nFurthermore, legislation recently signed into law improves our ability \nto screen foreign students by requiring increased communication among \nthe State Department, the INS, and the schools enrolling foreign \nstudents and by closing gaps in the existing foreign student monitoring \nprogram.\n  The high school exchange program included in this supplemental \nappropriations bill has been endorsed by the Alliance for International \nEducation and Cultural Exchange, AMIDEAST, AFS, the Academy for \nEducational Development, the American Councils for International \nEducation, the American Institute for Foreign Study, the Institute of \nInternational Education, the National Council for International \nVisitors, Sister Cities International, World Learning, and World Study \nGroup.\n  America must respond to the terrorist threat on many levels. We need \nto ensure that our defenses are strong, our borders are secure, and our \nrelationships with allies are vibrant. We also need to do more in the \narea of public diplomacy.\n  It is clearly in America's national security interest to promote more \npeople-to-people contacts throughout the Muslim world. Indeed, in a May \n3rd speech to the World Affairs Council in California, Deputy Secretary \nof Defense Paul Wolfowitz spoke about the need to reach out and \nstrengthen voices of moderation in the Islamic world and to bridge the \n``dangerous gap'' between the West and the Muslim world. He said \nAmerica must ``begin now . . . the gap is wide and there is no time for \ndelay.''\n  After September 11, many of the Muslim countries condemned those acts \nand pledged to help the United States fight terrorism. As we have seen \nin Afghanistan, Pakistan, and elsewhere in the Muslim world, some \nindividuals and factions within a country can support terrorists and \nterrorist organizations, while others seek to resolve issues \npeacefully. America must reach out in friendship to all individuals in \nthe Islamic world who share our worldview.\n  The Koran says, ``O Mankind! We created you from a single pair of a \nmale and a female, and made you into nations and tribes, that ye may \nknow each other.'' These words speak eloquently of the need for this \nlegislation. Building bridges of understanding and tolerance across \ncultures will help ensure that Americans and people of the Islamic \nworld will truly understand and know each another.\n  I am grateful to Senator Leahy for recommending that funding for this \nnew student exchange program be included in the supplemental \nappropriations bill. I am grateful as well to Senators McConnell, Byrd, \nand Stevens for their support. I urge my colleagues to support funding \nfor this program, and I hope it will be preserved during the conference \non the supplemental appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the\n\n[[Page S5194]]\n\namendments and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendments were ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The bill having been read the third time, the question is, Shall it \npass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I take the floor at this late hour to \nexpress my appreciation to the senior Senator from Alaska, Mr. Stevens, \nfor his cooperation in handling this bill and for his masterful \nhandling of the bill on the floor. I thought it best to let him do that \nwithout any action or work on my part. The problem was on his side. I \nbelieved that Chairman Stevens was the man to deal with those things. \nHe did it to perfection. I thank him. We couldn't have gotten to this \npoint had it not been for Senator Stevens and his support.\n  Let me also thank Harry Reid. Senator Reid is a whip sui generis. He \nhas been a real asset to the leadership, and to the managers of the \nbill in getting this bill passed. It has taken hours on his part. For \nhis willingness to stay until the last, for his willingness to take our \nstatements and get them in the Record, I want to personally thank him \nfor a job well done. It is a hard job. I have been a whip. I have not \nbeen whipped, but I have been a whip around here. So I know the kind of \nwork he did.\n  I also thank the wonderful staff on both sides of the aisle. They \nworked hard. They worked during the hours after some of us went home to \nsleep. But they stayed here. And they will still be here after we go \nhome tonight. We can't thank them enough. They are excellent.\n  I thank Members on both sides of the aisle for the courtesies they \nextended.\n  I think this is a good bill. I am glad we passed it. We need to get \nit to conference. Perhaps there will battles there.\n  I thank all Senators, and I thank the floor staff--the people who are \nhere who work many hours. I thank you all.\n  Again, I thank Mr. Stevens. He couldn't be a better Senator from \nAlaska. He is the ``Senator of the 20th century'' from Alaska. I salute \nhim.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West Virginia. \nThe Senator from West Virginia is not only a great chairman, he is a \ngreat friend. I thank him for the privilege of trying to deal with the \nproblems that occurred on this side of the aisle.\n  I also join in thanking Senator Reid. I think he has shown \npersistence in trying to get this bill through. I don't criticize the \nconcept of having gone to cloture, but I do criticize the conduct of \nsome under cloture. We will have to deal with that later.\n  It is a difficult process. But I will say this: I think this bill is \nimportant to the country. It is very important to the President. It is \na bill which I think is very important to those of us who worked so \nhard to try to get it through. We are now going to go to conference \nwith the House. Many of the provisions in this bill the House is not \naware of yet, but I am sure they will be controversial. It is my hope \nwe can move in the conference sometime next week and hopefully try to \naddress some of the issues that are not in this bill today. They are in \nthe House bill. We have cut out some of them.\n  I am still bothered by the debt ceiling. I hope that leadership will \nlook to the debt ceiling problem to see if we can't get a stand-alone \nbill or some way to address that issue. I remember so well in days past \nwhen it would fester and get to the point where people were being \nthreatened of being put into jail and all of that because Congress had \nnot acted. The debt ceiling being lifted reflects the fact that the \neconomy of this country has expanded enormously. We have been through a \nperiod of inflation. As we go into a period of inflation and we roll \nover our debt, we end up with an imbalance by the passage of time \nrather than expenditures of money.\n  I believe we ought to accommodate the situation so that people who \nare administering our laws downtown don't feel fearful of what might \nhappen to them because of expenditures over which they really cannot \nmaintain total control. As we get close to these debt ceiling \nlimitations, I think Government slows down out of fear. This is no time \nto have that kind of reaction when we are at war.\n  I look forward to working with everyone with the hope that we can \naddress that problem sometime before the end of this month. Again, I \nthank my colleagues. I thank the Chair and everyone for their patience. \nI thank the Parliamentarian for his impartiality.\n  I was happy to see yesterday come to an end.\n  Thank you very much.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, very briefly, I have spoken to Senator \nDaschle about the debt limit. We have a freestanding debt limit bill. \nWe are going to work as hard as we can to get it to the floor as \nquickly as we can. I have spoken to Senator Daschle several times in \nthat regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \ninsist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses, and that the Chair be authorized \nto appoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The Presiding Officer (Mr. Durbin) appointed Mr. Byrd, Mr. Inouye, \nMr. Hollings, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Reid of Nevada, \nMr. Kohl, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \nJohnson, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Reed of Rhode Island, Mr. Stevens, Mr. \nCochran, Mr. Specter, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Bond, Mr. McConnell, Mr. Burns, \nMr. Shelby, Mr. Craig, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Campbell, Mr. Gregg, Mrs. \nHutchison of Texas, and Mr. DeWine conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are going to wrap up things here in just \na\n\n[[Page S5195]]\n\nminute. I would like to say publicly, as I have said to the Senators \nprivately, and to the Presiding Officer, that we have been through a \nvery difficult time while you have been presiding. It really is most \nhelpful, where there is confusion on the floor, to have someone who \nunderstands what is going on and who has absolute control of the \nSenate. You did an outstanding job of presiding. That is not easy.\n  We have Parliamentarians who help. But it certainly is a tremendous \nhelp if you have someone such as the Presiding Officer who makes the \ndecisions on his own. They were all right. I extend my appreciation and \nour appreciation for the way in which you presided over the Senate \nduring consideration of a most important bill. We have heard enough \ntalk about it.\n  But this is an important bill. It is an emergency supplemental \nappropriations bill which will help our troops, help homeland defense, \nand help veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/06/senate-section/article/S5195-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--S. 625\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, on May 23, 2002, the Senate passed the \nConference Report to H.R. 3448, the Public Health Security and \nBioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. Included in Title V \nof this Conference Report is the reauthorization of the Prescription \nDrug User Fee Act, ``PDUFA''.\n  Performance goals, existing outside of the statute, accompany the \nreauthorization of PDUFA. These goals represent a realistic projection \nof what the Food and Drug Administration Center for Drug Evaluation and \nResearch and Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research can \naccomplish with industry cooperation. The Secretary of Health and Human \nServices forwarded these goals to the chairmen of the Committee on \nEnergy and Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor and Pensions of the Senate, in a document \nentitled ``PDUFA Reauthorization Performance Goals and Procedures.'' \nAccording to Section 502 of the Conference Report, ``the fees \nauthorized by amendments made in this subtitle will be dedicated \ntowards expediting the drug development process and the process for the \nreview of human drug application as set forth in the goals in the \nCongressional Record.''\n  Today I am submitting for the Record this document, which was \nforwarded to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions on \nJune 4, 2002, as well as the letter from Secretary Thompson that \naccompanied the transmittal of this document.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  The Secretary of\n\n\n                                    Health and Human Services,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 2002.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \n         U.S. Senate Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kennedy: As you are aware, the Prescription \n     Drug User Fee Act of 1992 (PDUFA), as reauthorized by the \n     Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997, \n     expires at the end of Fiscal Year 2002. Under PDUFA, the \n     additional revenues generated from fees paid by the \n     pharmaceutical and biological prescription drug industries \n     have been used to expedite the process for the review of \n     prescription drugs, in accordance with performance goals that \n     were developed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in \n     consultation with PDUFA stakeholders.\n       FDA has worked with various stakeholders, including \n     representatives from consumer, patient, and health provider \n     groups, and the pharmaceutical and biological prescription \n     drug industries, to develop a reauthorization proposal for \n     PDUFA that would build upon and enhance the success of the \n     program. Title 5, Subtitle A, of the Public Health Security \n     and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, as \n     passed by the House on May 22, 2002, and by the Senate on May \n     23, 2002, reflects the fee mechanisms and other improvements \n     developed in these discussions. The performance goals \n     referenced in Section 502 are specified in the enclosure to \n     this letter, entitled ``PDUFA Reauthorization Performance \n     Goals and Procedures.'' I believe they represent a realistic \n     projection of what FDA can accomplish with industry \n     cooperation and both the additional resources identified in \n     the bill and annual FDA appropriations that fully cover the \n     costs of pay and inflation increases for the drug and \n     biologics review process each year.\n       This letter and the enclosed goals document pertain only to \n     Title 5, Subtitle A (Prescription Drug User Fees) of H.R. \n     3448, the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism \n     Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. OMB has advised that \n     there is no objection to the presentation of these views from \n     the standpoint of the Administration's program. We appreciate \n     the support of you and your staffs, the assistance of other \n     Members of the Committee, and that of the Appropriations \n     Committees, in the reauthorization of this vital program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Tommy S.

The performance goals for standard and priority original \n     NMEs in each submission cohort will be the same as for all of \n     the original NDAs (including NMEs) in each submission cohort \n     but shall be reported separately.\n       B. For biological products, for purposes of this \n     performance goal, all original BKSs will be considered to be \n     NMEs.\n\n\n                     iii. meeting management goals\n\n                    A. Responses to meeting requests\n\n       1. Procedure: Within 14 calendar days of the Agency's \n     receipt of a request from industry for a formal meeting \n     (i.e., a scheduled face-to-face, teleconference, or \n     videoconference) CBER and CDER should notify the requester in \n     writing (letter or fax) of the date, time, and place for the \n     meeting, as well as expected Center participants.\n       2. Performance Goal: FDA will provide this notification \n     within 14 days for 90% in FY 2003-2007.\n\n                         B. Scheduling meetings\n\n       1. Procedure: The meeting date should reflect the next \n     available date on which all applicable Center personnel are \n     available to attend, consistent with the component's other \n     business; however, the meeting should be scheduled consistent \n     with the type of meeting requested. If the requested date for \n     any of these types of meetings is greater than 30, 60, or 75 \n     calendar days (as appropriate) from the date the request is \n     received by the Agency, the meeting date should be within 14 \n     calendar days of the date requested.\n       Type A Meetings should occur within 30 calendar days of the \n     Agency receipt of the meeting request.\n       Type B Meetings should occur within 60 calendar days of the \n     Agency receipt of the meeting request.\n       Type C Meetings should occur within 75 calendar days of the \n     Agency receipt of the meeting request.\n       2. Performance goal: 90% of meetings are held within the \n     timeframe (based on cohort year of request) from FY 03 to FY \n     07.\n\n                           C. Meeting minutes\n\n       1. Procedure: The Agency will prepare minutes which will be \n     available to the sponsor 30 calendar days after the meeting. \n     The minutes will clearly outline the important agreements, \n     disagreements, issues for further discussion, and action \n     items from the meeting in bulleted form and need not be in \n     great detail.\n       2. Performance goal: 90% of minutes are issued within 30 \n     calendar days of date of meeting (based on cohort year of \n     meeting) in FY 03 to FY 07.\n\n                             D. Conditions\n\n       For a meeting to qualify for these performance goals:\n       1. A written request (letter or fax) should be submitted to \n     the review division; and\n       2. The letter should provide:\n       a. A brief statement of the purpose of the meeting;\n       b. A listing of the specific objectives/outcomes the \n     requester expects from the meeting;\n       c. A proposed agenda, including estimated times needed for \n     each agenda item;\n       d. A listing of planned external attendees;\n       e. A listing of requested participants/disciplines \n     representative(s) from the Center;\n       f. The approximate time that supporting documentation \n     (i.e., the ``backgrounder'') for the meeting will be sent to \n     the Center (i.e., ``x'' weeks prior to the meeting, but \n     should be received by the Center at least 2 weeks in advance \n     of the scheduled meeting for Type A meetings and at least 1 \n     month in advance of the scheduled meeting for Type B and Type \n     C meetings); and\n       3. The Agency concurs that the meeting will serve a useful \n     purpose (i.e., it is not premature or clearly unnecessary). \n     However, requests for a ``Type B'' meeting will be honored \n     except in the most unusual circumstances.\n\n\n                           iv. clinical holds\n\n       A. Procedure: The Center should respond to a sponsor's \n     complete response to a clinical hold within 30 days of the \n     Agency's receipt of the submission of such sponsor response.\n       B. Performance goal: 90% of such responses are provided \n     within 30 calendar days of the Agency's receipt of the \n     sponsor's response in FY 03 to FY 07 (cohort of date of \n     receipt).\n\n\n                      v. major dispute resolution\n\n                              A. Procedure\n\n       For procedural or scientific matters involving the review \n     of human drug applications and supplements (as defined in \n     PDUFA) that cannot be resolved at the divisional level \n     (including a request for reconsideration by the Division \n     after reviewing any materials that are planned to be \n     forwarded with an appeal to the next level), the response to \n     appeals of decisions will occur within 30 calendar days of \n     the Center's receipt of the written appeal.\n\n                          B. Performance goal\n\n       90% of such answers are provided within 30 calendar days of \n     the Center's receipt of the written appeal in FY 03 to FY 07.\n\n                             C. Conditions\n\n       1. Sponsors should first try to resolve the procedural or \n     scientific issue at the Division level. If it cannot be \n     resolved at that level, it should be appealed to the Office \n     Director level (with a copy to the Division Director) and \n     then, if necessary, to the Deputy Center Director or Center \n     Director (with a copy to the Office Director).\n       2. Responses should be either verbal (followed by a written \n     confirmation within 14 calendar days of the verbal \n     notification) or written and should ordinarily be to either \n     deny or grant the appeal.\n       3. If the decision is to deny the appeal, the response \n     should include reasons for the denial and any actions the \n     sponsor might take in order to persuade the Agency to reverse \n     its decision.\n       4. In some cases, further data or further input from others \n     might be needed to reach a decision on the appeal. In these \n     cases, the ``response'' should be the plan for obtaining that \n     information (e.g., requesting further information from the \n     sponsor, scheduling a meeting with the sponsor, scheduling \n     the issue for discussion at the next scheduled available \n     advisory committee).\n       5. In these cases, once the required information is \n     received by the Agency (including any advice from an advisory \n     committee), the person to whom the appeal was made, again has \n     30 calendar days from the receipt of the required information \n     in which to either deny or grant the appeal.\n       6. Again, if the decision is to deny the appeal, the \n     response should include the reasons for the denial and any \n     actions the sponsor might take in order to persuade the \n     Agency to reverse its decision.\n       7. N.B. If the Agency decides to present the issue to an \n     advisory committee and there are not 30 days before the next \n     scheduled advisory committee, the issue will be presented at \n     the following scheduled committee meeting in order to allow \n     conformance with advisory committee administrative \n     procedures.\n\n\n         vi. special protocol question assessment and agreement\n\n                              A. Procedure\n\n       Upon specific request by a sponsor (including specific \n     questions that the sponsor desires to be answered), the \n     agency will evaluate certain protocols and issues to assess \n     whether the design is adequate to meet scientific and \n     regulatory requirements identified by the sponsor.\n       1. The sponsor should submit a limited number of specific \n     questions about the protocol design and scientific and \n     regulatory requirements for which the sponsor seeks agreement \n     (e.g., is the dose range in the carcinogenicity study \n     adequate, considering the intended clinical dosage; are the \n     clinical endpoints adequate to support a specific efficacy \n     claim).\n       2. Within 45 days of Agency receipt of the protocol and \n     specific questions, the Agency will provide a written \n     response to the sponsor that includes a succinct assessment \n     of the protocol and answers to the questions posed by the \n     sponsor. If the agency does not agree that the protocol \n     design, execution plans, and data analyses are adequate to \n     achieve the goals of the sponsor, the reasons for the \n     disagreement will be explained in the response.\n\n[[Page S5197]]\n\n       3. Protocols that qualify for this program include: \n     carcinogenicity protocols, stability protocols, and Phase 3 \n     protocols for clinical trials that will form the primary \n     basis of an efficacy claim. (For such Phase 3 protocols to \n     qualify for this comprehensive protocol assessment, the \n     sponsor must have had an end of Phase 2/pre-Phase 3 meeting \n     with the review division so that the division is aware of the \n     developmental context in which the protocol is being reviewed \n     and the questions being answered.)\n       4. N.B. For products that will be using Subpart E or \n     Subpart H development schemes, the Phase 3 protocols \n     mentioned in this paragraph should be construed to mean those \n     protocols for trials that will form the primary basis of \n     an efficacy claim no matter what phase of drug development \n     in which they happen to be conducted.\n       5. If a protocol is reviewed under the process outlined \n     above and agreement with the Agency is reached on design, \n     execution, and analyses and if the results of the trial \n     conducted under the protocol substantiate the hypothesis of \n     the protocol, the Agency agrees that the data from the \n     protocol can be used as part of the primary basis for \n     approval of the product. The fundamental agreement here is \n     that having agreed to the design, execution, and analyses \n     proposed in protocols reviewed under this process, the Agency \n     will not later alter its perspective on the issues of design, \n     execution, or analyses under public health concerns \n     unrecognized at the time of protocol assessment under this \n     process are evident.\n\n                          B. Performance goal\n\n       90% of special protocols assessments and agreement requests \n     completed and returned to sponsor within timeframes (based on \n     cohort year of request) from FY 03 to FY 07.\n\n\n                 vii. continuous marketing application\n\n       To test whether providing early review of selected \n     applications and additional feedback and advice to sponsors \n     during drug development for selected products can further \n     shorten drug development and review times, FDA agrees to \n     conduct the following two pilot programs:\n\n A. Pilot 1--Discipline review letters for pre-submitted ``reviewable \n                          units'' of NDAs/BLAs\n\n       1. This pilot applies to drugs and biologics that have been \n     designated to be Fast Track drugs or biologics, pursuant to \n     section 112 of the FDA Modernization Act (21 U.S.C. 356), \n     have been the subject of an End-of-Phase 2 and/or a Pre-NDA/\n     BLA meeting, and have demonstrated significant promise as a \n     therapeutic advance in clinical trials.\n       2. For drugs and biologics that meet these criteria, FDA \n     may enter into an agreement with the sponsor to accept pre-\n     submission of one or more ``reviewable units'' of the \n     application in advance of the submission of the complete NDA/\n     BLA.\n       3. If following an initial review FDA finds a ``reviewable \n     unit'' to be substantially complete for review (i.e., after a \n     ``filing review'' similar to that performed on an NDA/BLA), \n     FDA will initiate a review clock for the complete review of \n     the ``reviewable unit'' of the NDA/BLA. The review clock \n     would start from the date of receipt of the ``reviewable \n     unit.''\n       4. To be considered fileable for review under paragraph 3, \n     a ``reviewable unit'' must be substantially complete when \n     submitted to FDA. Once a ``reviewable unit'' is ``filed'' by \n     FDA, except as provided in paragraph 5 below, only minor \n     information amendments submitted in response to FDA inquiries \n     or requests and routine stability and safety updates will be \n     considered during the review cycle.\n       5. Major amendments to the `'reviewable unit'' are strongly \n     discouraged. However, in rare cases, and with prior \n     agreement, FDA may accept and consider for review a major \n     amendment to a ``reviewable unit.'' To accommodate these rare \n     cases, a major amendment to a ``reviewable unit'' submitted \n     within the last three months of a 6-month review cycle may, \n     at FDA's discretion, trigger a 3-month extension of the \n     review clock for the ``reviewable unit'' in question. In no \n     case, however, would a major amendment be accepted for \n     review and the review clock for the ``reviewable unit'' \n     extended if the extended review clock for the ``reviewable \n     unit'' exceeded the review clock for the complete NDA/BLA. \n     (See paragraph 10 below).\n       6. After completion of review of the ``reviewable unit'' of \n     the NDA/BLA by the appropriate discipline review team, FDA \n     will provide written feedback to the sponsor of the review \n     findings in the form of a discipline review letter (DRL).\n       7. The DRL will provide feedback on the individual \n     ``reviewable unit'' from the discipline review team, and not \n     final, definitive decisions relevant to the NDA/BLA.\n       8. If an application is to be presented to an advisory \n     committee, the final DRL on the ``reviewable unit'' may be \n     deferred pending completion of the advisory committee meeting \n     and internal review and consideration of the advice received.\n       9. The following performance goals will apply to review of \n     ``reviewable units'' of an NDA/BLA for Fast Track drugs and \n     biologics that are submitted in advance of the complete NDA/\n     BLA under this pilot program:\n       a. Discipline review team review of a ``reviewable unit'' \n     for a Fast Track drug or biologic will be completed and a DRL \n     issued within 6 months of the date of the submission for 30% \n     of ``reviewable units'' submitted in FY04;\n       b. Discipline review team review of a ``reviewable unit'' \n     for a Fast Track drug or biologic will be completed and a DRL \n     issued within 6 months of the date of the submission for 50% \n     of ``reviewable units'' submitted in FY05;\n       c. Discipline review team review of a ``reviewable unit'' \n     for a Fast Track drug or biologic will be completed and a DRL \n     issued within 6 months of the date of the submission for 70% \n     ``reviewable units'' submitted in FY06, and\n       d. Discipline review team review of a ``reviewable unit'' \n     for a Fast Track drug or biologic will be completed and a DRL \n     letter issued within 6 months of the date of the submission \n     for 90% of ``reviewable units'' submitted in FY07.\n       10. If the complete NDA/BLA is submitted to FDA while a 6-\n     month review clock for a ``reviewable unit'' is still open, \n     FDA will adhere to the timelines and performance goals for \n     both the ``reviewable unit'' and the complete NDA/BLA. For \n     example, if a ``reviewable unit'' is submitted in January and \n     the complete NDA/BLA is submitted in April, the review goal \n     for the ``reviewable unit'' will be July and the review goal \n     for the complete NDA/BLA will be October.\n       11. Any resubmission or amendment of a ``reviewable unit'' \n     submitted by the sponsor in response to an FDA discipline \n     review letter will not be subject to the review timelines and \n     performance goals proposed above. FDA review of such \n     resubmissions and amendments in advance of submission of the \n     complete NDA/BLA will occur only as resources allow.\n       12. This pilot program is limited to the initial submission \n     of an NDA/BLA and is not applicable to a resubmission in \n     response to an FDA complete response letter following the \n     complete review of an NDA/BLA.\n       13. Guidance: FDA will develop and issue a joint CDER/CBER \n     guidance on how it intends to implement this pilot program by \n     September 30, 2003. The guidance will describe the \n     principles, processes, and procedures that will be followed \n     during the pilot program. The guidance also will define what \n     subsections of a complete technical section would be \n     considered an acceptable ``reviewable unit'' for pre-\n     submission and review and how many individual ``reviewable \n     units'' from one or more technical sections of an NDA/BLA can \n     be pre-submitted and reviewed subject to separate review \n     clocks under this program at any given time. The pilot \n     program will be implemented in FY 2004, after the final \n     guidance is issued and will continue through FY 2007.\n\n B. Pilot 2--Frequent scientific feedback and interactions during drug \n                              development\n\n       1. This pilot applies to drugs and biologics that have been \n     designated to be Fast Track drugs or biologics pursuant to \n     section 112 of the FDA Modernization Act (21 U.S.C. 356), \n     that are intended to treat serious and/or life-threatening \n     diseases, and that have been the subject of an end-of-phase 1 \n     meeting. The pilot program is limited to one Fast Track \n     product in each CDER and CBER review division over the course \n     of the pilot program.\n       2. For drugs and biologics that meet these criteria, FDA \n     may enter into an agreement with the sponsor to initiate a \n     format program of frequent scientific feedback and \n     interactions regarding the drug development program. The \n     feedback and interactions may take the form of regular \n     meetings between the division and the sponsor at appropriate \n     points during the development process, written feedback from \n     the division following review of the sponsor's drug \n     development plan, written feedback from the division \n     following review of important new protocols, and written \n     feedback from the division following review of study \n     summaries or complete study reports submitted by the sponsor.\n       3. Decisions regarding what study reports would be reviewed \n     as summaries and what study reports would be reviewed as \n     complete study reports under this pilot program would be made \n     in advance, following discussions between the division and \n     the sponsor of the proposed drug development program. In \n     making these decisions, the review division will consider the \n     importance of the study to the drug development program, the \n     nature of the study, and the potential value of limited \n     (i.e., based on summaries) versus more thorough division \n     review (i.e., based on complete study reports).\n       4. Guidance: FDA will develop and issue a joint CDER/CBER \n     guidance on how it intends to implement this pilot program by \n     September 30, 2003. The guidance will describe the \n     principles, processes, and procedures that will be followed \n     during the pilot program. The pilot program will be \n     implemented in FY 2004, after the final guidance is issued \n     and will continue through FY 2007. The full (unredacted) \n     study report will be provided to the FDA Commissioner and a \n     version of the study report redacted to remove confidential \n     commercial information or other information exempt from \n     disclosure, will be made available to the public.\n\n                  C. Evaluation of the pilot programs\n\n       1. In FY 2004, FDA will contract with an outside expert \n     consultant(s) to evaluate both pilot programs.\n       2. The consultant(s) will develop an evaluation study \n     design that identifies key questions, data requirements, and \n     a data collection plan, and a conduct a comprehensive study \n     of the pilot programs to help assess the value, costs, and \n     impact of these programs to the drug development and review \n     process. A preliminary report will be generated by the \n     consultant by the end of FY06.\n\n[[Page S5198]]\n\n      viii. pre- and peri-nda/bla risk management plan activities\n\n       a. Submission and Review of pre-NDA/BLA meeting packages: A \n     pre-NDA/BLA meeting package may include a summary of relevant \n     safety information and industry questions/discussion points \n     regarding proposed risk management plans and discussion of \n     the need for any post-approval risk management studies. The \n     elements of the proposal may include:\n       1. assessment of clinical trial limitations and disease \n     epidemiology\n       2. assessment of risk management tools to be used to \n     address known and potential risks\n       3. suggestions for phase 4 epidemiology studies, if such \n     studies are warranted\n       4. proposals for targeted post-approval surveillance (this \n     would include attempts to quantify background rates of risks \n     of concern and thresholds for actions)\n       The pre-NDA/BLA meeting package will be reviewed and \n     discussed by the review divisions as well as the appropriate \n     safety group in CDER or CBER.\n       b. Pre-NDA/BLA meeting with industry: This meeting may \n     include a discussion of the preliminary risk management plans \n     and proposed observational studies, if warranted, as outlined \n     above. Participants in this meeting will include product \n     safety experts from the respective Center. The intent of \n     these discussions will be for FDA to get a better \n     understanding of the safety issues associated with the \n     particular drug/biologic and the proposed risk management \n     plans, and to provide industry with feedback on these \n     proposals so that they can be included in the NDA/BLA \n     submission. It is the intent of this proposal that such risk \n     management plans and the discussions around them would focus \n     on specific issues of concern, either based on already \n     identified safety issues or reasonable potential focused \n     issues of concern.\n       c. Review of NDA/BLA: The NDA/BLA submitted by industry may \n     include the proposed risk management tools and plans, and \n     protocols for observational studies, based on the discussions \n     that began with the pre-NDA/BLA meeting, as described above, \n     and may be amended as appropriate to further refine the \n     proposal. These amendments would not normally be considered \n     major amendments. Both the review division and the \n     appropriate safety group will be involved in the review of \n     the application and will try to communicate comments \n     regarding the risk management plan as early in the review \n     process as practicable, in the form of a discipline review \n     letter. Items to be included in the risk management plan to \n     assure FDA of the safety and efficiency of the drug or \n     biologic are to be addressed prior to approval of an \n     application. The risk management plan may contain additional \n     items that can be used to help refine the risks and actions \n     (e.g., background rates and observational studies) and these \n     items may be further defined and completed after approval in \n     accordance with time frames agreed upon at the time of \n     product approval.\n       d. Peri-Approval Submission of Observational Study Reports \n     and Periodic Safely Update Reports (PSURs): For NDA/BLA \n     applications, and supplements containing clinical data, \n     submitted on or after October 1, 2002, FDA may use user fees \n     to review an applicant's implementation of the risk \n     management plan for a period of up to two years post-approval \n     for most products and for a period of up to three years for \n     products that require risk management beyond standard \n     labeling (e.g., a black box or bolded warning, medication \n     guide, restricted distribution). This period is defined for \n     purposes of the user fee goals as the peri-approval period. \n     Issues that arise during implementation of the risk \n     management plan (e.g., whether the plan is effective) will be \n     reported to FDA either in the form of a PSUR or in a periodic \n     or annual report (21 CFR 314.80 and 314.81) (ICH Guidance \n     E2C, Clinical Safety Data Management: Periodic Safety Update \n     Reports for Marketed Drugs) and addressed during the peri-\n     approval period through discussions between the applicant and \n     FDA. PSURs may be submitted and reviewed semi-annually for \n     the first two or three years post approval to allow adequate \n     time for implementation of risk management plans.\n       For drugs approved under PDUFA III, FDA may use user fees \n     to independently evaluate produce utilization for drugs with \n     important safety concerns, using drug utilization databases, \n     for the first three years post approval. The purpose of such \n     utilization evaluations is to evaluate whether these products \n     are being used in a safe manner and to work pro-actively with \n     companies during the peri-approval period to accomplish \n     this. FDA will allocate $70,900,000 in user fees over 5 \n     years to the activities covered in this section. FDA will \n     track the specific amounts of user fees spent on these \n     activities and will include in its annual report to \n     Congress an accounting of this spending.\n       e. Guidance Document Development: By the end of Fiscal Year \n     04, CDER and CBER will jointly develop final guidance \n     documents that address good risk assessment, risk management, \n     and pharmacovigilance practices.\n\n\n ix. independent consultants for biotechnology clinical trial protocols\n\n                   A. Engagement of expert consultant\n\n       During the development period for a biotechnology product, \n     a sponsor may request that FDA engage an independent expert \n     consultant, selected by FDA, to participate in the Agency's \n     review of the protocol for the clinical studies that are \n     expected to serve as the primary basis for a claim.\n\n                             B. Conditions\n\n       1. The product must be a biotechnology product (for \n     example, DNA plasmid products, synthetic peptides of fewer \n     than 40 amino acids, monoclonal antibodies for in vivo use, \n     and recombinant DNA-derived products) that represents a \n     significant advance in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention \n     of a disease or condition, or have the potential to address \n     an unmet medical need;\n       2. The product may not have been the subject of a \n     previously granted request under this program;\n       3. The sponsor must submit a written request for the use of \n     an independent consultant, describing the reasons why the \n     consultant should be engaged (e.g., as a result of \n     preliminary discussions with the Agency the sponsor expects \n     substantial disagreement over the proposed protocol); and\n       4. The request must be designated as a ``Request for \n     Appointment of Expert Consultant'' and submitted in \n     conjunction with a formal meeting request (for example, \n     during the end-of-Phase II meeting or a Type A, meeting).\n\n                   C. Recommendations for consultants\n\n       The sponsor may submit a list of recommended consultants \n     for consideration by the Agency. The selected consultant will \n     either be a special government employee, or will be retained \n     by FDA under contract. The consultant's role will be advisory \n     to FDA and FDA will remain responsible for making scientific \n     and regulatory decisions regarding the clinical protocol in \n     question.\n\n                         D. Denial of requests\n\n       FDA will grant the request unless the Agency determines \n     that engagement of an expert consultant would not serve a \n     useful purpose (for example it is clearly premature). FDA \n     will engage the services of an independent consultant, of \n     FDA's choosing, as soon as practicable. If the Agency denies \n     the request, it will provide a written rationale to the \n     requester within 14 days of receipt.\n\n                       E. Performance goal change\n\n       Due to the time required to select and screen the \n     consultant for potential conflicts of interest and to allow \n     the consultant sufficient time to review the scientific \n     issues involved, the performance goals for scheduling the \n     formal meeting (see section III) may be extended for an \n     additional sixty (60) days.\n\n                             F. Evaluation\n\n       During FY 2006, FDA will conduct a study to evaluate the \n     costs and benefits of this program for both sponsors and the \n     Agency.\n\n\n               x. first cycle review performance proposal\n\n     A. Notification of issues identified during the filing review\n\n       1. Performance Goal: For original NDA/BLA applications and \n     efficacy supplements, FDA will report substantive \n     deficiencies identified in the initial filing review to the \n     sponsor by letter, telephone conference, facsimile, secure e-\n     mail, or other expedient means.\n       2. The timeline for such communication will be within 14 \n     calendar days after the 60 day filing date.\n       3. If no deficiencies were noted, FDA will so notify the \n     sponsor.\n       4. FDA's filing review represents a preliminary review of \n     the application and is not indicative of deficiencies that \n     may be identified later in the review cycle.\n       5. FDA will provide the sponsor a notification of \n     deficiencies prior to the goal date for 50% of applications \n     in FY 2003, 70% in FY 2004, and 90% in FY 2005, FY 2006, and \n     FY 2007.\n\n             B. Good review management principles guidance\n\n       FDA will develop a joint CDER-CBER guidance on Good Review \n     Management Principles (GRMPs), and publish final guidance by \n     the end of FY 2003. The Good Review Management Principles \n     will address, among other elements, the following:\n       1. The filing review process, including communication of \n     issues identified during the filing review that may affect \n     approval of the application.\n       2. Ongoing communication with the sponsor during the review \n     process (in accordance with 21 CFR 314.102(a)), including \n     emphasis on early communication of easily correctable \n     deficiencies (21 CFR 314.102(b)).\n       3. Appropriate use of Information Request and Discipline \n     Review letters, as well as other informal methods of \n     communication (phone, tax, e-mail).\n       4. Anticipating/planning for a potential Advisory Committee \n     meeting.\n       5. Completing the primary reviews--allowing time for \n     secondary and tertiary reviews prior to the action goal date.\n       6. Labeling feedback--planning to provide labeling comments \n     and scheduling time for teleconferences with the sponsor in \n     advance of the action goal date.\n\n                              C. Training\n\n       FDA will develop and implement a program for training all \n     review personnel, including current employees as well as \n     future new hires, on the good review management principles.\n\n                             D. Evaluation\n\n       FDA will retain an independent expert consultant to \n     undertake a study to evaluate issues associated with the \n     conduct of first cycle reviews.\n       1. The study will be designed to assess current performance \n     and changes that occur\n\n[[Page S5199]]\n\n     after the guidance on GRMPs is published. The study will \n     include collection of various types of tracking data \n     regarding actions that occur during the first cycle review, \n     both from an FDA and industry perspective (e.g., IR letters, \n     DR letters, draft labeling comments from FDA to the sponsor, \n     sponsor response to FDA requests for information).\n       2. The study will also include an assessment of the first \n     cycle review history of all NDAs for NMEs and all BLAs during \n     PDUFA III. This assessment will include a more detailed \n     evaluation of the events that occurred during the review \n     process with a focus on identifying best practices by FDA and \n     industry that facilitated the review process.\n       3. The study will also include an assessment of the \n     effectiveness of the training program implemented by FDA.\n       4. FDA will develop a statement of work for the study and \n     will provide the public an opportunity to review and comment \n     on the statement of work before the study is implemented. The \n     consultant will prepare annual reports of the findings of the \n     study and a final study report at the end of the 5-year study \n     period. The full (un-redacted) study reports will be provided \n     to the FDA Commissioner and a version of the study reports \n     redacted to remove confidential commercial information or \n     other information exempt from disclosure, will be made \n     available to the public.\n       5. Development and implementation of the study of first \n     cycle review performance will be a component of the \n     Performance Management Plan conducted out of the Office of \n     the Commissioner (see section X).\n       6. Administrative oversight of the study will rest in the \n     Office of the Commissioner. The Office of the Commissioner \n     will convene a joint CDER/CBER review panel on a quarterly \n     basis as a mechanism for ongoing assessment of the \n     application of Good Review Management Principles to actions \n     taken on original NDA/BLA applications.\n\n\n                xi. improving fda performance management\n\n                          A. Performance fund\n\n       The Commissioner will use at least $7 million over five \n     years of PDUFA III funds for initiatives targeted to improve \n     the drug review process.\n       1. Funds would be made available by the Commissioner to the \n     Centers based both on identified areas of greatest need for \n     process improvements as well as on achievement of previously \n     identified objectives.\n       2. Funds also could be used by the FDA Commissioner to \n     diagnose why objectives are not being met, or to examine \n     areas of concern.\n       3. The studies conducted under this initiative would be \n     intended to foster:\n       a. Development of programs to improve access to internal \n     and external expertise\n       b. Reviewer development programs, particularly as they \n     relate to drug review processes,\n       c. Advancing science and use of information management \n     tools\n       d. Improving both inter- and intra-Center consistency, \n     efficiency, and effectiveness\n       e. Improved reporting of management objectives\n       f. Increased accountability for use of user fee revenues\n       g. Focused investments on improvements in the process of \n     drug review\n       h. Improved communication between the FDA and industry\n       4. In deciding how to spend these funds, the Commissioner \n     would take into consideration how to achieve greater \n     harmonization of capabilities between CDER and CBER.\n\n                        B. First two initiatives\n\n       Two specific initiatives will begin early in PDUFA III and \n     supported from performance management initiative funds (1) \n     evaluation of first cycle review performance, and (2) process \n     review and analysis within the two centers.\n\n                   1. First Cycle Review Performance\n\n       See the First Cycle Review Performance (See section X. for \n     details on this proposed study).\n\n                     2. Process Review and Analysis\n\n       a. In FY 2003, FDA will contract with an outside consultant \n     to conduct a comprehensive process review and analysis within \n     CDER and CBER. This review will involve a thorough analysis \n     of information utilization, review management, and activity \n     cost.\n       b. The review is expected to take from 18-24 months, \n     although its duration will depend on the type and amount of \n     complexity of the issues uncovered during the review.\n       c. The outcome of this review will be a thorough \n     documentation of the process, a re-map of the process \n     indicating where efficiencies can be gained, activity-based \n     project accounting, optimal use of review tools, and a \n     suggested path for implementing the recommendations.\n       d. FDA would anticipate delivery of a report of the \n     consultant's findings and recommendations in FY 2004-2005. \n     The agency would consider these recommendations in planning \n     any redesign or process reengineering to enhance \n     performance.\n\n                           3. Further Studies\n\n       In subsequent years of PDUFA III, FDA may develop other \n     study plans that will focus on further analysis of program \n     design, performance features and costs, to identify potential \n     avenues for further enhancement. Future studies would be \n     likely to include a comprehensive re-analysis of program \n     costs following the implementation of new PDUFA III review \n     initiatives and the adoption of any process changes following \n     the recommendations of the year 1 and 2 studies.\n\n\n          xii. electronic applications and submissions--goals\n\n       a. The Agency will centralize the accountability and \n     funding for all PDUFA Information Technology initiatives/\n     activities for CBER, CDER, ORA and OC under the leadership of \n     the FDA CIO. The July 2001 HHS IT 5-year plan states that \n     infrastructure consolidation across the department should be \n     achieved, including standardization. The Agency CIO will be \n     responsible for ensuring that all PDUFA III IT infrastructure \n     and IT investments support the Agency's common IT goals, fit \n     into a common computing environment, and follow good IT \n     management practices.\n       b. The Agency CIO will chair quarterly briefings on PDUFA \n     IT issues to periodically review and evaluate the progress of \n     IT initiatives against project milestones, discuss \n     alternatives when projects are not progressing, and review \n     proposals for new initiatives. On an annual basis, an \n     assessment will be conducted of progress against PDUFA III IT \n     goals and, established program milestones, including \n     appropriate changes to plans. A documented summary of the \n     assessment will be drafted and forwarded to the Commissioner. \n     A version of the study report redacted to remove confidential \n     commercial or security information, or other information \n     exempt from disclosure, will be made available to the public. \n     The project milestones, assessment and changes will be part \n     of the annual PDUFA III IT reports.\n       c. FDA will implement a common solution in CBER, CDER, ORA \n     and OC for the secure exchange of content including secure e-\n     mail, electronic signatures, and secure submission of, and \n     access to application components.\n       d. FDA will deliver a single point of entry for the receipt \n     and processing of all electronic submissions in a highly \n     secure environment. This will support CBER, CDER, OC and ORA. \n     The system should automate the current electronic submission \n     processes such as checking the content of electronic \n     submissions for completeness and electronically acknowledging \n     submissions.\n       e. FDA will provide a specification format for the \n     electronic submission of the Common Technical Document (e-\n     CTD), and provide an electronic review system for this new \n     format that will be used by CBER, CDER and ORA reviewers. \n     Implementation should include training to ensure successful \n     deployment. This project will serve as the foundation for \n     automation of other types of electronic submissions. The \n     review software will be made available to the public.\n       f. Within the first 12 months, FDA will conduct an \n     objective analysis and develop a plan for consolidation of \n     PDUFA III IT infrastructure and desktop management services \n     activities that will assess and prioritize the consolidation \n     possibilities among CBER, CDER, ORA and OC to achieve \n     technical efficiencies, target potential savings and realize \n     cost efficiencies. Based upon the results of this analysis, \n     to the extent appropriate, establish common IT infrastructure \n     and architecture components according to specific milestones \n     and dates. A documented summary of the analysis will be \n     forwarded to the Commissioner. A version of the study report \n     redacted to remove confidential commercial or security \n     information, or other information exempt from disclosure, \n     will be made available to the public.\n       g. FDA will implement Capability Maturity Model (CMM) in \n     CBER, CDER, ORA and OC for PDUFA IT infrastructure and \n     investments, and include other industry best practices to \n     ensure that PDUFA III IT products and projects are of high \n     quality and produced with optimal efficiency and cost \n     effectiveness. This includes development of project plans and \n     schedules, goals, estimates of required resources, issues and \n     risks/mitigation plans for each PDUFA III IT initiative.\n       h. Where common business needs exist, CBER, CDER, ORA and \n     OC will use the same software applications, such as eCTD \n     software, and COTS solutions.\n       i. Within six months of authorization, a PDUFA III IT 5-\n     year plan will be developed. Progress will be measured \n     against the milestones described in the plan.\n\n\n                      XIII. ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES\n\n                  A. Simplification of action letters\n\n       To simplify regulatory procedures, CBER and CDER intend to \n     amend their regulations and processes to provide for the \n     issuance of either an ``approval'' (AP) or a ``complete \n     response'' (CR) action letter at the completion of a review \n     cycle for a marketing application.\n\n   B. Timing of sponsor notification of deficiencies in applications\n\n       To help expedite the development of drug and biologic \n     products, CBER and CDER intend to submit deficiencies to \n     sponsors in the form of an ``information request'' (IR) \n     letter when each discipline has finished its initial review \n     of its section of the pending application.\n\n\n               XIV. DEFINITIONS AND EXPLANATION OF TERMS\n\n       A. The term ``review and act on'' is understood to mean the \n     issuance of a complete action letter after the complete \n     review of filed complete application. The action letter, if \n     it is not an approval, will set forth in detail the specific \n     deficiencies and, where appropriate, the actions necessary to \n     place the application in condition for approval.\n       B. A major amendment to an original application, efficacy \n     supplement, or resubmission of any of these applications, \n     submitted\n\n[[Page S5200]]\n\n     within three months of the goal date, extends the goal date \n     by three months. A major amendment to a manufacturing \n     supplement submitted within two months of the goal date \n     extends the goal date by two months.\n       C. A. resubmitted original application is a complete \n     response to an action letter addressing all identified \n     deficiencies.\n       D. Class 1 resubmitted applications are applications \n     resubmitted after a complete response letter (or a not \n     approvable or approvable letter) that include the following \n     items only (or combinations of these items):\n       1. Final printed labeling\n       2. Draft labeling\n       3. Safety updates submitted in the same format, including \n     tabulations, as the original safety submission with new data \n     and changes highlighted (except when large amounts of new \n     information including important new adverse experiences not \n     previously reported with the product are presented in the \n     resubmission)\n       4. Stability updates to support provisional or final dating \n     periods\n       5. Commitments to perform Phase 4 studies, including \n     proposals for such studies\n       6. Assay validation data\n       7. Final release testing on the last 1-2 lots used to \n     support approval\n       8. A minor reanalysis of data previously submitted to the \n     application (determined by the agency as fitting the Class 1 \n     category)\n       9. Other minor clarifying information (determined by the \n     Agency as fitting the Class 1 category)\n       10. Other specific items may be added later as the Agency \n     gains experience with the scheme and will be communicated via \n     guidance documents to industry.\n       E. Class 2 resubmissions are resubmissions that include any \n     other items, including any item that would require \n     presentation to an advisory committee.\n       F. A Type A Meeting is a meeting which is necessary for an \n     otherwise stalled drug development program to proceed (a \n     ``critical path'' meeting).\n       G. A Type B Meeting is a 1) pre-IND, 2) end of Phase 1 (for \n     Subpart E or Subpart H or similar products) or end of Phase \n     2/pre-Phase 3, or 3) a pre-NDA/BLA meeting. Each requestor \n     should usually only request 1 each of these Type B meetings \n     for each potential application (NDA/BLA) (or combination of \n     closely related products, i.e., same active ingredient but \n     different dosage forms being developed concurrently).\n       H. A Type C Meeting is any other type of meeting.\n       I. The performance goals and procedures also apply to \n     original applications and supplements for human drugs \n     initially marketed on an over-the-counter (OTC) basis through \n     an NDA or switched from prescription to OTC status through an \n     NDA or supplement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/06/senate-section/article/S5200-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 23, 2001 \nin Thibodaux, LA. A black woman was shot in the face with a paintball \ngun outside her home. Two teens were arrested and charged for \naggravated battery in what police called a hate crime.

Mr. President, I rise today in commemoration of the 58th \nanniversary of the largest air, land, and sea invasion ever undertaken: \nD-Day.\n  This monumental task involved over 150,000 American, British, \nCanadian, Free French, and Polish troops. Each of these individuals \ntook great risks, sacrificing themselves for the sake of freedom and \ndemocracy.\n  For many of the Americans storming the Utah and Omaha beach, D-Day \noffered their first glimpse of the enemy and death. Although, there had \nbeen extensive training and planning of the invasion, this was a \nchallenge unlike any other. Facing incredible odds, natural obstacles \nand man-made fortifications, the allied troops secured a beachhead in \nNazi occupied Europe from which to begin a western frontal attack. D-\nDay was a colossal moment where freedom and democracy regained a \nfoothold in Europe at the cost of many brave individuals.\n  There are many heroes of D-Day; many we honored and remembered just a \nlittle over a week ago during Memorial Day weekend and others who are \npassing each day. I know it is my wish, as it must be for the other \nmembers of this body, that the valor and sacrifices of our Nation's \nfighting men and women are not forgotten. Each generation deserves to \nunderstand the important events that shaped the world we live in. I'm \nhappy to see construction underway with the World War II monument on \nthe National Mall. This will serve as another reminder to those of \ntoday and tomorrow of those who came before us and made, ``For God and \nCountry,'' the ultimate sacrifice.\n  On the anniversary of possibly the most difficult military invasion, \nI tip my hat in solemn remembrance to those who fought so bravely to \nprotect freedom and liberty here and abroad. I also ask that all \nAmericans take a moment to remember their sacrifices, which allowed the \nworld to enjoy a greater freedom.\n  In conclusion, it is evident that following the savage attacks of \nSeptember 11, new sacrifices lay ahead of us. As America rises to meet \nthese challenges we can take solace in the model of courage and \ndetermination of those who gave their lives on the beaches of Normandy \nto protect our freedom.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, on this day 58 years ago, Allied forces \nbegan the D-Day invasion of Normandy, France. Given the importance of \nthis event to our nation's history, we should take a moment today to \nremember and to honor those who sacrificed their lives on the beaches \nof France in the fight against the forces of fascism.\n  D-Day was the largest air, land, and sea invasion in history. More \nthan 5,000 ships, 10,000 airplanes, and 150,000 troops participated in \nthe invasion of June 6, 1944. Soldiers from America, Britain, Canada, \nand France worked in concert to storm the beaches of Normandy, overcome \nentrenched German defensive positions, and establish a beachhead from \nwhich France and all of Europe was liberated. The success of the D-Day \ninvasion not only turned the tide of the war, but changed the course of \nhistory as well.\n  Exact casualties from the invasion have proven difficult to \ncalculate. But upwards of 10,000 men were killed or wounded on the five \nbeaches whose code names we have all come to know so well: Utah, Omaha, \nGold, Juno, and Sword.\n  Today, we pause to honor all of those who participated in the \nNormandy invasion, including those who were killed, those who have died \nin the six decades since the invasion, and those who survive today to \ntell of their comrades' bravery and sacrifices. We owe a debt to each \nof these men that can never be fully repaid. Yet, I believe one of the \nbest ways for us to pay our respect to these heroes, is to honor our \ncommitments to our veterans and to those serving in the active duty and \nreserve.\n  In an attempt to thank the U.S. servicemembers who participated in \nthe liberation of France, the French government is offering \ncertificates to U.S. veterans who served in France, its territorial \nwaters, or airspace between June 6, 1944 and May 8, 1945. I am working \nto make my constituents aware of these Thank-You-America Certificates \nso that all eligible South Dakota veterans get the recognition for \ntheir service that they deserve.\n  I know that my colleagues will join with me in commemorating the 58th \nanniversary of the D-Day invasion and honoring the veterans who \nanswered our Nation's call to service on that fateful day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/06/senate-section/article/S5200-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADDITIONAL COSPONSOR TO S.

Mr. President, an op-ed column in Tuesday's New York Times \nhighlighted how fast, easy and unintrusive background checks for gun \npurchases can be if performed properly. Yet, this is not the story we \nare told by groups that oppose closing the gun show \nloophole. According to the National Rifle Association, background \nchecks often take days to complete. But according to the Department of \nJustice, 95 percent of background checks are completed within two \nhours, and according to the Violence Policy Center, a vast majority of \nbackground checks are completed within a few minutes.\n  The New York Times op-ed also highlighted why it is so important that \nwe conduct these checks at gun shows. The author, Nicholas Kristof, \ncited the availability of .50 caliber semiautomatic rifles and assault \nrifles which sellers claim are powerful enough to penetrate bulletproof \nglass. It is common sense to make sure that criminals and other \nrestricted buyers are prohibited from buying such lethal weapons. While \nany legitimate purchaser can buy such weapons from a federally licensed \ndealer after an instant background check, they can also be purchased \nfrom an unlicensed dealer at any gun show without a background check.\n  According to Bureau of Justice Statistics, between 1994 and 1999, \nover 22 million background checks were completed and more than 536,000 \nfelons, fugitives and other prohibited persons were prevented from \nillegally purchasing firearms. But convicted criminals and suspected \nterrorists have reportedly used the gun show loophole to purchase \nfirearms and smuggle them out of the United States. For example, in \nFlorida, a man accused of having ties to the Irish Republican Army \ntestified that he purchased thousands of dollars worth of machine guns, \nrifles and high-powered ammunition at gun shows and proceeded to \nsmuggle them to Ireland. A 1999 study by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco \nand Firearms found 314 cases of fraud at gun shows, involving 54,000 \nguns. To help eliminate this type of activity, I cosponsored Senator \nReed's Gun Show Background Check bill to close the gun show loop hole. \nThis bill simply applies existing law governing background checks to \npersons buying guns at gun shows. I cosponsored that bill because I \nbelieve it would prevent criminals from getting guns.\n  The gun show loophole is an even more serious problem if .50 caliber \nsemiautomatic rifles are available for sale. Gun dealers recognize that \nthese weapons represent a very dangerous amount of firepower. The .50 \ncaliber rifle has apparently been promoted as a weapon able to ``wreck \nseveral million dollars worth of jet aircraft with one or two dollars \nworth of cartridge.'' These weapons are among the most powerful, and \nleast regulated, firearms legally available. According to one seller's \nWeb site, ``Never mind that the gun haters don't want you to have'em. \nForget about the lily-livered whiners in Congress. Exercise your rights \nbefore it's too late.'' Even some dealers know that .50 caliber weapons \nare too powerful and too accessible to be ignored any longer. Tighter \nregulations are needed. That is why I cosponsored Senator Feinstein's \nMilitary Sniper Weapon Regulation Act. This bill would strengthen the \nregulation of long-range .50 caliber sniper weapons.\n  I believe both pieces of legislation are common sense steps to ensure \nthat guns do not get into the hands of criminals and other prohibited \nbuyers. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting them and other \npieces of common sense gun safety legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/06/senate-section/article/S5201-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO JOLENE FRANKEN\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, next week will mark a new beginning \nfor the Iowa State Education Association when Jolene Franken steps down \nas President. I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Jolene \nfor her many accomplishments as a teacher and the outstanding job she \nhas done as the head of the organization representing Iowa teachers. \nShe has done Iowa proud.\n  We are all familiar with the expression that teachers touch the \nfuture. Whenever I see these words I think of teachers like Jolene \nFranken, a woman who is passionate about education and our children. As \nan elementary teacher for thirty years in Iowa, she has touched the \nlives of thousands of children.\n  Jolene Franken earned her Bachelor of Science degree at Greenville \nCollege in Greenville, IL and Masters Degree from Northwest Missouri \nState University. Jolene exemplifies life long learning and has \nparticipated in additional professional development activities at the \nUniversity of Northern Iowa and University of Iowa.\n  Most of Jolene's career has been spent teaching first grade, but she \nis always open to new challenges. Most recently, she taught \nacademically talented elementary students in the Denison Community \nSchool District's Extended Learning Program. Jolene has also been \nactive in the creative problem solving competition, ``Destination \nImagination,'' and has served as coach of the Iowa team for five years. \nHer Destination Imagination teams have participated in two World \nChampionships. She has also been a driving force behind the Iowa State \nAcademic Decathlon since its inception.\n  Jolene has also been an active member of the Iowa State Education \nAssociation and National Education Association throughout her career \nwhere she has held numerous offices. As President of ISEA for the past \nfour years, she has been a tireless advocate for children and public \neducation. She has fought to increase awareness of the teacher shortage \nin Iowa, fought to increase teachers' salaries and has pushed for \nquality teacher mentor programs.\n  As a first grade teacher, Jolene understands the importance of \nreading and has been an avid participant in NEA's Read Across America \nDay. Every year on Dr. Seuss' birthday, Jolene dons a ``Cat in the \nHat'' costume to visit Iowa schools and read to the children.\n  I commend and thank Jolene for her hard work to improve Iowa schools \nand educate Iowa's youth. Jolene's community, her State and her country \nare better off because of her years as an educator and leader for the \nfutures of all of our children. While I have highlighted some of her \naccomplishments and interests over the years, the list is so much \nlonger, and I speak from the heart when I say she will be missed. I \nknow she will continue to be active on behalf of Iowa's children\n  I also know that ISEA will be in good hands as John Hieronymus takes \nover as President. John is a math teacher from Iowa City and has served \nas vice-president of the organization for the past several years. \nJolene Franken is a tough act to follow, but I know he is more than \nprepared to take on the challenging mission of leading ISEA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/06/senate-section/article/S5201-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5201-S5202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMMEMORATING THE 58TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NORMANDY D-DAY INVASION ON \n                              JUNE 6, 1944\n\n Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate an \nevent that took place 58 years ago today. Of course, I am speaking \nabout the invasion of Normandy on D-Day, June 6, 1944. The magnitude of \nthe event, its scope and complexity, even now, instills a sense of awe \nin all of us. It remains the largest air, land, and sea invasion ever \nundertaken. The invasion force of over 150,000 soldiers was supported \nby over 5,000 ships and 10,000 airplanes. These troops were from the \nUnited States, Britain, and Canada and included Free French and Polish \nforces under the overall command of General Dwight David Eisenhower.\n  The invasion sites, from west to east, were designated as Utah, \nOmaha, Sword, Juno, and Gold. The British Second Army was responsible \nfor Sword, Juno, and Gold, while the U.S. First Army was responsible \nfor Utah and Omaha. The U.S. 1st and 29th Infantry Divisions landed at \nOmaha Beach, the U.S. 4th Infantry Division came ashore on Utah. The \n82nd and 101st Airborne Division were dropped behind the beaches. I \nmight add that some of the Airborne troops arrived by glider, an \noperation in which I was a participant.\n  Although the invasion was ultimately successful, it was a very hard\n\n[[Page S5202]]\n\nfought battle with many challenges. However, the individual initiative \nand courage of common soldiers saved the day. Many were teenagers or \njust in their twenties; most were frightened and on foreign soil under \nfire for the first time. Actions of courage and bravery were \neverywhere.\n  Now it seems so long ago, but I vividly remember this event. I \nremember these gallant men and their heroic actions. I remember those \nthat paid the ultimate price for our freedom. During this military \noperation I landed at Normandy with the Glider Infantry of the 82nd \nAirborne Division, First U.S. Army. I am proud to have been a part of \nthat endeavor and bear witness to the heroism and gallantry \ndemonstrated that day.\n  One of the most challenging and rewarding experiences of my life has \nbeen to serve my Nation as an Officer in the U.S. Army. Although it has \nbeen many years since I last wore an Army uniform, my love for the \nservice and pride in its heritage remain as strong today as it was when \nI was commissioned a Second Lieutenant. As I think about the sacrifice \nbeing made today by a new generation, I continue to remember the great \neffort and sacrifice made by so many young lives at Normandy. They paid \nthe ultimate price for the freedoms we continue to enjoy today.\n  With each passing year, the number of Normandy Invasion veterans \ngrows smaller. This is the final opportunity that I will have, as a \nMember of the Senate, to mark the anniversary of this occasion. I call \nupon my Senate colleagues and all Americans to never forget what \nhappened on those French beaches 58 years ago. I encourage all \nAmericans to remember the courageous men who fought and those who died \nto defend our liberties.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/06/senate-section/article/S5202-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nTO COMMEMORATE THE DEDICATION AND UNVEILING OF THE DETROIT ARSENAL TANK \n                        PLANT HISTORICAL MARKER\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I rise today to call my colleagues' \nattention to a significant event taking place in my home state of \nMichigan. On June 6, 2002 in the City of Warren, elected officials, \nbusiness and community leaders, and members and staff of the Tank-\nAutomotive and Armaments Command, will join with the Warren Historical \nCommission and the Michigan Historical Commission to dedicate and \nunveil a Historical Marker at the Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant site. Also \njoining them will be veterans and former workers of the Tank Plant who \nwell remember the contributions of this facility to the American war \neffort. Together, they will reflect back over 60 years ago, when on 113 \nacres of farmland in what was then Warren Township, the Detroit Tank \nArsenal emerged as the nation's largest defense plant. And they will \nnote that the Tank Arsenal marked the beginning of a legacy of how \ngovernment and business can unite for the common purpose of equipping \nour military and advancing our defense capability.\n  The Detroit Tank Arsenal success story began in 1940 when the U.S. \nArmy contracted with the Chrysler Corporation to create a separate \narmored force of ground vehicles. Albert Kahn was called upon to design \nthe mammoth structure needed to mass produce the Army's tanks and when \nit was completed it was the largest building of its type in all the \nworld. The first prototype rolled off the assembly line on Good Friday, \nApril 11, 1941. By early December 1941, the plant had shipped its 500th \ntank. Production continued to increase to a total of five assembly \nlines, and in December 1942, the plant set an all-time monthly \nproduction record by delivering 907 Sherman tanks.\n  President Roosevelt visited the Detroit Tank Arsenal in 1942 as part \nof his tour of the nation's defense facilities. He made the plant his \nfirst stop, touring the operations and watching the tanks run along the \narsenal's test tracks. After returning to Washington, the president \ncalled the Detroit Tank Arsenal ``an amazing demonstration of what can \nbe done by the right organization, spirit and planning.'' FDR further \nproclaimed the Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant in Warren ``The Arsenal of \nDemocracy.''\n  During World War II the Detroit Arsenal lived up to its motto \n``Enough and On Time'' by delivering more than 22,234 tanks such as the \nSherman. Production continued through the Korean and Vietnam Wars, \nthroughout the Cold War, and right into Desert Storm. By 1996, however, \nall tank manufacturing ceased at this facility. But the Tank-Automotive \nCenter that was created through the Arsenal in 1942 has evolved into \nthe Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command which is housed close to the \noriginal plant site. I am sure that my Senate colleagues join me in \npaying tribute to the great history of the Detroit Arsenal Tank Plant \nand in celebrating the future of progress that it opened to us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/06/senate-section/article/S5202-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            COMMUNITY HEROS\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, today I salute a community \nleader in my home State of Oregon. Today, I want to recognize the \nefforts of Susan Abravanel, Education Coordinator at SOLV, a non-profit \norganization in Oregon, in advocating for service-learning, one of the \nmost exciting educational initiatives taking hold in our nation today.\n  Service-learning gives students the opportunity to learn through \ncommunity service, but it is important to note that it is much more \nthan just community service, Mr. President--it is a method of classroom \ninstruction that engages a student's intellect through hands-on work \noutside the classroom that benefits the community at large. Research \nshows that students participating in service-learning make gains on \nachievement tests, complete their homework more often, and increase \ntheir grade point averages.\n  In addition to producing academic gains, service-learning is also \nassociated with both increased attendance and reduced dropout rates. It \nis clear to educators across the country that service-learning helps \nstudents feel more connected to their own education while strengthening \ntheir connection to their community as well. It is for all of these \nreasons that Susan Abravanel is working so hard to advocate for \nservice-learning in classrooms in Oregon and across the nation.\n  Ms. Abravanel is working closely with my office and with education \nleaders in Oregon to ensure that my home state remains a national \nleader in service-learning. Just two months ago, I introduced a bill \nwith my colleague, Senator Edwards, to strengthen our nation's \ncommitment to service-learning. I feel confident that this bill will \nsoon become law and that with Ms. Abravanel's continued efforts both \nhere in Washington, D.C. and at home in Oregon, students will continue \nto benefit from an education tied to civic engagement.\n  Ms. Abravanel exemplifies the type of engaged citizen our schools \nmust endeavor to produce, and her persistence will ensure that future \ngenerations of Americans will give back to their communities just as \nshe has. I would also like to note that Susan isn't just concerned \nabout education--her interests and efforts in Portland's Jewish \ncommunity are well known and highly appreciated--she is the new \nPresident of the Oregon chapter of the American Jewish Committee. I \nlook forward to working with Susan in her new role at the AJC and thank \nher for her continuing devotion to service-learning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/06/senate-section/article/S5202-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5202-S5203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE DEATH OF LEW R. WASSERMAN\n\n Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nmy dear friend and a true Hollywood legend: Lew Wasserman, a man who \nstood as a giant among giants. On Monday, June 3rd, Lew passed away at \nhis home from complications of a stroke.\n  My heart goes out to his wife Edie, daughter Lynne Kay Wasserman, his \ngrandson Casey and granddaughter Carol Leif, and to members of his \nextended family.\n  Lew was a great pioneer in the entertainment industry. He began his \ncareer in show business while in high school, working as an usher at \nthe Palace Theater in Cleveland.\n  Together Lew and Dr. Jules Stein built the world's largest talent \nagency representing such legends as Bette Davis, James Stewart, Alfred \nHitchcock, Tommy Dorsey, Kay Kyser, and Errol Flynn to name a few.\n  He also built a conglomerate of motion picture and television \ncompanies that produced the memorable hit movies ``American Graffiti'', \n``ET--the\n\n[[Page S5203]]\n\nExtra Terrestrial'' and ``Schindler's List.''\n  Without question Lew Wasserman was one of the most powerful and \ninfluential people in the entertainment industry, and his presence and \nleadership will be truly missed.\n  I am certain that his memory and good works will live on and continue \nto touch and improve the lives of people everywhere.\n  To list Lew's accomplishments does not come near to his contributions \nto our great nation.\n  Although Lew was unable to afford college, he was inspired to donate \nmillions of dollars for undergraduate scholarships at UCLA. Indeed, few \npeople have been as big-hearted and giving as Lew and his wife Edie.\n  Together they have given millions of dollars to a myriad of \nphilanthropic causes including the Motion Picture & Television Hospital \nin Woodland Hills.\n  Lew was instrumental in building the Dorothy Chandler Music Center in \nLos Angeles and served as a trustee of the John F. Kennedy Center for \nthe Performing Arts and the California Institute of Technology.\n  I know that the Wasserman family will continue the legacy of \nphilanthropic giving.\n  Lew also was very active in the foundation, Research to Prevent \nBlindness for which he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, \nthe country's highest civilian honor, by former President Clinton.\n  Throughout his distinguished career, Lew was often called upon by \nimportant leaders in our country including former Presidents Clinton, \nReagan, Carter and Lyndon B. Johnson, who wanted him as his Secretary \nof Commerce.\n  Despite his retirement, Lew was a man of tireless energy. He was an \navid and effective mediator during the labor tensions last year, when \nmajor studios were negotiating with writers and actors, Lew privately \nadvised both sides to compromise, avoiding a strike that could have \npotentially paralyzed the economy of California.\n  Simply put Lew Wasserman was a great American. His legacy is one of \ninspiring leadership and extraordinary accomplishment.\n  I am proud to say Lew was a loyal and good friend. Lew set a high \nstandard and his passing has left an enormous void to fill.\n  I know the next few weeks and months will be difficult for Edie and \nthe rest of the Wasserman family. But as they grieve, I hope they find \ncomfort in knowing what a wonderful contribution Lew made to the world \naround him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/06/senate-section/article/S5203-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HOUSTON DIGITAL BROADCAST\n\n Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate \nthe city of Houston on its recent designation as a ``Digital Television \nZone.'' Viewers in Houston are fortunate to be served by local \ntelevision stations that are broadcasting in digital. These stations \nare: KPRC, the NBC affiliate; KHOU, the CBS affiliate; KRIV, the local \nFOX station; KTRK, the local ABC owned and operated station; KTXH, a \nFOX owned UPN affiliate; and KUHT, the local PBS station.\n  I would like to especially note KPRC, a Post-Newsweek owned NBC \naffiliate, where I had the privilege to work in a former life as a \njournalist.\n  As the broadcast industry undertakes its transition to digital \ntelevision, I am proud to say all these local Houston stations are \nalready fully on the air in digital. For those not familiar with \ndigital television, it is the next step in the evolution of television. \nJust as other communication mediums are moving from an analog to a \ndigital format, television is too.\n  This year, coverage of the Olympics' opening ceremonies and the NCAA \nMen's Basketball Championship was broadcast in High-definition digital \ntelevision. Today, Houston viewers can watch popular programs like \n``Drew Carey,'' ``NYPD Blue,'' and ``the Tonight Show'' in High \nDefinition TV. Programming like this will propel the transition forward \nand encourage consumers to invest in digital technology--like their \nlocal broadcasters have done already.\n  In January, as one of only three cities in the country with all \naffiliates on the air in digital, Houston earned the distinction of \nbeing designated a ``Digital TV Zone.'' Houston broadcasters pooled \ntheir resources over the past year to educate Houston consumers about \ndigital TV technology and its benefits. The local stations cooperated \nwith electronics manufacturers and retailers to post digital sets in \nhigh traffic areas throughout the city.\n  Houston broadcasters are doing their part to launch the digital \ntelevision future. As with other technological advances, there will be \nchallenges before consumers can fully benefit from everything digital \nTV offers. There are issues about making digital television sets \ncapable of communicating with digital VCRs and DVD players. There are \nquestions about the availability of digital tuners in new TV sets. \nImportantly, American consumers will need to embrace digital \ntelevision.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nan amendment with Senator Wyden to preserve a truly invaluable search \nand rescue capability in the Pacific Northwest.\n  On May 30, all eyes in Oregon and across the Nation watched as brave \nOregonians put themselves in harms way to rescue climbers on Mt. Hood. \nThe rescuers included members of the Oregon National Guard, the \nPortland Mountain Rescue, and the Air Force Reserve 939th Air Rescue \nWing, whose members have been lauded for scores of rescues on Mt. Hood \nand the Oregon Coast, not to mention rescues in our neighboring state \nof Washington.\n  Last week, nine climbers were swept into a 20-foot deep crevasse on \nMt. Hood. Tragically three of the climbers did not survive, but the \nstills of the rescuers ensured that others would survive. The rescue \nlast week highlighted the skills of the Rescue Wing and the importance \nOregonians placed on the Wing's capabilities in the region. While \nadverse wind conditions most likely sent one of the helicopters into an \ninevitable crash, the highly skilled pilot of the 939th ensured that \nthe crew survived and that all on the ground were unharmed.\n  This happened just one week after the 939th rescued a sick climber \nfrom Mt. Hood's Sandy Glacier. I believe this rescue highlights the \nWing's capabilities. Late in the evening, the 304th Rescue Squadron \nused it night vision capabilities to spot the climber at an elevation \nof 8,750 feet. The Pave Hawk, equipped with a hoist, lowered down Steve \nRollins of Portland Mountain Rescue onto the Glacier to assess the \nclimber. After being secured to the hoist, the climber and rescuer were \nraised into the helicopter and transported to safety.\n  Oregonians were devastated to hear of Air Force plans to take away \nthe 939th Search and Rescue Wing out of the State to move it to \nFlorida.\n  Oregonians realize that the 939th's mission is to rescue our brave \nmen in combat. In fact, we believe that the members of the 939th are \namong the very best trained in the Nation. We know this because we know \nthe Oregon terrain and we have witnessed first-hand their skill under \nmost challenging conditions.\n  The decision to move the 939th came about in December 2000--ten \nmonths prior to a day that has changed our understanding of national \nsecurity and defense needs. We have been at war since September 11. We \nneed to keep the highly trained combat search and rescuers who are \nready to serve at a moment's notice. A new active duty wing would \nneither be ready today nor tomorrow, not next week nor next month. It \nwould take two years to stand up a new active duty rescue wing. We not \nonly need assets in places abroad where al Quaeda members train, but we \nneed a capability at home to support homeland security needs.\n  I have not seen enough evidence to make me believe that changing the \nmission of a CSAR Wing would be advantageous to the United States in \nwartime.\n  In the wake of September 11, the President established the White \nHouse Office of Homeland Security and the Homeland Security Council to \nensure that our Federal response and protection efforts are coordinated \nand effective. The President also directed\n\n[[Page S5204]]\n\nHomeland Security Advisor Tom Ridge to determine if the current \ngovernment structure allows us to meet the threats of today while \nanticipating the unknown threats of tomorrow. I question why the Air \nForce has not done the same.\n  I understand that my original amendment was not considered germane. \nThis amendment would have prevented any funds from being made available \nfor this conversion. The amendment the managers accepted requires the \nSecretary of the Air Force to certify that a comparable search and \nrescue capability is available in the 939th Combat Search and Rescue \nWing's area of responsibility and that any new aircraft assigned to the \nunit will comply with local environmental and noise standards, and that \nthe Air Force has developed a plan for the transition of personnel \ncurrently assigned to the unit.\n  I appreciate the assistance from Senators Stevens, Inouye, and Byrd \nand look forward to working with them on this important issue.\n  Let me close by illustrating why this is so important to me and all \nOregonians. The pioneer spirit of the Oregon Trail did not end with the \nsettlement of the valleys of Oregon. That spirit and bravery is very \nmuch still alive in my state. But Oregonians cannot go any further \nwest. They can only go up, into the skies and into the mountains. It is \nthere that the modern-day pioneers meet with both triumph and tragedy, \nand their lessons are learned.\n  The lessons of last week on Mt. Hood are harsh ones that remind us of \nhuman frailty and the unbending forces of nature. Not unlike the tragic \nevents of the last year, what I saw in the recovery on Mt. Hood also \nillustrates the bravery and compassion inherent in us all, and I want \nthat spirit to continue in Oregon.\n  This is the spirit that is the bedrock of America's Armed Forces. It \nis clear to me that removing the 939th from Oregon would truly be a \ntragedy without a lesson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/06/senate-section/article/S5204-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE RETIREMENT OF MAJOR GENERAL HAROLD TIMBOE, USA\n\n Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an \nAmerican who has honorably served our Nation for 34 years--Major \nGeneral Harold L. Timboe, United States Army Medical Corps, Commanding \nGeneral, North Atlantic Regional Medical Command and Walter Reed Army \nMedical Center, Washington, D.C.\n  A native of Long Beach, CA, General Timboe attended the United States \nMilitary Academy at West Point, New York, where he earned a Bachelor of \nScience Degree in 1968. He started his Army career as an Air Defense \nArtillery officer with assignments in Saudi Arabia and Vietnam. \nFollowing graduation from the University of Texas Medical School in \n1978 and his residency, Major General Timboe served with distinction in \na variety of leadership and executive positions including the \nfollowing: Corps Surgeon, XVIII Airborne Corps, Operation Desert Storm; \nCommanding General, 44th Medical Brigade, Fort Bragg, NC; Commanding \nGeneral, Great Plains Regional Medical Command, Fort Sam Houston, TX; \nculminating as the Lead Agent, TRICARE Northeast, Region 1, \nheadquartered at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.\n  In his most recent position Major General Timboe directed the \nintegration of the National Capital Area Composite Health Care System \nacross the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard services, which \nincludes 77 work centers between National Naval Medical Center, \nBethesda, Malcom Grow Medical Center, Walter Reed Army Medical Center \nand their 41 Satellite facilities. Through his distinctive \naccomplishments, Major General Timboe reflected great credit upon \nhimself, the United States Army, and the Department of Defense.\n  General Timboe's accomplishments and service have been recognized in \nnumerous military awards. He has been awarded the Legion of Merit with \nfour Oak Leaf Clusters, Bronze Star with one Oak Leaf Cluster, \nMeritorious Service Medal with three Oak Leaf Clusters, Air Medal, \nJoint Service Commendation Medal, Army Commendation Medal, Army \nAchievement Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, Humanitarian Service Medal, \nArmed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Southwest Asia Service Medal, Expert \nField Medical Badge, Flight Surgeon Badge, U.S., British, and German \nParachutist Badges, and the Army Staff Identification Badge.\n  Major General Timboe and his wife Donna are to be commended for their \ndedication and contribution to our Nation. Major General Timboe's \nservice to his country has been exemplary and in the finest traditions \nof the United States Army. I extend my appreciation to General Timboe, \nand congratulate him as he retires from his distinguished military \ncareer. I wish him and his family well in their future endeavors as \nthey enter a new phase of their lives in Texas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/06/senate-section/article/S5204-2", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CLARENCE B. CRAFT\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, it is with great pride, but \nwith a heavy heart that I rise today to pay tribute to one of America's \ngreatest heroes and fellow Arkansan, Clarence B. Craft. Mr. Craft \npassed away on March 28, 2002, but left behind a legacy of kindness and \ncourage. Though he was born in California, he spent the last twenty-\nfive years of his life in northwest Arkansas giving selflessly of his \ntime as a volunteer for the Veterans' Affairs Medical Center in \nFayettville. He will be remembered as a true and dedicated friend to \nthe veterans, one who lifted their spirits with personal visits, often \nvisiting every patient in the hospital. After his passing, those who \nknew him characterized Clarence as a ``special man.''\n  Clarence Craft was an extremely humble person, and rarely talked \nabout the accolades that made this great American truly special. On May \n31, 1945, then-Private First Class Craft faced a numerically superior \nJapanese force on the island of Okinawa. PFC Craft's one-man attack \nagainst a Japanese defense that had repelled repeated, heavy assaults \nby battalion-sized U.S. formations for 12 days, resulted in the entire \ndefensive line crumbling. For these heroic acts Clarence Craft was \nrecognized with our nation's highest award for actions above and beyond \nthe call of duty, the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n  Let the record show on behalf of a grateful nation, that the U.S. \nSenate pays tribute to Clarence B. Craft, an American hero. He will be \nsorely missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/06/senate-section/article/S5204-3", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/06/senate-section/article/S5204-4", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/06/senate-section/article/S5204-5", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    NINTH BIENNIAL REPORT OF THE INTERAGENCY ARCTIC RESEARCH POLICY \n    COMMITTEE FROM FEBRUARY 1, 2000 THROUGH JANUARY 31, 2002--PM 89\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Government Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  As required by section 108(b) of Public Law 98-373 (15 U.S.C. \n4107(b)), I transmit herewith the Ninth Biennial Report of the \nInteragency Arctic Research Policy Committee (February 1, 2000, to \nJanuary 31, 2002).\n                                                      George W.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. TORRICELLI (for himself and Mr. Cleland):\n  S. 2593. A bill to protect diverse and structurally complex areas of \nthe seabed in the United States exclusive economic zone by establishing \na maximum diameter size limit on rockhopper, roller, and all other \nground gear used on bottom trawls; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, our oceans are one of America's most \nprecious and valuable resources. For hundreds of millions of people, \nour coastal waters are a place of relaxation, recreation, and \nrejuvenation. The oceans are also a tremendous supply of fish and other \nseafood, many caught by commercial fishers and others by recreational \nsportsmen and hobbyists.\n  There is a growing concern, however, about protecting ocean habitat \nfrom the damaging effects of some types of commercial fishing gear. The \nmanner in which these concerns are presently being handled by the \nNational Marine Fishery Service has led to a great deal of confusion \nand litigation. Therefore, in an effort to protect important ocean \nsubstrates that are recognized as critical areas of marine habitat, I, \nwith my colleague, Senator Max Cleland of Georgia, am introducing a \nbill today that takes a much more direct approach.\n  I have received many letters from constituents in my home State of \nNew Jersey who are concerned about the use of ``rock hopper'' nets in \nthe New York Bight area and elsewhere. They have chronicled the \nnegative effects of this gear and the damage they see occurring as a \nresult of its use. In response to their concerns I feel compelled to \nintroduce in the Senate companion legislation to Congressman Joel \nHefley's Sea Bed Protection Act of 2002, which he introduced recently \nin the House. This bill will amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation Act by reining in the use of this damaging fishing gear.\n  Rock hopper nets are used in hard-bottom areas where naturally \noccurring vertical structures prevents the use of more conventional \ntrawl gear. The rock hopper incorporates a series of rollers that act \nlike the drum on the front of a steamroller. While operating, the \nrollers prevent the net from becoming entangled by guiding it up and \nover obstructions. While it is effective at catching fish, it is \nequally effective at damaging the sea floor where it is used.\n  It has been clearly documented that rock hopper nets kill clinging \norganisms and living corals, the very things that attracted the fish \nthey were designed to catch in the first place. The heavy rollers and \nsweeps that guide the nets crush marine life and can even flatten \nbottom topography.\n  When a specific piece of equipment is demonstrated to be harmful to \nmarine life or the marine environment, it is common sense to stop using \nit and find a more ecosystem-friendly method of harvesting fish for the \nmarket. It is folly to allow the continued use of fishing gear that has \nan uncontrollable level of bycatch of that is damaging to the very \nhabitat necessary for the fish it catches to grow and reproduce. Rock \nhopper nets are clearly a threat to fragile habitats that are \nparticularly important to a healthy marine ecosystem. The Sea Bed \nProtection Act\n\n[[Page S5208]]\n\nwill limit their use and protect critical habitat, while highlighting \nour concern for the broader issues of sustainable fisheries and habitat \nprotection.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \n        Allard, and Mr. Craig):\n  S. 2594. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to \npurchase silver on the open market when the silver stockpile is \ndepleted, to be used to mint coins; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Support of \nAmerican Eagle Silver Bullion Program Act. The American Eagle Silver \nBullion Program was originally created in 1985 to provide a vehicle for \ninvestors who wish to invest in silver, and to deplete the Defense \nLogistics Agency's Strategic and Critical Materials Stockpile. As many \ninvestors in silver bullion know, since its inception, the American \nEagle Silver Bullion Coin Program has grown to become the largest and \nmost successful coin program in the United States, generating millions \nof dollars in revenue each year. In fact, between 1995 and 2001, the \nAmerican Eagle Silver Coin program has generated revenues of over $264 \nmillion, much of which has been used to pay down the national debt.\n  Ironically, the success of this program threatens its future, because \nit has also fulfilled its secondary purpose, depleting the Strategic \nand Critical Materials Stockpile. The authorizing language for the \nAmerican Eagle Silver Bullion Program mandates that silver to mint the \ncoins may only be drawn from the stockpile. Legislation is needed to \nallow the program, which is so beneficial to both investors and the \ngovernment, to continue.\n  The Support of American Eagle Silver Bullion Program Act will allow \nthe U.S. Mint to continue the American Eagle Silver Bullion Program by \nauthorizing them to purchase silver on the open market. Given the dual \npurposes of the program's birth, it is only fitting that its rebirth \nwill also have two results. Not only will the program be able to \ncontinue to serve the needs of investors and the government, it will \nalso provide a needed boost to the nation's silver mining industry. It \nis estimated that the Mint will purchase approximately 9 million ounces \nof silver per year for the American Eagle Silver Bullion Program. As \nthe largest silver producing state in the nation, representing \napproximately 34 percent of the United States' silver production, \nNevada will lead the other 12 silver producing states in supplying this \nsuccessful program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 2595. A bill to authorize the expenditure of funds on private \nlands and facilities at Mesa Verde National Park, in the State of \nColorado, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today, I am introducing a very simple \nand important bill that will aid in our Nation's understanding of an \nancient time.\n  The 52,000 acre Mesa Verde National Park in southwestern Colorado \nholds one of the most unique archaeological sites in the world. The \nculture represented at Mesa Verde reflects more than 700 years of \nhistory. People lived and flourished in communities in the area from \naround 400 A.D. through 1300 A.D.\n  Eventually, the people there built elaborate stone villages in the \nsheltered alcoves of the canyon walls that are today regarded as \n``cliff dwellings.'' The villagers lived in the cliff dwellings during \nthe last 100 to 125 years of occupation at Mesa Verde. Within the span \nof two generations, in the late 1200s, the people left their homes and \nmoved away. However, they left behind a literal treasure trove of \nartifacts in the ruins, artifacts that are still being collected and \nstudied to this day.\n  Our Nation's first conservationist and fellow Republican, President \nTheodore Roosevelt established the Mesa Verde National Park in 1906. \nSince that time, countless artifacts have been carefully excavated and \ncatalogued.\n  Unfortunately, those priceless treasures have not had a suitable \nhome, and instead have been housed in what effectively is a tin shed \nbuilt in the 1950s, which has since become infested with mice. The tin \nshed lacks proper temperature and humidity controls in an area where \nthe humidity can swing from seventeen to eighty percent in a short \ntime. A tin shed is no place to store 800 year old corn and yucca \nleaves or clay pot artifacts, especially considering such drastic and \ndamaging climate changes.\n  My bill provides the Secretary of the Interior with the authority to \ncollect and expend donated funds for the design and construction and \nassociated costs to build a visitors center. The legislation provides \nno Federal money for this much needed project, but allows for Interior \nto partner with devoted non-profit historical and cultural \norganizations, especially the Mesa Verde Foundation.\n  The visitors center will be located on land owned by the Foundation \nadjacent to the entrance of the park. The proximity of the cultural and \nvisitors center to the cliff dwellings will allow archeologists, \nstudents, and visitors an open and accessible window to the lives of \nindigenous and prehistoric people.\n  I am proud to follow in the footsteps of fellow conservationist, \nTeddy Roosevelt, and ask the Senate for quick passage of this important \nbill. Thank you, and I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2595\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n       The Secretary of the Interior is authorized to collect and \n     expend donated funds and expend appropriated funds for the \n     design, construction, maintenance, and operation of a \n     cultural center and related facilities to be constructed to \n     accommodate visitors, to protect artifacts and archival \n     materials, and for the administration of Mesa Verde National \n     Park on privately owned lands located outside and adjacent to \n     the boundary of the park.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. \n        Torricelli, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Biden, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 2596. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nthe financing of the Superfund; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce a bill \nthat addresses a critical gap that now exists in the funding for the \nclean-up of the Nation's most toxic waste sites. The Toxic Clean-up \nPolluter Pays Renewal Act restores the fees on oil, chemical and other \nindustries to ensure that the Superfund trust fund is solvent, and that \npolluters, not the American Taxpayers, bear the burden of cleaning up \nsites that pose a threat to the health and safety of our communities.\n  I am also pleased to be joined in this effort by the ranking member \nof the Superfund Subcommittee, Senator Chafee as well as the chairman \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator Jeffords. As \nChair of the Superfund Subcommittee, I thank them for joining me in \nthis effort.\n  Senators Torricelli, Corizine, and Biden are also cosponsers.\n  The threats posed by Superfund sites affect communities in every \ncorner of the country. One in every four Americans lives within four \nmiles of a Superfund site. That's 70 million Americans, including 10 \nmillion children, who are at risk of cancer and other health problems.\n  My State of California has the second highest number of Superfund \nsites in the country after New Jersey. And more than 40 percent of \nCalifornians live within four miles of a Superfund site.\n  Anyone who lives anywhere near a Superfund site knows about the \nterrible damage these industrial sites do to the community. Parents \nworry if their kids are safe when they find out there is a toxic mess \ndown the street; real estate values go down the drain; and major \nchallenges must be overcome to get the responsible parties to own up to \ntheir responsibility.\n  Fortunately, after Love Canal in 1980, Congress enacted the Superfund \nlaw to address the serious threat posed by these sites. And this law \nhas worked. Great progress was made. Since the creation of this program \nover 800 sites have been cleaned up. During the last four years of the \nClinton Administration, there was an average of 87 final cleanups a \nyear.\n\n[[Page S5209]]\n\n  Unfortunately, this program has seen a sharp decline since the start \nof the Bush Administration. The pace of cleanups has slowed to a crawl. \nInstead of 87 National Priority List sites a year, less than half of \nthat are now being cleaned-up. The number is projected to drop further, \nto just 40 sites, this year.\n  At the same time, the heart of the Superfund law is under attack: the \nprinciple that polluters must pay for cleanups. And that is the issue \nthat my bill addresses.\n  The Superfund trust fund, which includes funds from Superfund fees \npreviously paid by oil, chemical, and other industries, is nearly gone. \nIt will be depleted by 2004. Why? Because these fees expired in 1995.\n  The result is that a greater and greater share of the cost of \nSuperfund cleanups is being borne by taxpayers instead of polluters. In \nfact, in 1995, taxpayers contributed just 18 percent to the Superfund \ntrust fund. But by next year, American taxpayers will pay 54 percent of \nthe Superfund budget.\n  This trend must be reversed. We must return to the principle of \n``polluter pays.''\n  That is what the Toxic Clean-up Polluter Pays Renewal Act would do. \nIt would reinstate the two Superfund fees, the excise tax on oil and \nchemical companies as well as the corporate environmental income tax, \nas they existed from 1986 to 1995.\n  These fees are not large in scope. For example, for every barrel of \noil, the excise tax is only 9.7 cents. Chemical manufacturers pay $4.45 \nfor every ton of arsenic or mercury they produce. This fee varies based \non the frequency and toxicity of the chemical.\n  With regard to the corporate environmental income tax, corporations \nthat have over $2 million in taxable income pay only 0.12 percent on \ntaxable income above $2 million dollars. That means that a company that \nhas $2,010,000 in taxable income would pay only $12.\n  These companies make millions on their sales. This fee is a small \nprice to pay for a healthy, safe environment.\n  And, while the fees themselves are relatively small, the preliminary \nestimates indicate that they would generate $15 billion to $16 billion \nover the next 10 years for the Superfund Trust Fund. And that is $16 \nbillion that the American taxpayer would not have to pay.\n  After the Superfund fees expired in 1995, President Clinton \nrepeatedly tried to have them reinstated. Unfortunately, the Bush \nAdministration is not supporting returning to the important principle \nof polluters pays.\n  Polluters pays is fair. Polluters pays works. And polluter pays must \ncontinue. To shift the burden to all taxpayers is wrong, and we will \nfight this Administration's attempt to turn its back on the health of \nthe American people.\n  Mr. CHAFEE. Mr. President, today I join with Senator Boxer to \nintroduce a bill to fund the Superfund program for the 10 years. With \nthe Superfund Trust Fund on the verge of insolvency and with a large \nnumber of Superfund sites still requiring cleanup, it is incumbent upon \nus to provide a stable source of funding for this important program. I \nam pleased that the bill we introduce today will ensure Superfund \ncleanups will continue without jeopardizing funding for other key \nprograms.\n  The need for the Superfund program dates back to the late 1970 and \nthe discovery of thousands of barrels of toxic waste buried illegally \nin a New York community outside of Buffalo. Congress responded to Love \nCanal and other sites by enacting Superfund. This law was intended to \naddress the Nation's worst sites and ensure that parties are held \nresponsible for the contamination they created. Litigation ensued \nthroughout the 1980's, which slowed down the pace of cleanups. By the \n1990s, the pace of Superfund cleanups increased. Administrative and \nlegislative reforms in the last 10 years have significantly improved \nthe effectiveness and pace of the Superfund program.\n  Collection of excise and income taxes to supply the Superfund ceased \nat the end of 1995 and have never been reinstated. While spending for \nthe Superfund program has remained steady, the dependence on general \nrevenue dollars have grown. By fiscal year 2004, the Superfund program \nwill be funded virtually entirely by general revenues. Unfortunately, \nwe are currently living in an atmosphere of budget deficits. We find \nourselves unable to pay for key programs due to insufficient resources \nand I believe it is a mistake to make the Superfund program compete for \nthose limited general revenue dollars because we did not replenish the \nSuperfund Trust Fund.\n  The legislation which we have introduced today will reinstate the \nSuperfund taxes for 10 years. It is true that these taxes will generate \nless revenue than those that expired in 1995. This is a deliberate \neffort maintain balance between the amount of money paid into the trust \nfund and the amount of money appropriated by Congress. We do not want \nto create a situation in which we are putting more money into the trust \nfund than will be spent. At the same time, we must ensure that \nSuperfund cleanups progress as quickly as possible. Despite some claims \nthat Superfund cleanups will soon be complete, the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency testified recently before the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee that the remaining Superfund sites are complex and \ncostly. All evidence points to the fact that the Superfund program is \nnot in jeopardy of winding down any time soon and that adequate funding \nwill be needed.\n  In conclusion, I would like to say that I believe this to be a \nreasonable proposal. It is not perfect, because a perfect solution \nwould ensure that the people responsible for the contamination pay to \nclean it up. In the future we may wish to look for more equitable ways \nto fund the Superfund program. However, with the Superfund Trust Fund \non the verge of insolvency, a return to the previous funding mechanism \nis a prudent step.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CRAIG (for himself, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Burns, Mr. Crapo, Mr. \n        Murkowski, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 2597. A bill to authorize a 3-year demonstration program to \nrecruit and train physicians to serve in a rural setting; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Rural Health \nTraining Incentive Act. I am pleased that Senators Patty Murray, Conrad \nBurns, Mike Crapo and Frank Murkowski are joining with me in this \neffort today.\n  We are all aware there is a nationwide shortage of health \npractitioners in rural America and that this shortage is affecting the \navailability of health care in those communities. This trend is \naggravated by the upcoming retirement of 77 million baby-boomers and \nthe overall aging of the rural populations. Unfortunately, there is no \nquick fix for the problem, and the solution will require a long-term \ninvestment in human resources. The bill that I am introducing today \nwould begin work on this long-term investment through the regional \nWashington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho, WWAMI, program.\n  The WWAMI program has an excellent track record in its 30 year \nhistory of designing programs that work. It has a regionally focused \nmedical school with a mission to train physicians for the communities \nin Washington, Wyoming, Alaska, Montana and Idaho. With 27 percent of \nthe land mass of the Nation and only 3.3 percent of its population it \nis truly a ready made laboratory for exploring the best ways to recruit \nand train rural health care professionals.\n  This legislation seeks to expand upon the existing WWAMI programs for \nthe recruitment and training of all health care professionals in the \nfive state rural settings and to develop and evaluate similar programs \nthat could be used in other regions of the country. This legislation \nwould be a step in preparing our young people to go into the medical \nprofessions and, importantly, would encourage them to practice in rural \ncommunities.\n  I am pleased to be able to introduce this legislation as part of an \noverall strategy to stabilize health care in rural communities. This \nsession, I have introduced legislation that would provide rural health \ncare facilities with much needed capital to build new or repair \nexisting infrastructure and to purchase medical equipment to help them \nkeep pace with changing technologies. I am also pleased to have worked \nwith my colleague Senator Harkin on two\n\n[[Page S5210]]\n\nseparate pieces of legislation that would provide Medicare equity to \nboth providers and seniors in rural States. The bill that I am \nintroducing today adds an integral element of this strategy by making \nsure that health professionals are available to serve in rural areas.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2597\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Rural Health Training \n     Incentive Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. WWAMI DEMONSTRATION PROJECT.\n\n       (a) Grant Authorized.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     (in this section referred to as the ``Secretary'') is \n     authorized to award a grant to the Washington, Wyoming, \n     Alaska, Montana, and Idaho joint medical school (in this \n     section referred to as ``WWAMI'') to strengthen and expand \n     programs to encourage more health professionals to practice \n     in rural areas.\n       (2) Duration.--The Secretary shall award the grant in \n     paragraph (1) for a period of 3 years.\n       (b) Use of Funds.--The grant awarded pursuant to subsection \n     (a) may be used for activities including--\n       (1) developing new mechanisms for recruiting and mentoring \n     rural youth with respect to all health professions;\n       (2) strengthening and stabilizing the system of training \n     for the family physicians needed in rural areas; and\n       (3) expanding the network of rural training tracks \n     throughout WWAMI.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 6 months after the end of the \n     grant period described in subsection (a)(2), WWAMI shall \n     submit to the Secretary a report evaluating the results of \n     programs funded with the grant authorized under subsection \n     (a)(1) and any recommendations regarding the effectiveness of \n     such programs.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROJECT EXPANSION.\n\n       (a) In General.--After submission of the report required in \n     section 2(c), the Secretary is authorized to award grants to \n     eligible entities to expand the programs under section 2, and \n     to implement the recommendations made in such report, in \n     other geographic areas.\n       (b) Eligible Entity Defined.--As used in this section, the \n     term ``eligible entity'' means a partnership between a \n     regional university or college and the medical school \n     associated with such university or college where such medical \n     school has a rural area training track of at least 2 months.\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--There are authorized to be appropriated to \n     carry out this Act, except section 2(c) and section 3, \n     $3,400,000 for fiscal year 2003, $4,100,000 for fiscal year \n     2004, and $4,800,000 for fiscal year 2005.\n       (b) Evaluation.--There is authorized to be appropriated to \n     carry out the report described in section 2(c), $500,000 for \n     fiscal year 2005.\n       (c) Project Expansion.--There is authorized to be \n     appropriated to carry out section 3, such sums as may be \n     necessary beginning in fiscal year 2006.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Inouye, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. \n        Bingaman, and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 2598. A bill to enhance the criminal penalties for illegal \ntrafficking of archaeological resources, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Enhanced \nProtection of Our Cultural Heritage, EPOCH, Act of 2002. This \nlegislation will increase the maximum penalties for violations of three \nexisting statutes that protect the cultural and archaeological history \nof the American people, particularly Native Americans. The United \nStates Sentencing Commission recommended the statutory changes \ncontained in this bill, which would complement the Commission's \nstrengthening of Federal sentencing guidelines to ensure more stringent \npenalties for criminals who steal from our public lands. I welcome the \nCommission's suggestion and am pleased that Senators Inouye, Clinton, \nBingaman, and Boxer have joined me as cosponsors.\n  This bill will increase the maximum penalties for the Archaeological \nResources Protection Act, ARPA, 16 USC Sec.  470ee, the Native American \nGraves Protection and Repatriation Act, NAGPRA, 18 USC Sec.  1170, and \nfor 18 USC Sec.  1163, which prohibits theft from Indian Tribal \nOrganizations. All three statutes currently impose a 5-year maximum \nsentence, and each includes a lower maximum for a first offense of the \nstatute and/or a violation of the statute involving property of less \nthan a specified value. This bill would create a 10-year maximum \nsentence for each statute, while eliminating the lower maximums under \nARPA and NAGPRA for first offenses.\n  Such maximum sentences would be consistent with similar Federal \nstatutes. For example, the 1994 law proscribing museum theft carries a \n10-year maximum sentence, as do the general statutes punishing theft \nand the destruction of government property. Moreover, increasing the \nmaximum sentences will give judges and the Sentencing Commission \ngreater discretion to impose punishments appropriate to the amount of \ndestruction a defendant has done.\n  Making these changes will also enable the Sentencing Commission's \nrecent sentencing guidelines to be fully implemented. The Commission \nhas increased sentencing guidelines for cultural heritage crimes, but \nthe statutory maximum penalties contained in current law will prevent \njudges from issuing sentences in the upper range of the new guidelines. \nThose new guidelines have the enthusiastic support of the Justice and \nInterior Departments, the Society for American Archeology, the National \nTrust for Historic Preservation, numerous Native American nations, and \nmany others. Congress should take the steps necessary to see the \nguidelines take full effect.\n  Two of the three laws we amend with this legislation protect Native \nAmerican lands and property. The third, ARPA, protects both public and \nIndian lands, and provides significant protection to my State of \nVermont. For example, ARPA can be used to prosecute those who would \nsteal artifacts from the wrecked military vessels at the bottom of Lake \nChamplain that date to the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. U.S. \nAttorneys can also use ARPA to prosecute criminals who take items that \nare at least 100 years old from a protected site on Vermont State \nproperty without a permit, and then transport those goods into another \nState. In addition, ARPA protects artifacts found on the approximately \n5 percent of Vermont land that is Federal property, land that includes \nmany ``ghost towns'' that have long been abandoned but are an important \npart of our history.\n  Those who would pillage the rich cultural heritage of this Nation and \nits people are committing serious crimes. These artifacts are the \nlegacy of all Americans and should not be degraded as garage sale \ncommodities or as fodder for private enrichment.\n  I would like to thank a number of people for their help and advice \nabout this legislation. Charlie Tetzlaff, as well as the rest of the \nstaff at the Sentencing Commission, helped us understand the importance \nof this issue, and made protecting our cultural heritage a priority \nwhen he served as United States Attorney for Vermont. Art Cohn, the \ndirector of the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum, and Giovanna Peebles, \nVermont's State Archeologist, were very helpful in explaining how our \nlaws protect the cultural heritage of Vermont and the rest of the \nNation, and I am grateful for their support for this bill.\n  Passage of this legislation would demonstrate Congress' commitment to \npreserving our Nation's history and our cultural heritage. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this common-sense initiative.\n  I would ask that the text of this legislation be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2598\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Enhanced Protection of Our \n     Cultural Heritage Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ENHANCED PENALTIES FOR CULTURAL HERITAGE CRIMES.\n\n       (a) Enhanced Penalty for Illegal Trafficking in \n     Archaeological Resources.--Section 6(d) of the Archaeological \n     Resources Protection Act of 1979 (16 U.S.C. 470ee(d)) is \n     amended by striking ``not more than $10,000'' and all that \n     follows through the end of the subsection, and inserting \n     ``not more than $100,000, imprisoned not more than 10 years, \n     or both.''.\n       (b) Enhanced Penalty for Embezzlement and Theft From Indian \n     Tribal Organizations.--Section 1163 of title 18, United \n     States\n\n[[Page S5211]]\n\n     Code, is amended by striking ``five years'' and inserting \n     ``10 years''.\n       (c) Enhanced Penalty for Illegal Trafficking in Native \n     American Human Remains and Cultural Items.--Section 1170 of \n     title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``or imprisoned not more \n     than 12 months, or both, and in the case of a second or \n     subsequent violation, be fined in accordance with this title, \n     or imprisoned not more than 5 years'' and inserting \n     ``imprisoned not more than 10 years''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b), by striking ``imprisoned not more \n     than one year, or both, and in the case of a second or \n     subsequent violation, be fined in accordance with this title, \n     imprisoned not more than 5 years'' and inserting ``imprisoned \n     not more than 10 years''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself, Mr. Kyl, and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 2599. A bill to establish the Water Supply Technologies Program \nwithin the Office of Energy Efficiency and renewable Energy of the \nDepartment of Energy, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, on behalf of myself, Senator Kyl, and \nSenator Crapo, I am introducing a bill with reference to water, water \nsupply, and research. We have no American policy, no place that you can \ngo where the basic water issues of our land can be metered and modeled, \nand where we can find out what the real situation is with reference to \nwater for our growing needs in our cities and the surrounding areas.\n  If you are interested in that, I think you will find the bill I am \nsending to the desk to be an intriguing one. It has been put together \nby very bright, technical people from laboratories and similar \nentities, where they clearly set forth the way we ought to go about \nestablishing a water supply research center for a country as important \nas ours, and how we can provide research on an annual basis in these \nareas for very few dollars.\n  Water is the lifeblood of our Southwest. We don't have an abundant \nsupply and what we do have is becoming increasingly threatened. Between \nproviding water for people and various endangered species, there just \nisn't enough water to go around.\n  I'm sure many of my colleagues are seeing daily headlines like:\n\n       Winds Parch Remaining Moisture Out of New Mexico Land,\n       Navajos Urged To Sell Parched Livestock,\n       New Mexico Going to Drought Emergency,\n       Drought Watch--Skies Without Hope, and\n       Trees Need Big Help To Survive Drought.\n\nThere is no larger problem facing our Southwest.\n  This bill is part of my broad strategy for dealing with water quality \nand quantity issues. In earlier bills, I have sought to provide grants \nto communities struggling to meet the new EPA arsenic mandates. I \nrecently introduced the National Drought Preparedness Act of 2002 to \nhelp communities develop drought preparedness plans in an effort to \nmitigate the effects of future droughts.\n  This bill will help with short term challenges like meeting arsenic \nmandates and longer term issues like cost-effective desalination \ntechnologies and better modeling to enable optimum utilization of the \nwater in our major river basins.\n  There are good reasons for designating the Department of Energy to \ncreate these technologies. Energy is the second largest user of water, \nsecond only to agriculture. Furthermore, energy costs are a major \ncomponent in purifying and pumping drinking water and in treating \nwastewater.\n  As scarcity of water intensifies, more and more energy will be needed \nto obtain and treat it. Water will be pumped from greater depths and \nover greater distances. More treatment will be needed as we use less \npure resources. As just one example, up to half the costs of \ndesalination involve energy.\n  Removal of arsenic will be one focus for this new program. In New \nMexico, as in much of the West, arsenic occurs naturally in significant \nconcentrations. This, coupled with the fact that New Mexico is not a \nwealthy State, has made the recent unfunded mandate imposed by the EPA \ninsurmountable.\n  This new standard is going to cost New Mexico around $400 million. \nMore than 100 community water systems in the State will probably have \nto upgrade their water treatment facilities. Ratepayers are likely to \nsee monthly rate increases averaging between $40 and $90, that's simply \nunacceptable. Other States have similar problems.\n  Even worse, these costs may force people to shift from expensive \ntreated water to cheaper domestic wells. Since these wells often \ncontain even greater amounts of arsenic and pollutants, there may be \nunintended public health consequences created by this new mandate.\n  I introduced S. 1299 to provide grants to States to help them comply \nwith these new standards. That will help, but grant dollars alone \naren't the answer to this issue. We also need to reduce the costs of \narsenic removal.\n  This bill authorizes $8 million for research and development of cost \neffective strategies. The program will focus on reducing overall costs, \nincluding those for energy and will include demonstration projects in \nthe arid southwest.\n  The bill also provides for a 4 year extension in the time by which \nmunicipalities must comply with the new EPA mandate, in addition to the \nextension that EPA has already committed to. This extension is open to \nany public water system that is in the process of utilizing technology \nauthorized under this bill. Our national laboratories, especially \nSandia, will be strong contributors to this program.\n  Another part of the bill deals with the challenges of providing \nadequate supplies of fresh water for the growing populations of our \nsouthwest. These States face severe water shortages, which impact both \nour urban communities and our rural agricultural ones. Our fresh water \nsupply will not increase, unless we take steps today and invest in new \napproaches to water supply and management.\n  To achieve this, my bill provides authority for the program director, \nin cooperation with the Commissioner of Reclamation, to coordinate \ndesalination research for improved technologies. This program is \nauthorized at $6 million.\n  The program will focus on development and demonstration of \ntechnologies appropriate for desalinating brackish water and encourages \nthe use of renewable energy. Part of these funds will enable completion \nof a national desalination research center in the Tularosa Basin of New \nMexico.\n  The bill also provides $7 million to implement programs to examine \nthe relationships between water supplies and energy needs. It will \nfocus on the availability of water and on opportunities for increasing \nour supplies. Hopefully, with this research we can turn our water \nfuture into something other than a ``zero sum'' game.\n  The program will develop comprehensive models to assess and manage \ncompeting demands for water by energy, agriculture and other sectors. \nTo accomplish this, models will include a range of physical phenomena \nand a complete set of the major water uses. The bill provides for the \ndevelopment of these models for up to 3 domestic river basins, one of \nwhich addresses an international border.\n  Many Americans are under the illusion that water will always flow out \nof their tap each time it is turned on. And they continue to believe \nthat there will always be an adequate supply of good quality water to \nmeet all needs, energy, agriculture and domestic. I fear this may not \nalways be the case. Unless we develop a long-term strategy for dealing \nwith impending water shortages it could be too late.\n  I hope this bill starts us down the path of conquering water \nchallenges in the 21st Century.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2599\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Water Supply Technologies \n     Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the understanding, use, and protection of water \n     resources are matters of national and global security;\n       (2) increasing demand for water supply may dramatically \n     alter population patterns and strain international relations;\n       (3) the remediation of many sites of the Department of \n     Energy and the treatment of domestic water supplies require \n     cost-effective, efficient removal of contaminants from water \n     supplies;\n\n[[Page S5212]]\n\n       (4) such remediation frequently involves knowledge and \n     modeling of water transport at the surface and subsurface \n     levels;\n       (5)(A) energy costs--\n       (i) are a major factor in the extraction, storage, \n     treatment, and delivery of water; and\n       (ii) are particularly high in the case of desalination \n     processes; and\n       (B) increased efficiencies in energy use, or use of \n     renewable energy sources in treatment processes, can result \n     in large cost savings;\n       (6)(A) most energy production technologies are highly water \n     intensive;\n       (B) the energy industry is the second largest water user \n     after agriculture;\n       (C) energy production requires a reliable, predictable \n     water supply; and\n       (D) the limited availability of water is beginning to \n     constrain construction of new powerplants;\n       (7) having strong expertise in geosciences, hydrology, \n     chemistry, energy options, system modeling, and security \n     technologies, the Department of Energy is well positioned to \n     contribute to national efforts relating to water issues;\n       (8) modeling and simulation of water cycles on at least the \n     scale of river basins can guide strategies affecting--\n       (A) site cleanup;\n       (B) agricultural use of land;\n       (C) industrial use of land;\n       (D) protection of the environment; and\n       (E) population expansion;\n       (9) municipal water systems are facing unfunded Federal \n     mandates to remove heavy metals and other contaminants from \n     water supplies;\n       (10) in the future, as water supplies are further stressed, \n     municipal water systems may be forced to use water supplies \n     that cannot, using existing technologies, be cost-effectively \n     purified to meet clean water standards;\n       (11) many components of technologies used in the \n     remediation of heavy metals and other contaminants at sites \n     of the Department would aid municipal water systems in water \n     purification;\n       (12) for municipal water systems, 2 of the most \n     economically and technically challenging treatment processes \n     are--\n       (A) reduction of arsenic levels; and\n       (B) desalination;\n       (13)(A) the security of water supplies is a growing \n     concern; and\n       (B) there is an emerging need for real-time sensing, and \n     reporting systems for early warnings to the public, of \n     potentially hazardous contaminants in the drinking water \n     supply;\n       (14) major water shortages along the United States-Mexico \n     border--\n       (A) are projected to occur in the future; and\n       (B) could contribute to many issues affecting the border \n     region; and\n       (15) research and development of the Department must be \n     coordinated with research and development of other Federal \n     agencies, each of which has responsibilities, interests, and \n     capabilities to contribute to solving the important problems \n     described in this section.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, I am honored to stand here today with my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Inouye, and submit a resolution \nhonoring the Marine Raiders. In recent months, heroism and service to \nour great Nation have risen as qualities valued and held dearly in the \nhearts of all Americans, but the men and women of our armed forces are \nno strangers to these qualities. Our American servicemen and women were \nnot introduced to the concepts of bravery, sacrifice, and patriotism on \nSeptember 11. The men and women of our armed forces have dedicated \ntheir lives to serving this great country since its conception, and I \nrise today to honor some of this country's greatest servants.\n  In August, 1942, the United States Marines conduct a combat raid on \nJapanese forces on Makin Atoll in the Gilbert Islands. On August 17 and \n18, 1942, these Marines raided Butaritari Island, in the Makin Atoll. \nThese men were members of the 2nd Raider Battalion, a Marine unit \ntrained to conduct guerrilla-style attacks behind enemy lines. The unit \nwas led by Lieutenant Colonel Evans Carlson; his second-in-command was \nMajor James Roosevelt, son of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The unit \ncame under heavy Japanese resistance, and during the two-day battle, \nthe Raiders killed 83 Japanese soldiers. However, because of weather, \nwere unable to evacuate the bodies of their fallen comrades. The \nremains of these valiant men, known as Marine Raiders, were recovered \nand brought home to a grateful nation, at long last, in 1999. A funeral \nceremony was held in August 2001 for nineteen of these brave men.\n  As Americans, we have become accustomed to the risks and losses \nincurred while defending the great American principles of democracy, \nliberty, and patriotism. Our strength and spirit continue to prevail, \nand our continuing efforts to honor those who make the ultimate \nsacrifice in maintaining America's freedom, must not be lost upon the \nMarine Raiders. The bravery and heroism of these men has gone unsung \nfor almost sixty years, and the time has come now to honor the Marine \nRaiders by establishing a monument in Arlington National Cemetery.\n  This site would respectfully honor the Marine Raiders with a monument \nestablished at a point next to the Challenger Monument. Such \nrecognition will demonstrate to our country and to the world that \nAmerica will never leave any of our fallen servicemen and women behind, \neither in memory or geographic location, and will bring them home to \nthe American soil they perished defending.\n  As a former Marine, I am proud to have served this great Nation. The \ncall to service as a member of the armed forces is a strong and noble \ncall. In light of the recent attacks upon America, we remain united in \na common vow to never forget those make the ultimate sacrifice in \nprotecting the liberty we as Americans hold so precious. We, as Members \nof Congress and as citizens of this country, must remain united in \nfulfilling this promise to those who make that sacrifice today and \ntomorrow, without forgetting the men and women who made it yesterday, \nand in every war of America's past. We owe these heroes the honor of \nremembrance, both for the liberty we enjoy today and our freedom \ntomorrow.\n  Honoring the Marine Raiders presents us the unique opportunity to \npresent to the world the love and respect we have for our fallen \nwarriors. With the challenges of war looming for our servicemen and \nwomen today, this demonstration of respect seems particularly \nappropriate. I ask my colleagues to join Senator Inouye and me in \nhonoring these men, and their sacrifice, with a memorial in Arlington \nCemetery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/06/06/senate-section/article/S5214-1", "month": "06", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5214-S5215]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3767.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Financial investment in passenger rail infrastructure \n     is critical, and Federal leadership is required to address \n     the needs of a reliable safe, secure passenger rail network, \n     just as has been used in establishing the interstate highway \n     system and the Federal aviation network.\n       (2) Lack of investment and attention to the needs of \n     passenger rail infrastructure has resulted in a weak \n     passenger rail network, and has caused a strain on the \n     capacity of other modes of transportation in many areas of \n     the country. According to the Department of Transportation, \n     in 1999 the cost of wasted time and extra fuel consumption \n     due to delays on congested roads was estimated at $78 \n     billion.\n       (3) Passenger rail is an integral part of the United States \n     transportation system, and, as can be evidenced in the \n     Northeast Corridor, relieves the pressures of congestion on \n     highways and at airports, and creates a more balanced system \n     of transportation alternatives.\n       (4) Passenger rail service has been a vital instrument in \n     the transportation needs of our nation. For instance, during \n     World War II, the privately owned, operated, and constructed \n     railroad industry transported 90 percent of all defense \n     freight, and 97 percent of all defense personnel transported \n     to points of embarkation for theaters of action. By the end \n     of the war, railroads accounted for three quarters of the \n     share of the common carrier share of intercity traffic, with \n     airplanes and buses sharing the remaining quarter of traffic.\n       (5) Significant attention and Federal funding were required \n     to construct the Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense \n     Highways. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 established a \n     Highway Trust Fund based upon Federal user taxes in order to \n     finance up to 90 percent of the costs of the $25 billion \n     dollar highway construction plan.\n       (6) Federal policies with respect to investment in aviation \n     resulted in a strengthened aviation industry and the rapid \n     development of air passenger service, and by the late 1960's \n     most rail companies were petitioning the government to \n     discontinue passenger services because of losses.\n       (7) Amtrak was established in 1971 by the Rail Passenger \n     Service Act of 1970 to provide passenger rail services in the \n     United States as a public service; at the time of Amtrak's \n     formation, freight railroads were losing money on \n     unprofitable passenger rail operations. Since 1971 Amtrak has \n     received only $25 billion in public subsidies; during that \n     period, the United States invested over $570 billion on \n     highways and aviation.\n       (8) The Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997, and \n     preceding statutes, resulted in creating conflicting missions \n     for the National Railroad Passenger Corporation of both \n     serving a public function by operating unprofitable long-\n     distance routes while also attempting to operate at a profit. \n     This policy has also restricted Amtrak's profit potential on \n     the Northeast Corridor by limiting the capital expenditures \n     to help defray other costs.\n       (9) Due to a lack of capital investment, the Northeast \n     Corridor has accumulated a backlog of repair needs, including \n     life safety and security needs. Investment in the capital \n     needs of the Northeast Corridor would result in capacity \n     improvements which would result in greater utilization of the \n     existing infrastructure.\n       (10) The Department of Transportation Inspector General's \n     2001 Assessment of Amtrak's Financial Performance and \n     Requirements (Report # CR-2002-075) found that Amtrak's lack \n     of available capital has impeded its efforts to achieve \n     financial goals.\n       (11) In order to attempt to meet the mandate of the Amtrak \n     Reform and Accountability Act of 1997, Amtrak has been forced \n     to delay capital improvement projects and other projects \n     which would produce long-term benefits.\n       (12) The Department of Transportation Inspector General's \n     2001 Assessment of Amtrak's Financial Performance and \n     Requirements (Report #CR-2002-075) found that Amtrak's most \n     profitable operations are on the Northeast Corridor, where \n     Federal investment in passenger rail infrastructure has been \n     significantly higher than anywhere else in the country.\n       (13) Federal investments in capital projects to support \n     passenger rail in areas other than the Northeast Corridor \n     would result in improved service and increase profitability.\n       (14) The need for a balanced interstate and international \n     transportation system that provides a viable alternative to \n     travel by private automobile or commercial aircraft is \n     particularly evident after the events of September 11, 2001.\n       (15) As a matter of national security, a strong passenger \n     rail network would provide travelers an alternative to \n     highway and air travel, which could lead to reduced United \n     States reliance on foreign oil imports.\n       (16) In fiscal year 2001, the United States spent less than \n     1 percent of all transportation modal spending on intercity \n     passenger rail, and since 1998 Amtrak has received only $2.8 \n     billion of the $5.3 billion it has been authorized to receive \n     by Congress.\n       (17) Passenger rail in the United States has no stable \n     funding source, in contrast to highways, aviation, and \n     transit.\n       (18) Per capita spending on passenger rail is much higher \n     in other countries than the United States and, in fact, the \n     United States ranks behind other countries including Canada, \n     Japan, France, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Austria, \n     Switzerland, Belgium, Sweden, Luxembourg, Denmark, Ireland, \n     Norway, the Czech Republic, Finland, Slovakia, Portugal, \n     Poland, South Africa, Greece, and Estonia.\n       (19) The United States needs to engage in long-term \n     planning to foster and address future passenger \n     transportation growth and show forethought regarding \n     transportation solutions rather than be forced to act due to \n     an impending crisis.\n       (20) It is in the national interest to preserve passenger \n     rail service in the United States and to maintain the \n     solvency of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation.\n       (21) Long-term planning and support for passenger rail will \n     help offset the emerging problems created by transportation \n     congestion, and contribute to a cleaner and more \n     environmentally-friendly transportation system.\n       (22) A comprehensive re-evaluation of our nation's rail \n     passenger policy is required and a clearly defined role for \n     Amtrak and a connected rail passenger network must be \n     established.\n       (23) The Federal government must take the primary \n     responsibility for developing national railroad passenger \n     transportation infrastructure, and help ensure that it \n     functions as an efficient network. Privatization of the rail \n     passenger industry in Great Britain has been disastrous and \n     passenger service has suffered overall.\n       (24) The nation should be afforded the opportunity to \n     receive safe, efficient, and cost-effective rail passenger \n     services, taking into account all benefits to the nation as a \n     whole.\n\n                 TITLE I--RAIL TRANSPORTATION SECURITY\n\n     SEC. 101.

RAILWAY-HIGHWAY CROSSINGS IN HIGH-SPEED RAIL \n                   CORRIDORS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The entire cost of construction of \n     projects for the elimination of hazards of railway-highway \n     crossings in designated high-speed rail corridors, including \n     the separation or protection of grades at crossings, the \n     reconstruction of existing railroad grade crossing \n     structures, and the relocation of highways to eliminate grade \n     crossings, may be paid from sums authorized by subsection \n     (k). In any case when the elimination of the hazards of a \n     railway-highway crossing can be effected by the relocation of \n     a portion of a railway at a cost estimated by the Secretary \n     of Transportation to be less than the cost of such \n     elimination by one of the methods mentioned in the first \n     sentence of this section, then the entire cost of such \n     relocation project may be paid from sums authorized by \n     subsection (k).\n       (b) Classification of Projects.--The Secretary may classify \n     the various types of projects involved in the elimination of \n     hazards of high-speed rail corridor railway-highway \n     crossings, and may set for each such classification a \n     percentage of the costs of construction which shall be deemed \n     to represent the net benefit to the railroad or railroads for \n     the purpose of determining the railroad's share of the cost \n     of construction. The percentage so determined shall in no \n     case exceed 10 per cent of such costs. The Secretary shall \n     determine the appropriate classification of each project.\n       (c) Liability of Railroad.--Any railroad involved in a \n     project for the elimination of hazards of railway-highway \n     crossings paid for in whole or in part from sums made \n     available under this section shall be liable to the United \n     States for the net benefit to the railroad determined under \n     the classification of such project made under subsection (b). \n     That liability to the United States may be discharged by \n     direct payment to the State transportation department of the \n     State in which the project is located, in which case such \n     payment shall be credited to the cost of the project. The \n     payment may consist in whole or in part of materials and \n     labor furnished by the railroad in connection with the \n     construction of the project. If any such railroad fails to \n     discharge such liability within a 6-month period after \n     completion of the project, it shall be liable to the United \n     States for its share of the cost, and the Secretary shall \n     request the Attorney General to institute proceedings against \n     such railroad for the recovery of the amount for which it is \n     liable under this subsection. The Attorney General is \n     authorized to bring such proceedings on behalf of the United \n     States, in the appropriate district court of the United \n     States, and the United States shall be entitled in such \n     proceedings to recover such sums as it is considered and \n     adjudged by the court that such railroad is liable for in the \n     premises. Any amounts recovered by the United States under \n     this subsection shall be credited to miscellaneous receipts.\n       (d) Survey and Schedule of Projects.--Each State shall \n     conduct and systematically maintain a survey of all high-\n     speed rail corridor railway-highway crossings to identify \n     those railroad crossings which may require separation, \n     relocation, or protective devices, and establish and \n     implement a schedule of projects for this purpose.\n       (e) Funds for Protective Devices.--The Secretary shall give \n     priority under this section to the elimination of high-speed \n     rail corridor railway-highway grade crossings, but shall make \n     funds authorized for obligation or expenditure under this \n     section available for the installation of protective devices \n     at high-speed rail corridor railway-highway crossings where \n     appropriate.\n       (f) Apportionment.--The Secretary shall apportion funds \n     available for obligation and expenditure under this section \n     between high-speed rail corridor railway-highway crossings on \n     the Northeast Corridor and such crossings outside the \n     Northeast Corridor in an equitable fashion, taking into \n     account traffic volume, traffic patterns, frequency of \n     trains, adequacy of existing hazard warnings, and such other \n     factors as the Secretary deems appropriate.\n       (g) Annual Report.--The Secretary shall report to the \n     Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and \n     the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure not later than December 30 of each year on the \n     progress being made to implement the railway-highway \n     crossings program authorized by this section and the \n     effectiveness of such improvements. Each report shall contain \n     an assessment of the costs of the various treatments employed \n     and subsequent accident experience at improved locations. The \n     report shall include--\n       (1) the number of projects undertaken, their distribution \n     by cost range, road system, nature of treatment, and \n     subsequent accident experience at improved locations;\n       (2) an analysis and evaluation of the program activities in \n     each State, including identification of any State found not \n     to be in compliance with the schedule of improvements \n     required by subsection (d); and\n       (3) recommendations for future implementation of the \n     railway-highway crossings program under this section and \n     section 130 of title 23, United States Code.\n       (h) Use of Funds for Matching.--Funds authorized to be \n     appropriated to carry out this section may be used to provide \n     a local government with funds to be used on a matching basis \n     when State funds are available which may only be spent when \n     the local government produces matching funds for the \n     improvement of railway-highway crossings.\n       (i) Incentive Payments for At-grade Crossing Closures.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     this section and subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), the \n     Secretary may make incentive payments to a local government \n     upon the permanent closure by such government of public at-\n     grade high-speed rail corridor railway-highway crossings \n     under its jurisdiction.\n       (2) Incentive payments by railroads.--The Secretary may not \n     make an incentive payment under paragraph (1) to a local \n     government with respect to the closure of a crossing unless \n     the railroad owning the tracks on which the crossing is \n     located makes an incentive payment to the government with \n     respect to the closure.\n       (3) Amount of Federal incentive payment.--The amount of the \n     incentive payment payable to a local government under \n     paragraph (1) with respect to a crossing may not exceed the \n     lesser of--\n       (A) the amount of the incentive payment paid to the \n     government with respect to the crossing by the railroad \n     concerned under paragraph (2); or\n       (B) $ 7,500.\n       (j) Coordination with Title 23 Program.--In carrying out \n     this section, the Secretary shall--\n       (1) implement this section in accordance with the \n     classification of projects and railroad share of the cost as \n     provided in section 646.210 of title 23, Code of Federal \n     Regulations; and\n       (2) coordinate the administration of this section with the \n     program established by section 130 of title 23, United States \n     Code, in order to avoid duplication of effort and to ensure \n     the effectiveness of both programs.\n       (k) Funding.--Not less than 10 percent of the amounts \n     appropriated for each fiscal year to carry out section 26101A \n     shall be obligated or expended to carry out this section.\n\n     SEC. 207.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Financial investment in passenger rail infrastructure \n     is critical, and Federal leadership is required to address \n     the needs of a reliable safe, secure passenger rail network, \n     just as has been used in establishing the interstate highway \n     system and the Federal aviation network.\n       (2) Lack of investment and attention to the needs of \n     passenger rail infrastructure has resulted in a weak \n     passenger rail network, and has caused a strain on the \n     capacity of other modes of transportation in many areas of \n     the country. According to the Department of Transportation, \n     in 1999 the cost of wasted time and extra fuel consumption \n     due to delays on congested roads was estimated at $78 \n     billion.\n       (3) Passenger rail is an integral part of the United States \n     transportation system, and, as can be evidenced in the \n     Northeast Corridor, relieves the pressures of congestion on \n     highways and at airports, and creates a more balanced system \n     of transportation alternatives.\n       (4) Passenger rail service has been a vital instrument in \n     the transportation needs of our nation. For instance, during \n     World War II, the privately owned, operated, and constructed \n     railroad industry transported 90 percent of all defense \n     freight, and 97 percent of all defense personnel transported \n     to points of embarkation for theaters of action. By the end \n     of the war, railroads accounted for three quarters of the \n     share of the common carrier share of intercity traffic, with \n     airplanes and buses sharing the remaining quarter of traffic.\n       (5) Significant attention and Federal funding were required \n     to construct the Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense \n     Highways. The Federal Aid Highway Act of 1956 established a \n     Highway Trust Fund based upon Federal user taxes in order to \n     finance up to 90 percent of the costs of the $25 billion \n     dollar highway construction plan.\n       (6) Federal policies with respect to investment in aviation \n     resulted in a strengthened aviation industry and the rapid \n     development of air passenger service, and by the late 1960's \n     most rail companies were petitioning the government to \n     discontinue passenger services because of losses.\n       (7) Amtrak was established in 1971 by the Rail Passenger \n     Service Act of 1970 to provide passenger rail services in the \n     United States as a public service; at the time of Amtrak's \n     formation, freight railroads were losing money on \n     unprofitable passenger rail operations. Since 1971 Amtrak has \n     received only $25 billion in public subsidies; during that \n     period, the United States invested over $570 billion on \n     highways and aviation.\n       (8) The Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997, and \n     preceding statutes, resulted in creating conflicting missions \n     for the National Railroad Passenger Corporation of both \n     serving a public function by operating unprofitable long-\n     distance routes while also attempting to operate at a profit. \n     This policy has also restricted Amtrak's profit potential on \n     the Northeast Corridor by limiting the capital expenditures \n     to help defray other costs.\n       (9) Due to a lack of capital investment, the Northeast \n     Corridor has accumulated a backlog of repair needs, including \n     life safety and security needs. Investment in the capital \n     needs of the Northeast Corridor would result in capacity \n     improvements which would result in greater utilization of the \n     existing infrastructure.\n       (10) The Department of Transportation Inspector General's \n     2001 Assessment of Amtrak's Financial Performance and \n     Requirements (Report # CR-2002-075) found that Amtrak's lack \n     of available capital has impeded its efforts to achieve \n     financial goals.\n       (11) In order to attempt to meet the mandate of the Amtrak \n     Reform and Accountability Act of 1997, Amtrak has been forced \n     to delay capital improvement projects and other projects \n     which would produce long-term benefits.\n       (12) The Department of Transportation Inspector General's \n     2001 Assessment of Amtrak's Financial Performance and \n     Requirements (Report #CR-2002-075) found that Amtrak's most \n     profitable operations are on the Northeast Corridor, where \n     Federal investment in passenger rail infrastructure has been \n     significantly higher than anywhere else in the country.\n       (13) Federal investments in capital projects to support \n     passenger rail in areas other than the Northeast Corridor \n     would result in improved service and increase profitability.\n       (14) The need for a balanced interstate and international \n     transportation system that provides a viable alternative to \n     travel by private automobile or commercial aircraft is \n     particularly evident after the events of September 11, 2001.\n       (15) As a matter of national security, a strong passenger \n     rail network would provide travelers an alternative to \n     highway and air travel, which could lead to reduced United \n     States reliance on foreign oil imports.\n       (16) In fiscal year 2001, the United States spent less than \n     1 percent of all transportation modal spending on intercity \n     passenger rail, and since 1998 Amtrak has received only $2.8 \n     billion of the $5.3 billion it has been authorized to receive \n     by Congress.\n       (17) Passenger rail in the United States has no stable \n     funding source, in contrast to highways, aviation, and \n     transit.\n       (18) Per capita spending on passenger rail is much higher \n     in other countries than the United States and, in fact, the \n     United States ranks behind other countries including Canada, \n     Japan, France, Great Britain, Italy, Spain, Austria, \n     Switzerland, Belgium, Sweden, Luxembourg, Denmark, Ireland, \n     Norway, the Czech Republic, Finland, Slovakia, Portugal, \n     Poland, South Africa, Greece, and Estonia.\n       (19) The United States needs to engage in long-term \n     planning to foster and address future passenger \n     transportation growth and show forethought regarding \n     transportation\n\n[[Page S5233]]\n\n     solutions rather than be forced to act due to an impending \n     crisis.\n       (20) It is in the national interest to preserve passenger \n     rail service in the United States and to maintain the \n     solvency of the National Railroad Passenger Corporation.\n       (21) Long-term planning and support for passenger rail will \n     help offset the emerging problems created by transportation \n     congestion, and contribute to a cleaner and more \n     environmentally-friendly transportation system.\n       (22) A comprehensive re-evaluation of our nation's rail \n     passenger policy is required and a clearly defined role for \n     Amtrak and a connected rail passenger network must be \n     established.\n       (23) The Federal government must take the primary \n     responsibility for developing national railroad passenger \n     transportation infrastructure, and help ensure that it \n     functions as an efficient network. Privatization of the rail \n     passenger industry in Great Britain has been disastrous and \n     passenger service has suffered overall.\n       (24) The nation should be afforded the opportunity to \n     receive safe, efficient, and cost-effective rail passenger \n     services, taking into account all benefits to the nation as a \n     whole.\n\n                 TITLE I--RAIL TRANSPORTATION SECURITY\n\n     SEC. 101.
