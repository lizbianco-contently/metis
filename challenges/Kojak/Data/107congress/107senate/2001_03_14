Mr. President, the issue the Senate is debating is \nbankruptcy. We will also be dealing with education, and we will be \ndealing with the budget.\n  Somewhat overlying all these issues is the idea of tax relief, of \ndoing something with the tax burden of American citizens, coming to \nsome agreement on how that can indeed be done with some of our \nassociates to come to the conclusion that, in fact, taxpayers are \nentitled to some relief in their taxes, if indeed those taxes exceed \nthe needs of the Federal Government.\n  It has been, of course, the highest priority for this administration, \nthe highest priority for President Bush, as he has outlined his plan in \nhis campaign and has brought it forth as a specific proposal to the \nCongress. The House has acted on a portion of it at this point. I \nhappen to believe it is reasonable for the Senate to hold off a bit in \nterms of acting on it until we have seen our budget. That is \nappropriate.\n  We need to try as much as we can to get people to understand what is \nout there. There are all kinds of notions being thrown about. What we \nneed to do is to try to get it as accurate as we can so people can, \nindeed, make their decisions.\n\n[[Page S2270]]\n\n  Some are concerned about the idea that you have to project revenues \ninto the future. Of course, there is some uncertainty. We don't know \nexactly what will happen. In anything you do, whether it is an \norganization, whether it is a business, whether, indeed, it is your \nfamily, as you take into account longer term expenditures, one has to \nreach out and make an estimate as to what they think the revenues are \ngoing to be. That is not unusual. We have the best people who have made \nprognostications in the past doing that.\n  Under the budget, receipts grow from $2.1 trillion in 2001 to $3.2 \ntrillion in 2011, an increase of 51 percent. Overall, the budget \nprojection totals collections of almost $30 trillion over the next 10 \nyears. Despite the fact that to all of us, I assume, $1.6 trillion is \nan almost unimaginable amount, it is, indeed, a little less than 6 \npercent of the total projected revenues. When you put it into the \ncontext of what we are talking about, it becomes a reasonable proposal.\n  I imagine probably more important than anything is that we have to \ntake a look at the fact that we do have a surplus. Frankly, when we do \nhave a surplus, we find, if we ask people, how much more involvement of \nthe Federal Government, how much growth of the Federal Government do \nyou want over here, they would say: We have about enough growth. We \nhave about enough Government. But then over here you have a surplus so \nevery expenditure that anyone has ever had in mind suddenly becomes a \npossibility, and we find ourselves then with growth beyond what most \npeople would want to have.\n  The American people are paying a record level of taxation, over 20.5 \npercent of the gross domestic product. That is the highest it has been \nsince World War II. The individual burden has doubled since the Clinton \ntax increases of 1993. All this points toward doing something \nmeaningful in terms of tax reduction. The cut would be $1.6 trillion; \nthat would be left in the pockets of taxpayers.\n  We hear all kinds of notions that it is actually going to be $2.2 \ntrillion or whatever. That is not the case. It is aimed towards being \n$1.6 trillion, and that is where it would be.\n  There is tax relief for all taxpayers. We can get into, obviously, a \ndiscussion of the fact that there are people who don't pay income taxes \nwho will not have relief from income tax reduction. That is fairly \nreasonable.\n  Everyone who pays taxes will get some relief. A typical family of \nfour will see their tax liabilities reduced by $1,600, which is a \nsizable amount.\n  The other part of the equation is that there are moneys to strengthen \neducation. There are moneys to help with defense and security. Those \nare a couple of the top priorities we have. We will do more with \nMedicare. Those dollars will be there for Medicare. Those dollars will \nbe there for Social Security.\n  I hope people understand the whole package. It sometimes is made to \nsound as though, if we give those taxpayers a break, we will not be \nable to do the things we should. Not true. There will be dollars to do \nthe things the Federal Government has as priorities. There will be \ndollars to reduce the debt, and, in fact, all of the reducible debt \nwill be done by 2010. That will not be all of it because much of it is \nlong term and, frankly, people who hold the certificates are not ready \nto do that.\n  It is something on which we need to continue to work. I think it is a \ngood thing for the country. It is a good thing for the taxpayers. \nCertainly, it is something I support, and I hope others support. I see \nmy friend from Missouri.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we Americans take pride in our freedom \nand independence. Central to our sense of who we are is our firm belief \nthat we are free to walk the paths of our own choosing, free to move \nabout as we please, free from the intrusion of the government in that \nmovement.\n  As Thomas Jefferson wrote in his Draft of Instructions to the \nVirginia Delegates in the Continental Congress, ``The God who gave us \nlife, gave us liberty at the same time.''\n  From the start, immigrants came to these shores to escape the state's \nintrusion into their lives. When in the early 1600's, the English \ngovernment began arresting Separatists for their religious practices, \nabout a hundred of them became the Pilgrims and sailed to Plymouth. \nWhen in 1620 the Parliament enacted a law requiring all to worship \naccording to the laws of the Church of England, the Puritans came to \nMassachusetts, the Quakers came to New Jersey and then Pennsylvania, \nand Catholics came to Maryland.\n  When, in 1636, Roger Williams sought freedom from the intrusions of \nthe Massachusetts colony into religious practices, he founded Rhode \nIsland. And two decades later, Jews fleeing the persecutions of \nnumerous states settled there in Newport.\n  Even separated by the Atlantic Ocean, however, the American colonists \ncontinued to chafe at the intrusion of the British government into \ntheir lives. Among the colonists' foremost grievances was the manner in \nwhich the British government harassed and searched Americans without \nreason or probable cause. The British government did so under color of \ngeneral warrants known as ``writs of assistance,'' which gave British \ncustoms officers blanket authority to search where they pleased for \ngoods imported in violation of British tax laws.\n  This harassment by the state's officers helped to spark the American \nRevolution. In 1761, the Massachusetts patriot James Otis attacked the \nwrits and their use to hound American colonists as, he said, ``the \nworst instrument of arbitrary power, the most destructive of English \nliberty, and the fundamental principles of law, that ever was found in \nan English law book,'' because, in Otis' words, they placed ``the \nliberty of every man in the hands of every petty officer.''\n  Otis' argument did much to sow the seeds of America's Declaration of \nIndependence. ``Then and there,'' said John Adams, ``then and there was \nthe first scene of the first act of opposition to the arbitrary claims \nof Great Britain. Then and there the child Independence was born.''\n  The Supreme Court later wrote: ``Vivid in the memory of the newly \nindependent Americans were those general warrants known as writs of \nassistance under which officers of the Crown had so bedeviled the \ncolonists.'' And in another case, the Court wrote: ``It is familiar \nhistory that indiscriminate searches and seizures conducted under the \nauthority of `general warrants' were the immediate evils that motivated \nthe framing and adoption of the Fourth Amendment.''\n  That Amendment states:\n\n       The right of the people to be secure in their persons, \n     houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches \n     and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall \n     issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or \n     affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be \n     searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\n  Early on, Chief Justice Marshall assumed that the Fourth Amendment \nwas intended to protect against arbitrary arrests. And that position \nhas become settled law. More recently, the Supreme Court has said:\n\n       Unreasonable searches or seizures conducted without any \n     warrant at all are condemned by the plain language of the \n     first clause of the Amendment.'' The Court went on to state \n     that ``the warrantless arrest of a\n\n[[Page S2271]]\n\n     person is a species of seizure required by the Amendment to \n     be reasonable.\n\n  It is thus fundamental to American history and rooted in American law \nthat the officers of the state may not arrest or detain its citizens \narbitrarily or without cause. Our law and Constitution protect our \nfreedom to walk those paths of our own choosing, free from the \nintrusion of the government as we walk.\n  And it is that very individual freedom that gives our great Nation \nits strength. As John Quincy Adams wrote: ``Individual liberty is \nindividual power, and as the power of a community is a mass compounded \nof individual powers, the nation which enjoys the most freedom must \nnecessarily be in proportion to its numbers the most powerful nation.''\n  The point of my comments today is this is not the case for all \nAmericans.\n  But, some Americans still cannot walk where they choose. Some \nAmericans cannot travel free from the harassment of the government. \nSome Americans still do not receive the full benefit of their civil \nrights.\n  Too many Americans are subject to being detained by officers of the \nstate without reasonable suspicion, without good reason, for no other \nreason than the color of their skin.\n  As I noted at the outset of my remarks, many came to these shores as \nimmigrants to escape the intrusive state. We must not forget that many \nalso came to these shores in chains, because of the color of their \nskin. They and their decendents endured our Nation's long struggle \nagainst slavery and discrimination.\n  Sadly, even now, skin color alone still makes too many Americans more \nlikely to be a suspect, more likely to be stopped, more likely to be \nsearched, more likely to be arrested, and more likely to be imprisoned.\n  The numbers alone are devastating: A 1999 ACLU report found that \nalong Interstate 95 in Maryland, while African-Americans were only 17 \npercent of the drivers and traffic violators, African-Americans \naccounted for an alarming 73 percent of the drivers searched.\n  Last November, a front-page New York Times story reported that New \nJersey state documents acknowledged that at least 8 of every 10 \nautomobile searches carried out by state troopers on the New Jersey \nTurnpike over most of the last decade were conducted on vehicles driven \nby African-Americans and Hispanics.\n  Racial profiling is not limited to I-95. The Justice Department has \nrecently been investigating 14 police departments for civil rights \nviolations, including Charleston, West Virginia; Riverside, California; \nOrange County, Florida; Prince George's County, Maryland; Eastpointe, \nMichigan; New Orleans; Buffalo; Washington; and New York City. In Los \nAngeles, the Justice Department recently forced the police department \nto accept an independent monitor's supervision after a 4-year \ninvestigation of police abuse in the city's largely minority Rampart \nsection.\n  The practice of racial profiling has not respected status or \nstanding, wealth or privilege.\n  Last September, the Director of Personnel at the White House, Bob \nNash, and his wife were stopped for no other apparent reason than that \nthey are African-American. As Mr. Nash said at the time:\n\n       Until that moment, we had an intellectual understanding of \n     the bogus crime, ``Driving While Black.'' But, in a few \n     terrifying moments, we felt it more deeply and more \n     personally than any words could ever convey. Said Nash, the \n     experience left them embarrassed, humiliated and afraid for \n     our lives.\n\n  The Houston Chronicle reported that last year the Border Patrol \npulled over and questioned United States District Judge Filemon Vela \ntraveling to court--not once but twice--as part of an immigration \ncrackdown in South Texas, called Operation Rio Grande.\n  Last November, the well-known singer Lenny Kravitz was handcuffed and \ndetained by Miami Beach police. Mr. Kravitz, whose 1989 song ``Mr. Cab \nDriver'' speaks out against racial profiling, appears to have fallen \nvictim to it himself. Said Kravitz:\n\n       I was very concerned and upset. Being black, I've dealt \n     with all kinds of things because of my color, but nothing \n     like this.\n\n  Last month, 60 Minutes aired the story of Harvard law student Bryonn \nBain, who appears to have been the victim of ``walking while black.'' \nHe was stopped by police while simply walking down the street. In an \narticle in the May 2, 2000, Village Voice, Bain said:\n\n       After hundreds of hours and thousands of pages of legal \n     theory in law school, I have finally had my first real lesson \n     in the Law.\n\n  Said Bain:\n\n       The lesson for the day was that there is a special Bill of \n     Rights for nonwhite people in the United States--one that \n     applies with particular severity to Black men. It has never \n     had to be ratified by Congress because--in the hearts of \n     those with the power to enforce it--the Black Bill of Rights \n     is held to be self-evident.\n\n  Plainly, the practice of racial profiling is profoundly at variance \nwith the fundamental tradition of American law and justice.\n  In 1790, President George Washington wrote the congregation of Touro \nSynagogue in Newport, Rhode Island, in words that are etched in the \nHolocaust Memorial Museum in Washington:\n\n       The government of the United States . . . gives to bigotry \n     no sanction, to persecution no assistance.\n\n  But what other than ``bigotry'' and ``persecution'' can we call this \npractice of ``racial profiling,'' which targets drivers, airline \npassengers, or pedestrians, not because of any action they take, not \nbecause of any probable cause, but solely because of the color of their \nskin. Too many law enforcement entities have made a crime out of DWB--\n``Driving While Black.''\n  Among the many corrosive effects of this insidious practice is the \nway it undermines the willingness of good people to work with the \npolice. As one victim of racial profiling in Glencoe, Illinois, said:\n\n       Who is there left to protect us? The police just violated \n     us.\n\n  As the U.S. Civil Rights Commission found last year:\n\n       Communities of color do not want to choose between safety \n     and civil rights.\n\n  They should not have to.\n  We as a Nation cannot and should not tolerate this injustice. As the \nphilosopher Herbert Spencer wrote:\n\n       No one can be perfectly free till all are free.\n\n  And as Woodrow Wilson said:\n\n       Liberty does not consist . . . in mere general declarations \n     of the rights of man. It consists in the translation of those \n     declarations into definite action.\n\n  Many leaders have spoken out against this intolerable abuse. Many \nhave worked to translate the traditions of American law and justice \ninto legislation to address this evil.\n  First and foremost is our colleague in the other body, Representative \nJohn Conyers. Representative John Conyers has been at the forefront of \nlegislative efforts on this subject. We have worked together on \nlegislation focused on a study of traffic stop data. Shortly, \nCongressman Conyers and I will introduce, along with many of our \ncolleagues, an improved version of that bill.\n  Last Congress and this Congress, I have been proud to cosponsor a \nbill introduced by my friend and colleague from Illinois, Senator \nDurbin, that focuses on ``flying while Black''--the practice of \ntargeting people of color to be stopped and searched in airports. \nSenator Durbin has provided valuable leadership on this issue.\n\n  Let me take a moment to notice the very intense and sincere efforts \nof a new colleague of ours, Senator Jon Corzine, of New Jersey, who has \nmade addressing this racial profiling issue one of his top priorities. \nI very much look forward to working with the new Senator from New \nJersey on this issue.\n  Leaders of both parties have expressed support for doing something \nabout racial profiling.\n  During the second Presidential debate, on October 11 of last year, \nthen-Governor Bush said that he would support or sign as President a \nfederal law banning racial profiling by police and other authorities at \nall levels of government.\n  Governor Bush said:\n\n       I can't imagine what it would be like to be singled out \n     because of race and stopped and harassed. That's just flat \n     wrong, and that's not what America's all about. And so we \n     ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling.\n\n  Governor Bush went on:\n\n       I do think we need to find out where racial profiling \n     occurs and do something about it. And say to the local folks, \n     get it done, and if you can't, there'll be a federal \n     consequence.\n\n  He further said:\n\n       [R]acial profiling isn't just an issue at the local police \n     forces. It's an issue throughout\n\n[[Page S2272]]\n\n     our society. And as we become a diverse society, we're going \n     to have to deal with it more and more.\n       I believe, sure as I'm sitting here, that most Americans \n     really care. They're tolerant people. They're good, tolerant \n     people. It's the very few that create most of the crisis. And \n     we just happen to have to find them and deal with them.\n\n  On February 9 of this year, at remarks marking Black History Month, \nPresident Bush said that he would ``look at all opportunities'' to end \nracial profiling. While visiting a predominantly African-American \nelementary school here in Washington, D.C., President Bush said:\n\n       I'll look at all opportunities, starting with the gathering \n     of information where the federal government can help \n     jurisdictions gather information, compile information, to get \n     the facts on the table to make sure people are treated fairly \n     in the justice system.\n\n  And in his State of the Union Address two weeks ago, the President \naddressed the issue again. There, he said:\n\n       As government promotes compassion, it also must promote \n     justice. Too many of our citizens have cause to doubt our \n     nation's justice when the law points a finger of suspicion at \n     groups instead of individuals. All our citizens are created \n     equal and must be treated equally. Earlier today, I asked \n     John Ashcroft, the Attorney General, to develop specific \n     recommendations to end racial profiling. It's wrong, and we \n     will end it in America.\n\n  I certainly welcome our new President's comments.\n  Attorney General Ashcroft has also stated that racial profiling will \nbe a priority in his Department of Justice. At his confirmation hearing \non January 17, Senator Ashcroft said:\n\n       I think racial profiling is wrong. I think it's \n     unconstitutional. I think it violates the 14th Amendment. I \n     think most of the men and women in our law enforcement are \n     good people trying to enforce the law. I think we all share \n     that view. But we owe it to provide them with guidance to \n     ensure that racial profiling does not happen. I look forward \n     to working together with you to try to find a way to do that.\n\n  Senator Ashcroft summed up:\n\n       I will make racial profiling a priority of mine.\n\n  In a follow-up written question to that hearing, I asked Senator \nAshcroft whether his opposition to racial profiling included racial \nprofiling of airline passengers or people walking down the street. \nSenator Ashcroft replied:\n\n       I have stated my strong opposition to racial profiling \n     across the spectrum. There should be no loopholes or safe \n     harbors for racial profiling. Official discrimination of this \n     sort is wrong and unconstitutional no matter what the \n     context.\n\n  And two weeks ago, at an extensive statement and press conference on \nthe subject, Attorney General Ashcroft said:\n\n       I have long believed that to treat people solely on the \n     basis of their race was a violation of the 14th Amendment to \n     the U.S. Constitution.\n\n  He declared: ``It's wrong,'' and said:\n\n       I believe Congress can, and will, respond constructively.\n\n  Attorney General Ashcroft also sent a letter to the Chairmen and \nRanking Democratic Members of the Judiciary Committees on this subject, \nand I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that letter be printed in \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, Wisconsin's former Governor Tommy \nThompson, now Secretary of Health and Human Services, created a Task \nForce on Racial Profiling when he was Governor. That Task Force just \ncompleted its report, and concluded, among other things, that more data \nis needed, and recommended data collection. Congressman Conyers and our \nlegislation calls for data collection, among other things.\n  I am pleased that the President and Members of his Cabinet recognize \nthe gravity of this issue for all Americans. Particularly in the wake \nof the racially divisive election and nomination of Attorney General \nAshcroft, the Administration needs to make special efforts to heal the \nwounds that separate us as a Nation. And with the support of the \nAdministration, we should be able to enact racial profiling legislation \nthis year.\n  But we should do more. Once again, I call on President Bush to \nresubmit the nomination of Judge Ronnie White to serve as a U.S. \nDistrict Court judge.\n  I also call on the President publicly to support the nomination of \nJudge Roger Gregory to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  These distinguished jurists deserve to sit on the Federal bench. And \nthe effective administration of justice in America demands that the \nFederal courts, even the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, reflect the \ndiversity of this Nation.\n  Let us do more to advance the cause of justice for all, and then we \ncan truly live out the ancient wisdom, inscribed on the Liberty Bell, \nand ``[p]roclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the \ninhabitants thereof.''\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                               Office of the Attorney General,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 28, 2001.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: As you know, I received a directive \n     from the President late yesterday asking me to work with \n     Congress to develop effective methods to determine the extent \n     to which law enforcement officers in the United States engage \n     in the practice of racial profiling. As you further know, \n     racial profiling is the use of race as a factor in conducting \n     stops, searches, and other investigative procedures. While we \n     all recognize that the overwhelming majority of law \n     enforcement officers perform their demanding jobs in an \n     outstanding manner, any practice of racial profiling, even by \n     a small minority, is unacceptable.\n       You may recall that during the hearing I held on the \n     subject last year as a Senator, I stated that racial \n     profiling, even if practiced only by a few, is extremely \n     problematic for two reasons. First, it undermines the public \n     trust in the impartiality of law enforcement officers which \n     is essential to effective law enforcement. Second, and more \n     importantly, I personally believe such a practice violates \n     the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to \n     the Constitution. I share the President's commitment to \n     ending any unequal treatment of Americans, particularly by \n     law enforcement.\n       To this end, I urge you in your capacity as Ranking Member \n     of the Judiciary Committee to consider quickly legislation \n     authorizing the Department of Justice to conduct a study of \n     traffic stops data that currently is being collected \n     voluntarily by law enforcement agencies across the country. \n     Such a study will assist us in determining the extent of the \n     problem of racial profiling.\n       The Traffic Stops Statistics Study Act introduced last \n     Congress by Congressman Conyers in the House, and proposed by \n     Senator Feingold in the Senate, is an excellent starting \n     place for such an enterprise. I would hope that any \n     legislation you consider makes clear that such information is \n     provided voluntarily, in order to quell any potential \n     federalism concerns. Such legislation ought to permit \n     consideration of broad categories of data, such as the \n     reasons and circumstances of any stop, the identifying \n     characteristics of the driver and passengers as perceived and \n     discernable by the officer making the stop, the \n     characteristics of the officer making the stop, the racial or \n     ethnic composition of the area in which the stop was made, \n     and any other data that will ensure as full a picture as \n     possible of these contacts, such as arrest and conviction \n     outcomes linked to traffic stops. In order to encourage \n     participation, the legislation hopefully will make clear that \n     the legislation will not change the burdens or standards of \n     proof in any lawsuits. The legislation, therefore, would lend \n     to a better study, by emphasizing the importance and \n     seriousness of the issue while, at the same time, encouraging \n     cooperation.\n       I am eager to begin work on this important task, and hope \n     that Congress will consider such legislation quickly. If \n     Congress is unable to authorize such a study in 6 months, I \n     will instruct the Department to begin promptly its own study \n     of available data. I look forward to working with you on this \n     important issue to ensure that all Americans are guaranteed \n     equal justice under law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John Ashcroft,\n                                                 Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/14/senate-section/article/S2272-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2272-S2273]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               BANKRUPTCY\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed to \nspeak as if in morning business for a few minutes on two amendments \nthat are pending to the bankruptcy bill-- amendments offered by Senator \nWyden and Senator Smith related to discharge of debts and prohibition \nof discharge of debts related to the California energy crisis.\n\n[[Page S2273]]\n\n  I oppose the Smith amendment to the underlying Wyden amendment, and I \nalso oppose the Wyden amendment.\n  In my view, both amendments are unfair in that they give an unfair \nadvantage to government agencies at the expense of private companies in \nthe event that California utilities wind up in bankruptcy. They ensure \nthat a large Federal utility like Bonneville, itself the beneficiary of \nbillions of dollars of Federal investment, and other utilities will be \npaid ahead of the banks, small renewable energy generators, natural gas \ncompanies, and other creditors.\n\n  Both amendments are not helpful in our current circumstance. The \nState of California and its utilities are trying desperately to keep \nthe utilities out of bankruptcy. Without these amendments, they stand a \ngood chance of succeeding. If the amendments are adopted, the utilities \nwill almost certainly be forced to declare bankruptcy.\n  I also oppose the amendments because, in my view, they are unwise. \nThe consequences of the three largest utilities in California going \nbankrupt are unknown, as is the rest of the State's economy and the \nrest of our Nation's economy. But it is clear that it will not just \naffect the ratepayers served by the three utilities, or even just the \npeople of California. It will affect all Americans. As Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, testified several weeks ago, ``it's \nscarcely credible that you can have a major economic problem in \nCalifornia which does not feed to the rest of the 49 States.''\n\n  In my view, the amendments are also unnecessary. If utilities are \nable to avoid bankruptcy, then the power suppliers that these \namendments seek to protect will be paid. Even if they go bankrupt, \nthose power suppliers stand a reasonably good chance of being paid--if \nnot by the utilities themselves, then by the government, for the \nreasons that Senator Murkowski explained last night on the Senate \nfloor.\n  In my view, the amendments are also unworkable. By trying to jump \ncertain creditors to the head of the line to receive payment, they will \nmost likely force the remaining creditors to move to put the utilities \ninto bankruptcy immediately so that the utilities' assets can be \ndivided immediately, 6 months before the amendments in fact take \neffect.\n  Even if the amendments are enacted, the generators would not likely \nreceive any benefit from the enactment of the amendments.\n  Finally, these amendments, in my view, are uncharitable in that the \nadministration has declared the California electric crisis to be \nCalifornia's problem, and has left it to California to solve the \nproblem. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is the \nindependent agency charged with seeing to it that electric rates are \njust and reasonable, has done little to help the situation. Governor \nDavis, and the State legislature in California, the utilities, and \ntheir creditors have been working valiantly in recent weeks, and even \nmonths, to fix this problem. All they are now asking of this Senate is \nthat we not intervene and send the utilities into bankruptcy by \nadopting amendments of this type.\n  In my view, Senators need to weigh the potential enormous harm to \nmillions of Americans that would result in the adoption of these \namendments against the illusory benefit that the amendments hold out \nfor the few generators that would be benefited.\n  In sum, to paraphrase Shakespeare, which is not done very often on \nthe Senate floor, adoption of the amendments will rob California of \nthat which cannot enrich the northwest generators and yet will make \nCalifornia poor, indeed.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I believe the unanimous consent order \nprovided 5 minutes for Senator Hagel to speak against the Wyden \namendment. Senator Hagel will not be able to be present, and I ask \nunanimous consent to use that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I thank the ranking member of the Energy Committee, the Senator from \nNew Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, for his remarks in opposition to the Wyden \namendment. I also wish to thank Senator Murkowski, the chairman, who \ncame to the floor last night and spoke against the amendment.\n  Last evening, I submitted for the Record several letters in \nopposition to the amendment from the Electric Power Supply Association, \nthe Edison Electric Institute, The Williams Companies, Calpine, Pacific \nGas and Electric, Southern California Edison, International Brotherhood \nof Electrical Workers, The Utility Reform Network, a consumer group, \nand the American Gas Association, all in strong opposition to the Wyden \namendment, and also with one general theme. That general theme is that \nif the Congress of the United States were to determine the order in \nwhich debts would be discharged, it would trigger a bankruptcy because \nthose who are not favored in that order would seek to protect their \nright by moving both Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California \nEdison into bankruptcy. Virtually every single letter reiterated that \nconcern.\n\n  I would like to reread from one of the letters so the Senate might \nunderstand the concern, and that is from the Electric Power Supply \nAssociation. That letter states:\n\n       We are writing to express our deep concern and opposition \n     to [the amendment]. Our fear is that this amendment could \n     precipitate a financial crisis and exacerbate the already \n     precarious situation in the West.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator suspend.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I will.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/14/senate-section/article/S2273-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2273-S2279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 2001--Resumed\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator now has 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair, and I would like to continue:\n\n       This amendment seeks to give certain entities a favorable \n     status in the event that California utilities fall into \n     bankruptcy.\n\n  That is what the Wyden amendment does.\n  The letter goes on:\n\n       Many companies have provided power to California's \n     consumers and [this association] believes emphatically that \n     all these entities deserve to be fully and fairly \n     compensated.\n\n  As do I, Mr. President.\n\n       However, it is inappropriate for the Senate to try and \n     create winners and losers in this desperate situation. Rather \n     than orderly resolution, this legislation could lead to a \n     premature declaration of bankruptcy and the\n\n[[Page S2274]]\n\n     inevitable liquidation of the California electric utilities' \n     assets in a legal free-for-all.\n\n  The American Gas Association, on behalf of all of the natural gas \ncompanies involved in this, also states the same thing. They go on, \nhowever, to say:\n\n       As the preferred creditors would in actuality control the \n     bankruptcy proceedings through their status, in effect \n     Chapter 11 reorganization would not be an option. Liquidation \n     of assets through Chapter 7 filing would result. Such action \n     could cause serious disruption and harm to the utility \n     customers, not to mention the non-preferred creditors.\n\n  So, Mr. President, you have virtually all of the electric power \nproducers, as well as the natural gas producers, in effect, saying that \nif you give these Federal entities preferred status, should there be a \nbankruptcy, they would, in effect, have to assert their rights to force \nan involuntary bankruptcy, and that then would put both of the \nutilities into chapter 7 rather than chapters 11 or 13. This was the \ntheme--the dominant theme--from virtually every generator, producer, \nand creditor.\n\n  I know of virtually no electric power producer or gas producer that \nbelieves this amendment will do anything other than trigger a \nbankruptcy of these two companies. Therefore, I am strongly in \nopposition to it.\n  Last evening, the proponent of this legislation, Senator Wyden, said \nin fact the legislation does not do this. So we went out and we \ncontacted the bankruptcy attorney for Pacific Gas and Electric. We \nasked them for a letter and their interpretation of the Wyden \namendment. I have that letter. I will read it into the Record.\n\n       My firm is special reorganization counsel to Southern \n     California Edison. In connection with the debate over the \n     Wyden Amendment to S. 420, it has been suggested that the \n     Amendment is not intended to prefer the debt covered by the \n     Amendment over the debts of other creditors of Southern \n     California Edison and the other utilities affected by the \n     Amendment. Please be advised that, in my view, the Amendment \n     would do exactly that.\n\n  This is the bankruptcy counsel for one of the utilities at risk of \nbankruptcy.\n  The letter goes on:\n\n       The purpose of the Wyden Amendment is to exclude from the \n     binding effect of a plan of reorganization in chapter 11 \n     certain creditors of the utility who provided wholesale \n     electric power to the utility under certain conditions. It \n     provides that such debts are nondischargeable. As a \n     consequence, a utility in chapter 11 could not bind such \n     preferred creditors under a plan of reorganization, and such \n     creditors would be able to pursue the utility following \n     confirmation of a plan to collect in full, in cash, their \n     obligations while the other creditors were bound by the terms \n     of a confirmed plan of reorganization. Depending upon the \n     magnitude of such preferred claims, the utility might find it \n     very difficult to confirm a plan under such circumstances. \n     Such result would be very detrimental to not only the utility \n     but to its other creditors.\n\n  This is the bankruptcy counsel himself.\n\n       It is also my understanding that there has been a \n     suggestion in argument on behalf of the Amendment that the \n     magnitude of the preferred obligations would not exceed $100 \n     million to $200 million. I am advised by Southern California \n     Edison that based upon the amount of power purchased during \n     the emergency orders of the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission, the amount of power procured to serve Southern \n     California Edison's customers substantially exceeded that \n     amount.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes have expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to use the \nremainder of Senator Bingaman's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Thank you very much.\n  Continuing:\n\n       Based upon the foregoing, it should be clear that if \n     Southern California Edison was involved in a bankruptcy \n     proceeding, the proposed legislation would have significant \n     impact upon Southern California Edison and its other \n     creditors.\n\n  Mr. President, this is the bankruptcy counsel.\n  So we know two things: One, from bankruptcy counsel, that this \namendment--the Wyden amendment and the Smith amendment--do in fact \ncreate two classes of creditors. And they do, in fact, give premier \nstanding to one class of creditors, the Federal subsidized entities. \nThose entities are given preference in a bankruptcy. Secondly, we know \nin fact that the amount involved is a good deal more than the amount \nrepresented in this Chamber.\n  We also know that virtually every other power producer and supplier--\nevery single one--believes that if this amendment were to pass, they \nwould have to exercise their rights, which would be to push Southern \nCalifornia Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric into an involuntary \nbankruptcy and most probably in chapter 7, which would mean a \ndissolution of the companies involved.\n  This would be tragic because the State has negotiated an agreement \nwith two utilities to buy their transmission lines and to put $7 \nbillion into the purchase of those transmission lines. The result would \nthen be a securitization of that back debt and enable these utilities \nto pay their debtors and creditors without going into bankruptcy. So a \nplan to enable the payment of the debtors and creditors is now underway \nby the State.\n  Various Members of this body may not like how the State is handling \nthe problem, but the State does have the right to try to redress the \ndebts and in fact is doing so. These amendments can only wreak \ndevastation on that attempt. I strongly oppose the Wyden and Smith \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I am going to a gathering for Jesse \nBrown. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to bring the Wellstone \namendment, which is supposed to come next, to the floor at 1:15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object, is that a modification \nof the earlier amendment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. That is correct.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. How would it be, again?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. The modification is that the section dealing with \ncoercive practices is out, which was a question of Banking Committee \njurisdiction.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 40\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be a 5-minute debate on the \nCarnahan amendment No. 40. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, I understand the managers have agreed \nto accept my amendment on home energy. I thank Senator Collins, \ncosponsor of the amendment, as well as Senators Hatch, Grassley, and \nLeahy for their willingness to help on this very important amendment. I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? The \nSenator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I understand that pending is the Carnahan amendment. I \nask unanimous consent that following the concluding debate, the \namendment be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 78\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Alaska that we \nare waiting on a 5-minute debate before we vote, and the debaters have \nnot arrived. That could delay our vote. Will the Senator speak long?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may, I will take some of the time, perhaps, \nallotted to the Senator from California to just make a statement on the \namendment, which will not take more than a minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I don't believe the time has expired. \nI believe I have 2\\1/2\\ minutes. I will be happy to give some of that \nto the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. She has 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I will just use a minute. Let me leave you with one \nthought. Article I, section 8, of the Constitution clearly states that \nCongress shall ``establish uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies \nthroughout the United States.''\n  There is absolutely nothing uniform about the pending amendment. It \nonly protects electric sales ordered by the Federal Government to \nCalifornia, or sales only to California by State, local, or Federal \nGovernment entities. If similar power sales arose in New York or \nGeorgia, these provisions would not apply.\n  In other words, this amendment says there is one set of bankruptcy \nrules for electric sales into California and another set of bankruptcy \nrules for electric sales into the other 49 States. Clearly, this is \ncompletely contrary to the intent of our Founding Fathers and the \nConstitution; they wanted one set of uniform rules to govern bankruptcy \nthroughout the entire country. As a consequence, I urge my colleagues \nto reflect on this legitimate question of the constitutionality of the \namendment.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, there are 2\\1/2\\ minutes on our side for \nthe Smith-Boxer-Wyden amendment. I yield a minute and a half of that \ntime to Senator Boxer, and I thank her. I remind our colleagues on this \nissue affecting the Pacific Northwest, there is a disagreement among \nthe Californians.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am supporting the Wyden-Smith amendment \nbecause it sends the right signal--an ethical signal to the private \nutilities in California who owe billions of dollars of unpaid bills to \nthose who supplied energy to my State when my State was in dire need. \nSometimes these power generators, many municipal utilities, were forced \nby the Federal Government to send this power, even though they were \nconcerned that they needed to conserve it for themselves or that they \nmight not get paid.\n  Call me old-fashioned, but I say pay your bills. Don't send your \nparent company $4.8 billion--which is what one private utility did--to \npay dividends of the shareholders and repurchase stock when you know \nyou have bills to pay.\n  I have a Washington Post article. I ask unanimous consent to have it \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 31, 2001]\n\n                  Audit Results Anger Consumer Groups\n\n                  (By William Booth and Rene Sanchez)\n\n       Los Angeles, Jan. 30--The first of several audits to be \n     released by state regulators said that one of California's \n     two nearly bankrupt utilities, Southern California Edison, \n     legally passed along nearly $5 billion in net income to its \n     parent, Edison International, which used the money to pay \n     dividends to its shareholders and to repurchase its own \n     stock.\n       The audit, released Monday night by the California Public \n     Utilities Commission, also showed that Southern California \n     Edison is now broke and so strapped for cash it cannot keep \n     buying electricity at rates higher than it can pass along to \n     consumers.\n       The $4.8 billion was, in part, proceeds from the sale of \n     the Southern California Edison's power plants, which the \n     utility was required to sell under California's 1996 \n     deregulation plan. Deregulation here sought to break up the \n     utility monopolies and open the state up to free-market \n     forces.\n       Consumer advocates--and some elected officials--reacted \n     angrily to the audit, accusing the utilities of pleading \n     poverty and begging for financial assistance from the state \n     to avoid bankruptcy.\n       ``Basically, they took the money and ran,'' John Burton, a \n     Democratic leader of the state Senate from San Francisco, \n     told reporters. ``Had they not done that they would not be in \n     the financial problem they are in. If ratepayers bail them \n     out, ratepayers should get something in return, like power \n     lines or something.''\n       But officials with the utilities said their critics are \n     playing politics and misinterpreting their books. Tom \n     Higgins, senior vice president at Edison International, said: \n     ``There's been no profit, no windfall. This is the recovery \n     of capital investment.''\n       The past profits and current solvency of the state's two \n     struggling utilities are central to California's energy \n     crisis. Most experts agree that the state is suffering from \n     soaring prices and its 15th day of emergency energy rationing \n     because of a failed and dysfunctional deregulatory plan, \n     which allowed wholesale energy prices to soar while capping \n     the rates utility companies could charge consumers. In the \n     past six months, the utilities have gone bust, while \n     wholesale power producers have reaped huge profits.\n       California is fast running out of time to solve its \n     immediate energy crisis. The state already has used up the \n     first $400 million in emergency appropriations for \n     electricity purchases. The Legislature is considering bills \n     to make the state a major buyer of power--and to pass along \n     possible steep increases in costs to consumers. Gov. Gray \n     Davis (D) worked through the weekend trying to hammer out a \n     longer-range plan, but so far the Legislature has passed only \n     emergency measures and decrees--and no long-term solutions.\n       Higgins, the Edison International executive, said Southern \n     California Edison was required to sell off its plants after \n     deregulation in 1996, and that it did so--mostly to out-of-\n     state companies that are now the wholesale suppliers of \n     California's electricity. The utility sold off its gas and \n     coal-fired plants, but retained its nuclear and hydroelectric \n     facilities.\n       The money they got from plant sales, Higgins said, went to \n     pay off the banks that loaned them the cash to build the \n     generating stations and to repay investors and shareholders \n     who also put money into plant construction. The transfer of \n     money occurred from 1996 through last November.\n       ``It's like you have a house and mortgage and you sell the \n     house and you recover your initial investment and then pay \n     off the mortgage,'' Higgins said.\n       Another audit of Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the other \n     struggling utility, will be released within days. That \n     results are expected to be similar.\n       ``The only reason this would be controversial is that the \n     consumer groups are trying to rewrite history,'' said John \n     Nelson, a spokesman for PG\n       Nelson said his utility did the same thing as Southern \n     California Edison--it sold plants, paid off loans and sent \n     the rest to its holding company, PG Corp. He would not \n     disclose exactly how much was transferred, but said it is \n     safe to assume a figure of several billion dollars.\n       Consumer advocates around California, however, said it did \n     not matter that the utilities were returning investments to \n     their shareholders, a practice that no one has asserted is \n     financially improper or illegal. Today, they began lobbying \n     state lawmakers to scrap an emerging legislative plan that \n     would cover much of the utilities' purported debts with \n     billions of dollars in publicly financed bonds.\n       ``This confirms what we've been saying all along,'' said \n     Matt Freedman, a director of the Utility Reform Network. \n     ``Edison is not being straight with the public or the \n     Legislature about the extent of its debt.''\n       Freedman also said that the audit shows that in recent \n     months Edison has been selling some of its own generating \n     power back to itself at high prices on the open market, then \n     claiming both profit and debt.\n       ``It's like a laundering scheme,'' he said.\n       Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers Action Network said \n     the audit could significantly influence the fast-moving \n     legislative debate on the state's energy crisis. He said that \n     while it was not illegal for the utilities to transfer money \n     to their parent companies, ``the question is, `Was it \n     prudent?' ''\n       But Paul Hefner, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Robert \n     Hertzberg (D), said there are no substantive new revelations \n     in the Edison audit and that the Legislature is proceeding \n     with a plan outlined last Friday that would cover much of the \n     utilities' debts in exchange for the state receiving warrants \n     to buy stock in the companies.\n       ``I don't know that it changes the landscape at all,'' \n     Hefner said, referring to the audits. ``All along we've been \n     saying we're not going to do this and get nothing back. We're \n     driving as hard a bargain as we can.''\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Another private utility did the same thing to the tune of \n$5 billion. That is $9 billion these private utilities sent out.\n  In my opinion, this amendment sends a strong message to the utilities \nin my State: It is not right to ask for help and walk away from your \nobligations. This amendment helps 12 power companies in California, \nmunicipal companies. In the end, it will help consumers because the \nnext time there is a crisis,\n\n[[Page S2276]]\n\npower companies will not fear they will be left high and dry and they \nwill be willing to assist us in the future.\n  This amendment was not offered in anger; it was offered in fairness. \nI support it.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 37 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. WYDEN. To finish the debate, I yield to Senator Smith, my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I appreciate the chance to say a \nfew closing words on this debate, which has been a good one.\n  All the neighbors of California are asking--at least those affected \nby the Bonneville Power Administration--is that they be paid. I believe \nCalifornia wants to pay. Ultimately, they have to work through their \nlaw that makes it difficult to pay. We want them to do that. We need \nthem to do that because people in the Northwest already are paying \nhigher rates because of this California law. We should not have to pay \nadditional, higher rates.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, how much of my time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute 4 seconds.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to thank Senators Murkowski and \nBingaman for opposing this amendment and also to join them in saying \nthat I believe this is a very dangerous amendment. It creates two \nclasses of creditors. The first is a protected class; namely, certain \nFederal entities.\n  Yesterday, I introduced into the Record a series of letters from \nvirtually all of the electricity and natural gas providers. Those \nletters had one common theme, and that theme was that to do this is not \nonly unprecedented, but it will probably force an involuntary \nbankruptcy because once the dam is broken, other creditors will then \nseek to protect their rights under bankruptcy law. Hence, it is a very \ndangerous amendment.\n  The State of California is currently seeking to purchase the \ntransmission lines of the utilities to be able to inject $7 billion and \nsolve the problem. I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  Is all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I move to table the Wyden amendment \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table Amendment No. 78.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD (when his name was called).

Mr. President, Senator Breaux, Senator Enzi, and myself \nhad an interesting and, I think, enlightening discussion on the issue \nof ergonomics, as well as Senator Specter.\n  I ask unanimous consent there now be a period of about 30 minutes for \na discussion of this issue, the time to be equally divided between \nSenators Breaux and Enzi for debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, does the \nSenator have an idea how long this will take?\n  Mr. NICKLES. About 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for the discussion \nwith me--Senator Enzi, Senator Landrieu, and Senator Blanche Lincoln--\non the issue of an amendment I have at the desk, which we will not vote \non right now, but I hope to perhaps reach an agreement on at a later \nhour.\n  The amendment addresses the question of the so-called ergonomics \nrule, which this body addressed last week, through the use of a \nprocedure which is not normally utilized, when the Senate of the United \nStates said that a rule that had been promulgated by the Department of \nLabor would not be allowed to go into effect addressing injuries in the \nworkplace that workers receive which cause them to lose very \nvaluable hours of service, both to themselves and their employers. \nThose workplace injuries clearly cause a loss to companies and small \nbusinesses, as well as the personal loss that is caused to the \nindividual.\n\n  There was a great deal of concern raised by myself and by some \nRepublican colleagues to the rule because in many cases it would have \nan adverse effect on the States' workers compensation laws. And they \nhad concerns about the potential that the rule would, in fact, allow \ninjuries to be covered that were not directly related to having been \nbrought about by conditions in the workplace.\n  The third thing I heard a great deal of was that employers really \ndidn't have enough information to know whether they were covered or \nwhat were their responsibilities. Therefore, in order to try to answer \nthose questions and still address the concern that I think most people \nhave about injuries in the workplace, which are estimated to cost \nbetween $45 million and $54 million annually, I have offered an \namendment that I think is one this body should embrace in a bipartisan \nfashion.\n  No. 1, we say the Secretary of Labor, within the next 2 years, shall \npromulgate regulations dealing with these injuries in the workplace. In \naddition to giving her the mandate from the Congress to promulgate \nthese regulations, we also go further and say that, in trying to \naddress the concerns we heard on the floor of the Senate, for instance, \nin issuing this new rule, the Secretary of Labor shall ensure that \nnothing in the rule expands the application of the State workers comp \nlaw. We had a lot of concern about whether it would be altered or \nexpanded. This amendment clearly says that nothing would be in the bill \nand the rule could expand the application of the State workers \ncompensation law. It also says that nothing in this amendment or in the \nrule could affect the OSHA laws. They are in place as they are, and if \nsomebody wants to change them, that would be for a later date.\n  The other thing I think was very important, which we heard from so \nmany of our people, was that the injuries they are talking about under \nthe rule shall be work-related disorders that occur within the \nworkplace. Many people were concerned that, well, someone could injure \ntheir back on a Saturday at home during a recreational activity and \ncome to work on Monday and blame it on conditions in the workplace.\n  The amendment I have offered, along with my bipartisan cosponsors, \nsays\n\n[[Page S2277]]\n\nthe standard shall not apply to nonwork-related disorders that occur \noutside the workplace or nonwork-related disorders that are aggravated \nby the workplace.\n  So every objection I heard, particularly from my colleagues on this \nside of the aisle, I think has been taken care of in the amendment we \nhave offered. It is my intent that if this rule would be promulgated, \nnothing in this amendment would prohibit Congress from using the same \nCongressional Review Act procedures if they did not like the rule. If \nsome think it is too much or too little, they can still use the \nCongressional Review Act, as we did last week to knock down the rule \nwith which a majority of the Members of the Congress did not agree.\n  I think our amendment addresses every concern. The question is, Do \nyou want to do something about the workplace that is fair, reasonable, \nresponsible; that businesses can embrace, working people can embrace, \nand say, all right, this is a problem, let's recognize it and do \nsomething about it? Just to say, well, the Secretary may not do that, \nreally doesn't give any guidance to what the Congress says. We \nshould make the rules.\n\n  My amendment takes care of every objection I heard, I think, and I \nthink there is a proper balance between employers and business, as well \nas the working men and women of this country. I do not, for the life of \nme, understand why this would not be something that should not be \nunanimously agreed to by Republicans as well as my Democrat colleagues.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I guess we are equally divided under the agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Correct.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I will yield 15 minutes to my colleague. I reserve 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Breaux for his efforts on \nergonomics. These injuries are happening in this country and we need to \ndo something about them. I appreciated the conciseness with which he \nmade a statement during the last debate we had on ergonomics.\n  I wish his bill more closely followed the statement he made. I \nsuspect there is leeway in there to do exactly what he said when he \nmade that statement, and I think this comes fairly close. I hope we \nwill be able to work together to make some changes in what is in his \namendment. Most of all, what I hope is that the Senators who are \ninterested in this issue will work with me. I am the subcommittee \nchairman for Employment, Safety and Training. It is all of the labor \nissues. It includes the ergonomics issue. I had planned to begin a \nprocess of holding some hearings. I already have my staff members \nlooking at past efforts--and there are supposed to be 10 or 12 years of \nefforts on ergonomics already--to see what was done and where it went \nwrong before. Also, I am scheduling some meetings with Secretary Chao. \nI am pleased to have other people involved in those meetings with me. \nWe need to come up with a mechanism that will actually prevent \ninjuries. I am not interested in the mechanism that just does paperwork \nor just puts costs on business. I know the people who submitted this \namendment--particularly Senator Breaux--are not interested in having \nthat either.\n  I have been trying to work on this compliance issue through a number \nof mechanisms since I got here. One of them is something called the \nSAFE Act. It was encouragement for businesses--particularly small \nbusinesses--to hire professional consultants to come in and take a look \nat their business. I would suggest using OSHA people, but they are \nalready overworked doing OSHA inspections. In State plan States, which \nare the States where there are the least OSHA accidents, there are more \ninspections but there is more consultation that is done. So I have put \na huge emphasis on consultation with businesses.\n  The way the consultation works in States is the OSHA team, or \ninspector, comes in and looks at the place and says this is wrong, this \nis wrong, and this is wrong. If they say that, you better fix it. And \nif you fix it, then you are not subject to the penalties.\n  That is an incentive process. That is what I envision for compliance \nwith an ergonomics rule as well: Somebody helping the small \nbusinessman. I am not worried about the big businesspeople because they \nhave the VPP program, the specialists, and they have the professionals \non staff. It is the little guy, and that is what we talked about when \nwe did the ergonomics CRA last week. They cannot digest all the \ninformation. They do not even know what is absolutely essential and \nwhat is suggested.\n  If somebody can tell them what to do--they know the value of their \nemployees; they want to protect their employees. In most instances, \nthey do not know how to protect their employees. If there is more of \nthe consultation aspect to it and the incentive to do it, if the folks \ncome in and tell you to do those things and you do those things, you \nwill not be fined. I am so pleased there is a compliance piece to this.\n  Something I hope will be incorporated in the future, perhaps even in \nthis rule, is the ability of the managers to talk to the employee or \nemployees directly. The way the current national labor standards read \nis that management cannot talk to the employees unless they are in a \nunion. Of course, if they are in a union, then the management can talk \nto the representative of the employees.\n  We are missing this step of being able to say to an employee: How are \nyou feeling? How is your workstation? Are there any improvements we can \nmake? These are folks who are doing that same job in all of the \nexamples we use, the same job day in and day out. They are the experts \non it. They know the things that can be done to make their work easier.\n  Those are the things that need to be incorporated in ergonomics: very \nspecific suggestions for a particular kind of a--it is not even for a \nparticular kind of business because within an industry, several \ndifferent businesses will do the same operation differently. If they \nconferred more, which I am not sure they are allowed to do either, then \nthey would probably wind up with a standard method of doing things, and \nthey would be able to compare the ergonomics process, as well as any \nother safety issue and come to an agreement on how those safety issues \ncan be reached.\n  Another thing that needs to be done while we are at it is changing \nthe rulemaking process. One of the things that fascinated me in my \ncomments and visits with Assistant Secretary Jeffress, who is in charge \nof OSHA, was that in the 28 years OSHA has been in effect, there has \nnot been one rule revised even though there have been huge changes in \nthe workplace.\n  What that tells me is that our rulemaking process is so cumbersome, \nso subject to court action that we cannot take a look at things that \nwere done 28 years ago even though the technologies have changed \ntremendously.\n  There are some things that need to be done. I wish we had been \nconsulted a bit more on some of the specific wording. I know there is \nan effort to work together on some of these things, so we may be able \nto come up with an agreement in a short while so this amendment can be \naccepted.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana for making this effort, for \ngetting us started on it. I hope he will work with me on the process. I \nyield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I will use whatever time I need, and I \nwill then yield to the Senator from Arkansas.\n  Some of the points the Senator made are valid. However, our amendment \naddresses those concerns, particularly the concern about an employer \nknowing exactly what his or her requirements are because we say that \nthe rule shall set forth in clear terms the circumstances under which \nan employer is required to take action, the measures required of an \nemployer under the standard, and the compliance obligation of an \nemployer under the standard.\n  We give the employers clear direction. We let them know when they are \nin compliance, and we clearly spell out what their obligations are and \nalso the measures that are required.\n  Under the requirements of our legislation, the rule has to come back \nand clarify to an employer exactly what is being required.\n\n[[Page S2278]]\n\n  I think the amendment is a good one; ergo, I think it should be \nadopted.\n  I yield whatever time she consumes to the Senator from Arkansas, Mrs. \nLincoln.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, with all of this talk we have heard recently about \nbipartisanship and wanting to do what is right by everyone, not leaving \nanyone behind, I am certainly glad we have at least a few minutes to \nhave a debate on an alternative to last week's issue of workplace \nsafety.\n  I have been delighted to work with my colleagues, Senator Breaux and \nSenator Landrieu--and Senator Specter has worked with us--in developing \nan amendment that requires the Department of Labor to draft a new \nergonomics standard that addresses the ergonomic hazards in the \nworkplace without penalizing business owners who act in good faith.\n  As I stated in my remarks last week, I voted to repeal the ergonomics \nstandard last year because, in my opinion, it was unreasonable in terms \nof the requirements it imposed on businesses and how unworkable it was \nwith regard to the vagueness of the standards with which employers were \nexpected to comply.\n  However, I do not believe our action to overturn the current \nergonomics rule should in any way be interpreted as congressional \nintention to end the debate on this issue of workplace safety. That is \nwhat we did last week. That certainly was not my intention. In fact, I \nbelieve the Federal Government does have a responsibility to set safety \nstandards and to protect workers against hazards that exist in their \nplace of employment.\n  Certainly, the new Secretary of Labor and the new administration, \nthrough working with our colleagues in hearings and other ways, I think \nwould relish the idea of being able to come up with a standard that is \nworkable, something that can give us workplace safety but encourage \nbusinesses to be involved. That is certainly possible.\n\n  The ergonomics standard or the rule we saw last year was a no win for \nanyone because we were not going to see, because of the court cases \nthat were already involved with that rule, workers protected, nor were \nwe able to see a reasonable compliance that industries could meet. It \nwas not a win for anyone.\n  If we fail to come back with anything else, and if we fail to \nencourage the Department of Labor to come up with something that is \nreasonable and workable, then we, once again, have failed everyone--\nbusinesses and employees--because we can do better at providing better \nworkplace safety, and we can also provide businesses a better way of \ncomplying with it. Everyone wins with that--workers and businesses.\n  The amendment we are offering gives the Department of Labor 2 years \nto craft a new Federal ergonomics standard. In addition, our amendment \ndirects the Department to address serious problems that exist in the \nprevious rule.\n  Specifically, we make clear that the new standards should not apply \nto injuries that occur outside the workplace or, as Senator Breaux \nmentioned, injuries that are aggravated by activities that employees \nperform as a part of their job.\n  Furthermore, this amendment requires the Secretary of Labor to set \nforth in clear terms what businesses are required to do to comply with \nthis new standard before it takes effect.\n  Finally, we prohibit the new rule from expanding the application of \nState workers compensation laws.\n  In short, I believe our amendment is a reasonable, commonsense \napproach that will allow the Department of Labor to address a serious \nhealth and safety issue in the workplace in a manner that is fair to \nboth employees and employers. After all, in the debate last week, is \nthat not what we said we were striving for?\n  As a founding member of the Senate's new Democrats coalition who is \ninclined to seek compromise whenever possible, I wish we had been given \nthe opportunity to draft and offer a compromise proposal on ergonomics \nlast week when it was most appropriate. Unfortunately, we did not have \nthat opportunity.\n  Now that the consideration of the resolution of disapproval has been \nconcluded, I am certainly hopeful my colleagues will want to work in a \nbipartisan way and permit a reasonable period of debate and vote on \nthis amendment and come up with something that is going to be workable \nfor absolutely everybody, certainly employees as well as employers and \nbusinesses, all of which can be brought to the table in the next 2 \nyears, and we can craft something that is going to be workable and meet \nthe objectives we have all expressed.\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana for his hard work and leadership \nin this effort, and I look forward to working with all of our \ncolleagues in the next several days to come up with something we can \nadopt and prove to the people of this Nation and businesses of this \nNation that we are truly concerned about workplace safety and about \nbeing sensible.\n  I yield back to the Senator from Louisiana the remainder of his time.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator from Arkansas for her contribution. \nShe comes from a State deeply involved in these issues. I know she \nspeaks with a ``mine'' of experience in addressing these concerns. I \nthank her for her contribution, as well as my colleague from Louisiana, \nSenator Landrieu.\n  I take this time to say to our colleagues our staffs are currently \ntalking with each other across party lines to see whether there might \nbe some agreement we can reach on an authorization bill as an amendment \neither to this legislation that is currently pending before the Senate \nor to some other legislative package that is going to come before the \nSenate. I will continue to work with our colleagues and our staffs \ntrying to find a way to reach an agreement on a pending amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from Arkansas and the Senator from \nLouisiana for their consideration and their work in a bipartisan way to \nsee we get something done and to extend that opportunity to go to \nmeetings with Secretary Chao and also to participate in hearings on my \nsubcommittee. We want to make some progress on this issue.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know Senator Enzi is not managing the \nbill--he is on the floor for other reasons--but I wonder if we could \nhave some idea in the near future as to what we are going to do for the \nrest of the day. Senator Wellstone, by virtue of the unanimous consent \nagreement, is going to come in at 1:15. We have Senator Durbin who has \noffered what is, in effect, a substitute. That was laid down last \nnight. He is willing to start debating that amendment.\n  We have others we could get over here to offer amendments. We want \nthe record to be clear that we are doing everything we can. Senator \nLeahy has instructed everyone to move this bill along as quickly as \npossible. I certainly agree with that. I see Senator Grassley, too. \nMaybe we could have some information as to whether we could set aside \nthe amendment that is pending and move on to something else?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it is my understanding the bill managers are \nlooking at what is left on the bankruptcy bill at this moment. Senator \nWellstone's bill will be the amendment pending. He is planning on being \nhere at 1:15.\n  I had heard some concern that most of the actual bankruptcy issues \nhad been covered and we were just doing some peripheral ones. There is \nsome concern on our side as to what the process is going to be, too. It \nis my understanding they are discussing that now. The chairman probably \ncan give us some information.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. If the Senator from Nevada will yield, I will try to \nrespond to his inquiry.\n\n  No. 1, since so many people are busy during the lunch hour with the \nsteering committees and the type meeting\n\n[[Page S2279]]\n\nthat both parties have, we might not be so fortunate as to get \nsomething up before 1:15 when the Wellstone amendment is up.\n  The second is, the Senator asked if we could do another amendment. \nWhat amendment would the Senator suggest we move to, then?\n  Mr. REID. There is one amendment about which I have received a number \nof calls today. Mr. Durbin, the Senator from Illinois, wants to offer \nhis substitute. In effect, that is what it is. The Senator from Iowa is \nfamiliar with that. It is at the desk.\n  It is at the desk. He would be willing to have a relatively short \ntime agreement for the opportunity to express his views on that.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. As the main sponsor of this legislation, I should be \nable to tell you we could go to the Durbin amendment. But we have some \nreservation at this time on moving forward on the Durbin amendment, \nparticularly because it would take a good deal of time and would \ninterfere with the Wellstone amendment. If there is some other \namendment the Senator from Nevada would like to take up, he might \nsuggest something, and we would quickly consider that.\n  Mr. REID. We have one that Senator Leahy has been trying to get up, \namendment No. 19, a set-aside amendment.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That is the same amendment, if we went back to regular \norder. If we called regular order, we would end up on that amendment.\n  Mr. REID. It is my understanding that No. 20 is regular order. This \none isn't before the Senate.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. This is an amendment that has not been before the \nSenate.\n  Mr. REID. That is my understanding. It has been filed but it has not \nbeen debated.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I suggest we put in a quorum call, and then we will \ntake a look at it.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the pending amendment be set \naside temporarily and amendment No. 19 on behalf of Senator Leahy be \noffered.\n  It is my understanding that the Senator from Iowa will also want a \nunanimous consent agreement to indicate there would be no second-degree \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 19\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Reid], for Mr. Leahy, proposes \n     an amendment numbered 19.\n\n  Mr. REID.

The clerk will report the pending amendment of \nthe Senator from Minnesota.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Amendment No. 36, as modified, previously proposed by Mr. \n     Wellstone.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to be clear with my colleagues \nand the majority leader that I came to the floor very early on with \nseveral amendments to move this process forward. Last week, when I \ninitially objected to a motion to proceed, the majority leader said we \nwould have substantive debate on amendments. This amendment has been \n``hanging out there'' for several days. I have wanted a vote on this \namendment. I modified this amendment because there was concern on the \npart of one of my colleagues on the other side that there was a \njurisdictional problem with a committee. I had assumed we would have an \nup-or-down vote on this amendment. My understanding is that it might \nnot happen and there might be a second-degree amendment. I don't know \nwhat that amendment is, but it will probably be an amendment that will \ngut this amendment.\n  It makes me start to wonder, even more, about what we have been doing \nout on the floor of the Senate with this bankruptcy bill. My colleague \ncalled this a reform bill, but I wish to mention a couple of articles \nthat have been published recently. I will soon ask to have them printed \nin the Record.\n  There was a piece that appeared on Tuesday, March 13, in the Wall \nStreet Journal entitled, ``Auto Firms See Profit In Bankruptcy-Reform \nBill Provision.'' The first paragraph:\n\n       The nation's three major auto makers are always interested \n     in making deals, and they hope to close one in the U.S. \n     Senate this week that is worth millions of dollars to each of \n     them.\n       The deal lies in the bankruptcy-reform bill expected to \n     clear the Senate this week. Buried in the bill's 42 pages is \n     a section that changes the way auto loans are treated when an \n     individual declares bankruptcy, making it more likely the car \n     loans will have to be paid back in full--even while other \n     creditors collect only part of what they are owed.\n\n  That might include child support payments as well.\n  There also is in here a chart that deals with the soft money, PAC, \nand individual contributions by members of the Coalition for \nResponsible Bankruptcy Laws.\n  I actually think the bitter irony is that the debate we have been \nhaving on this bill--for the 2\\1/2\\ or 3 years I have been working on \nthis--is probably, unfortunately, a perfect bridge to the debate we are \ngoing to have on campaign finance reform.\n  Again, I want to be real clear with my colleagues. I don't like to \ncome to the floor and do a one-to-one correlation that money has been \ngiven, so that is why you are voting this way. I don't believe in that \nfor several reasons. One, it would be arrogant on my part to believe \nthat if somebody has a different point of view, that means, ipso facto, \nthey are receiving all this money from, for instance, the financial \nservices industry and that is why they are voting the way they are. \nThat is not my argument.\n  Rather, my argument is institutional, which is more serious. The \nproblem with this political process is not that there is \n``corruption,'' as in the wrongdoing of individual officeholders, as in \none-to-one quid pro quo--here is the money, here is how you should \nvote.\n  The problem is institutional, and that is a more serious problem. It \nis the imbalance of power, the imbalance of access, the imbalance of \ninfluence, not affluence, between the people I have tried to represent \nas a Senator--low- and moderate-income people, people of color, poor \npeople, consumers--and the heavy hitters, the investors, the players, \nthe lobbying coalition.\n\n[[Page S2280]]\n\n There has been article after article about the full-court press of the \nfinancial services industry over this bill.\n  The auto firms get a good deal. That is worked into this bill. Buried \nin the bill's 42 pages is a special deal for them.\n  By the way, it is not a special deal for you if you are going under \nbecause of major medical expenses, which is 50 percent of the cases. It \nis not a special deal for you if you have lost your job in the Iron \nRange of Minnesota, 1,400 taconite workers out of work. It is not a \nspecial deal for you if you have gone through a divorce and there is a \nsudden loss of income. But it is a special deal for these folks. This \nis a piece by Tom Hamburger of the Wall Street Journal.\n  There is another piece in the Wall Street Journal by Tom Hamburger, \nLaurie McKinley, and David S. Cloud:\n\n       For the businesses that invested more money than ever \n     before in George W. Bush's costly campaign for the \n     presidency, the returns have already begun.\n       MBNA America Bank was one of the largest corporate donors \n     to the Bush campaign and other GOP electoral efforts last \n     year. The bank and its employees gave a total of $1.3 \n     million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a \n     nonpartisan clearinghouse here. Charles Cawley, MBNA's \n     president, was a member of the Bush ``pioneers,'' wealthy \n     fund-raisers who each personally gathered at least $100,000 \n     for the presidential campaign.\n\n  I guess I am not going to get any support from the pioneers in my \nSenate race.\n\n       Mr. Cawley hosted Bush fund-raising events at his home in \n     Wilmington, Del., last year and, in 1999, at his summer home \n     in Maine, north of the Bush family retreat in Kennebunkport.\n\n  This whole piece--you get the point--is all about huge amounts of \nmoney, lobbying coalitions, access, and influence.\n  I ask unanimous consent that both of these articles by Mr. Hamburger \nin the Wall Street Journal be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From the Wall Street Journal]\n\nInfluence Market: Industries That Backed Bush are Now Seeking Return on \n   Investment--Tobacco Wants to Kill a Suit, Oil to Drill in Alaska; \n         Patient Privacy Targeted--White House Stresses Merits\n\n         (By Tom Hamburger, Laurie McGinley and David S. Cloud)\n\n       Washington.--For the businesses that invested more money \n     than ever before in George W. Bush's costly campaign for the \n     presidency, the returns have already begun.\n       MBNA America Bank was one of the largest corporate donors \n     to the Bush campaign and other GOP electoral efforts last \n     year. The bank and its employees gave a total of about $1.3 \n     million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a \n     nonpartisan clearinghouse here. Charles Cawley, MBNA's \n     president, was a member of the Bush ``pioneers,'' wealthy \n     fund-raisers who each personally gathered at least $100,000 \n     for the presidential campaign.\n       Mr. Cawley hosted Bush fund-raising events at his home in \n     Wilmington, Del., last year and, in 1999, at his summer home \n     in Maine, north of the Bush family retreat in Kennebunkport. \n     At the Maine affair, 200 guests gathered in the early evening \n     on the large porch of the Cawley home, situated on a hill \n     with a sweeping view of the Atlantic Ocean. Guests sipped \n     cocktails and heard a brief talk by the candidate.\n       The money didn't stop on election day. Mr. Cawley and his \n     wife each gave the maximum of $5,000 to help fund Mr. Bush's \n     fight in the Florida vote recount. Mr. Cawley gave an \n     additional $100,000 to the Bush-Cheney inaugural committee, \n     the most the committee would take from a single donor.\n       Last week, MBNA's investment began paying off. The company, \n     one of the nation's three largest credit-card issuers, has \n     been pushing for years to tighten bankruptcy laws that allow \n     certain consumers filing for court protection, in effect, to \n     disregard obligations to credit-card companies and other \n     unsecured lenders. On Wednesday, the White House announced \n     that President Bush would sign a bill now moving through \n     Congress that would make it tougher for consumers to escape \n     such debts. If enacted, the measure could translate into an \n     estimated tens of millions of dollars in additional annual \n     earnings for each of the big credit companies.\n       MBNA's vice chair, David Spartin, says his firm has no way \n     to estimate how the legislation would affect the company's \n     bottom line. MBNA has backed the bill for years ``because we \n     think it is good for consumers,'' as it will ``reduce the \n     cost of credit for everyone,'' Mr. Spartin says. The \n     donations to President Bush and other candidates were made \n     because ``we think they would make excellent public \n     officials,'' he adds. No MBNA official ``has ever spoken to \n     President Bush about the bill,'' Mr. Spartin says.\n       Many corporations feel like a new day is dawning in \n     Washington. ``We have come out of the cave, blinking in the \n     sunlight, saying to one another, `My God, now we can actually \n     get something done,' '' says Richard Hohlt, Washington \n     lobbyist for several other major banks which, like MBNA, are \n     backing an industry coalition whose members provided some $26 \n     million to Republicans during the 1999-2000 campaign cycle.\n       President Clinton last year vetoed a similar bill that \n     would have toughened bankruptcy law. Consumer groups argue \n     that such legislation would weaken protection for working \n     families, many of whom have been the targets of aggressive \n     credit-card marketing.\n       Also in action last week were members of a large coalition \n     of Mr. Bush's business backers who want to roll back new \n     federal rules designed to protect workers from repetitive-\n     motion injuries.\n       In a private meeting with congressional leaders last \n     Tuesday, President Bush signed off on a plan to kill the \n     ergonomic regulations, using the powers of the Congressional \n     Review Act. That act, passed in 1996, gives Congress 60 days \n     to reject regulations issued by federal agencies. But it was \n     never used during Mr. Clinton's term because to take effect, \n     a resolution rejecting new rules has to be approved by the \n     president.\n       Repealing the ergonomic rules ranks high on the priority \n     lists of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National \n     Association of Manufacturers and the National Association of \n     Wholesaler-Distributors. The trade groups technically don't \n     endorse candidates, but each of them mounted major grass-\n     roots and advertising campaigns that benefited Mr. Bush and \n     other Republicans in the 2000 elections.\n       A repeal would be a particularly hard loss for organized \n     labor, which has fought for enactment of the ergonomic rules \n     for 10 years, saying they are needed to protect workers from \n     wrist, back and other injuries.\n       On employee safety, consumer bankruptcy and a host of other \n     issues, Bush administration officials maintain they are \n     acting strictly on the merits, not the money. Proponents of \n     the bankruptcy bill, for example, point out that personal \n     bankruptcy filings reached a record 1.4 million in 1998. \n     The bill that would toughen the bankruptcy law won strong \n     bipartisan support in the House last week, passing 309-\n     106.\n       Business advocates maintain that the ergonomics rules \n     include an overly broad definition of ``musculoskeletal \n     disorders'' and that the new standards give employees \n     claiming to have such disorders overly generous treatment: \n     90% of their salary and benefits for up to three months.\n       But a strongly as they believe in their arguments, business \n     lobbyists acknowledge it's no accident that, following their \n     massive support for the GOP, Republicans are moving quickly \n     to address some of their top issues.\n       Mr. Bush ran the most costly presidential campaign in \n     American history. Donors to his campaign and the Republican \n     National Committee contributed a total of $314 million. Of \n     that, more than 80% came from corporations or individuals \n     employed by them. Al Gore and the Democratic National \n     Committee raised $213 million, receiving strong support from \n     labor organizations and their members. But more than 70% of \n     the Democratic total also came from businesses and their \n     employees.\n       These totals can be seen as somewhat inflated because most \n     donors to either party work for a business. But the amounts \n     don't include separate contributions from trade associations \n     or independent business advertising. ``The role of business \n     last year was huge, and it overwhelmingly benefited \n     Republicans,'' says Larry Makinson of the Center for \n     Responsive Politics.\n       As the bankruptcy and ergonomics bills move through the \n     Senate over the next few days, business groups also will be \n     looking for early action on other key issues. Here's a \n     preview.\n       With then-Vice President Al Gore and many Democratic \n     congressional candidates railing against alleged profiteering \n     by drug companies, the industry made its biggest-ever \n     contributions to the GOP cause.\n       Drug companies contributed $14 million to Republican \n     campaigns over the past two years and spent an additional $60 \n     million to fund their own independent political-advertising \n     campaign. Industry executives will be lobbying the new \n     administration on a wide range of issues, such as the \n     proposal to overhaul the Medicare program and include a \n     prescription-drug benefit for senior citizens. The industry \n     wants to make sure such a benefit doesn't lead to drug-price \n     controls.\n       But the fight isn't likely to command center stage for many \n     months. In the meantime, drug companies will press for a \n     rewrite of federal rules protecting the privacy of patients' \n     medical records. The rules were announced with much fanfare \n     in the final weeks of the Clinton administration. The drug \n     companies recently got a sign that they, too, were making \n     progress with the new administration.\n       Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy Thompson, in a \n     move that infuriated consumer groups, invited additional \n     public comments on the rules until the end of this month. The \n     industry is hoping the move will lead to more delays and, \n     ultimately, significant revisions.\n       Last December, Mr. Clinton heralded the rules as ``the most \n     sweeping privacy protections ever written.'' For the first \n     time, patients would have access to their medical files and \n     could correct mistakes. Providers, such as hospitals and \n     health plans, would be\n\n[[Page S2281]]\n\n     required to get written permission from patients to use or \n     disclose patients' health information. Providers also would \n     have to create sophisticated record-keeping systems and \n     privacy policies to document compliance with the rules.\n       Hailed by privacy advocates, the rules include provisions \n     anathema to nearly every segment of the health-care industry. \n     Drug makers, HMOs, drugstore chains and hospitals say that \n     while they back the goal of increased privacy, the rules have \n     a potential cumulative price tag in the tens of billions of \n     dollars, much of it to overhaul data-collection and \n     information-technology systems.\n       The companies warn that the new requirements mean that \n     pharmacies would need signed customer consents on file before \n     they could do something as simple as sending a prescription \n     home with a neighbor. The drug industry also says that \n     research critical to boosting corporate innovation and \n     tracking the safety of drugs would be inhibited. Academic \n     researchers seeking personal health information from \n     hospitals would have to get authorization from the patient or \n     undergo a special privacy review by a hospital panel.\n       Privacy advocates such as Janlori Goldman of the Health \n     Privacy Project at Georgetown University counter that such \n     dire predictions are inaccurate and ``hysterical.''\n       Technically, the regulations apply to the use of \n     information by hospitals, doctors, pharmacists and HMOs. But \n     they have big implications for drug companies, which depend \n     on access to that data for research and marketing. Among the \n     drug companies most concerned is Merck & Co., because of its \n     Merck-Medco unit. Like other pharmacy-benefits managers, \n     which obtain contracts from HMOs and employers to keep drug \n     costs down, Merck-Medco fears it would be hindered in its \n     ability to track physician-prescribing patterns and other \n     information.\n       Taking the lead on combating the rules is the \n     Confidentiality Coalition, an industry group that meets at \n     the offices of the Healthcare Leadership Council, overlooking \n     Farragut Square, a few blocks from the White House. Dubbed \n     the ``Anti-confidentiality Coalition'' by privacy advocates, \n     the alliance has 120 members, including Merck, Eli Lilly & \n     Co., Cigna Corp. and Medtronic Inc., the big medical-device \n     maker. A core group of 20 to 30 lobbyists shows up regularly \n     for strategy sessions.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 13, 2001]\n\n       Auto Firms See Profit in Bankruptcy-Reform Bill Provision\n\n                           (By Tom Hamburger)\n\n       Washington.--The nation's three major auto makers are \n     always interested in making deals, and they hope to close one \n     in the U.S. Senate this week that is worth millions of \n     dollars to each of them.\n       The deal lies in the bankruptcy-reform bill expected to \n     clear the Senate this week. Buried in the bill's 420 pages is \n     a section that changes the way auto loans are treated when an \n     individual declares bankruptcy, making it more likely the car \n     loans will have to be paid back in full--even while other \n     creditors collect only part of what they are owed.\n       Automobile lenders and academic experts say the financing \n     arms of the large auto companies will gain hundreds of \n     millions of dollars annually if the auto-loan provision \n     remains in the final bill, despite efforts by Illinois Sen. \n     Richard Durbin and other Democrats to pull it out.\n       The long-sought bill, which tightens the rules under which \n     consumers can declare bankruptcy, contains several other \n     obscure provisions that, like the one on auto loans, provide \n     special benefits to groups with the ability to influence \n     decision makers. For example, the legislation contains a two-\n     paragraph section--not the subject of any hearings or public \n     debate--that could make it more difficult for Lloyd's of \n     London to collect debts from American investors in the \n     insurance firm who can show they were victims of fraud. The \n     legislation also exempts credit unions from the bill's \n     disclosure requirements for voluntary repayment plans.\n       But it is the auto-loan provision that draws the loudest \n     complaints.\n       ``This is one of the best examples of why this is \n     legislation that is at war with itself,'' says Brady C. \n     Williamson, who teaches at the University of Wisconsin Law \n     School and who was chairman of the National Bankruptcy Review \n     Commission in 1996 and 1997.\n       The bankruptcy bill is designed to reduce the number of \n     Chapter 7 bankruptcy filings, in which consumers erase debts \n     to unsecured creditors, and increase the number of Chapter 13 \n     filings, which require debtors to repay at least a portion of \n     their obligations under the supervision of a court-appointed \n     trustee.\n       The auto giants gain because the proposed law would \n     eliminate the so-called cram-down rules that allow borrowers \n     entering Chapter 13 bankruptcy to repay only an automobile's \n     market value plus interest, not the full value of the \n     outstanding loan.\n       Consider, for example, the situation of someone entering \n     bankruptcy who bought a car two years ago for $10,000. The \n     car is now worth $6,000, but the buyer still owes $8,000 in a \n     multiyear note to the auto dealer. Under current law, a \n     person filing for Chapter 13 bankruptcy would pay the dealer \n     the $6,000 market value and keep the car. The remaining debt \n     would be considered, along with debts owed to other unsecured \n     creditors such as retailers, credit-card firms and medical \n     providers.\n       The theory behind the cram-down was that secured creditors \n     could get the value of their collateral back, cars wouldn't \n     get repossessed as often and bankruptcy filers could continue \n     to pay off at least a portion of their obligations to auto \n     lenders and other creditors under the supervision of a \n     trustee.\n       But under the bill's change, says Mr. Williamson, the \n     debtor will have to devote a larger share of remaining \n     resources to satisfying the auto dealer. Many may lose their \n     cars to repossession. Others will fall in Chapter 13, which \n     already has a 66% failure rate. He worries that more \n     creditors will thus end up filing under Chapter 7, precisely \n     the outcome the bill was designed to avoid.\n       Lobbyists for the major auto companies, whose financing \n     arms make loans to their customers, acknowledge encouraging \n     Michigan's former senator--now energy secretary--Spencer \n     Abraham to add the provision to the bankruptcy bill in 1999.\n       ``We think cram-down is a bad idea,'' says Anne Marie \n     Sylvester, media-relations manager for GMAC North America, \n     the financing arm of General Motors Corp. ``It raises costs \n     because it forces us to accept losses, which we may have to \n     spread among our customer base. In effect, it rewards debtors \n     who don't fulfill their obligations and penalizes those who \n     follow the rules.'' She said GMAC contributed $1.6 billion to \n     GM's $5 billion earnings last year. The bill also stands to \n     benefit GM's main competitors, Ford Motor Co. and Daimler \n     Chrysler AG.\n       This provision was in the bill that passed Congress last \n     year but was vetoed by then President Clinton, who said it \n     hit working families too hard. In another sign of the effect \n     a change in the presidency can make, the Bush White House has \n     formally signaled its intention to sign the bill.\n       Because removal of the cram-down effectively puts auto \n     lenders ahead of other creditors, the proposed shift \n     threatened a powerful business coalition, led by credit-card \n     companies, that has been pushing for an overhaul of \n     bankruptcy law in recent years. Despite some dissent, though, \n     the coalition generally held together, says Jeff Tassey, \n     organizer of the Coalition for Responsible Bankruptcy Laws. \n     Coalition members calculated that the advantages gained by \n     auto companies were worth accepting to keep that powerful \n     constituency behind the new law.\n       ``There are provisions that are important to some \n     industries that aren't important to others,'' Mr. Tassey \n     says. ``But the members took a mature approach . . . It was \n     important to have the automobile industry in there.''\n       To the auto industry, the change has been needed since \n     cram-down was introduced into law in 1978. Since that law \n     passed, bankruptcy rates have gone up nearly 800% and \n     automobile companies, which make a significant portion of \n     revenue from lending, were upset about the losses.\n       They argued that eliminating cram-down will make the \n     overall system more disciplined, helping all creditors. Mr. \n     Tassey says that cram-down works as an incentive to enter \n     Chapter 13 bankruptcy and argues that removing it will ``be a \n     deterrent to filing specious bankruptcies.''\n       But opponents scoff at those arguments. ``This is the worst \n     provision in this bill for those who want to induce people to \n     pay their debts back,'' says Henry Hildebrand of Nashville, \n     Tenn., chairman of the legislative- and legal-affairs \n     committee of the National Association of Chapter 13 Trustees.\n       As Mr. Hildebrand and others see it, the legislation will \n     hurt all creditors, and will run contrary to the intent of \n     the law's proponents. He cites studies by his organization \n     showing that a fifth of Chapter 13 debtors would be driven \n     into Chapter 7, where they can discharge or liquidate credit-\n     card and other unsecured debt.\n       And in the Senate last week, Sen. Durbin launched his \n     effort to remove the auto section from the final bill, or at \n     least modify it significantly.\n       ``This provision is unjustly tipped in favor of the \n     creditor, providing little or no protection for debtors,'' \n     Mr. Durbin says. ``A person who want to keep their car and go \n     to work ends up being a loser.''\n       The bankruptcy coalition's Mr. Tassey, though, dismisses \n     the critics: ``The bankruptcy establishment likes the system \n     the way they have been running it,'' he says.\n\n                         A Stake in Bankruptcy\n\nSOFT MONEY, PAC AND INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTIONS BY MEMBERS OF THE COALITION\n                     FOR RESPONSIBLE BANKRUPTCY LAWS\n                        (In thousands of dollars)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                        To           To\n           Organization             Democrats   Republicans     Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAmerican Bankers Association.....      $588.90    $1,109.60    $1,709.50\nCredit Union National Association       763.40       873.04     1,642,44\nFord Motor.......................       208.47       548.21       772.13\nDaimlerChrysler..................       161.03       483.08       700.11\nGeneral Motors...................       172.20       502.83       688.80\nAmerica's Community Bankers......       201.57       334.85       536.42\nIndependent Bankers Association..       164.62       261.25       429.47\nVisa USA.........................       172.25       167.85       340.10\nNational Retail Federation.......        28.50       204.78       233.28\nAmerican Financial Services              38.84       155.73       194.57\n Association.....................\nMastercard International.........        11.60        82.60        96.65\nConsumer Bankers Association.....        10.25        13.00        23.25\n                                  --------------------------------------\n      Total (in millions)........        $2.52        $4.74        $7.37\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Numbers don't add up because some contributions went to non-\n  partisan causes.\nSources: The Center for Responsive Politics, Federal Election\n  Commission.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE.

The bill has already been approved by the House, \n     and Mr. Bush has pledged to sign it.\n       Sponsors of the bill acknowledge that lawyers and lobbyists \n     for the banks and credit card companies were involved in \n     drafting it. The bill gives those industries most of what \n     they have wanted since they began lobbying in earnest in the \n     late 1990's, when the number of personal bankruptcies rose to \n     record levels.\n       In his final weeks in office, President Bill Clinton vetoed \n     an identical bill, describing it as too tough on debtors. But \n     with the election of Mr. Bush and other candidates who \n     received their financial support, the banks and credit card \n     industries saw an opportunity to quickly resurrect the \n     measure.\n       In recent weeks, their lawyers and lobbyists have jammed \n     Congressional hearing rooms to overflowing as the bill was \n     redebated and reapproved. During breaks, there was a common, \n     almost comical pattern. The pinstriped lobbyists ran into the \n     hallway, grabbed tiny cell phones from their pockets or \n     briefcases and reported back to their clients, almost always \n     with the news they wanted to hear.\n       ``Where money goes, sometimes you see results,'' \n     acknowledged Representative George W. Gekas, a Pennsylvania \n     Republican who was a sponsor of the bill in the House. But \n     Mr. Gekas said that political contributions did not explain \n     why most members of Congress and Mr. Bush appeared ready to \n     overhaul the bankruptcy system.\n       ``People are gaming this system,'' Mr. Gekas said, \n     describing the bill as an effort to end abuses by people who \n     are declaring bankruptcy to wipe out their debts even though \n     they have the money to pay them. ``We need bankruptcy \n     reform.''\n       Among the biggest beneficiaries of the measure would be \n     MBNA Corporation of Delaware, which describes itself as the \n     world's biggest independent credit card company. Ranked by \n     employee donations, MBNA was the largest corporate \n     contributor to the Bush campaign, according to a study by the \n     Center for Responsive Politics, an election research group.\n       MBNA's employees and their families contributed about \n     $240,000 to Mr. Bush, and the chairman of the company's bank \n     unit, Charles M. Cawley, was a significant fund-raiser for \n     Mr. Bush and gave a $1,000-a-plate dinner in his honor, the \n     center said. After Mr. Bush's election MBNA pledged $100,000 \n     to help pay for inaugural festivities.\n       MBNA was obviously less enthusiastic about the candidacy of \n     former Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Bush's Democratic rival; \n     according to the center, only three of the company's \n     employees gave money to the Gore campaign, and their \n     donations totaled $1,500.\n       The center found that of MBNA's overall political \n     contributions of $3.5 million in the last election 86 percent \n     went to Republicans, 14 percent to Democrats. The company, \n     which did not return phone calls for comment, made large \n     donations to the Senate campaign committees of both political \n     parties--$310,000 to the Republicans, $200,000 to the \n     Democrats.\n       MBNA's donations were part of a larger trend within the \n     finance and credit card industries, which have widely \n     expanded their contributions to federal candidates as they \n     stepped up their lobbying efforts for bankruptcy overhaul.\n       According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the \n     industries' political donations more than quadrupled over the \n     last eight years, rising from $1.9 million in 1992 to $9.2 \n     million last year, two-thirds of it to Republicans.\n       Kenneth A. Posner, an analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean \n     Witter, said that the bankruptcy bill would mean billions of \n     dollars in additional profits to creditors, and that it would \n     raise the profits of credit card companies by as much as 5 \n     percent next year. In the case of MBNA, that would mean \n     nearly $75 million in extra profits in 2002, based on its \n     recent financial performance.\n       The bill's most important provision would bar many people \n     from getting a fresh start from credit card bills and other \n     forms of debt when they enter bankruptcy. Depending on their \n     income, it would bar them from filing under Chapter 7 of the \n     bankruptcy code, which forgives most debts.\n       Under the legislation, they would have to file under \n     Chapter 13, which would require repayment, even if that meant \n     balancing overdue credit card bills with alimony and child-\n     support payments.\n       Consumer groups describe the bill as a gift to credit card \n     companies and banks in exchange for their political largess, \n     and they complain that the bill does nothing to stop abuses \n     by creditors who flood the mail with solicitations for high-\n     interest credit cards and loans, which in turn help drive \n     many vulnerable people into bankruptcy.\n       ``This bill is the credit card industry's wish list,'' said \n     Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard law professor who is a bankruptcy \n     specialist. ``They've hired every lobbying firm in \n     Washington. They've decided that its time to lock the doors \n     to the bankruptcy courthouse.''\n       The bill's passage would be evidence of the heightened \n     power of corporate lobbyists in Washington in the aftermath \n     of last year's elections, which left the White House and both \n     houses of Congress in the hands of business-friendly \n     Republicans.\n       Last week, corporate lobbyists had another important \n     victory when both the Senate and the House voted to overturn \n     regulations imposed during the Clinton administration to \n     protect workers from repetitive-stress injuries.\n       Credit card companies and banks would not be the only \n     interests served by the bankruptcy bill. Wealthy American \n     investors in Lloyd's of London, the insurance concern, have \n     managed through their lobbyists to insert a provision in the \n     bill that would block Lloyd's from collecting millions of \n     dollars that the company says it is owed by the Americans.\n       Lloyd's has hired its own powerful lobbyist, Bob Dole, to \n     help plead its case on Capitol Hill. Last week, the chief \n     executive of Lloyd's was in Washington to plot strategy.\n       The issue involves liabilities incurred by Lloyd's in the \n     1980's and 1990's when it was forced to pay off claims on \n     several disasters, like the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Investors \n     in Lloyd's are expected to share both its profits and its \n     losses, but the Americans have refused to settle the debts, \n     claiming they were misled by Lloyd's.\n       As he watched consumer-protection amendments to the \n     bankruptcy bill fail by lopsided margins last week, Senator \n     Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the \n     Judiciary Committee and a leading critic of the bill, said \n     that colleagues had told him privately that they were \n     ``committed to the banks and credit card companies--and they \n     are not going to change.\n       ``Some of them do this because they think it's the right \n     thing to do,'' Mr. Leahy said.\n       But he said other senators were voting for the bill because \n     they know that the banks and credit card companies ``are a \n     very good source'' of political contributions. ``I always \n     assume senators are doing things for the purest of motives,'' \n     he added, his voice thick with sarcasm. ``But I have never \n     had credit card companies show up at my fund-raisers, and I \n     don't think they ever will.''\n       Mr. Gekas said the implication that money was buying \n     support for the bankruptcy bill was insulting, and that the \n     bill did most consumers a favor by ending practices by some \n     debtors that had forced up interest rates for everybody else. \n     ``Bankruptcies are costly to all of us who don't go \n     bankrupt,'' Mr. Gekas said.\n       In the late 1990's, banks, credit card industries and \n     others with an interest in overhauling the bankruptcy system \n     formed a lobbying group, the National Consumer Bankruptcy \n     Coalition, for the purpose of pushing a bankruptcy-overhaul \n     bill through Congress.\n       They said they needed to act to deal with what was then a \n     record number of personal bankruptcy filings. According to \n     court records, the number of personal bankruptcies hit nearly \n     1.4 million in 1998, a record up from 718,000 in 1990. The \n     number fell to just under 1.3 million last year, although it \n     is expected to rise again if the economy continues to sour.\n       The coalition's founders included Visa and Mastercard, as \n     well as the American Financial Services Association, which \n     represents the credit card industry, and the American Bankers \n     Association.\n       The Center for Responsive Politics found that the \n     coalition's members contributed more than $5 million to \n     federal parties and candidates during the 1999-2000 election \n     campaign, a 40 percent increase over the last presidential \n     election.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. By the way, there was also a piece on this on National \nPublic Radio this morning. There is another piece by Mr. Samuelson in \nthe Washington Post this morning. His argument is that it is not so \nmuch that it is a bad bill--I think because I had to skim read it; I \nwas in a rush--he was saying that at a time with an economic downturn, \nthere may now be more people filing bankruptcy. Actually, it has fallen \noff over the last year and a half, but that may happen again, and we \nare going to make it really difficult for a whole lot of people in very \ndifficult economic circumstances to rebuild their lives. Mr. Samuelson \nwas saying he questioned the timing of this bill.\n  The New York Times piece is: ``Lobbying On Debtor Bill Pays \nDividend.'' That is a headline that should give ordinary citizens, the \npeople of Minnesota and the country, a whole lot of faith in our \npolitical process. ``Lobbying On Debtor Bill Pays Dividend'':\n\n       A lobbying campaign led by credit card companies and banks \n     that gave millions of dollars in political donations to \n     members of Congress and contributed generously to\n\n[[Page S2283]]\n\n     President Bush's 2000 campaign is close to its long-sought \n     goal of overhauling the Nation's bankruptcy system.\n\n  It goes on to talk about all of the breaks the credit card industry \nis going to get, that all of the money they put into politics is going \nto pay a huge dividend in terms of support.\n  By the way--this is interesting as well--while I probably have been \none of the strongest critics of President Clinton, it is interesting \nthat this piece about the support from all of the financial \ncontributions paying off--I think one reason my colleagues are in such \na rush to pass this bill is to show now we have a President who is \ngoing to sign the bill as opposed to veto the bill because we could not \noverride the veto.\n  President Clinton, wherever you are, with whatever kind of tough \nstories you have had to deal, with whatever you have done by way of \npardons that may not be right that I do not agree with, I want you to \nknow that as a Senator I thank you for standing up to all of these big \ncontributors, to all of these interests, to the financial services \nindustry. It wasn't easy to do, and you did it. Thank you, President \nClinton.\n  I am not at all surprised President Bush cannot wait to sign this \nbill. This is his crowd, as my good friend Fritz Hollings from South \nCarolina would say. This is his crowd. I am sure he cannot wait to sign \nthe bill.\n  Let me go to this amendment which I do not think my colleagues want \nto vote on up or down. I thought when I modified it we had at least an \nimplicit understanding we would have an up-or-down vote, but they do \nnot want to vote on this amendment, and I do not blame them. I would \nnot want to vote against this amendment either.\n  This amendment is an amendment that deals with the predatory lending \nwhich targets low- and moderate-income families.\n  This bankruptcy ``reform'' bill, does it have much that deals with \npredatory lending practices? No. Does it call on the credit card \nindustry--broadly defined--to perhaps take some accountability for \npumping credit cards on our children and all sorts of other people who \nthen find themselves in trouble and have to file for bankruptcy? No.\n  I will tell you what it does do. It makes it very difficult for a \nwhole lot of people who find themselves in desperate financial straits \nto file for chapter 7, and, for that matter, it goes beyond the means \ntest. There are provisions in this 50-page bill plus that make it \nreally hard for ordinary people to get relief and rebuild their lives. \nThat is absolutely outrageous.\n\n  I believe somebody needs to challenge this rush to get this done. We \nmay have a cloture vote. We are going to have a cloture vote this \nafternoon, I take it. Colleagues should vote against it. There are a \nnumber of Senators who want to have amendments and want to have a vote \non amendments, and they are right.\n  By the way, I did not file for cloture. That was the majority leader. \nMy understanding is there is going to be a cloture vote, and my \nunderstanding is Senators would have a chance to have votes on their \namendments. That was my understanding. That is what should happen. \nThere are some substantive amendments that deal directly with \nalternatives to this harsh bill.\n  I want to know why we are not going to have votes on those \namendments--I mean major amendments. And this amendment I think is also \na major amendment, but I know other colleagues, who have worked on this \nmany more years than I have and have more expertise, probably have even \nmore important amendments. What do you think about this one? This \namendment will prevent claims in bankruptcy on high-cost transactions \nin which the annual interest rate--if you are ready for this--exceeds \n100 percent. These are payday car title pawns. It is an extremely small \namount. These are low-income folks who pay this price who are having a \ndifficult time because someone was ill and had to go to the doctor and \nthey do not have much margin month to month. Go for a loan and you are \nextended a small amount, $100 to $500, for an extremely short time, 1 \nor 2 weeks. The loans are marketed as giving the borrower a little \nextra until payday.\n  The loan works like this, if you can believe these loan sharks, these \nvultures. The borrower writes a check for the loan amount, plus a fee. \nThe lender agrees to hold on to the check until the agreed upon date \nand give the borrower the cash. On the due date, the lender either \ncashes the check or, as quite often it happens, allows the borrower to \nextend the loan by writing a new check for the loan amount, plus an \nadditional fee. Calculated on an annual basis, these fees are \nexorbitant. For example, a $15 fee on a 2-week loan of $100 is an \nannual interest rate of 391 percent. Rates as high as 2,000 percent per \nyear have been reported on these loans.\n  Why in the world do we want to allow claims in bankruptcy for these \nkinds of credit transactions? Why are we in such a rush to support \nthese sleazy loan sharks? Can somebody come out on the floor of the \nSenate and tell me what the goodness is in what they do? Can somebody \ngive me one good argument why you don't want to vote up or down on this \namendment? I am indignant. I have to be careful not to get too hot. I \nam really angry.\n  Let me talk about the other area that is so egregious. Car title \npawns are 1-month loans secured by the title to the vehicle by the \nborrower. Please remember, Senators, these are not our sons and \ndaughters or brothers or sisters or our wives or husbands. I am talking \nabout poor people. We, luckily by the grace of God, or by luck of \nanother kind, are not in this position. We don't have to put our car up \nfor collateral. We don't live month by month on meager incomes and \ndesperate to get credit. That doesn't happen to us.\n\n  A typical title pawn costs 300 percent interest, and consumers who \nmiss the payments have their cars repossessed. In some States, \nconsumers do not receive the proceeds from the sale of the repossessed \nvehicle even if the value of the car exceeds the amount of the loan.\n  The Presiding Officer knows all about this because of his position in \nthe State of Florida. For example, a borrower might put up their $2,000 \ncar as collateral for a $100 car title loan and an outrageous interest \nrate, and if the borrower defaults, the lender can take the car, sell \nit, and keep the full $2,000 without returning the excess value to the \nborrower.\n  And we want to protect these loan sharks? Members don't want to vote \nfor this amendment? Members want to come second-degree this amendment? \nWhy?\n  These schemes actually are more lucrative if the borrower defaults. \nOften the borrower--are you ready for this?--is required to leave a set \nof keys to the car with the lender, and if the borrower is even 1 day \nlate with the payment, he or she might look out the window and find the \ncar is gone.\n  This amendment would prohibit claims in bankruptcy for credit \ntransactions such as these payday loans and car title pawns where they \ncharge over 100 percent interest in a year.\n  Could somebody explain to me why this is a bad amendment? Could \nsomebody defend these sleazy loan sharks? So far, no one has.\n  There is no question these high-interest-rate loans take advantage of \nworking people. On the face of it, paying 300 percent or 500 percent or \n800 percent for a $100 loan or $200 loan is unconscionable. No fully \ninformed person with a choice would do it. But that is exactly the \nissue: These folks may not always have a choice.\n  I am sorry I believe this has been happening over and over again in \nthe last couple of weeks. This is similar to the ergonomics standard. \nThis is a class issue. These are poor people we are talking about. None \nof us is ever put in this situation.\n  President Bush, whatever happened to compassionate conservatism? My \nRepublican colleagues, whatever happened to compassionate conservatism?\n  Often these borrowers turn to payday lenders and car title pawns \nbecause they can't get enough credit through the normal channels. So \nthese borrowers are a captive audience, unable to shop around to seek \nthe best interest rates, uninformed about choices, unprotected from \ncoercive collection practices.\n  I thank the Chair for having the graciousness to face me while I \nspeak. I always thought that was important. I thank the Chair. It is \nmuch harder to speak when the presiding Chair is reading or not paying \nattention. I thank the Chair for his graciousness. When I shout, I am \nnot shouting at the Presiding Officer.\n  There is no way the borrower can win. At best, they are robbed by \nhigh\n\n[[Page S2284]]\n\ninterest rates, and at worst their lives are ruined by the $100 loan \nwhich spirals out of control. These loans are patently abusive. They \nshould not be protected by a bankruptcy system. Because they are so \nextensive, they should be completely dischargeable in bankruptcy so the \ndebtors can get a true fresh start and so that more responsible \nlenders' claims are not crowded out by the shifty operators.\n  Colleagues, vote for this amendment because you are for responsible \nlenders. Vote for this amendment. I call this the responsible lender's \namendment. Why should unscrupulous lenders who have equal standing in \nbankruptcy court with a community bank or a credit union that tries to \ndo right by their customers? Why do we give equal value to these sleazy \nloan sharks with community banks or credit unions?\n\n  By the way, I don't think these lenders should be able to take \nadvantage of customers' vulnerability through harassment or coercion, \nbut that was considered to be a terrible provision. That challenged \njurisdiction in another committee, so I even dropped the language on \nthe coercive practices.\n  My amendment simply says if you charge interest over 100 percent on a \nloan, and if the borrower goes bankrupt, you cannot make a claim on \nthat loan or the fees from the loan. In other words, the borrower's \nslate is wiped clean of your usurious loan and he gets a fresh start.\n  Additionally, such lenders will be penalized if they try to collect--\nwell, no. See, there you go; there was my prepared statement. I \nshouldn't use a prepared statement. I was going to say, additionally \nsuch lenders will be penalized if they try to collect on their loan \nusing coercive tactics, but I have taken that out. That was the \nmodification my colleagues asked for, as if that would be such a \nterrible thing. And now I don't even get an up-or-down vote on the \namendment. That is my understanding.\n  This amendment is a commonsense solution to the problem I have \ndescribed. It allows the Senate to send a message to those loan sharks. \nIf you charge an outrageous interest rate, if you profit from the \nmisery and misfortune of others, if you stack the deck against the \ncustomers so they become virtual slaves to their indebtedness, you will \nget no protection in bankruptcy court for your claims.\n  As I say that, it sounds good to me. It really does. What is wrong \nwith this proposition? If a lender wants to make these kinds of loans \nunder this amendment, he or she can. But if he wants to be able to file \nclaims in bankruptcy, he can't charge more than 100 percent interest. I \ndon't believe any one of my colleagues will come to the floor to claim \nthat a 100-percent interest rate is an unreasonable ceiling.\n  This amendment is in the spirit of reducing bankruptcies. I think if \nit was adopted it would significantly improve the bill, and I urge its \nadoption.\n  I will deal with a few more questions that have been raised. I assume \nwe will have a debate on this. This whole bankruptcy bill and debate \nmake me uncomfortable because one of the Senators for whom I have the \ngreatest respect is Senator Grassley from Iowa--and he or another \nSenator may come out here. He is a great Senator, in my opinion. But I \nhave to say one of two things is going to happen. Senators are going to \ncome out here and say: Senator Wellstone, your amendment is all wrong. \nThese loan sharks need the protection. We are for the loan sharks. We \nare for the 100 percent interest-plus. Or they are going to come out \nwith a second-degree amendment which I fear will have the same effect \nbecause it will gut this amendment, in which case we will have a debate \nabout that.\n  But, so far, the silence has been deafening. I assume we will have \nthat debate or maybe it will be accepted; I don't know. We will have a \nvote one way or the other.\n  This amendment is necessary. For those who say some States are \nstarting to institute regulation of payday lenders--that is true, and I \nam glad; if States do more than we do, I am all for it--more and more \npayday loans are being made over the Internet, and they cannot be \neffectively regulated by the States. In addition, payday lenders have \nexplored using national bank charters to avoid State regulation. So \nboth tactics require a Federal response.\n  These payday lenders, if you are ready for this, are generating 35 \npercent to 50 percent. The fees are grossly disproportionate to the \nrisk or the profit margins would not be so high. We are talking about \nloan sharks who feed off misery and illness, all too often, and \ndesperation, and low- and moderate-income people, many of them families \nheaded by single parents, many of them families headed by women, many \nof them people of color, many of them urban, many of them rural--and we \nought to be willing to stand up for these people.\n  This amendment challenges Senators: Are you on the side of these \nsleazy loan sharks? Or are you willing to defend poor people in the \nUnited States of America?\n  I am not holding the Senate up. I am waiting for the debate.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 37\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to bring up my amendment No. 37, and I then be allowed to \nwithdraw the amendment No. 37 which relates to trade adjustment \nassistance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President and my good friend from Montana, the \nreason that I offered this amendment previously is because the crisis \nthat we are facing in the steel industry in general is having a \nparticularly devastating effect on workers in my state--and also, quite \nfrankly in the state of Michigan as well.\n  In the northeastern part of Minnesota--an area we call the Iron \nRange--a material called taconite is mined and then becomes an input \ninto the steel production process. Taconite is basically iron ore; it's \ncrushed, melted in blast furnaces, and then cast to be used to produce \nfinished steel products.\n  As you know, the steel industry is highly integrated. To make \nfinished steel products, producers can purchase semi-finished steel or \nthey can make their own semi-finished steel with taconite or iron ore. \nDue to the recent surge in dumped semi-finished steel slab imports it \nhas become cheaper for steel mills to import this steel and finish it \nrather than make their own. This, coupled with the general decline in \nthe U.S. steel industry, has had a devastating effect on taconite \nworkers in my state and in Michigan. Just one example of many that I'm \nsure you're familiar with is LTV Corp's announcement in December that \nit was filing for bankruptcy.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this document, which sets forth the \nchronology of the major layoffs, shutdowns, etc. that have been \ndevastating working families in the Iron Range of my state, printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Chronology of Worker Dislocation in the Taconite Industry on the Iron \n                           Range in Minnesota\n\n       In December 1999 the Iron Mining Association of Minnesota \n     (IMA) reported that 5,760 workers were employed in taconite \n     plants in Minnesota. After the announced cuts described below \n     take effect, our projections show that there will be \n     approximately 4,480 workers employed in this industry. That's \n     more than 1,200 workers laid off in one year.\n       Below is a chronology of the worker dislocation we have \n     been experiencing.\n       1. On May 24, 2000, the LTV Corp. announced its plan to \n     permanently close the taconite plant in Hoyt Lakes. There are \n     1,400 people who work at this plant.\n       2. On December 29, 2000, LTV, the Nation's third leading \n     producer of basic steel, filed for bankruptcy court \n     protection.\n       3. On December 31, 2000, National Steel Pellet Co. laid off \n     15 hourly workers and 7 salaried staff members.\n       4. On January 28, 2001, Hibbing Taconite announced a six-\n     week shut down, idling about 650 hourly workers.\n       5. On February 16, 2001, Minnesota Twist Drill laid off 64 \n     of 195 full-time employees.\n       6. On February 19, 2001, Hibbing Taconite announced the \n     elimination of between 29 and 38 salaried positions.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, the difficulty, and the reason I \noffered my\n\n[[Page S2285]]\n\namendment, is that the previous Administration had an inconsistent \nrecord with respect to recognizing U.S. iron ore workers' eligibility \nto receive Trade Adjustment Assistance, despite the fact that they are \nclearly being injured by unfairly traded steel imports. In its most \nrecent decision, involving a different taconite producer, a \ndetermination was made that low grade iron ore is not ``like or \ndirectly competitive with'' semi-finished steel slabs. I remain hopeful \nthat a new Administration, taking a fresh look at this issue, will \nresolve the issue differently. Meanwhile, however, I was offering this \namendment to make it explicit that taconite workers will be eligible to \nreceive the trade adjustment assistance they so clearly need.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to begin by saying that I am very \nsympathetic to the plight of taconite workers described by Senator \nWellstone. Unfortunately, the situation is not at all unusual. Taconite \nworkers are an example, and unfortunately not an isolated example, of \nthe fate of workers who supply critical inputs to American industries \nthat face stiff import competition.\n  When American workers lose their jobs because their production is \nreplaced by imports of ``like or directly competitive articles,'' we \nhelp those workers through the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. TAA \nprovides extended unemployment benefits, retraining benefits, and job \nsearch and relocation benefits to workers who lose their jobs through \nthe effects of trade. I am and have been a strong supporter of the \nTrade Adjustment Assistance Program for many years. But the present TAA \nprogram helps only the workers whom the Department of Labor determines \nproduce the same product that is being imported.\n  This year presents an opportunity to consider how the TAA program can \nbe more effective in meeting the needs of all workers who lose their \njobs as a result of import competition. That means recognizing that \ntrade-related job losses and dislocation are devastating for all \nworkers, no matter where they are in the overall production process.\n  The TAA program comes up for reauthorization this year. I think that \nis the right context for addressing the problem raised today. I want to \nassure my colleague Senator Wellstone that I would look favorably on \nexpanding the TAA program to cover workers, whenever imports from any \ncountry lead to job loss. In fact, we are already working on \nlegislation in the Finance Committee which would do just that. I invite \nSenator Wellstone to work with the Finance Committee in this effort and \nto testify before the Committee when we hold hearings on TAA later this \nyear. It is certainly my hope that we will be able to address the trade \nadjustment needs of taconite and other similarly situated workers, as \nwe work to reauthorize and expand the TAA program this year.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President and my colleagues, the Senior Senator from \nMinnesota, Senator Wellstone and Senator Baucus from Montana, I \nappreciate Senator Baucus' candor in recognizing that taconite workers \nhave been inconsistently treated in the Department of Labor's \ndefinition of workers, eligible for Trade Adjustment Assistance. The \nefforts of taconite workers, from the Iron Range of Minnesota, to \nobtain relief from reduced production of semi-finished steel slab and \nsteel plant closings, have been frustrated by how the Department of \nLabor considers the taconite industry. This is the reason Senator \nWellstone and I introduced the Taconite Workers Relief Act. This bill \nunderscores what I believe is certain: that taconite production is an \nessential part of an integrated steel-making process. Steel, no matter \nwhere it is made, is produced by a process initiated by iron ore or \ntaconite pellets. Taconite pellets are melted in blast furnaces and \nthen blown with oxygen to make steel. Every ton of imported \nsemifinished steel displaces 1.3 tons of iron ore in basic domestic \nsteel production.\n  In Minnesota, in the mid-1990's, seven operating taconite mines and \n6,000 workers produced 45 million tons of taconite, which is 70 percent \nof the nation's supply. Today, the painful reality is that production \ncutbacks have ravaged the United States' iron ore industry. Northshore \nMining Company announced that it would cut 700,000 tons of production; \nU.S. Steel's Minntac plant is cutting 450,000 tons; and the Hibbing \nTaconite Company is cutting 1.3 million tons of production.\n  On December 29, 2000 LTV, the third largest steel producer in the \nUnited States, filed for bankruptcy, bringing the number of steel \nproducing companies under Chapter 11 protection to nine. The closing of \nLTV permanently eliminates 8 million tons of production and 1,400 jobs \nin Minnesota. I am sure that the pain of unemployed steelworkers in \nMinnesota, and the fear of those who face an uncertain future, is \nmirrored among steelworkers in northern Michigan. This is the reason \nwhy Senators Levin and Stabenow are also cosponsors of the Taconite \nWorkers Relief Act.\n  The men and women of the Iron Range, who have worked for generations \nin the iron ore mines of northeastern Minnesota, are members of long \nstanding in the union of the United Steelworkers of America. These are \nhard working people who believe that America's steel industry is a \nbasic industry, essential to the economic and national security of our \ncountry. These are people, with an unwavering work ethic, who \nunderstand that the steel industry is highly integrated, and who \nbelieve they are part of that industry. This is the reason I want to \nwork to ensure the Department of Labor clearly recognizes the \neligibility of taconite workers for TAA, and I also believe that \neligibility should be retroactive to include workers permanently laid \noff in the past year.\n\n  I commend the leadership of Senator Baucus in offering to support the \nexpansion of TAA to cover taconite workers. I stand firmly on the \nprinciple that taconite workers must be treated equally at the trade \ntable, and in the definition of eligibility for trade adjustment \nassistance. The opportunity the Senator has offered within the context \nof reauthorizing TAA is a wise strategy. I will join the Senator in \nworking hard to eliminate any question there may be about the \nimportance of taconite as part of an integrated steel industry.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank Senator Wellstone and Senator Dayton for their \ndetailed and thoughtful presentation of the situation of taconite \nworkers in Minnesota and Michigan. I also welcome their willingness to \nwork with me and the Finance Committee on the reauthorization and \nexpansion of the TAA program.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I concur with my colleagues that the \nTrade Adjustment Assistance Act needs a thorough review to protect \nworkers who lose their jobs or income as a result of import \ncompetition. I am committed to a top to bottom review of the Act this \nyear and to work with members to make the necessary changes.\n  The amendment (No. 37) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Utah and I have been working together \non a managers' package. We might be able to move that forward. We are \nnot right at that spot yet.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator would just withhold, how long does the \nSenator wish to speak? We are about to do a unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. KERRY. I don't know exactly. About 10 minutes or so.\n  Mr. REID. Fine. It will take us that long to get things in order.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I could say to my colleague, with his indulgence, I \ncertainly will not object, but I want to make it clear, because we are \nalso in the middle of something else, that I have an amendment out \nhere. I have been debating it. I am ready to hear somebody else debate \nit. I am ready to\n\n[[Page S2286]]\n\nhave a vote. I am not holding anything up. Democrats have a number of \namendments to this bill that should be offered, debated, and voted on.\n  I question what is going on here.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am not sure which dog I have in this \nfight at the moment. I appreciate what the Senator from Minnesota is \ntrying to accomplish. I gather that various people are trying to work \non that. I certainly don't want to interrupt the flow. I will speak. If \nat some moment the Senate needs to move back to business, I will \nobviously be happy to do so.\n  (The remarks of Mr. KERRY are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I want to accommodate two colleagues \nwho are on the floor, Senator Levin and Senator Biden, but I want to \njust be clear about what is going on here. It is 2:30. I have been \nasking for a vote on the amendment. Eight other Democrats have \namendments on which they would like to have votes.\n  The strategy on the other side is to not have votes and basically \nshut this down with a cloture vote. I want to be clear about this.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be voted on within the next \n30 minutes--first of all, voted on within the next 30 minutes, with no \nsecond-degree amendments.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have to object to that unless we can work \nout some matters that have to be worked out.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I may go on, I was going to go on and ask unanimous \nconsent that the managers' package be dealt with--I would not think \nthat would require a rollcall vote--and that the pending Durbin \namendment No. 93 be dealt with. But I would like to say to Democrats--\nand this is not aimed at my colleague from Utah--this is a violation of \nan agreement that we had.\n  Last week, the majority leader came out here on a motion to proceed. \nI blocked it. We talked about it and said we would have substantive \ndebate. We were given the assurance that before any cloture vote, we \nwould have the opportunity to have our amendments down here and voted \non. I have come out here with an amendment. I have not delayed at all. \nI still can't get a vote on this amendment after 3 days. You have \nsomeone such as Senator Durbin, who has been working as hard on \nbankruptcy as anybody, who can't get a vote on his amendment. This \ncloture motion should not have been filed. It is in violation of the \nagreement that was made. Any number of us are not having the \nopportunity to have up-or-down votes.\n  Frankly, I would not want a vote on behalf of these payday lenders, \nthese sleazeball shark lenders, myself. We ought to have a vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, Mr. President, as the Senator \nknows, we have been here for almost 2 weeks on this bill. This is a \nbill that has been modified. Some of the amendments of the other side \nhave been agreed to. Some have been on the floor.\n  This bill passed 70-28 last December. Frankly, there appears to us to \nbe an effort to have amendment after amendment, and some of these \namendments are not even germane. In fact, quite a few of them are not \ngermane. Our side exercised a prerogative of the rules to file cloture, \nto end what really is a debate that is going out of bounds.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. HATCH. Excuse me, if I may finish. I would have preferred not to \nhave filed cloture. I would have preferred to agree to a small number \nof amendments and we go forward on those amendments and then have a \nvote on final passage, but we were not able to get that agreement, or \nat least have not been able to up to now. As far as I know, there is \nonly one Senator stopping that agreement.\n  I say this to my distinguished friend from Minnesota: As far as I am \nconcerned, I have no real objection to the Senator proceeding on his \namendment and having a vote prior to the cloture vote. I prefer to \nvitiate the cloture vote. If the Senator feels aggrieved, I am going to \ntry to accommodate him, but I hope our colleagues on both sides will be \nwilling to work with us to get this bill completed because it is an \nimportant bill.\n  Yes, there are a variety of viewpoints in this bill, but this is a \nvery important bill. We believe we have bent over backwards to try to \nwork it out with both sides in this matter.\n  I ask unanimous consent--I hope the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota will listen--that a vote occur in relation to the pending \nWellstone amendment No. 36, as I understand it, as modified, at 3:40 \np.m. today, and the time between now and then be equally divided and no \nsecond-degree amendments be in order prior to the vote, and at some \npoint it be in order to lay aside the amendment for up to 5 minutes for \nconsideration of a managers' amendment.\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I appreciate the Republicans \nallowing a vote on the amendment of the Senator from Minnesota. We have \nnow approximately 1 hour 5 minutes. I am told the Senator from \nMinnesota wishes to speak an additional period of time on his \namendment. The Senator from Delaware, who is the ranking member on the \nForeign Relations Committee----\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, that is fine.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Michigan is here to talk about something \nhe worked out with the chairman and ranking member. I wonder if we can \nmake sure they all have an opportunity to speak. I ask the Senator from \nMinnesota how he feels about that.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am sorry, I did not hear.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator have a problem with Senator Levin having 5 \nminutes and the Senator from Delaware 15 minutes prior to the vote at 4 \np.m. because there are no another amendments being offered prior to \nthat time?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Reserving the right to object, I ask my colleague from \nUtah whether I may amend his unanimous consent request to assure that \nthe managers' package be accepted or voted on and that the Durbin \namendment be out here. If I may--I have the floor, if I may finish for \na moment. I want to let my colleagues speak. It is an outrageous \nproposition here. I am not just speaking about my own amendment. I want \na vote on my own amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. If I may finish, and then I will take a question. I \nwant to know why, No. 1--maybe there is something I do not know--I want \nto know whether or not there is a commitment that the managers' \namendment will be accepted before we get a cloture vote and it gets \nclotured out, and I want to know why Senator Durbin, who has worked on \nthis bill long before I understood the issue, cannot bring it out. I \nwant a vote. I have been trying to have a vote on it for days. I am \nready to have Senator Biden and Senator Levin speak and have a vote on \nmy amendment right away. I want to know why.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be disposed of at 3:40 p.m. \nand also Senator Durbin be allowed to come to the floor and debate his \namendment and have a vote on the Durbin amendment as well after 3:40 \np.m. and that we either have a voice vote or recorded vote on the \nmanagers' package before the cloture vote.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator yield for a comment?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I am not going to yield the floor, but I----\n  Mr. HATCH. You already yielded the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me accommodate my colleague.\n  I am trying to accommodate the Senator. I am trying to be reasonable, \nand I am trying to make this matter acceptable. We have a cloture vote \nat 4. I am willing to accommodate the Senator so he can have a debate \non his amendment equally divided until 3:40 when we vote on the \namendment.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, will----\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me finish. Then we will vote on that amendment, as \nmodified. As I understand it, Senator Levin wants to speak--is that \ncorrect?--for 5 minutes, and Senator Biden wants to speak for how much \ntime?\n  Mr. BIDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n\n[[Page S2287]]\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I will be happy to without losing my right to the floor.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I am not standing here seeking recognition to speak, \nalthough I would like to do that at whatever time is convenient, but I \nask the question: Isn't it fair that the request--and I strongly \ndisagree with Senator Wellstone's characterization of this bill, and I \nstrongly disagree with Senator Durbin's characterization of this bill, \nbut are they not entitled to have a vote? I am standing here to support \ntheir right to have a vote before cloture. I thought that was the \ngeneral understanding, that we would have the ability to vote on both \nthose amendments before cloture.\n  I do not understand why they are not being given that right. Again, I \nstrongly disagree with both of them. I think there has even been a \nlittle bit of demagoguery on the bill. I resent some of the ways they \nhave characterized the positions of some of us who support the bill, \nbut I think they have a right to have a vote on their amendments. I \nthought there was an understanding.\n  My question is: Was there not an understanding that we would be \nvoting today prior to cloture on some of these amendments that would be \nkicked out by cloture if cloture were invoked?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BIDEN. I cannot yield. The Senator from Utah has the floor. I \nasked a question so I cannot yield. That is my question.\n  Does it also not make sense for the legitimacy of the cloture vote to \nlet them have their votes on both those amendments?\n  Mr. HATCH. I am not aware of the promise to Senator Durbin, but I am \ntrying to accommodate the distinguished Senator. We have a limited time \nprior to the cloture vote.\n  Mr. BIDEN. I ask unanimous consent----\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator withhold?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Will the Senator withhold before I ask unanimous consent \nmyself? I am trying to accommodate the distinguished Senator from \nMinnesota. If Senator Durbin wants to come to the floor and do his \namendment, personally I do not have any objection to that. Let me check \nwith our side and make sure we can do that, as long as we have an \nopportunity to amend the Durbin amendment.\n  Would it be possible to cut down the time so we could accommodate \nboth amendments before the vote?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Absolutely. That has been my point.\n  Mr. HATCH. If you will be willing to take less time, we can allow 5 \nminutes for Senator Levin; and how much time does the Senator from \nDelaware need?\n  Mr. BIDEN. If the Senator will yield, I am not asking for any time to \nspeak on NATO--that is what I want to speak on--because I thought this \nwas a dead period. It is kind of a dead period for different reasons.\n  I ask the Senator to consider the request. If the Senator from \nMinnesota is willing to knock down his time--the Senator can speak for \nhimself--the staff of the Senator from Illinois tells me he will be \nwilling to cut down his time as well so they both can get a vote on \ntheir amendments prior to 4 o'clock.\n  What I am asking the Senator from Utah, whom I support on this bill, \nis to give them a chance, if they will cut down their time, to have a \nvote on both of their amendments. That is my request of the Senator \nfrom Utah. They are both here and can speak for themselves, obviously, \nbetter than I can.\n  Mr. HATCH. Let me suggest the absence of a quorum, and I will \nimmediately see if I can get this done.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator withhold so I may speak?\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Michigan be \ngiven 5 minutes and then the floor come back to me at the conclusion of \nhis remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Utah. I was \ngoing to offer an amendment on behalf of Senator Feinstein and myself. \nIt is amendment No. 91 at the desk. It is similar to an amendment \nadopted last Congress during debate of the bankruptcy bill, which was \ndeleted during negotiations with the House of Representatives. I am not \ngoing to offer this as an amendment to this year's bankruptcy bill but, \nrather, introduce it as a freestanding bill because of the agreement of \nSenator Gramm, who is the chairman of the Banking Committee, to hold a \nhearing on our bill when it is filed as a freestanding bill.\n  When it is introduced, it will be referred to his committee. However, \nI want to spend 1 or 2 minutes explaining what this amendment is all \nabout.\n  What credit card companies do now is charge interest to people, even \nthough they pay part of their indebtedness on time.\n  It would be fine if they were just charging interest on part of the \nindebtedness which was outstanding and not paid on time. That is \nperfectly appropriate. But if somebody, for instance, starts with a \nzero balance, charges $1,000 on their credit card, pays $900 on time by \nthe due date, then that person is not only charged interest on the $100 \nowed, that person is charged interest on the full $1000, even the part \nof his bill that is paid by the due date.\n  I don't know any other situation where somebody who pays an \nobligation on time is nonetheless charged interest on the part that is \npaid.\n  Again, our bill will address this by addressing the imposition of \ninterest for on-time payments during the so-called ``grace period.'' \nCurrently, credit card lenders use complicated definitions of ``grace \nperiod'' to allow interest charges for payments even if they are made \non time. Credit card lenders define ``grace period'' as applicable only \nif the balance is paid in full. Mastercard, for example, defines their \n``grace period'' as ``a minimum of 25 days without a finance charge on \nnew purchases if the New Balance if paid in full each month by the \npayment due date.'' That means that even if a person pays 90 percent of \nhis balance, he is still charged interest on money which is timely \npaid.\n  This is an overreach by the credit card companies. It should be \ncorrected by the credit card companies. Most credit card customers, \nwhen they send in a check to pay their credit card on time, fairly \nassume they will not be charged interest on the money paid. But in fact \nthey are, unless they happen to pay off the entire amount of their \nobligation. It is unfair. It is an overreach. It ought to be corrected \nby the credit card companies themselves. If it isn't, our bill will \ncorrect it for them.\n  Credit card companies are adding new and higher fees all the time in \nthe small print of their lending terms. According to Credit Card \nManagement, late fees, balance transfer fees, over-limit fees, and \nother penalty fees were a source of $5.5 billion in revenue for credit \ncard companies in 1999, up from $3.1 billion in 1995.\n  Hopefully, the credit card companies will correct this overreach \nthemselves, and this bill will not be necessary, but the chairman of \nthe Banking Committee has indicated he is willing to hold a hearing on \nthis bill and on similar practices by the credit card companies that \nmight be brought to the attention of the Banking Committee, and based \non that agreement by the Senator from Texas, I will not be offering \nthis amendment on the bankruptcy bill but instead will be offering a \nfreestanding bill on behalf of Senator Feinstein and myself.\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the Senator from Utah for yielding me this \ntime. I will not offer the amendment, and I withdraw the amendment at \nthis time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is recalled.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time prior \nto the vote in relation to the pending Wellstone amendment numbered 36, \nas modified, be limited to 10 minutes equally divided and no second-\ndegree amendments be in order prior to the vote, and following that \ntime, the amendment be laid aside and Senator Durbin be recognized to \ncall up his amendment No. 93, and following the reporting, Senator \nHatch be recognized to offer a second degree, and time on both \namendments be limited to 30 minutes equally divided.\n  Further, then, these votes occur first in relation to the second \ndegree to Durbin, then in relation to the Durbin amendment, as amended, \nif amended,\n\n[[Page S2288]]\n\nand finally in relation to the Wellstone amendment, with 2 minutes \nbetween each vote for explanation, and the votes to begin no later than \n3:20, and Senator Wellstone's time as previously ordered be limited to \n5 minutes, and the majority leader be recognized for 5 minutes just \nprior to cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I understood the unanimous consent, I can call up my \namendment numbered 93 at this time. At some point, Senator Hatch may \noffer a second degree.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent the Wellstone time be reserved to \nfollow the 30 minutes equally divided between Senator Durbin and \nmyself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 93\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I don't know the sequence, but I want to \nmake certain we are considering amendment No. 93 that I have offered. \nSenator Wellstone has a pending amendment as well. I am prepared to \nargue my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The amendment has been filed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment was called up earlier. It is \npending.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 96 to Amendment No. 93\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 96 to amendment No. 93.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I object, unless a copy is provided. We \nhave no idea what is in the amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. It is on your desk.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I do not object.\n  Mr. HATCH. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it took a few minutes to sort out what we \nare doing, and this is what it has come down to. I am offering an \namendment to the bill before us with a bankruptcy reform bill which was \nconsidered 2\\1/2\\ years ago in the Senate and passed by a vote of 97-1.\n  Senator Hatch has come back and said, instead, it is a take it or \nleave it deal. We have this bill that is presently before us--take it \nor leave it. That is what the choice will be for my colleagues in the \nSenate. But I encourage them to take a close look at the differences \nbetween the substitute I am offering and what is being considered today \nin this Chamber.\n  This bankruptcy debate has gone on for over 4 years. A very small \npercentage of Americans will never set foot in bankruptcy court, thank \nthe Lord, but those who do hope they will have a new day in their \nlives. Because of their income situations they cannot repay their \ndebts. Many of these people would love to repay their debts but, \nunfortunately, they have been faced with medical bills far beyond what \nany family could take care of. They might have gone through a divorce \nand found themselves with little or no income to raise a family and all \nthe bills finally stacked up and pushed them over the edge. They could \nface a situation where they have lost a job that they had for a \nlifetime and then they find themselves in bankruptcy court.\n  My colleague, Senator Grassley of Iowa, spoke eloquently, when I \noffered my bill, about the need for us to change the process so the \nSenate could have bankruptcy reform. Let me read a little bit of what \nSenator Grassley said in the Congressional Record of September 23, \n1998. He said:\n\n       Mr. President, first of all I want to thank everyone in \n     this body for the overwhelming vote of confidence on the work \n     that Senator Durbin and I have done on this bankruptcy bill. \n     Getting to this point has been a very tough process involving \n     a lot of compromise and a lot of refinement.\n\n  Senator Grassley went on to say:\n\n       You heard me say on the first day of debate that for the \n     entire time that I have been in the Senate that on the \n     subject of bankruptcy--maybe not on every subject, but the \n     subject of bankruptcy--there has been a great deal of \n     bipartisan cooperation . . . this legislation has always \n     passed with that sort of tradition.\n\n  About the amendment I am offering now, Senator Grassley went on to \nsay:\n\n       So I want to say to all of my colleagues that I not only \n     thank them for their support but, more importantly . . . that \n     tradition has continued. . . . I don't think we would have \n     had the vote that we had today if it had not been for the \n     bipartisanship that has been expressed. . . .\n\n  The vote was 97-1. The Grassley-Durbin bankruptcy reform had \noverwhelming bipartisan support. But, on two successive occasions, that \nbankruptcy bill went into a conference committee and, frankly, never \nemerged. What came back from the conference committee was a slam dunk, \nunbalanced, one-sided bankruptcy reform that favored credit card \ncompanies and financial institutions, and, frankly, did little or \nnothing for consumers and families across America.\n  I am pleased we have had this debate before us. But I tell you in the \nspirit that Senator Grassley spoke to the Members of the Senate on the \nfloor, I have offered the very bill which he and I worked on for so \nlong, the bill that passed so overwhelmingly. We already have before us \na thoroughly researched and broadly considered bill which was found \nacceptable to virtually every Member of this body in 1998. The bill \nbefore the Senate now, the Bankruptcy Reform Bill, is not a balanced \nbill. The bill we have before us today is one that is tipped decidedly \nin favor of credit card companies and banks.\n\n  There have been efforts made over the span of this debate to amend \nthis bill to give consumers a fighting chance. Those efforts have \nfailed. I have tried to offer an amendment, for example, which would \nrequire more complete disclosure on the monthly statements on credit \ncards. The credit card industry has refused. Why send a message to \nAmerica of how divided we are in bankruptcy reform instead of coming up \nwith a bipartisan bill that addresses the issue? The Senate can speak \nin a united, bipartisan voice, making clear we have reached a broad-\nbased consensus on bankruptcy reform.\n  Let me review a few of the major differences between the bills and \npoint out why I believe the bill I offer as a substitute is a much more \nbalanced approach, a decision made by 96 of my colleagues and myself \nwhen we last voted on this.\n  The Durbin amendment uses a means test that requires every debtor, \nregardless of income, who files for chapter 7 bankruptcy to be \nscrutinize by the U.S. Trustee to determine whether the filing is \nabusive. We want to stop abusive filings and those who would exploit \nthe bankruptcy court. The bill creates a presumption that a case is \nabusive if the debtor, the person who owes the debt, is able to pay a \nfixed percentage of unsecured nonpriority claims or a fixed dollar \namount.\n  In my home State of Illinois, the average annual income for \nbankruptcy filers in the Central District where I live in Springfield, \nin 1998, was $20,448. Yet the average amount of debt which people \nbrought into bankruptcy court was more than $22,000. It is clear that \nthese people were over the edge. You can't get blood out of a turnip. \nWhen the credit industry wants to keep pushing and pushing and pushing \nfor more and more money, they have lost sight of the reason for \nbankruptcy court. When people have reached the end of the road, it is \ntime to give them a fresh start.\n  This figure shows these filers were hopelessly insolvent. They owed \nmore money on debt than they had in collateral and their total income \nfor the entire year. They don't even come close to meeting the \nstandards where they would go through the scrutiny of this bill.\n  My amendment gives the courts discretion to dismiss or convert a \nchapter 7 bankruptcy case if the debtor can fund a chapter 13 repayment \nplan. What it means in simple language is this: If the court takes a \nlook at the person in bankruptcy court and says, ``You can pay back a \nsubstantial part of this debt, we are not going to let you off the hook \nentirely,'' the Durbin\n\n[[Page S2289]]\n\namendment says: Yes, the court can reach that decision. And that is an \nappropriate decision. Everybody should try in good faith to pay their \nbills.\n  But let us also concede there are some people who will never be able \nto repay these bills. Unfortunately, the amendment offered by Senator \nHatch is one that doesn't give that kind of latitude and flexibility.\n  My approach is cheaper, it is more flexible, it is more sensible, and \nit is more fair. What is the sense of applying a complicated means test \nto every bankruptcy filing when studies have clearly shown the types of \nmeans tests envisioned in the amendment of Senator Hatch would only \napply to a small fraction, far less than 10 percent of the people \nfiling bankruptcy? A study by the American Bankruptcy Institute put the \nfigure at 3 percent. That means that 100 percent of the people filing \nin bankruptcy court would have to go through a process that only \napplies to 3 percent of them.\n\n  Beyond the administrative costs, there is a lot of stress on poor \nfamilies in this approach. Let me tell you why I think this bill is \nalso balanced. I don't believe we should ration credit in America, but \nI believe as consumers and families across America you have a right to \nbe informed, well informed about what you are getting into with a \ncredit card. My amendment was more balanced in its approach. This bill \nbefore us, Senator Hatch's bill, does not approach credit card \ndisclosure in a meaningful way. This should be a primary objective of \nbankruptcy reform: Reform the bankruptcy court, but also end some of \nthe abuses of the credit card industry.\n  When you go home tonight and open the mail, you know what you are \ngoing to find--another credit card solicitation. If you happen to be a \ncollege student, you are a prime target for these credit card \ncompanies. They want to get students with limited or no income with \ncredit cards in hand, charging debts across the campus and around the \ntown, many of them finding themselves in over their head in no time at \nall.\n  If I want to take out a large loan at a reasonable interest rate, a \nfew thousand dollars, or $100,000 as the mortgage on my home, I have to \ngo through all kinds of scrutiny. The banks want to see my income tax \nforms, my bank statements, my pay stubs, and the like. But many of you \nknow when you want to apply for a credit card the same tests don't \napply.\n  We have heard a lot about the democratization of credit. On the one \nhand, it is a good thing; credit should be broadly available. The \nmarketplace should work in a way so everyone who needs credit has \naccess. But the pendulum has swung too far in the wrong direction. \nAccording to BAI Global, a market research firm in Tarrytown, NY, in \n1999 Americans received 3 billion mailings advertising credit cards. \nThat is more than three times the 900 million mailings in 1992, and \nthose are only the ones that go through the mail. We know there are \nInternet solicitations and television and radio solicitations and \nmagazine solicitations as well.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about the college students. At American \nUniversity here in Washington, DC, every time a student purchases \nsomething from the bookstore at American U, he or she gets this bag. At \nthe bottom of this bag are four--not one, but four--credit card \nsolicitations for these students every time they go into the bookstore.\n  Another college has a phone-in system for registering for class. That \nsounds pretty convenient. I can remember standing in long lines when I \nhad to register. But when the students come in, the first thing they \nhear from the university is a credit card solicitation. There is no \navoiding it. If they want to register for class, the first thing they \nhave to find out is whether they need a credit card. That is the most \nimportant question.\n\n  When I go to a University of Illinois football game, they wave a T-\nshirt at me: Do you want a free T-shirt? Sure. Well, all you have to do \nis sign up for a credit card.\n  Students are signing up. The dean of students tells us the No. 1 \nreason kids leave school--not because of academic failure--is because \nthey are in over their heads when it comes to credit cards.\n  That sort of thing is absolutely indefensible. When you consider the \nfact the median family income for chapter 7 bankruptcy filers has been \ndeclining, it tells us that more and more people of limited means are \ntaking out too many credit cards and getting in too far.\n  This bill that is being offered by the credit industry says several \nthings:\n  First, if you get in over your head and want to file for bankruptcy, \nit is going to be tough.\n  Think about this for a minute.\n  There was an interesting article which appeared today in the \nWashington Post that said, ``Bad timing on the bankruptcy bill.'' If we \nare worried about confidence, and if people are worried about making \npurchases, are we going to pass the Hatch-Grassley bankruptcy bill to \ntell people if they purchase something and get in over their heads they \nare not going to be able to get out of their debt in bankruptcy court? \nIs that supposed to restore consumer confidence? Just the opposite is \ngoing to be true.\n  I think the writer of this, Robert Samuelson, makes a very good \npoint.\n  One of the provisions I think we should consider is that consumers \nhave more information on their monthly bill they receive from a credit \ncard company--something that is clear and understandable and not \nambiguous. The credit industry that wrote the bill before us said they \nwill say to consumers across America that they will give them an 800 \ntelephone number so they can call if they have any questions about the \ncredit card.\n  When you go home tired at night and are fighting all the phone calls \ncoming in, you don't want anyone to say they will give you an 800 \ntelephone number.\n  What I suggested is something very simple, and it is a part of my \namendment. I have a little show and tell. Let me demonstrate it.\n  This is a credit card statement that came to one of the people in my \noffice. As you can see, it is pretty familiar to you. It has a second \npage with all of the things we read so carefully each month to figure \nout what the terms of the credit card are.\n  The concern I have is this whole question of the minimum monthly \npayment. I said to the credit card companies: When it comes to the \nminimum monthly payments on these monthly statements, could you be so \nkind as to say to the people who are being billed, if they make the \nminimum monthly payment and they don't increase their balance, how many \nmonths it will take for them to pay off the balance and how much will \nthey have paid in principal and interest.\n  I don't think that is an outrageous idea.\n  This is an example of what it might look like. This says, if you make \nthe minimum monthly payment, it will take you 8 months to pay off your \ncurrent balance, and the total cost to you will be approximately $9,407 \ninstead of the remainder of $5,435.\n\n  Do you know what the credit card companies told me when I suggested \nthey put this information on the monthly statement? ``Impossible.'' It \nis impossible for us to calculate if they made the minimum monthly \npayment how long it would take them to pay the principal and interest.\n  You know better and I know better. The technology and the computers \nare such that they can provide this in an instant. But they do not want \npeople to know this. Make the minimum monthly payment, and things are \ngoing to be just fine. When you get in too far, why don't you \n``consolidate your debt'' and get another credit card, and pretty soon \nyou are in over your head.\n  Pretty soon, if this bankruptcy bill passes, they will find when they \nwalk into bankruptcy court they will be stuck with these debts. They \ncannot get away from them.\n  This is the greatest boon to the credit industry that has ever been \npassed by the Senate. And we are about to do it today, if we don't \nadopt the Durbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Illinois has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I admire our colleague. He is very \narticulate. He is a very effective Member of this body.\n  We have filed an amendment to his amendment that basically, if we \nvote for it, would enact the bill we passed\n\n[[Page S2290]]\n\nlast year 72-28 in the Senate, which I think would be a fitting \nconclusion to what has gone on here over the last number of weeks. But \nI know it causes heartburn for our colleague from Illinois. So, as a \ncourtesy to him, I am going to withdraw my amendment at this time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my amendment be withdrawn. And we will \nhave a vote. I will move to table the Senator's amendment at the \nappropriate time, and I will also, if he needs more time for his \namendment, grant him some of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The amendment (No. 96) was withdrawn.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, let's understand the Senator's amendment. \nHis amendment does not have the Schumer language in it that was passed \nyesterday. It doesn't have the Schumer language on abortion in it that \nwe worked out very meticulously with the distinguished Senator from New \nYork. That is very important language.\n  It doesn't have the privacy language that Senator Leahy and the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont and I worked out over a long period \nof time. That is very critical language. Frankly, it is just an \namendment that would substitute the current legislation with the \nbankruptcy reform bill that passed the Senate in the 105th Congress.\n\n  This amendment by the distinguished Senator from Illinois is a \ntransparent attempt to kill bankruptcy reform. It was hastily produced \nand does not even include the amendments to keep it current; that is, \nsome of the bankruptcy judgeship provisions that have been overtaken by \nthem.\n  The Durbin amendment throws away 4 years of revision, compromise, and \nimprovement.\n  The Durbin amendment is lacking in several important areas:\n  The amendment has no enforceable means test;\n  The amendment does not include the improved child support provisions \nrequested by the child support community;\n  The amendment does not include the Leahy-Hatch ``Toysmart'' consumer \nprivacy amendment;\n  The amendment does not have the reaffirmation provisions in the \ncurrent bill which substantially improved consumer protections;\n  The amendment lacks the important consumer protections such as the \n``Debtors' Bill of Rights'';\n  The amendment does not include 4 years of improvements for the \nfinancial netting provision;\n  The amendment does not address the abuse of the bankruptcy system by \nthose who wish to discharge debts arising from violence; that is, the \nSchumer-Hatch compromise. That is a very important part of what we hope \nwill be the final bill.\n  The amendment has much weaker anti-fraud provisions, such as weakened \naudit provisions and being more tolerant of repeated abusive filings.\n  The amendment deletes current law provisions allowing the court to \nconsider charitable contributions when making a determination as to \nwhether the debtor's filing is an abuse.\n  The amendment does not provide for retroactive enactment of Chapter \n12 filings--farmers--from July 1, 2000 through the date of enactment.\n  The amendment would create an immediate effective date, which, given \nthe scope of the legislation, is wholly inappropriate.\n  The amendment lacks improvements to the small business bankruptcy \nprovisions in the bill.\n  This is a blatant effort to turn back the clock and force \nconsiderable renegotiation of provisions that have been negotiated in \ngood faith by literally hundreds of Senators and Congresspeople over \nthe last 4 years.\n  Make no mistake. A vote for this substitute is a vote to kill \nbankruptcy reform.\n  We oppose the Durbin amendment. I hope my colleagues on the other \nside will oppose it as well because basically it will upset everything \nwe have tried to do and tried to accommodate Democrats on and \nRepublicans on over the last 4 years.\n  A vote for this amendment is a vote against meaningful bankruptcy \nreform. I appreciate the fact the distinguished Senator believes deeply \nand he doesn't like this bill. He is one of a few who does not like \nthis bill. He is one of the 28 who voted against the bill when it \npassed last year. If anything, the bill from last year has been \nmodified with amendments from the other side.\n  The bill we ultimately, hopefully, will vote on and vote to invoke \ncloture on has been modified to please Members on the other side in a \nwide variety of ways.\n  We have tried to accommodate our friends on the other side. I \ncertainly believe I have been fair as the manager of the bill; and I \nintend to continue to be. But this amendment would work against almost \neverything we have tried to accomplish over the last 4 years.\n  With that, does the distinguished Senator need some time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, I do.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I do not know how much time is remaining, but if I could \nhave 10 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah has 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. Could I give the Senator 5 minutes, and I will take 4?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That would be fine. I thank the Senator from Utah for his \ncourtesy.\n  We have locked horns many times, but we are friends. I respect him \nvery much.\n  Every time Senator Hatch tells you there is a provision in the bill \nbefore us that is not included in the Durbin bill--believe me, every \ntime the credit industry gave us a morsel, they took away a beef steak. \nAnd that is what happened when it was all over.\n  The bill before us today is much worse on consumers in America than \nthe bill this Senate passed by a vote of 97-1. And though the Senator \nfrom Utah tells me how terrible my bill is, he voted for it. He voted \nfor it, as did most of the Senators who are here today.\n  Let me read to you some comments from people I think are worth \nrepeating. This first comment comes from David Broder. We know him. He \nis a respected journalist and is published in the Washington Post, and \nother newspapers. This is what he says about this bankruptcy bill I am \ntrying to replace:\n\n       As for the bankruptcy bill, it deserves the veto Clinton \n     gave it. Despite some useful provisions, it is an unbalanced \n     measure, which does nothing to curb the mass marketing of \n     credit cards to young and low-income people who perpetually \n     pay the exorbitant interest on their monthly balances. It \n     will squeeze money out of people who have been clobbered by \n     job losses, divorce or medical disasters, yet allow some \n     millionaires to plead bankruptcy while turning their assets \n     into mansions in states with unlimited homestead exemptions.\n       In both cases, money interests prevailed over the public \n     interest.\n\n  That was David Broder in this morning's Washington Post.\n  Lawrence King is a law professor at New York University. I quote him:\n\n       I fear this [bill] will end up creating an underground \n     economy. People will go off the books. They'll ask to be paid \n     in cash. They'll get a false Social Security number. They'll \n     move.\n       In my 40 years of dealing with Congress on bankruptcy \n     legislation, this is the worst I've ever seen. It's the kind \n     of bill that makes you want to point your fingers at \n     individual congressmen and say, ``Shame on you.''\n\n  This bill before us today is not balanced. If that credit industry \nwill not even include a provision on your monthly statement so you can \nmake an informed decision about the kind of debt which you and your \nfamily can face, it tells the whole story, as far as I am concerned.\n  What we have offered in this substitute is a carefully crafted and \nbalanced bill. It says the credit card companies have to end some of \ntheir abuses and that we believe that abuses in the bankruptcy court \nhave to end.\n  I salute my colleague and friend from New York, Senator Schumer. It \nis true that his language yesterday on predatory lending is a good \naddition to the bill. But I will tell him that the bill I am offering--\nthe one that passed 97-1--has my provision which directly attacks \npredatory lending.\n  Who are these predatory lenders? They are people who want a second \nmortgage on your grandmother's home, that turns into a balloon payment, \nthat turns into a foreclosure, that turns into a trip to bankruptcy \ncourt,\n\n[[Page S2291]]\n\nwhere the home she saved for for a lifetime is lost to these people, \nthese loan sharks, who take advantage of the system. Sadly, the \nfinancial and credit card industry came to the rescue of these loan \nsharks at the expense of elderly Americans who are being exploited by \nthem.\n  Senator Schumer's amendment has helped immeasurably. I assure those \nwho are listening to this debate that the Durbin amendment I have \noffered today has equally powerful language when it comes to ending \npredatory lending in the United States.\n  The credit industry and the financial industry oppose both measures. \nThat ought to tell you the whole story about what is before us.\n  We have precious few opportunities in the Congress--certainly on the \nfloor of this Senate--to consider any legislation to help consumers and \nfamilies across America. Passing the Durbin amendment will help them. \nIt will provide some balance to the bill. If we should defeat this \namendment and go back to the original bill--which is now before us--as \nDavid Broder and others have said, the net losers will be families \nacross America facing a slowdown in this economy, who fall behind in \ntheir debts and end up in bankruptcy court as the targets and as the \nvictims of the credit industry. That is a wrong move.\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in supporting this \namendment.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I will yield to the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, \nwithout losing my right to the floor, for the purpose of modifying his \namendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to modify amendment No. 51 with the modification I now send \nto the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The submitted amendment (No. 51), as modified, is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To strike section 1310, relating to barring certain foreign \n                               judgments)\n\n       On page 439, strike line 19 and all that follows through \n     page 440, line 12.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his courtesy \nand assistance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 93\n\n  Mr. HATCH. As I said before, the Durbin amendment would upset 4 solid \nyears of negotiations between both sides of the aisle on both sides of \nCapitol Hill. It is lacking in all kinds of areas. There is no \nenforceable means test. It does not include the improved child support \nprovisions that have been requested and desired by the child support \ncommunity. It does not have the Leahy-Hatch privacy language. It does \nnot have the reaffirmation provisions.\n  It lacks the Debtors' Bill of Rights. It lacks 4 years of \nimprovements in the financial netting provisions. It does not address \nthe abuse of the bankruptcy system by those who wish to discharge debts \narising from violence, the Schumer-Hatch compromise. It has much weaker \nantifraud provisions, such as weakened audit provisions. You can just \ngo on and on.\n  It deletes current law provisions in allowing the courts to consider \ncharitable contributions when making a determination as to whether the \ndebtor's filing is an abuse. It does not provide for retroactive \nenactment of chapter 12 filings that benefits our farmers from July 1, \n2000, to the date of enactment.\n  The amendment would create an immediate effective date which, given \nthe scope of the legislation, is wholly inappropriate, and it lacks \nimprovements to the small business bankruptcy provisions that are in \nthe bill currently before the Senate.\n  In my opinion, it is an attempt to turn back the clock and force \nconsiderable renegotiation of all of these provisions, and many other \nprovisions, that we have worked so hard to put together over the last 4 \nyears.\n  The bankruptcy bill is a bipartisan bill. It is not a Republican \nbill; it is not a Democrat bill. It is a bipartisan bill. We worked \nvery strongly all these years to bring it about. I have to say, there \nare certain Senators in this body who have a right to do this but who \nhave never wanted a change in the bankruptcy laws, at least the way the \nbill has been negotiated by the vast majority of people in both Houses \nof Congress. But a vote for this substitute is a vote to kill the \nbankruptcy bill.\n  I hope, after all of these years, and all of these months, and all of \nthe time we have spent on the floor on this bill, that my colleagues \nwill vote to table the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time and move to \ntable the amendment, and ask for the yeas and nays. And I ask unanimous \nconsent that the votes occur as we had in the original unanimous \nconsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. No. We have to wait until the Wellstone--my motion to \ntable has been approved?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair was in error. The unanimous consent \nagreement was that we now debate the Wellstone amendment.\n  Mr. HATCH. Right, before the motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to table has been made, and the \nrollcall vote will be ordered at the appropriate time.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 36, As Modified\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have spoken about this amendment for \nsome time. I have just a few minutes to summarize again. This is \nalready in the Record. In addition to the Broder piece that my \ncolleague, Senator Durbin, mentioned, I have the New York Times, \nTuesday, March 13, ``Lobbying on Debtor Bill Pays Dividend''; two \npieces by Tom Hamburger in the Wall Street Journal--``Auto Firms See \nProfit in Bankruptcy-Reform Bill Provision'' and ``Influence Market: \nIndustries That Backed Bush Are Now Seeking Return on Investment,'' \nincluding in bankruptcy. Also, another piece by Robert Samuelson, ``Bad \nTiming on the Bankruptcy Bill.''\n  Mr. President, I have an amendment that I think is a real test case. \nIt simply says, if you charge over 100 percent interest on a loan, and \nthe borrower goes bankrupt, you cannot make a claim on that loan or the \nfees from that loan. In other words, the borrower's slate is wiped \nclean of the usurious loan, and he gets a fresh start.\n\n  This amendment is a commonsense solution to the problem I have talked \nabout all afternoon. It allows the Senate to send a message to these \nloan sharks: If you charge an outrageous interest rate, if you profit \nfrom the misery and misfortune of others, if you stack the deck against \nthe customer so that they become virtual slaves to your indebtedness, \nyou will get no protection in bankruptcy court for your claims.\n  In talking about these payday loans, I say to my colleagues, these \nare poor people, low- and moderate-income people. They don't have other \nsources of credit. They get charged on these loans as they roll over \nevery several weeks up to 2,000 percent interest per year. Is it too \nmuch to say that if you charge over 100 percent per year, you are not \ngoing to get the protection in bankruptcy? Is it too much for the \nSenate to be on the side of consumers, to be on the side of poor \npeople?\n  This amendment is simple: Are we on the side of poor people? Do we \nprovide some protection--for a single woman who is raising her family, \nfor communities of color, senior citizens, working-income people who \nwere put under by these interest rates--or are we on the side of some \nof the sleaziest loan sharks?\n  I hope Senators will support this amendment. It certainly will make \nthis bill less harsh. It doesn't change the overall equation. This is a \ngreat bill for the credit card industry, a great bill for the financial \nservices industry. I congratulate them. What a lobbying force; how much \nmoney and how much lobbying and how much power. A whole lot of \nvulnerable people have been left out; a whole lot of middle-income \nfamilies have been left out.\n  I believe my colleagues will regret voting for this bill, but at the \nvery minimum, they could vote for this amendment that goes after these \nloan sharks, that goes after these payday loans. It is such is \ndeplorable practice. It is so outrageous, making such exorbitant profit \noff the misery of people.\n\n[[Page S2292]]\n\n We ought to be on the side of vulnerable consumers. We ought to be on \nthe side of low- and moderate-income families. We ought not be on the \nside of these loan sharks. This amendment should receive 100 votes.\n  I say to my colleague from Illinois, for all the hours I have been \nout here, so far I have not heard one Senator come to the floor and \ndebate this amendment. That is unbelievable to me.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. What the Senator is saying is that no one has come to the \nfloor defending the payday loans and the loan sharks?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. No one has come to the floor to defend the payday \nloans and the loan sharks. I have had this amendment on the floor for 3 \nor 4 days.\n  Mr. DURBIN. They have had ample opportunity. The Senator should get a \nunanimous vote.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I say to my colleague from Illinois, I think this may \nbe the first amendment I have introduced that is going to get 100 \nvotes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I look forward to it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, lest there be a failure to talk about the \nother side, I might just do that.\n  Although the amendment is described as only attacking ``payday \nloans,'' it imposes new and burdensome regulation on virtually any \ncompany that offers consumer loans, including automobile or truck \nloans, or that cashes personal checks and charges a fee. It represents \nan attempt to use Federal law to in effect abolish ``payday loans'', \nintruding into an area traditionally reserved to the States.\n  Although lenders who provide ``payday loans'' are an easy target \nbecause the credit they offer is expensive, they in fact provide access \nto legitimate, short term credit for many poor families who otherwise \nwould be forced to borrow from loan sharks to cover short term \nemergencies. Some borrowers, particularly poor borrowers, cannot \nqualify with conventional lenders. For that reason, some States permit \n``payday'' lenders to operate.\n  This amendment would in effect drive payday lenders out of business.\n  It also is vastly overbroad, imposing new, burdensome regulation on \nmany legitimate businesses.\n  The amendment amends the Bankruptcy Code to deny the claim of any \ncreditor who charged more than a new, Federal maximum price ceiling for \nany type of automobile or consumer credit.\n  The amendment also imposes a maximum Federal price limit of 100 \npercent annual percentage rate on what any consumer creditor, \nautomobile dealer, or check casher could charge in fees or interest for \na loan or check cashing service, possibly preempting State regulation \nsetting a lower or higher price limit. Violations of the maximum \nFederal price limit would result in denial in bankruptcy proceedings of \nthe claim of the creditor, auto dealer or check casher.\n  This amendment strikes at any lender or merchant who charges flat \nfees permitted by State law in a lending transaction. For example, a \n$10 cash advance fee or a $15 Federal Express fee permitted by State \nlaw for quickly sending a check back to the borrower could exceed the \nlimit if the credit was short term.\n  This amendment intrudes into an area traditionally regulated by the \nstates. Some States permit ``payday'' loans, but this regulation would \ninitiate federal regulation of the service.\n  Oppose this unwise and overbroad attempt to federally regulate an \narea traditionally regulated by the States.\n  This could hurt the very poor people who have to have these instant \nloans the Senator is trying to help. In fact, he hurts them.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. May I ask the Chair if I have any time left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 51 seconds remaining. The \nSenator from Texas has 2 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this amendment is really a usury limit \namendment. Our distinguished colleague from Minnesota simply objects to \npeople lending at high interest rates.\n  I am sure there are some people who believe that if contracts are \nentered into at terms they find objectionable, the terms should not be \nenforced. But that is not the way the American commercial code works. \nWhat this amendment would do, in essence, is say that if I borrowed \n$100 for a week and I paid a $2 service charge on that loan, if the \nborrower went bankrupt, I wouldn't have to pay the loan because the \nSenator from Minnesota has judged that interest rate to be too high.\n  That is great when you are making $146,000 a year. That is great when \nevery bank in your State would love to lend you money. But the plain \ntruth is, there are a lot of Americans who need to borrow money, a lot \nof Americans who would like to borrow money for a week to get over a \ntemporary credit problem they have. The terrible impact of this \namendment is that it would destroy the ability of those people to use \nlegitimate lenders and, in the process, would force them in many cases \nto borrow elsewhere and pay many times as much in interest.\n  Not only is this Government simply imposing its will on the \nmarketplace, but it also has real unintended consequences. Let me give \nan example. Let's say you have a debit card and you pay a fee in case \nyou have an overcharge from your balance. If you write a check for \n$100, that fee is going to exceed the amount prohibited under the \nWellstone amendment and, as a consequence, you wouldn't have to pay \nthat charge if something happened to the company and it went into \nbankruptcy.\n  Here is the problem: The kinds of interest rates that are being \ntalked about sound high, and they are high when they are calculated on \nan annualized basis. But when you borrow for a week, the carrying \ncharges and the finance charges, which aren't necessarily high for that \nperiod of time, by their very nature, produce a high annual rate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional \nminute.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I would not object, although I would \nlike to have, and ask unanimous consent for, 1 additional minute to \nrespond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me give another example: If you took a cab in the \nDistrict of Columbia and were driven to the airport, you would not \nconsider the rate to be usurious. But if you took that same cab and \nwere driven to Los Angeles, CA, and you were charged $50,000, you would \nlikely consider that charge to be usurious. Do we have a law that tries \nto say that a rate going to California, which would be considered \nusurious, not be charged for traveling a much shorter local distance in \nthe District of Columbia? The point is, when you are borrowing money \nfor a week, you pay high annual interest rates.\n  So, the net result of this amendment is to deny people access to \ncredit. If the amendment were adopted, it is true that borrowers would \nno longer be paying high rates, but it is equally, and more \nsignificantly, true they wouldn't be getting any loans at all for which \nthey were willing to pay. They will be driven into the black market, \nand they will pay a higher rate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, no legitimate lender charges over 100 \npercent interest on an annual basis. We have usury laws that deal with \nbanks at the State level, and we should do so. But these payday lenders \nhave carved out an exemption for themselves. These loan sharks have \ncarved out an exemption for themselves.\n  If Senators are concerned about poor people, we should be thinking \nabout other ways they can have access to credit. We are not doing that \nat all. But we now have an opportunity to make it clear that we are not \ngoing to let these loan sharks continue to feed off of the misery of \npoor people. We are not going to let them engage in this kind of \nexploitation.\n  To my colleagues who say, oh, no, 100 percent, or 300 percent, or \n2,000 percent interest rates on an annual basis are just what poor \npeople need, so please don't have an amendment, Senator Wellstone, that \nwill hurt poor people; they need to be able to pay over 100 percent per \nyear--your arguments are\n\n[[Page S2293]]\n\nabsurd, as much as I like you. They are absurd.\n  Frankly, you can't get out of this vote. You are either for \nvulnerable citizens and families and you are against this kind of loan \nshark practices or you are on the side of these loan sharks. Senators, \nstep up to the plate and vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I move to table the amendment of the \nSenator from Minnesota, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n\n\n                            Amendment No. 93\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise to support Mr. Durbin's amendment \nthat is a complete substitute for the pending bankruptcy reform bill. \nThis amendment is essentially the bill that passed the Senate in 1998 \nby a vote of 97-1. This near unanimous vote in favor of a bill shows \nthat it is possible to have bankruptcy reform that the whole Senate can \nsupport if it is balanced and fair.\n  Unfortunately, I have said before, S. 420 is not balanced and fair. I \nhave outlined in detail my concerns with this bill. Mr. Durbin's \namendment goes a long way to addressing those concerns and I will vote \nfor it if we are permitted to vote on it.\n  One of the most significant improvements that the Durbin amendment \naccomplishes is that it contains much stronger credit card disclosure \nrequirements.\n  Literally billions of credit card solicitations flood consumers' \nmailboxes each year. Not millions but billions.\n  Even though the number of bankruptcies is now on the way down, most \nexperts agree that the rise in bankruptcy filings that occurred in the \npast decade was due in significant part to the irresponsible extending \nof credit by credit card companies and banks to people who have already \nshown that they cannot handle additional debt.\n  Just to give a single tangible example of the blizzard of \nsolicitations that credit card issuers are now sending out, one member \nof my staff has collected solicitations he received by mail since this \nbill was marked up in the last Congress. In the last 20 months, he has \nreceived 95 mail offers for a new credit card. Now I am sure my staffer \nis a very creditworthy individual, but 95 offers for a new credit card? \nI am sure that my colleagues have received at least as many \nsolicitations, even if they did not count them all up. And of course, \nthese direct mail offers don't include the constant invitations for \ncredit cards that people see every day on TV and on the Internet.\n  This is an industry whose sales pitches are out of control. The \ncredit card companies are making bad decisions every day. People \nreceive new cards with thousands of dollars of new credit when they \nhave maxed out on 2, 5, or even 10 other cards.\n  And now the credit card companies have come before Congress asking \nfor our help. And boy, are we about to give it to them. This bill is a \nbailout for the credit card industry. It is going to make it easier for \ncredit card companies to collect more on the bad decisions they have \nmade, the credit they have extended to people who are demonstrably poor \ncredit risks. And make no mistake, giving the credit card companies \nmore power will work to the detriment of women trying to collect \nalimony and child support from ex-husbands who have filed for \nbankruptcy.\n  Last December, the Wisconsin State Journal, a very middle-of-the-road \npaper in my home State, summarized well my concern about the extent to \nwhich this bill gives the credit card industry what it wants. The \nJournal wrote:\n\n       When the credit card industry came to Congress to ask for \n     help in collecting debts from deadbeats, Congress should have \n     said: It's not government's job to bail you out. Why don't \n     you tighten up your own lending practices? Instead, Congress \n     let the industry turn a bankruptcy reform bill into a debt \n     collection assistance plan.\n\n  The editorial continues:\n\n       The House and Senate had before them 172 recommendations \n     from the National Bankruptcy Reform Commission, which was led \n     by Madison attorney Brady Williamson. The commission had \n     stressed that bankruptcy law must remain balanced: It must \n     work for creditors and debtors.\n       But the congressmen also had before them lobbyists for the \n     credit card industry and similar lenders. Quickly, bankruptcy \n     reform legislation became a campaign fund-raising bonanza for \n     the politicians, with the lending industry ``investing'' $20 \n     million in contributions. Just as quickly, bankruptcy reform \n     turned into the credit card industry's bill.\n\n  My colleagues are well aware of my concern about the influence of \ncampaign money on politics and policy. As I have said a number of \ntimes, the bankruptcy bill is a poster child for the need for campaign \nfinance reform. You only have to look at what the credit card industry \ngets in this bill, and just as importantly, the disclosure that \nconsumers do not get, to understand that.\n  A full discussion of this amendment, or the larger bankruptcy issue, \nis impossible without a Calling of the Bankroll. Money and influence \nare at the very core of this debate.\n  I would like to call my colleagues' attention to an article from the \nFebruary 26th issue of Business Week magazine. It's called ``Tougher \nBankruptcy Laws--Compliments of MBNA?'' The article points out the \nextraordinary largesse of this one credit card company, which is, of \ncourse, a significant leader of the coalition supporting this bill.\n  The contributions of MBNA were also noted in an article in the New \nYork Times entitled, ``Hard Lobbying on Debtor Bill Pays Dividend.''\n  Most of the $1.2 million in soft money that MBNA gave to the parties \nin the last cycle was given in the second half of 2000, when a ``shadow \nconference'' determined what the final bankruptcy bill would look like, \nand the bill was brought back to the House and the Senate in an \nextraordinary procedural maneuver. In particular, MBNA gave $100,000 in \nsoft money to the National Republican Senatorial Committee on October \n12, 2000, the very same day that the House gave final approval to the \nbill. MBNA has a habit of making well-timed contributions. On the very \nday that the House passed a bankruptcy conference report in 1998 and \nsent it to the Senate, MBNA gave a $200,000 soft money contribution to \nthe NRSC.\n\n  To give my colleagues and the public an idea of just how generous \nMBNA has been, the corporation's Chairman & CEO, Alfred J. Lerner, and \nhis wife, Norma, each made contributions of a quarter of a million \ndollars to the Republican National Committee in the last cycle.\n  And the generosity didn't stop there. According to an article in the \nWall Street Journal from March 6th, MBNA President Charles M. Cawley is \nalso an active political donor and fundraiser who gave $100,000 to the \nBush-Cheney Inaugural Committee.\n  Of course, MBNA is not the only wealthy interest fighting against \nthis bill, on the contrary, they have plenty of company. According to \nthe Center for Responsive Politics, the nine members of the National \nConsumer Bankruptcy Coalition contributed more than $5 million in soft \nmoney, PAC money and individual contributions during the 2000 election \ncycle. The Coalition's members include Visa USA, Mastercard \nInternational and several financial industry trade groups, including \nthe American Bankers Association and the American Financial Services \nAssociation.\n  This is the fourth time I have Called the Bankroll on the bankruptcy \nissue from this floor. You might wonder how I manage to come up with \nnew information, bankroll after bankroll after bankroll. Well, the \nanswer is simple: the industry keeps giving more and more money.\n  Huge sums, like quarter million dollar contributions, and six figure \ndonations that just happen to be delivered on key days when legislation \nis up for a vote. This industry is not subtle. They want this \nlegislation to become law, and they aren't shy about using the campaign \nfinance system to get their way.\n  That is the context in which we consider this amendment. And that is \nall the more reason why sensible protections like that proposed in this \namendment need to be adopted.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Durbin amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the articles from Business Week and The \nNew York Times be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S2294]]\n\n                  [From Business Week, Feb. 26, 2001]\n\n             Tougher Bankruptcy Laws--Compliments of MBNA?\n\n                      (By Christopher H. Schmitt)\n\n       Last December, as Congress struggled to wrap up a lame-duck \n     session, it sent President Clinton an overhaul of bankruptcy \n     laws. The bill, the most sweeping change in bankruptcy policy \n     in two decades, had handily passed both houses. But Clinton, \n     complaining that it was unfair to those who fall on hard \n     times, let it die. That was a big disappointment to credit-\n     card issuer MBNA Corp., which has spent several years \n     lobbying for a bankruptcy rewrite and stands to be the \n     biggest beneficiary of an overhaul.\n       Now, MBNA is about to hit pay dirt. New bankruptcy \n     legislation is on a fast track. Judiciary panels in the House \n     and Senate have held perfunctory hearings, and a bill could \n     be on the House and Senate floors as early as late February. \n     A White House spokesman has indicated that George W. Bush \n     will sign it.\n       The bill--a carbon copy of last year's version--is aimed at \n     stopping consumers from dissolving debts they can afford to \n     repay. It would establish a ``needs-based'' formula that \n     would determine whether debtors can pay off part of their \n     debt under court supervision. Those earning at or above the \n     median for their state would have to make good on at least \n     part of their obligations. LARGESSE. While this would help \n     all lenders, it especially benefits MBNA, the world's largest \n     credit-card issuer. The credit that MBNA and its fellow \n     plastic-issuers extend is typically unsecured, so they have \n     less recourse than other creditors when a customer can't pay. \n     Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst Kenneth A. Posner \n     estimates that the overhaul could boost credit-card issuers' \n     earnings by 5% this year. For MBNA, that could mean some $75 \n     million more in profit, based on third-quarter earnings.\n       With the kind of payoff, the company has been pushing hard \n     for the bill--and the election of a President who will sign \n     it. In Campaign 2000, MBNA employees contributed $237,675 to \n     Bush, making them the candidate's single biggest source of \n     cash, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a \n     campaign-finance think tank in Washington. On the soft-money \n     side, MBNA chipped in nearly $600,000, with about two-thirds \n     going to the GOP. (Most of the rest went to a Democratic \n     Party committee.) On top of that, MBNA Chairman and CEO \n     Alfred Lerner and his wife, Norma, each kicked in $250,00 to \n     the Republicans. Charles M. Cawley, CEO of MBNA's bank unit \n     and a friend of Bush Sr., organized fund-raisers and gave \n     $18,660 to Bush and the GOP.\n       Much of the money flowed in the second half of last year, \n     when the bankruptcy bill was moving on Capitol Hill. One \n     example: On the same day the House gave final approval, MBNA \n     ponied up $100,000 for the Republican Party. ``This is just a \n     real good illustration of the way things work in Washington: \n     Money is given, money is given strategically, [and] money is \n     given by industries for a particular purpose,`` says Celia \n     Viggo Wexler, author of a Common Cause report on consumer-\n     credit companies' political giving. Adds Edmund Mierzwinski, \n     consumer director for the U.S. Public Interest Research \n     Group: MBNA's largesse is ``clearly money well spent.'' \n     Lerner, Cawley, and an MBNA spokesman did not return calls \n     seeking comment.\n       Consumer groups say they'll continue to fight the bill, \n     which they contend is especially ill-advised in the slowing \n     economy. After falling 12% from a high of 1.44 million in \n     1998, bankruptcy filings are ticking up again. One early \n     report shows cases in January rose 15% over a year ago. A \n     handful of Democrats will seek to soften the bill's impact on \n     indebted consumers, but quick approval seems guaranteed. \n     ``This legislation is on a downward ski slope, never to be \n     stopped.'' said Representative Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Tex.) at \n     a recent hearing. And smoothing the way is MBNA.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 13, 2001]\n\n               Hard Lobbying on Debtor Bill Pays Dividend\n\n                           (By Philip Shenon)\n\n       Washington, Mar. 12.--A lobbying campaign led by credit \n     card companies and banks that gave millions of dollars in \n     political donations to members of Congress and contributed \n     generously to President Bush's 2000 campaign is close to its \n     long-sought goal of overwhelming the nation's bankruptcy \n     system.\n       Legislation that would make it harder for people to wipe \n     out their debts could be passed by the Senate as early as \n     this week. The bill has already been approved by the House, \n     and Mr. Bush has pledged to sign it.\n       Sponsors of the bill acknowledge that lawyers and lobbyists \n     for the banks and credit card companies were involved in \n     drafting it. The bill gives those industries most of what \n     they have wanted since they began lobbying in earnest in the \n     late 1990's, when the number of personal bankruptcies rose to \n     record levels.\n       In his final weeks in office, President Bill Clinton vetoed \n     an identical bill, describing it as too tough on debtors. But \n     with the election of Mr. Bush and other candidates who \n     received their financial support, the banks and credit card \n     industries saw an opportunity to quickly resurrect the \n     measure.\n       In recent weeks, their lawyers and lobbyists have jammed \n     Congressional hearing rooms to overflowing as the bill was \n     redebated and reapproved. During breaks, there was a common, \n     almost comical pattern. The pinstriped lobbyists ran into the \n     hallway, grabbed tiny cell phones from their pockets or \n     briefcases and reported back to their clients, almost always \n     with the news they wanted to hear.\n       ``Where money goes, sometimes you see results,'' \n     acknowledged Representative George W. Gekas, a Pennsylvania \n     Republican who was a sponsor of the bill in the House. But \n     Mr. Gekas said that political contributions did not explain \n     why most members of Congress and Mr. Bush appeared ready to \n     overhaul the bankruptcy system.\n       ``People are gaming this system,'' Mr. Gekas said, \n     describing the bill as an effort to end abuses by people who \n     are declaring bankruptcy to wipe out their debts even though \n     they have the money to pay them. ``We need bankruptcy \n     reform.''\n       Among the biggest beneficiaries of the measure would be \n     MBNA Corporation of Delaware, which describes itself as the \n     world's biggest independent credit card company. Ranked by \n     employee donations, MBNA was the largest corporate \n     contributor to the Bush campaign, according to a study by the \n     Center for Responsive Politics, an election research group.\n       MBNA's employees and their families contributed about \n     $240,000 to Mr. Bush, and the chairman of the company's bank \n     unit, Charles M. Cawley, was a significant fund-raiser for \n     Mr. Bush and gave a $1,000 a-plate dinner in his honor, \n     the center said. After Mr. Bush's election, MBNA pledged \n     $100,000 to help pay for inaugural festivities.\n       MBNA was obviously less enthusiastic about the candidacy of \n     former Vice President Al Gore, Mr. Bush's Democratic rival; \n     according to the center, only three of the company's \n     employees gave money to the Gore campaign, and their \n     donations totaled $1,500.\n       The center found that of MBNA's overall political \n     contributions of $3.5 million in the last election, 86 \n     percent went to Republicans, 14 percent to Democrats. The \n     company, which did not return phone calls for comments, made \n     large donations to the Senate campaign committees of both \n     political parties--$310,000 to the Republicans, $200,000 to \n     the Democrats.\n       MBNA's donations were part of a larger trend within the \n     finance and credit card industries, which have widely \n     expanded their contributions to federal candidates as they \n     stepped up their lobbying efforts for a bankruptcy overhaul.\n       According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the \n     industries' political donations more than quadrupled over the \n     last eight years, rising from $1.9 million in 1992 to $9.2 \n     million last year, two-thirds of it to Republicans.\n       Kenneth A. Posner, an analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean \n     Witter, said that the bankruptcy bill would mean billions of \n     dollars in additional profits to creditors, and that it would \n     raise the profits of credit card companies by as much as 5 \n     percent next year. In the case of MBNA, that would mean \n     nearly $75 million in extra profits in 2002, based on its \n     recent financial performance.\n       The bill's most important provision would bar many people \n     from getting a fresh start from credit card bills and other \n     forms of debt when they enter bankruptcy. Depending on their \n     income, it would bar them from filing under Chapter 7 of the \n     bankruptcy code, which forgives most debts.\n       Under the legislation, they would have to file under \n     Chapter 13, which would require repayment, even if that meant \n     balancing overdue credit card bills with alimony and child- \n     support payments.\n       Consumer groups describe the bill as a gift to credit card \n     companies and banks in exchange for their political largess, \n     and they complain that the bill does nothing to stop abuses \n     by creditors who flood the mail with solicitations for high-\n     interest credit cards and loans, which in turn help drive \n     many vulnerable people into bankruptcy.\n       ``This bill is the credit card industry's wish list,'' said \n     Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard law professor who is a bankruptcy \n     specialist. ``They've hired every lobbying firm in \n     Washington. They've decided that it's time to lock the doors \n     to the bankruptcy courthouse.''\n       The bill's passage would be evidence of the heightened \n     power of corporate lobbyists in Washington in the aftermath \n     of last year's elections, which left the White House and both \n     houses of Congress in the hands of business-friendly \n     Republicans.\n       Last week, corporate lobbyists had another important \n     victory when both the Senate and the House voted to overturn \n     regulations imposed during the Clinton administration to \n     protect workers from repetitive-stress injuries.\n       Credit card companies and banks would not be the only \n     interests served by the bankruptcy bill. Wealthy American \n     investors in Lloyd's of London, the insurance concern, have \n     managed through their lobbyists to insert a provision in the \n     bill that would block Lloyd's from collecting millions of \n     dollars that the company says it is owed by the Americans.\n       Lloyd's has hired its own powerful lobbyist, Bob Dole, to \n     help plead its case on Capitol Hill. Last week, the chief \n     executive of Lloyd's was in Washington to plot strategy.\n       The issue involves liabilities incurred by Lloyd's in the \n     1980's and 1990's when it was forced to pay off claims on \n     several disasters,\n\n[[Page S2295]]\n\n     like the Exxon Valdez oil spill. Investors in Lloyd's are \n     expected to share both its profits and its losses, but the \n     American have refused to settle the debts, claiming they were \n     misled by Lloyd's.\n       As he watched consumer-protection amendments to the \n     bankruptcy bill fail by lopsided margins last week, Senator \n     Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the ranking Democrat on the \n     Judiciary Committee and a leading critic of the bill, said \n     that colleagues had told him privately that they were \n     ``committed to the banks and credit card companies--and they \n     are not going to change.\n       ``Some of them do this because they think it's the right \n     thing to do,'' Mr. Leahy said.\n       But he said other senators were voting for the bill because \n     they know that the banks and credit card companies ``are a \n     very good source'' of political contributions. ``I always \n     assume senators are doing things for the purest of motives,'' \n     he added, his voice thick with sarcasm. ``But I have never \n     had credit card companies show up at my fund-raisers, and I \n     don't think they ever will.''\n       Mr. Gekas said the implication that money was buying \n     support for the bankruptcy bill was insulting, and that the \n     bill did most consumers a favor by ending practices by some \n     debtors that had forced up interest rates for everybody else. \n     ``Bankruptcies are costly to all of us who don't go \n     bankrupt,'' Mr. Gekas said.\n       In the late 1990's, banks, credit card industries and \n     others with an interest in overhauling the bankruptcy system \n     formed a lobbying group, the National Consumer Bankruptcy \n     Coalition, for the purpose of pushing a bankruptcy-overhaul \n     bill through Congress.\n       They said they needed to act to deal with what was then a \n     record number of personal bankruptcy filings. According to \n     court records, the number of personal bankruptcies hit nearly \n     1.4 million in 1998, a record, up from 718,000 in 1990. The \n     number fell to just under 1.3 million last year, although it \n     is expected to rise again if the economy continues to sour.\n       The coalition's founders included Visa and Mastercard, as \n     well as the American Financial Services Association, which \n     represents the credit card industry, and the American Bankers \n     Association.\n       The Center for Responsive Politics found that the \n     coalition's members contributed more than $5 million to \n     federal parties and candidates during the 1999-2000 election \n     campaign, a 40 percent increase over the last presidential \n     election.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \ntable the amendment of the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that I be able to continue for 1 \nminute, with the same amount of time for the Senator from Utah, before \nwe go to a vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to take the time to simply ask the \nSenator from Utah where we stand on the managers' package? Are we \ngetting close to that time? We have a number of items being cleared or \nhave been cleared. I would like to get that taken care of. I would like \nto be able to present the managers' package prior to the cloture vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. We are working on that, but we don't have it put together \nyet. I don't know if we can do that before the cloture vote, but we \nwill continue to work on it.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I further ask of the Senator from Utah, if \nthey are unable to complete the ones we have agreed on--the paperwork--\nit would fall, if cloture was voted, on the basis of germaneness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Mr. HATCH. We are going to try to work with the Senator. It may take \na unanimous consent postcloture.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nmanagers' package is brought forward, and it is agreed on by the \nSenator from Utah and the Senator from Vermont, the items in it be \nconsidered germane.\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 36, As Modified\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment of Senator \nWellstone dealing with payday loans. For people who aren't familiar \nwith this kind of loan, payday loans occur when a borrower gives a \npersonal check to someone else, and that person gives the borrower cash \nin an amount less than the amount of the personal check. The check \nisn't cashed if the borrower redeems the check for its full value \nwithin 2 weeks.\n  At the onset, I would like to point out the fact that payday loans \nare completely legal transactions in many states. If a financial \ntransaction is perfectly legal under state law, I don't think that it \nis wise policy to use the bankruptcy code to try and undo that legal \nstate transaction.\n  Using the Bankruptcy Code for this purpose leads to perverse results \nbecause the only people who will receive any benefit or relief will be \nthose who file for bankruptcy. The amendment would deny payday lenders \nthe right to sit at the bankruptcy bargaining table. So other people \nwho use payday loans who never file for bankruptcy will not benefit \nfrom this amendment. These people who have taken out loans but don't \ntake the easy way out in bankruptcy court will still have to pay back \ntheir loan. Therefore, you have the perverse result of people who do \nnot have the money to file for bankruptcy who will have to pay the loan \nas agreed. Even if you share Senator Wellstone's distaste for payday \nloans, this amendment won't benefit the poorest of the poor because \nmost of them do not seek bankruptcy relief.\n  I also think that the Wellstone amendment would have the effect of \nmaking it harder for the poor and those with bad credit histories to \ngain access to cash--the very people that Senator Wellstone is \nconcerned about. People who use payday loans simply cannot get loans \nthrough traditional sources because they are too risky, so a payday \nloan may be the only way they can get quick cash to pay for family \nemergencies or essential home and auto repairs.\n  I know that the intentions of my friend from Minnesota are honorable, \nbut the effect of this amendment would be to make it harder for poor \npeople to get the help they need when they need it. So I urge my \ncolleagues to reject the Wellstone payday amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The question is on agreeing to \nthe motion to table amendment No. 36, as modified.

The Senator will suspend for a moment.\n  We will have order in the body.\n  The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we really do need order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We will please have order in the body. Please \ntake your conversations off the floor. We cannot proceed until we have \norder.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Chair and thank my colleagues for their \ncourtesy.\n  Mr. President, we just had a vote that dealt with payday loans, \nwhether or not we were going to provide some protections to the most \nvulnerable consumers. That amendment failed.\n  My colleague, Senator Durbin, and other colleagues, have come out on \nthe floor with amendments that have gone after predatory practices. \nThey have said: Look, let's give consumers some protection. Those \namendments--or most of those amendments--have failed.\n  I had an amendment earlier which said, look, if you want to go after \nthose people who are gaming this system, fine, but for goodness' sake, \nfor the 50 percent of the people who are going under because of medical \nbills and who find themselves in these difficult circumstances, carve \nout an exemption. Do not make it so difficult for them to file for \nchapter 7. Do not make it so difficult for them to go through this \nprocedure, this procedure, and this procedure. Do not put so many \nhurdles in their way.\n  Bankruptcy is a safety net not just for low-income people but for \nmiddle-income people.\n  There was a front page story the other day in the New York Times. The \nheadline was: ``Lobbying On Debtor Bill Pays Dividend.''\n  I do not want to get myself in trouble with people in whom I believe. \nI do not make a one-to-one correlation such as, for example, the \nSenator from Utah and the Senator from Iowa; they have a different \nviewpoint. That is why they have argued for this bill, period. Let's \njust make that argument and stop there.\n  But I will tell you, at an institutional level, there is a serious \nproblem with this bill. And it is this: When it comes to the financial \nservices industry, the credit card industry, broadly defined, big \ngivers, heavy hitters, a huge and powerful lobbying coalition, they \nhave way too much access, and they have way too much say.\n  It is an institutional problem because the people filing for chapter \n7, trying to rebuild their lives because of a major medical bill or \nbecause they have lost their job on the Iron Range or because there has \nbeen a divorce, they do not have the same clout. They do not have the \nsame economic resources.\n  Quite frankly, I think this bill is too harsh, it is not balanced, it \nis not just, it is not fair, and there are a whole lot of families in \nthis country who are going to pay the price.\n  I call on my colleagues to vote against cloture. I know the vast \nmajority of Senators will not do so, but I will tell you, I do not \nbelieve by voting for cloture and then going forward and passing this \nbankruptcy bill we have done the right thing. I think this is good for \nthe credit card industry. It is good for the financial services \nindustry. But I think we have left out consumers.\n  We have left out a lot of low- and moderate- and middle-income \npeople. We have left out a lot of women who are single and the heads of \ntheir households. We have left out a whole lot of people of color and a \nwhole lot of people who are disproportionately among the ranks of \nworking-income and low-income people.\n  So I say to Senators, I hope you will vote against cloture. This bill \ndoes not deserve to go forward. This bill represents the power of the \nfinancial services industry that has marched on Washington every single \nday for the last 3 years. And it leaves out ordinary citizens in a very \nprofound and very harsh way. Senators, please vote against cloture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the majority leader \nor his designee is recognized for up to 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HATCH addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I hate to disagree with my friend and \ncolleague from Minnesota, but he could not be more wrong. This bill \nactually will do an awful lot of good for people in our society. I will \nnot go into all the details on that. All I have to say is that a vote \nat this stage against cloture is a vote against bankruptcy reform.\n  The bill we are voting on is the same bill that got 70 votes last \nyear, plus it includes the Schumer-Hatch violence amendment among a \nnumber of other Democratic Party amendments. Let me remind my \ncolleagues, and everyone else who wants bankruptcy reform, that many of \nthose who voted against this bill that passed 70-28 last December said \nif the Schumer violence language had been included, they would have \nvoted for it. Well, it is included. We have worked that language out. \nIt is a shame we have been forced to file cloture after all of the \naccommodations we have made. I would have preferred not to file \ncloture, but I believed that was the way we needed to proceed.\n  We have been very fair on this bill. I hope our colleagues will \nrealize this is a very important bill. It makes very important changes \nthat are needed in the bankruptcy laws of this country. We have \naccommodated both sides in virtually every way we possibly could. I \nhope everybody will vote for cloture, and let's get this bill passed \nand get it enacted into law.\n  Is there any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 and a half minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. Is that all the time that is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota has 28 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. HATCH. We are prepared to yield back.\n\n\n                             cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. Under the previous \norder, the clerk will report the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n[[Page S2297]]\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     do hereby move to bring to a close debate on S. 420, an \n     original bill to amend title 11, United States Code, and for \n     other purposes:\n         Trent Lott, Robert F.

Mr. President, today the Citizens Against Government \nWaste issued their 2001 Pork List. I am here to discuss that briefly.\n  Five items on the first page of this list were requested in the \nPresident's budget as part of the Corps of Engineers regular program, \nbut they are charged to be pork. Those were requested by President \nClinton and his administration, not by me. Also, $11 million listed as \npork in the Interior Department budget was also requested by the \nPresident, not me, to manage fish and game in Alaska. It shows the \naccuracy of this list.\n  Other items listed on this ``waste'' list include runway lights. It \nso happens that 80 villages in Alaska have no roads or hospitals. They \ndepend on medical evacuation by aircraft when people have babies, \nsuffer a heart attack, or have to have medical assistance. Those same \nvillages have no runway lights at all.\n  North of the Arctic Circle, the Sun doesn't even rise beginning in \nmid-December until the end of the following January, making it \nimpossible for an evacuation plane to land without lights. In fact, \nthis is a persistent problem for us all winter throughout Alaska. After \na Native man in Hoonah, AK, suffered a heart attack and sat on the \ntarmac for 3 days waiting for medical evacuation, the mayor wrote to me \nand asked for runway lights. We looked into it and found that it was \ntrue. I really did not realize there were so many of these small \nairports that had no lights.\n  I not only am proud that the Senate acceded to my request for runway \nlights in last year's appropriations bills, I want to put the Senate on \nnotice that this year I am going to seek funds so that every village in \nAlaska has runway lights. Under the current procedure for allocation \naid for improvement of airports, they are not eligible.\n\n  I believe if it is wasteful to make sure a woman in hard labor can \ndeliver her baby in a hospital with a doctor attending, instead of in \nan airplane hangar with the help of a mechanic, then I am guilty of \nasking the Senate for pork and proud of the Senate for giving it to me.\n  The Citizens Against Government Waste listed funding to aid in the \nrecovery of the endangered stellar sea lion as pork. The Senate and the \nwhole Congress remember the battle over the sea lion at the end of the \nlast session. That issue threatened to shut down the pollack fishery in \nAlaska, which supplies most of the fish for fast food and frozen \nproducts nationwide. The Office of Management and Budget estimated the \nclosure of that fishery would cost the national economy as much as a \nhalf billion dollars annually. By making a Federal investment to assure \nsound science to protect the sea lions, we will avoid that loss in our \nfisheries, families will not lose their jobs, and the Federal \nGovernment will continue to collect corporate and personal income taxes \nfar in excess of the money we put up to assure sound science is used in \naddressing that problem.\n  Likewise, the list includes transportation vouchers so welfare \nmothers can get to their jobs and get off welfare. By making another \nsmall investment in public transportation--$60,000 in this case--women, \nparticularly in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough in our State, can work, \npay taxes, and save\n\n[[Page S2298]]\n\nthe Government thousands and thousands--hundreds of thousands of \ndollars in welfare benefits. If that is pork, again I am guilty.\n  Alaska has the highest rate of alcoholism in the Nation. Alaska is \nNo. 1 in child abuse, No. 1 in domestic violence, and No. 1 in suicide, \nparticularly among young men in the Native villages. Working with our \nGovernor and State legislature, and faith-based institutions such as \nCatholic Charities that utilize volunteers, and an enormous number of \nvolunteers, some of this pork brought the Federal Government in as a \npartner to address these problems that are persistent in our State. \nThose projects, along with homeless shelters, are listed as shameful \npork in this list. For me, not addressing these crying human needs \nwould be what would be shameful, and I am ashamed of the people who \nmade the list.\n  Alaska has the highest unemployment rate in our Nation. Some \ncommunities have unemployment rates four times the national \nunemployment rate during the Great Depression. We have unemployment as \nhigh as 80 percent in some of our cities and villages. I addressed that \nissue with job training programs to help get people off welfare rolls \nand into productive employment where they will pay taxes. That, too, is \nlisted as pork.\n  Despite the nationwide shortages of nurses, teachers, and pilots, \nthose training programs which we instituted in our State are listed as \npork. In a State where only a handful of communities have doctors, let \nalone nurses, our health needs are tremendous. By utilizing cost-\neffective telemedicine for our veterans and Native people, we offer \nbasic health care services using community health aides in areas that \nhave no doctors, no clinics, and no hospitals. Those programs, again, \nare listed as wasteful, even though they are the most cost-effective \nprograms in the country, delivering health care service to people who \nare literally hundreds of miles from the doctors who provide the care \nthrough telemedicine.\n  Alaska, also unfortunately, is failing in educational achievement. In \nsome of our school districts, not only will the schools receive a \nfailing grade, but not one of the students in those schools can pass \nthe State exit exam in order to graduate. But summer reading programs \nthat we put in place to address those needs, and similar programs to \naddress the problems of education in a State that is one-fifth the size \nof the United States and has such a small population, all of these \nthings are listed as pork. The criterion seems to be if President \nClinton requested it, it was not pork. If I requested it or a member of \nour committee requested it, it is pork.\n  Our State has 70 percent of the lands in national parks, 85 percent \nof the lands in national wildlife refuges, over one-third of the \nnational forest lands, and receives less money for improvements and \nutilization of those lands than any other State that has such parks or \nwildlife refuges or forests. We have 50 percent of the coastline of the \nUnited States, and we harvest over 50 percent of the fish that are \nconsumed in the United States. We have more than half of the Indian \ntribes in the United States. I challenge anyone to look at the dismal \nrecord of the executive branch in stewardship of either the Natives or \nthese lands or fisheries areas, and compare that to what we have done \nhere in the Congress.\n  My amendments last year were not pork. Not one of them will enrich \nany person or any community. They meet needs in my State. We don't \nbuild tunnels under rivers for $8 billion. We don't build sports \nstadiums with tax advantages. We are a sovereign State, and so long as \nI am here, we will receive a fair share of Federal spending in order to \nmeet our needs.\n  I criticize those who made this list. I wish they would come out and \nface us. I will have a hearing, let them come and face us. It is high \ntime these people who are issuing these lists have some responsibility. \nThey issue the lists in order to get contributions from our citizens to \ntry to prevent so-called pork. It is not pork at all. It is meeting the \nneeds of the people in my State, and I for one am pleased, pleased, \nvery pleased that my colleagues have supported my request to meet those \nneeds.\n  Mr. BYRD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. BYRD. Let me thank the Senator from Alaska for being a good \nservant of his people. He was selected as the Alaskan of the Century--I \nbelieve that was the title, the Alaskan of the Century--last year.\n  Mr. STEVENS. That is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. He knows the needs of its people. He knows who sends him \nhere.\n  I welcome the Senator to the club. I have been in the same boat with \nthe Senator in many ways, and I have no apologies to make for serving \nmy people. I know who sends me here. I grew up in West Virginia when we \nhad only 4 miles of divide four-lane highway in the whole State. There \nwere only 4 miles in the whole State when I was starting out in the \nWest Virginia Legislature.\n\n  I know West Virginia, and what is one man's pork is another man's \njob.\n  I hope the Senator will just turn the back of his hand to those who \ncriticize him for helping his people. His people recognize that he \ndeserves the kind of award they gave him. I join them.\n  As long as I am here I am going to remember the people who sent me \nhere. This money isn't going overseas. The money--so-called pork--\ndoesn't go overseas. It goes to help people in West Virginia--their \nschools, their highways. People need highways on which to get to work \nor just to go to the grocery store or go to the schools or to the \ndoctor or to the hospital. Those highways I helped to build with that \nkind of ``pork'' have saved a lot of lives. It is much safer to drive \non those four-lane highways in West Virginia than down through the \ncurves and hollows, and along the deep ravines where one can't see up \nahead beyond that next curve.\n  Let me pay my respect to the Senator for doing a good job, being a \ngood Alaskan, and a good representative of the people of Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the Senator yield to the Senator from Vermont?\n  Mr. STEVENS. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Alaska and the Senator \nfrom Vermont represent, population-wise, two of the smallest States in \nthe Union. There are differences, of course, as the Senator from Alaska \nrepresents a State greater than much of the continental United States.\n  I have always thought the genius of the founders of this country, as \nthe Senator from West Virginia has pointed out on many occasions, was \nwhen they set up the Senate and they said every State will have equal \nrepresentation. Vermont has two Senators--not determined by landmass, \nbecause if Alaska had two Senators based on landmass no other State \nwould have any Senators. California, larger than many countries, has \ntwo Senators. The Senate is one place where States are equal.\n  Frankly, I have never heard the Senator from Alaska--I have served \nwith him for 26 years, and I served with him on the Appropriations \nCommittee during that time--ask for something for himself, never. I \nhave heard him fight for his own State, the same way I hope I fight for \nmy State, or the Senator from West Virginia fights for his State, or \nthe Senator from Nevada for his.\n  I point out to those who may be critical of the Senator from Alaska \nfighting for Alaska that never has the senior Senator from Alaska gone \nin there and sought anything for himself. But he has fought for the \nneeds of his State. Those needs are great. Nobody--I visited Alaska on \nseveral occasions--can possibly conceive of the enormous needs of a \nState such as Alaska because of its size and diversity. I think of the \nhorrendous winters we sometimes get in Vermont. They cannot begin to \nmatch what they have in Alaska.\n  Frankly, I have always been proud to serve with the Senator from \nAlaska. We are of different parties. We are in many areas of different \npolitical philosophies. But I consider him one of the closest friends I \nhave in the Senate. I have been proud to serve with him on the \nAppropriations Committee.\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I thank each of the Senators for their \ncomments. The other night someone asked me how big Alaska really is. We \ngot out the statistics book and examined it. I will bet no one present \nrealizes that my State is larger than Spain, plus France, plus Germany, \nplus Italy.\n\n[[Page S2299]]\n\n  I would be willing to bet that we send more money to those areas than \nwe spend in Alaska to meet the needs of the Americans who live there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/14/senate-section/article/S2299-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2299-S2300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                BANKRUPTCY REFORM ACT OF 2001--Continued\n\n  Mr. STEVENS.

The Senator has that right.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 20, as modified\n\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I understand we have amendment No. 19, the \namendment of the Senator from Vermont, pending. I ask unanimous consent \nthat amendment No. 20 be modified by an amendment by myself and Mr. \nHatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I withhold that for a moment.\n  While we are waiting on that matter--I am surely going to make the \nrequest again--we have my amendment with the yeas and nays on it. And I \nunderstand that the leader would prefer that votes begin in the \nmorning. I have no objection to the leader stacking that with other \nvotes to occur in the morning. We have the yeas and nays on it.\n  I urge, however, that those who have germane amendments on our side \ncome to the floor and offer them, seek the yeas and nays, if they wish, \nand speak on them tonight. There is no reason why we cannot finish this \nbill sometime during the day tomorrow.\n  Mr. President, there appears to be some difficulty. I was of the \nunderstanding that Senator Hatch wanted this modified. I was going to \noffer that modification as a courtesy to Senator Hatch. I will not \noffer the modification and am perfectly happy to have them go ahead and \nvote on my original amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify amendment No. 20 on \nbehalf of myself and Mr. Hatch. I send the modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks about the \nrather stunning announcement we read this morning on the front page of \na number of newspapers about President Bush's reversal of a campaign \npromise he made with great clarity in the course of the last year. That \nis the reversal of a very clear promise by the President to support \nefforts to reduce pollution, particularly carbon dioxide emissions from \npowerplants in this country.\n  On the campaign trail last year, then-candidate Bush made clear his \nsupport for legislation to reduce nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, \nmercury, and carbon dioxide from powerplants, the so-called four \npollutants. There has been a great deal of science, a great deal of \nresearch done over these last years with respect to the impact of these \npollutants on the quality of our life on this planet.\n  On September 29, 2000, President Bush could not have been more clear. \nHe said:\n\n       With the help of Congress, environmental groups and \n     industry, we will require all powerplants to meet clean air \n     standards in order to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, \n     nitrogen oxide, mercury and carbon dioxide within a \n     reasonable period of time.\n\n  Only 10 days ago, EPA Administrator Christie Whitman reaffirmed the \nPresident's position that he would support and seek legislation to cut \nglobal warming pollution from powerplants.\n  This is the second time in 2 weeks that a policy announcement by a \nSecretary in the Bush administration has been reversed by the White \nHouse only a few days after that policy announcement was made. I am \nreferring to the prior policy announcement made by Secretary Powell \nwith respect to the efforts to renew negotiations left off by the \nClinton administration with North Korea. Two days after Secretary \nPowell said, indeed, that is what the administration would do, the \nPresident and the White House announced they would not, and the rug was \nessentially pulled out from under Secretary Powell. Now we see the same \nthing with Secretary Whitman. She announces that, indeed, she intends \nto enforce the President's campaign promise, and many groups around the \ncountry welcomed having a President of the United States who was \nprepared to offer leadership and to move us in the right direction.\n  Yesterday it became clear, all of a sudden, that the President was no \nlonger interested in doing what he said, helping Congress and \nenvironmental groups and industry and, apparently, even his own EPA \nAdministrator in that effort. It turns out that the President not only \ndoes not support it but he opposes it.\n  A lot of Americans will have their own judgments about what happens \nwhen people run for office and within a few months of running for \noffice renege on the promises they make to the American people about \nwhy it is they ought to be elected. In a letter to Senator Hagel and \nothers, the President said:\n\n       I do not believe that the government should impose on power \n     plants mandatory emissions reductions for carbon dioxide, \n     which is not a pollutant under the Clean Air Act.\n\n  The White House has offered explanations for the President's flipflop \nby saying that the President did not understand that carbon dioxide \nemissions from powerplants is currently not regulated. Therefore, his \npledge was misinformed, and the mistake.\n  With all due respect, I find that statement to be an inadequate \nexplanation, not so much because the President didn't know the current \nimplementation requirements of the Clean Air Act but because, despite \nthat lack of awareness, he proceeded to make such a sweeping promise to \nthe American people and to allow his EPA Administrator to continue that \npromise for a few weeks while in office.\n\n  The second reason for the President's reversal, the White House \nclaims, is a ``new'' study by the Department of Energy that concludes \nthat the cost of environmental protections is too great. Let me \nunderscore that: The cost of environmental protections is too great.\n  I don't think that analysis properly balances the many different \nvariables in how you arrive at the true cost because that cost has to \nbe balanced, not just based on the exact cost of putting in the \nimplementing technology, you also have to measure the downside cost to \nthe United States of America, indeed to the globe, for not taking the \nkinds of steps we need to take.\n  Our country, I regret to say, has been the largest emitter in the \nworld, growing at the fastest rate in the world in terms of energy use, \nand the least responsive in terms of the steps we should be taking to \ndeal with this. This country has to come to grips at sometime with the \nrealities of the profligate energy policies we are pursuing that wind \nup using extraordinary amounts of resources relative to our population \nwithout the kind of balance necessary to create what is called a \nsustainable energy policy, a sustainable environmental policy.\n  I find it also troubling that this one study, called ``Analysis of \nStrategies for Reducing Multiple Emissions from Power Plants,'' is \ndeemed to be somehow a new revelation. The study was a request of the \nDepartment of Energy by former Congressman David McIntosh who, it \nhappens, has been one of the harshest critics of environmental \nprotections who has served in the Congress. The study is a classic case \nof bad information in, bad information out. Some would call it, with \nrespect to the technology world, computers: Garbage in, garbage out. It \npurposefully restricts market mechanisms, and it assumes highest cost \ngeneration. As a result, its conclusions are entirely prefixed, \npreordained to come out with an expense factor that does not reflect \nwhere the technology is, where the state of the art is, or where the \nrealities are economically.\n  I recommend that the President review a series of other economic \nanalyses that embrace market mechanisms, that reflect real costs, and \nother kinds of environmental protections. This includes a different and \nmore recent study by the Department of Energy that concludes that a \nmultipollutant approach can reduce pollutions from large generators \nwith net savings to the consumer.\n  I am not someone who comes to the floor as an environmentalist and \nsuggests that the environmental movement has not on occasion pressed \nfor a solution that may, in fact, demand too much too quickly, or \nsometimes, I agree, we have environmental rules that are not even \nthoughtfully applied. There are times when we require of small \nbusinesses the same meeting of standards as we require for large \nbusinesses. It obviously does not make sense to the economies of scale \nor the gains or the capacities of those businesses to perform.\n  I readily accept the notion that there are some places that we can do \nbetter, there are some ways in which we can harness the energy of the \nmarketplace and use market forces to find solutions. I believe \nRepublican and Democrat alike in past administrations have been \nnegligent in being creative about reaching out to the private sector \nand putting the private sector at the table and asking the private \nsector for ways in which we could do things with least cost, least \nregulation, least intrusiveness from Washington, and harness the energy \nof the marketplace in finding some of these solutions.\n  Regrettably, even when that has happened, when companies have stepped \nforward and shown that there are cheaper ways of doing things, we now\n\n[[Page S2301]]\n\nsee the President embracing a study that reflects none of that \ncreativity and none of that capacity on the part of the private sector.\n  Let me be very specific about that. A number of companies have \nstepped forward to embrace the four pollutant approach I am talking \nabout. They include Consolidated Edison, PG, Northeast Utilities, \nPECO, and others. These companies have found a way to embrace a four \npollutant reduction strategy and do so in a way that benefits their \ncompany's bottom line and also benefit the consumers at the same time.\n  I want to put this in a context, if I may. Why is this so important \nto our country and to the concerns we have about global warming and \nabout pollutants in the air and the quality of life? I don't know a \nthoughtful Republican or Democrat who doesn't understand the linkage of \nsome of the things we emit into the air and water in various forms of \npollution, which have a terrible impact on the lives of our fellow \ncitizens.\n  The country has been treated to a couple of movies recently that \nshowed what happens when you have that kind of pollution taking place--\nthe impact of it on the lives of our fellow citizens. I had the \nprivilege of attending, as an official observer for the Senate, the \ndiscussions in Rio when President Bush's father was President in 1992--\nthe Earth Summit, when the United States said we would try to hold \nourselves to the emissions baseline of 1990 levels. We never took the \nsteps necessary to live up to that voluntarily agreed-upon goal. Since \nthen, I have been to Kyoto, to The Hague, and Buenos Aires, in each \nplace where global negotiations were taking place, where Presidents and \nprime ministers and environmental ministers and financial ministers \nwere all struggling together to find a way to reduce emissions. In \nevery one of those discussions, all of the less developed countries, \nand our European partners, looked at the United States of America as a \nculprit, as the problem, because we weren't willing to embrace some of \nthe steps they were taking, or were prepared to take, in order to enter \na global solution that has an impact on all of us.\n  I say to my colleagues, I am not talking about politics, I am talking \nabout facts--scientific facts. Just recently, 2,500-plus scientists at \nthe United Nations, through the IPCC, released increased data regarding \nour status with respect to global warming.\n  The decade of the 1990s was the hottest decade in all of human \nhistory. The glaciers on five continents are receding at record rates. \nOne thousand square miles of the Larsen ice shelf in Antarctic has \ncollapsed into the ocean. Arctic sea ice has thinned by 40 percent in \nonly 20 years.\n  For the first time, boats are traversing the Canadian Arctic without \nhitting ice pack. What used to take 2 years as a journey has now taken \nonly 2 months. Permafrost in Alaska and Siberia is defying its name by \nthawing. Ocean temperatures throughout the world are rising, and a \nquarter of the world's reefs have been bleached.\n  The scientific evidence that pollution is dangerously altering the \natmosphere is becoming more compelling as each year passes. This is \npeer-reviewed, hard science--reviewed science from the best researchers \nin the world. I believe it is compelling and it demands action.\n  In January of 2000, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change \nreleased its third assessment report. The IPCC involves thousands of \nscientists from around the world and many of the very best American \nscientists. It was organized in the early nineties by President Bush to \nassist governments in assessing the state of the global climate and \nwhat threat pollution may or may not pose to it.\n\n  This January, the IPCC released its strongest, most conclusive and \nmost alarming assessment of the global climate. It warned that rising \ntemperatures are attributable to human activities; that temperatures \nmay rise at a far faster rate than previously expected--as high as 10.4 \ndegrees over the next 100 years--and that the consequences will be \nadverse and far reaching. The potential consequences include droughts, \nfloods, rising seas, the displacement of tens of millions of people \nliving in coastal areas, and the massive die of plant and animal \nspecies.\n  The chair of IPCC, Dr. Robert Watson, put it his way:\n\n       We see changes in climate, we believe we humans are \n     involved, and we're projecting future climate changes more \n     significant over the next 100 years than the last 100 years.\n\n  And the IPCC report is only the latest in a body of science that \ndemands action.\n  October 2000, ``Coral Reefs Dying; Most May Be Dead In 20 Years.''\n\n       Addressing the International the Coral Reef Symposium on \n     the island of Bali, researchers warn that more than a quarter \n     of the world's coral reefs have been destroyed and remaining \n     reefs could be dead in 20 years. The most serious threat to \n     the reefs is global warming. Coral reefs are crucial anchors \n     for marine ecosystems, and more than a half billion people \n     depend on reefs for their livelihood, researchers at the \n     conference say.\n\n  March 2000, ``NOAA Finds Oceans Warming.''\n\n       Scientists at the National Oceanographic Data Center find \n     that the world's oceans have soaked up much of the warming of \n     the last four decades, delaying its full effect on air \n     temperatures. Scientists speculate that perhaps half of \n     human-caused climate change is not yet in evidence in the \n     form of higher air temperatures, because of the delay caused \n     by oceans.\n\n  January 2000, ``NAS Concludes Warming Is `Undoubtedly Real.' ''\n\n       A study by the National Research Council of the National \n     Academy of Sciences concludes that the warming of the Earth's \n     surface is ``undoubtedly real'' and that surface temperatures \n     in the last two decades have risen at a rate substantially \n     greater than the average for the past 100 years. This study \n     put to rest charges that satellite data contradicted land-\n     based data.\n\n  December 1999, ``Arctic Melting Almost Certainly The Result of \nPollution.''\n\n       A computer-based study by the University of Maryland and \n     NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center finds less than a 2 \n     percent chance that observed melting of Arctic sea ice is the \n     result of normal climatic variations--and less than a 0.1 \n     percent chance that melting over the last 46 years is the \n     result of normal variations. Arctic sea ice is melting at a \n     rate of 14,000 square miles per year, an area larger than \n     Maryland and Delaware combined. Melting of arctic ice \n     accelerates global warming, since ice reflects 80 percent of \n     solar energy back into space and water absorbs solar energy. \n     Meanwhile, the melting of arctic ice could disrupt ocean \n     currents and salinity levels.\n\n  June 1999, ``Greenhouse Gases Higher Now Than Any Time In 420,000 \nYears.''\n\n       A two-mile-long ice core drilled out of an Antarctic ice \n     sheet shows that levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases are \n     higher now than at any time in the past 420,000 years. \n     Scientists with the National Center for Scientific Research \n     in Grenoble, France, find that carbon dioxide levels rose \n     from about 180 parts per million during ice ages to 280-300 \n     parts per million in warm periods--far below the current \n     CO2 concentration of 360 parts per million. \n     Methane levels, meanwhile, rose from 320-350 parts per \n     billion during ice ages to 650-770 parts per billion during \n     the warm spells. The current methane concentration is about \n     1,700 parts per billion.\n\n  April 1998, ``20th Century Was The Warmest In 600 Years.''\n\n       Based on annual growth rings in trees and chemical evidence \n     contained in marine fossils, corals and ancient ice, \n     scientists at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst find \n     that the 20th century was the warmest in 600 years, and that \n     1990, 1995 and 1997 were the warmest years in all of the 600-\n     year period. Scientist conclude that the warming ``appears to \n     be closely tied to emission of greenhouse gases by humans and \n     not any of the natural factors,'' such as solar radiation and \n     volcanic haze.\n\n  January 1998, ``Changes May Happen Quickly With A Climate Shock.''\n\n       A University of Rhode Island study of ice cores from \n     Greenland shows that when the last ice age ended, the change \n     was sudden. In Greenland, a 9 to 18 degree F increase in \n     temperatures probably took place in less than a decade. The \n     finding challenges the widespread assumption that climate \n     changes are in all cases gradual, and suggests that human-\n     induced climate change could occur rapidly rather than \n     slowly.\n\n  I could go on; the science is compelling.\n  I committed to finding a solution to the problem of global warming. \nSome of my colleagues--and now the President--have charged that dealing \nwith this problem will bankrupt the American economy. I disagree. I \nbelieve that America can have a strong economy and a healthy \nenvironment. Fortunately, more and more companies are stepping forward \nto solve this problem and lead the way where government won't. BP will \nreduce its emission to 10 percent below its 1990 levels by 2010. \nPolaroid will cut its emissions to 20 percent below 1994 levels by \n2005. Johnson & Johnson will reduce its emissions to 7 percent below \n1990 levels by\n\n[[Page S2302]]\n\n2010. IBM will cut emissions by 4 percent each year till 2004 based on \n1994 emissions. And, Shell International, DuPont, Suncor Energy Inc., \nOntario Power Generation have all made similar commitments.\n  All the dire predictions of economic calamity from entrenched \npolluters just is not credible when leading companies are doing exactly \nwhat they say cannot be done. We know the power of technology to \ntransform an industry--just look at the impact of technology on \ninformation and medicine--and technology and innovation can transform \nhow we produce and use energy.\n  President Bush's reversal will also weigh heavily on the \ninternational talks to fight global warming. As a Senate observer to \nthe talks, I have seen firsthand how America's inaction has prevented \nprogress. In 1992 the U.S. pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas \nemissions to 1990 levels by 2000 through the strictly voluntary \nFramework Convention on Climate Change. We will miss that goal and end \nthe year with emissions 13 percent above 1990 levels.\n\n  Our failure goes beyond numbers alone. In the past eight years, we \nhave not taken a single meaningful step toward our commitment. We have \nnot seized opportunities to increase efficiency and reduce pollution \nfrom automobiles, appliances, electric utilities, housing, commercial \nbuildings, industry or transportation. Nor have we provided sufficient \neconomic incentives for the development and proliferation of solar, \nwind, hydrogen and other clean energy technologies. A range of sound \nproposals have been floated in Congress, but almost all have been \nrelegated to the legislative scrap heap.\n  Instead, Congress has enacted budget riders to keep us mired in the \nunsustainable status quo. An unwise mix of politics and special \ninterests has produced laws prohibiting the government from even \nstudying the efficacy of strengthening efficiency standards for cars \nand light trucks, laws blocking stronger efficiency standards for \nappliances, and laws hampering energy and environmental programs \nbecause, their sponsors mistakenly argue, these programs represent an \nunconstitutional implementation of the unratified Kyoto Protocol.\n  This regressive record is fatal to the international effort. It \nheightens distrust, undermines the credibility essential to success, \nand gives opening to our sharpest critics to seek advantage. For \nexample, the U.S. has insisted that unrestricted, international \nemissions trading be part of the global warming pact. Trading is a \nproven method to achieve greater environmental benefits at lower costs; \nit has halved the cost and accelerated the environmental gains of Clean \nAir Act. But European nations--led by Germany and France--charge the \ntrading program must be severely restricted or it will become a \nloophole by which the U.S. will avoid domestic action. They make that \ncharge as much for reasons of economic and political self-interest as \nthey do for environmental concerns, but, nonetheless, our paltry \nenvironmental record at home lends dangerous credibility to their \ncharge, and that makes the work of our negotiators all more difficult. \nMoreover our inaction has an equally dangerous practical effect. Every \nyear we fail to act, our environmental goals become more difficult to \nachieve.\n  Mr. President, it is early in this Congress and even earlier in \nPresident Bush's new administration. I remain hopeful, but being \nhopeful is becoming increasingly difficult, particularly today. \nPresident Bush has rejected a policy that can work, that can benefit \nthe environment and the nation. He did it really before the debate even \nstarted. And he broke the most important campaign pledge he made \nregarding the environment. And it took him less than two months to do \nit.\n  Let me just say that I wanted to review for my colleagues--and I hope \nsome will perhaps take an interest in reviewing these other \nassessments--a number of major assessments of the negative impact on \ncrops, on quality of health, on sea life, on major areas that should be \nof enormous concern to all of us, not as Republicans and Democrats, but \nas thinking U.S. Senators. I don't want to approach this in a \ndoctrinaire way, but I know that we have a responsibility to contribute \nour part to a major solution and reduction in global greenhouse gases, \nas well as to contribute to the better quality and health of our \ncitizens.\n  This decision by the President which, once again, gives increased \npower to the large energy interests of the country is the wrong \ndecision for our Nation and the wrong decision in the long run for \ncreating the sustainable environmental approach. My hope is that my \ncolleagues and the administration itself will review and come up with \nan approach that will better serve the interests of our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/14/senate-section/article/S2302-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2302-S2303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ERWIN MITCHELL AND THE GEORGIA PROJECT\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, on March 7, 2001, the Washington Post \nreported that the recent census indicates a 60-percent growth in our \nNation's Hispanic population, which now totals 35.3 million. Georgia \nhas also been witness to this growth. In 1991 the Hispanic student \npopulation in Dalton, GA, was only 4 percent and now 10 years later, \nHispanic enrollment in Dalton public schools has skyrocketed to 51 \npercent. The data from the 1999-2000 school year show that 45 percent \nof students in Dalton and 13 percent in Whitfield County are Spanish \nspeaking. There are children of hard-working families who are an \nimportant part of the Dalton community. Accordingly, business and \ncommunity leaders in that north Georgia community recognize the need \nfor innovative and comprehensive solutions to address the recent influx \nof immigrants. Recent studies show that where quality education \nprograms are joined with community-based services, immigrants have an \nincreased opportunity to become an integral part of their community and \ntheir children are better prepared to achieve success in school.\n  The Georgia Project has provided an innovative solution to the needs \nof northwest Georgia. This is a teacher exchange program which brings \nbilingual teachers from Mexico to provide language instruction to all \nDalton/Whitfield students. In addition, the program also sponsors a \nSummer Institute which provides Dalton/Whitfield teachers with the \nopportunity to study Mexican culture and history and the Spanish \nlanguage in Monterrey, Mexico.\n  The driving force behind this endeavor has been the creative efforts \nof Erwin Mitchell. His dedication to public service and fairness was \nevident during his days as a Member of the House of Representatives. \nThis same dedication and spirit of duty were the guiding forces behind \nthe award-winning Georgia Project. As the mastermind behind the Georgia \nProject, Erwin Mitchell's efforts have been confirmed by the rising \ntest scores of Dalton/Whitfield students on the Iowa Test of Basic \nSkills. His work has recently been recognized by both the National \nEducation Association, NEA, and the National Association for Bilingual \nEducation, NABE. The NEA has selected him to receive the NEA's 2001 \nGeorge I. Sanchez Memorial Award for his ``exemplary contributions in \nthe area of human and civil rights.'' NABE has named him the 2001 \nCitizen of the Year for his ``efforts in shaping a successful future \nfor America's students.''\n  This wave of immigration is not limited to Georgia alone. For \nexample, the Waterloo, IA, school system is being challenged to teach \n400 Bosnian refugee children who came here without knowing our \nlanguage, culture or customs. Schools in Wausau, WI, are filled with \nAsian children wanting to achieve success in the United States. In \nWayne County, MI, 34 percent of the student population are Arabic-\nspeaking and receive special help. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, \nthe recently arrived immigrant and refugee population living here today \nwill account for 75 percent of the total U.S. population growth over \nthe next 50 years. This growth is occurring in places like New York, \nLos Angeles, and Miami, but also in nontraditional immigrant \ncommunities like Gainesville, GA, and Fremont County, ID. Innovative \nprograms are being offered across the country to help accommodate these \npopulations, which is why I have once again introduced the Immigrants \nto New Americans Act. This legislation will create a competitive grant \nprogram within the Department of Education that funds model programs, \nwhich, one, help immigrant children to succeed in America's classrooms \nand,\n\n[[Page S2303]]\n\ntwo, help their families access community services such as job \ntraining, transportation, counseling, and child care.\n  Our country's diversity is growing and it is vital for us to support \nsuccessful programs like the Georgia Project that address the needs of \nchanging communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/14/senate-section/article/S2303-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBUTE TO HOOSIER ESSAY CONTEST WINNERS\n\n Mr. LUGAR, Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a group \nof young Indiana students who have shown great educative achievement.

I submit their \nnames for the Congressional Record because they demonstrate the \ncapabilities of today's students and are fine representatives of our \nNation.\n  This year, Hoosier students wrote on the theme, ``Eating Around the \nWorld From Hoosier Farms.'' I would like to submit for the Record the \nwinning essays of John Leer of Hamilton County, and Michelle Kennedy of \nJasper County. As State winners of the Youth Essay Contest, these two \noutstanding students are being recognized on Friday, March 16, 2001 \nduring a visit to our Nation's Capitol.\n  The essays are as follows:\n\n               Eating Around the World From Hoosier Farms\n\n                    (By John Leer, Hamilton County)\n\n       Jean woke up on a crisp, Canadian morning to the smell of \n     moist hot cakes baking on the skillet; to accent the hot \n     cakes, Jean's mother had prepared apple compote with sweet \n     brown sugar. Fresh sausage patties were succulently sizzling \n     in their own oils and grease. On this particular morning, \n     Jean thought to himself of the rich Canadian culture this \n     meal represented. To his own dismay, however, his mother told \n     him most of the ingredients used had come from the farms of \n     Indiana.\n       After looking deeper into the issue, Jean too realized that \n     most of his food had originated in the Midwest and especially \n     in Indiana. If something were to happen to the farms of \n     Indiana, he would be devastated. He would miss the grain used \n     in the bread, all of the pork and beef, and even the chilled \n     glass of milk used to wash down a chocolate chip cookie.\n       Then, Jean went outside to accomplish his daily, morning \n     chores of feeding the oxen and cleaning their stalls; he \n     noticed that in bold letters the sack said the feed was made \n     in Indiana. The idea that his entire daily routine depended \n     on a successful yield from Hoosier farms scared him; if a \n     long drought began or a downfall of water occurred, he would \n     not be eating hot cakes or drinking milk very much longer. \n     The Hoosier farmer was invaluable to him.\n       Throughout the day he noticed more foods of his daily diet \n     grown in Indiana: melons, tomatoes, pumpkins, corn, and more. \n     During geography class, Jean learned that Indiana is a \n     leading importer to Canada and that Canada depends on the \n     Hoosier fields. After getting off the school bus, he raced \n     towards the television only to turn on the weather station; \n     he had finally realized that Indiana food and weather played \n     a critical role in his daily life.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               Eating Around the World From Hoosier Farms\n\n                  (By Michelle Kennedy, Jasper County)\n\n       As an eighth grade student from the country of Japan, I \n     enjoy many American products. My day starts early in the \n     morning. As I prepare for my school day I usually have \n     breakfast which might include eggs and sausage from Indiana \n     farms. Grains from Indiana farms are imported so we might \n     enjoy cereals, breads, and pastries.\n       Japan does not have the space available for farmground or \n     livestock operations. What we have are very small farms. \n     Indiana grains and livestock products are very important to \n     us. We grow much rice but, other products such as pork, beef, \n     and poultry are needed to compliment our rice industry.\n       After a day of school I might stroll through the open \n     markets in our city. These market places have fruits and \n     vegetables from the Hoosier farms. In Japan we are always \n     studying new technology. We are very interested in by-\n     products of Indiana farmers.\n       Many things I use at school are by-products of American \n     farms. Soy ink and soy crayons are by-products of Indiana \n     soybeans. It is important for countries in the world to be \n     able to trade with one another. We are all dependant upon \n     each other.\n       Japan buys 8.9 billion dollars of United States Agriculture \n     products each year. Indiana agriculture plays a big part in \n     this.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    2000-2001 District Essay Winners\n\n       District 1: Christoper Wacnik (Lake County) and Megan \n     Spillman (St. Joseph County).\n       District 2: Andrew Pasquali (Noble County) and Natalie \n     Rummel (Elkhart County).\n       District 3: Mitchell Swan (Jasper County) and Michelle \n     Kennedy (Jasper County).\n       District 4: Jacob Little (Jay County) and Janna Rines (Jay \n     County).\n       District 5: Tyler Smith (Hendricks County) and Laura Trust \n     (Morgan County).\n       District 6: John Leer (Hamilton County) and Jeri Boone \n     (Hamilton County).\n       District 7: Kegan Knust (Clay County) and Nicole Dike (Knox \n     County).\n       District 8: Carson Ritz (Franklin County) and Erin Rauch \n     (Franklin County).\n       District 9: John Michel (Warrick County) and Michelle \n     Jochim (Gibson County).\n       District 10: Max Muhoray (Jefferson County) and Jennifer \n     Prickel (Ripley County).\n\n                     2000-2001 County Essay Winners\n\n       Benton: Jesse Becker and Carolyn Jenkinson; Cass: John \n     Workman and Julie Richardson; Clay: Kegan Knust and Nicole \n     Hayes; Delaware: Cais Hasan and Aleisha Fetters; Elkhart: \n     Natalie Rummel; Fayette: Sarah King; Franklin: Carson Ritz \n     and Erin Rauch; Fulton: Thomas Landis and Alicia Long; \n     Gibson: Michelle Jochim; Greene: Alex Weathers and Jessica \n     Chaney; Hamilton: John Leer and Jeri Boone.\n       Hendricks: Tyler Smith; Jackson: Kim Meier; Jasper: \n     Mitchell Swan and Michelle Kennedy; Jay: Jacob Little and \n     Janna Rines; Jefferson: Max Muhoray and Amanda Simmons; \n     Jennings: Wayne Carmickle and Andrea Webster; Knox: Josh \n     Anthis and Nicole Dike; Lake: Christopher Wacnik and Aubrette \n     Marie Biegel; Marion: Ben Campbell and Fatima Patino; Martin: \n     Nicole Lengacher; Morgan: Laura Trusty.\n       Noble: Andrew Pasquali; Posey: Tracie Johnson; Ripley: \n     Jennifer Prickel and Jeremy Borgman; St. Joseph: Daniel Seitz \n     and Megan Spillman; Starke: John Gibson and Sonya Crouch; \n     Vanderburgh: Mark Turpin; Vermillion: Marvin Woolwine and \n     Kelli Knight; Wabash: Matt Street and Mandy Renbarger; \n     Warrick: John Michel and Erika Downey; Washington: Ryan \n     Satterfield and Ashley Ingram; Wayne: Nick Kerschner and Anne \n     Hamilton.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/14/senate-section/article/S2303-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NORTH GEORGIA COLLEGE AND STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. MILLER.

Since its inception in 1873, \nNGCSU's military college has been renowned for its ability to produce \nexceptional officers in all service branches. This skill has resulted \nin many performance championships, including 12 titles from the Mardi \nGras Drill Meet.\n  The Mardi Gras Invitational Drill Meet draws teams representing the \nservice academies, senior and junior military colleges, and reserve \nofficer training corps programs at civilian colleges and universities. \nThe Blue Ridge Rifles and the Color Guard of NGCSU have exhibited \nconsistently excellent performances at the Mardi Gras Invitational. \nThis tradition continued with the most recent Mardi Gras Invitation \nDrill Meet, held on February 23, 2001, where the NGCSU cadets competed \nagainst 42 military drill teams from colleges and universities \nthroughout the United States. The Blue Ridge Rifles, under the command \nof Cadet Captain Phillip Pelphry and Cadet Master Sergeant Zachary \nPoole, received first place in platoon basic drill, second place in \nsquad drill, and first place in platoon exhibition drill. The North \nGeorgia College and State University Color Guard, under the command of \nCadet Captain Chris Rivers, received first place in the color guard \ncompetition.\n  I would like to recognize the following cadets for their fine \nrepresentation of North Georgia College and State University and of the \nentire state of Georgia.\n  The Blue Ridge Rifle Team: Joseph Byerly; Gregg Carey; Joshua \nCarvalho; Josh Clemmons; Byron Davison; John Filiatreau; Kurt Fricton; \nJason Howard; Joseph Marty; Phillip Pelphry; Jason Pon; Zachary Poole; \nJason Ryncarz; Jonathan Sellars; Benjamin Sisk; Jeffrey Wagner; Zachary \nZeis; and The Color Guard Team: Colin Arms; Peter Bender; Kyle Harvey; \nErnesto Johnson and Chris Rivers.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/14/senate-section/article/S2304-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S2304]]\n                      TRIBUTE TO ELIZABETH ROBERT\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to congratulate Elizabeth \nRobert, a graduate of Middlebury College and the University of Vermont, \nfor her success in transforming the struggling Vermont Teddy Bear \nCompany into a highly profitable e-business.\n  Ms. Robert joined the Vermont Teddy Bear Company as its Chief \nFinancial Officer in 1995 and only two years later rose to the position \nof Chief Executive Officer. In 1997, profits at Vermont Teddy Bear \nCompany were way down and the future was bleak. Now, only three years \nlater, sales are up 50 percent and the company boasts more than $22 \nmillion in annual sales. This spectacular turnaround was spearheaded by \nElizabeth Robert, who harnessed the power of the Internet to transform \nthe Teddy Bear Company into a successful Bear-Gram gift delivery \nservice. The company's website is http://store.yahoo.com/vtbear/.\n  Recently, The Rutland Herald and The Times Argus, featured Ms. Robert \nas a ``captain of industry.'' I ask that the full text of the Rutland \nHerald/Times Argus article of March 11, 2001, titled ``Elizabeth \nRobert: A `captain of industry' bears watching'' be printed in the \nRecord.\n  Liz's success is a shining example for all Vermonter business leaders \nto follow. By taking advantage of the new markets offered by the \nInternet and developing a sharply focused business plan, the Vermont \nTeddy Bear Company has doubled its sales and significantly expanded its \ncustomer base.\n  Last year, I invited Liz Robert to be the keynote speaker at my \nannual Women's Economic Opportunity Conference in Vermont. Ms. Robert \nshared her personal story with hundreds of women who attended the \nconference and encouraged each of them to follow their dreams. As an \nincredibly successful businesswoman and the mother of two teen-aged \ndaughters, she is an inspiration for all of us. My wife, Marcelle, and \nI were proud to be there with her.\n\n       Elizabeth Robert: A ``Captain of Industry'' Bears Watching\n\n                        (By Sally West Johnson)\n\n       Elizabeth Robert is nothing like her product. This woman, \n     who took over the floundering Vermont Teddy Bear Co. and \n     returned it to solvency, exudes a cool, angular self-\n     confidence that is not a bit like the warm and cuddly \n     personae of her stuffed bears.\n       A wiry, athletic 45-year-old, Robert has been with Vermont \n     Teddy Bear since 1995, when she signed on as chief financial \n     officer in what was already a financially troubled time. The \n     charm of founder John Sortino's bear-peddling pushcart \n     operation on Church Street in Burlington had long since worn \n     thin; his successor, Patrick Burns, ``took us on a trip down \n     teddy-bear lane,'' says Robert, explaining that Burns had a \n     vision of turning the company into a Disney-like conglomerate \n     that sold all things ursine. But that idea tanked, and when \n     Burns left town, Robert took over as chief executive officer \n     in October 1997.\n       In truth, taking on a top job had been in her game plan for \n     a long time. It's part of who she is, and she knew it. She \n     comes from several generations of highly accomplished women. \n     Her grandmother emigrated from Armenia to Paris, where she \n     worked in the laboratory of Mme. Marie Curie and later, \n     according to Robert, became the first female pediatrician in \n     Geneva. In the early 1940s, Robert's mother was working as a \n     photo editor at Time-Life Inc. ``I grew up in a household \n     where everything was possible,'' she says.\n       A Middlebury College alumna, class of 1978, she married \n     English professor Bob Hill in 1980, then had her first child \n     10 days before entering graduate school at the University of \n     Vermont. They have since divorced. With an MBA in hand, she \n     worked at all sorts of jobs for the next few years: at \n     Vermont Gas Systems, as a financial consultant, and as \n     campaign manager for Louise McCarren's 1990 run for \n     lieutenant governor. It was McCarren, now president of \n     Verizon in Vermont, who pointed out the obvious to her.\n       ``She told me that I wanted to be a captain of industry . . \n     . and she was exactly right,'' says Robert of her mentor. ``I \n     had been learning, accumulating a skill set with undefined \n     purpose. Now I knew what the purpose was.''\n       She leapt into her future by signing on as chief financial \n     officer with a high-tech start-up in Williston, Air Mouse \n     Remote Controls. ``We were constantly groveling for money, \n     constantly short of cash,'' she recalls. If it didn't seem to \n     be a blessing at the time, ``all that experience would be \n     relevant to me when I got to Vermont Teddy Bear.''\n       Robert's success at VTB has made her much in demand as a \n     speaker, especially when the subject is business \n     strategizing. Invited to address a UVM graduate class last \n     fall, she immediately turns the tables on her students. \n     ``What business is Vermont Teddy Bear in?'' she asks them. \n     (Hint: The correct answer is not ``selling teddy bears.'')\n       ``We are in the Bear-Gram gift delivery service,'' she \n     informs them after a few proffer hesitant guesses. ``We are \n     delivering a highly personalized message, and one that can be \n     changed right up to the last minute.''\n       Are Vermont Teddy Bears expensive? Yes, partly because they \n     are exclusively made in America, which costs more than making \n     them overseas. But then VTB isn't selling toys for kids. \n     ``You can't sell the Lover Boy bear off the retail shelf for \n     $65 or $75 even on Madison Avenue,'' explains Robert, ``but \n     you can sell them for $85 if you guarantee delivery the next \n     day and sell them with an embroidered shirt and a personal \n     message transcribed by a bear counselor.''\n       She settles into the story of VTB's decline into--and \n     resurrection from--bankruptcy with the confidence born of \n     success. It is a classic tale of a company getting too big, \n     too fast. ``We went from revenues of $300,000 in 1990 to $20 \n     million in 1994,'' she recounts. But after an IPO in late \n     1993, ``the company hit the wall. We were spending huge \n     amounts of money: We were advertising on Rush Limbaugh for $1 \n     million a year; we spent $8.1 million on the new building (in \n     Shelburne).''\n       In some ways, the financial crisis was relatively easy to \n     manage: ``When there is no money,'' she notes, ``the answer \n     is always `no.' '' With Robert's modified, and sharply \n     focused, sales strategies, the company began to come back. A \n     hugely successful Valentine's Day in 1998 liquidated the old \n     inventory and brought in a huge pile of cash. The company \n     picked up corporate-gift clients such as Seagrams, Nabisco \n     and Triaminic, the cold-medicine people. It also focused on \n     direct marketing of Bear-Grams through radio advertising to a \n     clientele Robert calls generically ``Late Jack''--a guy \n     between 18 and 54 years old who has forgotten the holiday, \n     whatever it is. They can bail him out at the last minute with \n     a gift that costs about the same as a nice bouquet of flowers \n     but lasts a lot longer and is more personal.\n       In fiscal 1998, VTB reported a net loss of $2 million. \n     Thanks to ``Late Jack,'' in fiscal 2000 company books showed \n     sales of $33 million, with a profit of $3.7 million. At the \n     moment, Elizabeth Robert is pretty much where she wanted to \n     be.\n       ``I am now a captain of industry,'' she says. The remark is \n     candid, not boastful. ``I'm not at the end of my career by \n     any means, but I don't see the need to move on at this \n     point.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/14/senate-section/article/S2304-2", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO GENE CONNOLLY\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

A bill to amend the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 \nto modify the requirements for voter mail registration and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce a commonsense \nelection reform bill which we have entitled the Safeguard the Vote Act. \nI realize other reform issues have received a lot of media attention, \nbut I think it is vital to focus on the fundamental issue of casting \nand counting votes honestly and fairly as well.\n  Over the past months, many Americans saw for the first time how \nactual vote counting is done or not done. We have had a real-life \ncivics lesson that was as unexpected as it was frustrating. Those of us \nin positions of responsibility need to fix what needs fixing, reform \nwhat needs reforming, and prosecute where actual wrongdoing has \noccurred.\n  Voting is the most important civic duty and responsibility for \ncitizens in our form of government. It should not be diluted by fraud, \nfalse filings in lawsuits, judges who do not follow the law, \npoliticians who try to profit from confusion, and people who just abuse \nthe system.\n  Let me be clear, at the same time voters must not be unduly confused \nby complicated ballots or confounded by inadequate phone lines or \nvoting booths. These barriers to voting are absolutely unacceptable, \nand we need to make sure they do not exist.\n  Having said that--and I believe very strongly in it--I also say to \nsome who want to hide the other abuses, do not try to use general \nconfusion as an excuse or a justification for fraud.\n  I want to make one simple point as I begin. Vote fraud is not about \npartisanship. It is not about Democrats versus Republicans. It is not \nabout the north side of St. Louis versus the south side of St. Louis. \nIt is not about somebody getting a partisan advantage. It is about \njustice.\n  Vote fraud is a criminal not a political act. Illegal votes dilute \nthe value of votes cast legally. When people try to stuff the ballot \nbox, what they are really doing is trying to steal political power from \nthose who follow election laws.\n  On election night in November of 2000, I was exercised and somewhat \nupset, one might say, as we learned about what was going on in St. \nLouis city where orders had been issued to keep the voting booths open \nin certain areas for an extended period of time. Lawyers appealed that \ndecision, and the Missouri Court of Appeals shut them down. They wrote:\n\n       (E)qual vigilance is required to ensure that only those \n     entitled to vote are allowed to cast a ballot. Otherwise, the \n     rights of those lawfully entitled to vote are inevitably \n     diluted.\n\n  Unfortunately, what we have seen in St. Louis these past months has \nbeen nothing short of breathtaking. Some might say that we have even \nbecome a national laughingstock. We have dead people registering by \nmail.\n  This city alderman died more than 10 years ago. He was registered to \nvote on cards turned in just before the March 6 mayoral primary. We had \npeople registering from vacant lots. The media in St. Louis was very \naggressive, and they checked on some of the voter addresses. There was \nno building there. They did not even see the tents in which people were \nliving.\n  Voter rolls in St. Louis had more names on the registered active and \ninactive list than there were people in St. Louis city. It begins to \nraise suspicions.\n  A city judge exceeded the law by providing extended voting hours for \nonly selected polling places. Then there is the strange story of a \nplaintiff in that case who claimed he ``has not been able to vote and \nfears he will not be able to vote because of long lines at the polling \nplaces and machine breakdowns.'' It was discovered he had two problems. \nHe was dead, in which case long lines should not have been a problem \nbecause he was not going anywhere anyway.\n  The lawyer then came up with somebody else: Oh, what we really meant \nto say was a guy whose name is similar to that, so they tracked him \nout. The\n\n[[Page S2308]]\n\nproblem was he had already voted when the lawyers filed the sworn \nstatement saying that he was worried about not being able to \nvote, which, I guess, we can only conclude meant he was worried about \ncasting a second illegal ballot.\n\n  We have had felons voting, people not even registered voting. Just \nwhen you think we have seen it all--this is my favorite--here is the \nvoting registration card that was sent in in October of 1994 by one \nRitzy Mekler. The interesting thing about Ritzy Mekler is that Ritzy is \na dog. We do not know how many times Ritzy may have voted, but this \nseems to be an unwarranted extension of the voting franchise. Much as I \nlove dogs, I don't really think they should be voting. This is \ncertainly a new avenue for those who like pets. But that is the kind of \nthing with which we need to deal.\n  The end result of all these revelations is that a city grand jury in \nSt. Louis is now investigating fraudulent voter registration, and the \nlawyers involved have sent the U.S. attorney a 250-page report. People \nare beginning to take it seriously. You don't have to take my word for \nit. Local St. Louis city Democrats have had a few things to say.\n  St. Louis' current mayor, Clarence Harmon, said:\n\n       I think there is ample, longstanding evidence of voter \n     fraud in our community.\n\n  State representative Quincy Troupe said:\n\n       There is no doubt in any black elected official's mind that \n     the whole process has discouraged honest elections in the \n     city of St. Louis for some time. We know that we have people \n     who cheat in every election. The only way you can win a close \n     election in this town, you have to beat the cheat.\n\n  From another side, 11th ward alderman, Matt Villa, said:\n\n       Who knows who did it. But it is apparent they are trying to \n     cheat and steal this election.\n\n  The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, which has been aggressively covering \nthis story, noted on its editorial page:\n\n       St. Louis appears to have a full-blown election scandal \n     that grows with each newly discovered box of bogus \n     registration cards.\n\n  As I noted earlier, I believe it is our duty to fix what needs to be \nfixed, reform what needs to be reformed, and prosecute where there has \nbeen wrongdoing. In St. Louis, I believe criminal prosecutions are \nbeing considered. Coupled with the bill I am introducing today, this \nshould go a long way toward cleaning up what has gone wrong in St. \nLouis.\n  I might add, just the threat of criminal prosecutions appear to have \nmade a difference in the mayoral primary in St. Louis last week. It was \na lot more honest than it has been in a long time. There is nothing \nlike the healthy atmosphere of possible criminal prosecutions to make \npeople think maybe we should not try to steal this election.\n  Well, let me go through the list of things we found out are \ncontributing to fraud.\n  The first obvious problem is the blatant fraud of the bogus voter \nregistrations. With dead people reregistering, fake names, phony \naddresses, and dogs being registered, it is clear the system is being \nabused.\n  Nearly all of these fraudulent registrations were the mail-in forms. \nOur plan begins by addressing this type of fraud with a few simple \nreforms. These are changing Federal law, which in some instances, has \nactually facilitated voter fraud.\n  1. First-time voters who register by mail would be required to vote \nin person and present a photo ID the first time after registration. We \ntrust that the local officials would recognize the dog if she came in--\neven with a photo registration.\n\n  2. If the follow-up registration card is returned to the election \noffice as undeliverable by the post office, States would be allowed \nimmediately to remove those names from the rolls, provided they made a \ngood-faith effort to ensure that eligible voters would not be removed \nfrom the rolls.\n  3. Finally, the bill would give the States the authority to include \non the mail registration form a place for notarization or other form of \nauthentication. Under current Federal law, States are actually \nprohibited from including this safeguard.\n  I believe the incentives for the bogus addresses and fake names would \nbe virtually eliminated by these simple safeguards, while all the \nlegitimate efforts to encourage new voters to register could, should, \nand must continue.\n  The second major problem we have seen in St. Louis is that the voter \nrolls are so clogged up with incorrect or fraudulent data that legal \nvoters are shortchanged. St. Louis city actually, as I said earlier, \nhas more voters listed on its active plus inactive rolls than the \nvoting age population of the city. That is not surprising if they are \nregistering dead people, dogs, and people from vacant lots.\n  Even more amazing is the fact that the Secretary of State said in a \nrecent report that 5,000 of the names on the inactive list are actually \nduplicates of other names on the inactive list. There are numerous \nother examples of names on both the active and inactive lists at the \nsame time. These inactive lists are what is being used for election day \nregistration and voting. They just go in and say my name is on the \ninactive list. Hundreds were allowed to vote in that instance.\n  Thus, it is painfully clear that something must be done to keep the \nvoter rolls clean and accurate.\n  The bill I introduce includes two basic reforms to assist in the \ncleanup of voter rolls. First, it would require States to conduct a \nprogram of cleaning up lists wherever the voter roll list of eligible \nvoters is larger than the number of people of voting age in that county \nor city. That seems to make only common sense. I can't imagine anyone \nopposing that if you have more people registered than you have people, \nsomething is wrong.\n  Second, my proposal adopts the commonsense approach just used by the \nSt. Louis election board in their March primary. For those voters whose \nnames have been moved to the inactive list, it would require that a \nphoto ID be presented by the voter as part of their oral or written \naffirmation of their address when they seek to vote again. The board of \nelections just required this in last week's election, and that election \nseemed to go off without a hitch.\n  I believe these straightforward reforms will go a long way toward \nrestoring the confidence in the voter registration and balloting \nprocess. But for those who insist on continuing their fraudulent \nactivities, this bill strengthens criminal penalties for those who \ncommit fraud or conspire to commit voter fraud.\n  Finally, given the dimensions of the vote fraud scandal in St. Louis, \nthis legislation creates a national pilot project to clean up voter \nlists in St. Louis in order to assist in ending election day corruption \nacross the Nation.\n  I have proposed that the Federal Election Commission run the project \nin St. Louis city and St. Louis County to develop a method we can use \nnationally to maintain accurate voter rolls and ensure that all \nproperly registered voters are permitted to vote without wrongfully \nbeing disenfranchised by failure of their registration to be effective, \nor by allowing others who are not qualified and registered to vote, \ndiluting their votes. The FEC would also coordinate records of voters \nregistered to vote at places authorized under the National Voter \nRegistration Act of 1993, along with State death and felony conviction \nrecords and the official voter registered for each polling place.\n  As the Missouri Court of Appeals wrote when they shut down the \nimproper efforts to keep only certain polling places open:\n\n       . . . (C)ommendable zeal to protect voting rights must be \n     tempered by the corresponding duty to protect the integrity \n     of the voting process. . . . (E)qual vigilance is required to \n     ensure that only those entitled to vote are allowed to cast a \n     ballot. Otherwise, the rights of those lawfully entitled to \n     vote are inevitably diluted.\n\n  With these new tools, and some real leadership, the election boards \nof St. Louis City, and St. Louis County could get the big broom--and \nstart cleaning up the mess. Criminal investigations are ongoing, I hope \nthat anyone responsible for cheating will be caught and punished. But \nwe must get a handle on the voter rolls. People who register and follow \nthe rules shouldn't be frustrated by inadequate polling places and \nphone lines or confused by out-of-date lists. At the same time, we must \nrequire voter lists to be scrubbed and reviewed in a much more timely \nmanner--so the cheaters cannot use confusion as their friend.\n  I certainly don't want St. Louis to have the lasting reputation \ndescribed by my old friend Quincy Troupe:\n\n\n[[Page S2309]]\n\n\n       The only way you can win a close election in this town, you \n     have to beat the cheat.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Jeffords, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Murkowski, Mr. Breaux, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Dorgan, Mrs. \n        Feinstein, Mr. Craig, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Schumer, \n        and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 530. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na 5-year extension of the credit for producing electricity from wind; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important tax \nlegislation for myself and Senators Jeffords, Leahy, Murkowski, Breaux, \nSmith of Oregon, Dorgan, Feinstein, Craig, Murray, Johnson, Schumer, \nand Conrad.\n  This legislation, entitled the ``Bipartisan Renewable Efficient \nEnergy with Zero Effluent, (BREEZE) Act'', extends the production tax \ncredit for energy generated by wind for five years. The current tax \ncredit is set to expire on January 1, 2002.\n  As author of the Wind Energy Incentives Act of 1993, I sought to give \nthis alternative energy source the ability to compete against \ntraditional, finite energy sources. I strongly believe that the \nexpansion and development of wind energy must be facilitated by this \nproduction tax credit.\n  Wind, unlike most energy sources, is an efficient and environmentally \nsafe form of energy production. Wind energy makes valuable \ncontributions to maintaining cleaner air and a cleaner environment. \nEvery 10,000 megawatts of wind energy produced in the United States can \nreduce carbon monoxide emissions by 33 million metric tons by replacing \nthe combustion of fossil fuels.\n  Since the inception of the wind energy production tax credit in 1993, \nmore than 1,128 megawatts of generating capacity have been put online. \nThis generating capacity powers nearly 300,000 homes, or 750,000 \npeople.\n  Over 900 megawatts of new wind energy capacity was added just last \nyear, bringing wind energy generating capacity in the U.S. to more than \n2,500 megawatts. This new wind energy will power the equivalent of over \n240,000 American homes, while displacing over 1.8 million tons of \ncarbon dioxide.\n  Equally important, wind energy increases our energy independence, \nthereby providing the United States with insulation from an oil supply \ndominated by the Middle East. Our national security is currently \nthreatened by a heavy reliance on oil from abroad.\n  The price of wind energy has been reduced more than 80 percent in the \npast two decades, making it the most affordable type of renewable \nenergy. In order to continue this investment in America's energy \nfuture, we must extend the production tax credit.\n  Currently, my own State of Iowa has 4 new wind power projects ready \nto go online just this year. These 4 projects, with the megawatt \ncapacity of over 240, will join the already existing 20 facilities in \nIowa. Even large petroleum producing States like Texas are recognizing \nthe growing potential of wind energy. Texas has the third largest wind \nfarm in the world, and plans to add 5 new facilities this year, adding \nto the 7 already online.\n  Moreover, wind energy has vast potential to contribute to \nCalifornia's electricity supply. As we all know, California is \ncurrently suffering because of an energy market with insufficient \nenergy generation and production that is overly dependent on natural \ngas.\n  Just in the past few weeks, plans have been unveiled to develop what \nwill be the world's two largest wind power plants in the Northwest. One \nwill be installed on the Oregon-Washington boundary and the other at \nthe U.S. Department of Energy's Nevada Test Site. Together, the two \nplants will have a capacity of 560 megawatts and will generate enough \npower annually to serve more than half a million people. In addition, a \nnumber of other new projects coming online this year in the West will \nalso bring much-needed additional generating capacity to the region.\n  Wind energy also produces substantial economic benefits. For each \nwind turbine, a farmer or rancher can receive more than $2,000 per year \nfor 20 years in direct lease payments. Iowa's major wind farms already \npay more than $640,000 per year to landowners. In California, the \ndevelopment of 1,000 megawatts would mean annual payments of \napproximately $2 million to farm and forest landowners.\n  Extending the wind energy tax credit would allow for even greater \nexpansion in the wind energy field. Wind is a domestically produced \nnatural resource, found abundantly across the country. Because wind \nenergy is homegrown, it cannot be controlled by any foreign power.\n  Wind energy can be harnessed without injury to our environment. Wind \nis a reliable form of power that is renewable and inextinguishable. \nThis legislation ensures that wind energy does not fall by the wayside \nas a productive alternative energy source.\n  The Senate needs to extend this important legislation and I encourage \nmy colleagues to join us in this effort.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 530\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Bipartisan Renewable, \n     Efficient Energy with Zero Effluent (BREEZE) Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. 5-YEAR EXTENSION OF CREDIT FOR PRODUCING ELECTRICITY \n                   FROM WIND.\n\n       Section 45(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     (relating to wind facility) is amended by striking ``January \n     1, 2002'' and inserting ``January 1, 2007''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Mr. Cleland, and Mr. Dorgan):\n  S. 531. A bill to promote recreation on Federal lakes, to require \nFederal agencies responsible for managing Federal lakes to pursue \nstrategies for enhancing recreational experiences of the public, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National \nRecreation Lakes Act of 2001--a bill that will recognize the benefits \nand value of recreation at federal lakes and give recreation a seat at \nthe table in the management decisions of all our federal lakes. I am \nproud to be joined in this effort today by Senator Cleland of Georgia \nand Senator Dorgan of North Dakota.\n  Recreation on our federal lakes has become a powerful tourist magnet, \nattracting some 900 million visitors annually and generating an \nestimated $44 billion in economic activity--mostly spent on privately-\nprovided goods and services. And by the middle of this century, our \nfederal lakes are expected to host nearly 2 billion visitors per year.\n  Yet, even with the millions of visitors each year to our lakes and \nreservoirs, recreation has suffered from a lack of unifying policy \ndirection and leadership, as well as insufficient interagency and \nintergovernmental planning and coordination. Most federal agencies are \nfocused on the traditional functions of man-made lakes and reservoirs: \nflood control, hydroelectric power, water supply, irrigation, and \nnavigation. And often recreation is left out of the decision process.\n  This legislation will reaffirm that recreation is also an authorized \npurpose at almost all federal lakes and direct the agencies managing \nthese projects to take action to reemphasize recreation programs in \ntheir management plans. This legislation will emphasize partnerships \nbetween the Federal Government, local governments, and private groups \nto promote responsible recreation on all our federal lakes.\n  It will establish a National Recreation Lakes Demonstration Program \ncomprised of up to 25 lakes across the nation. At each of these federal \nlakes, the managing agency will be empowered to develop creative \nagreements with private sector recreation providers as well as state \nland agencies to enhance recreation opportunities. Rather than just \nbuilding new federal campgrounds with tax dollars, we need to create \nnew partnerships to provide support for building recreation \ninfrastructure that is in line with visitor and tourist desires for \nrecreation. The National Recreation Lakes Demonstration Program will be \na pilot project to test these creative agreements and management \ntechniques on a small scale to demonstrate their effectiveness at \npromoting recreation on federal lakes.\n\n[[Page S2310]]\n\n  Second, this legislation will establish a Federal Recreation Lakes \nLeadership Council to coordinate the National Recreation Lakes \nDemonstration Program and coordinate efforts among federal agencies to \npromote recreation on federal lakes.\n  It also will include the Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers in the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program. The Fee \nDemo Program has had wide successes in Arkansas and across the country \nin allowing individual parks and recreation areas to keep more of their \nfee revenues on-site to reduce the often overwhelming maintenance \nbacklog.\n\n  The legislation will also provide for periodic review of the \nmanagement of recreation at federal water projects--something long \noverdue. A great deal has changed since many of the water projects were \nauthorized, yet the initial legislative direction from over 70 years \nago continues to be the basis for the management practices now in the \nyear 2001--and that is not right.\n  Finally, the legislation will provide new opportunities to link the \nnational recreation lakes initiative with other federal recreation \nassistance efforts, including the Wallop-Breaux program for boating and \nfishing.\n  Let me give you a little background on how this legislation was \ndeveloped. In 1996, the U.S. Senate recognized that recreation was \nbecoming more important on federal lakes and conceived the National \nRecreation Lakes Study Commission to review the current and anticipated \ndemand for recreational opportunities on federally managed lakes and \nreservoirs. The National Recreation Lakes Study Commission were charged \nto ``review the current and anticipated demand for recreational \nopportunities at federally managed man-made lakes and reservoirs'' and \n``to develop alternatives for enhanced recreational use of such \nfacilities.''\n  The Commission released its long-awaited report confirming the impact \nof recreation on federally-managed, man-made lakes in June of last \nyear. The Commission also recognized that we are far from realizing \ntheir full potential. The study documented that these lakes are \npowerful tourist magnets, attracting some 900 million visitors annually \nand generating an estimated $44 billion dollars in economic activity--\nmostly spent on privately-provided goods and services.\n  During the Energy and Natural Resources Committee's hearing in 1999 \non the Recreation Lakes Study, the chairman and I spent some time \ndiscussing how children today do not take full advantage of the outdoor \nopportunities that are available to them. It is so important that we \nencourage our children to enjoy the great outdoors that often times is \nless than an hour's drive away.\n  As the mother of twin 4-year-old boys, I feel we need to encourage \nour children to be children, not to become adults too quickly, to learn \nhow to enjoy the outdoors. The only way we can do that is by exposing \nthem to it early and often.\n  In this Nation, we have nearly 1,800 federally managed lakes and \nreservoirs. There are 38 in my home state of Arkansas. With so many \nfederal lakes throughout the country, there's no reason why we \nshouldn't do all we can to promote recreation. I know that in Arkansas, \nwe don't think twice about getting away to the lake for the weekend to \ngo boating or fishing, or to just get away from the day-to-day grind. \nAnd that doesn't even begin to get into the tremendous economic impact \nfrom recreation on our federal lakes.\n  Last August, I conducted a tour of two of our Corps of Engineers \nmanaged lakes in Arkansas--Lake Ouachita and Greers Ferry Lake--to \nobserve how our lakes are managed and to see where recreation falls on \nthe priority list. I saw many opportunities where the Corps of \nEngineers, working with local officials and private citizens, could, \nthrough innovative management techniques, better provide for the \nrecreation needs of the thousands of Arkansans that visit Arkansas' \nlakes each year. This bill will enable our federal lakes in Arkansas \nand around the country to invest in and manage for recreation so we all \ncan enjoy a day out on the lake.\n\n  This bill is not an attempt to completely rewrite how federal lakes \nin this country are managed or to put recreation in front of all other \nauthorized purposes at federal lakes. The National Recreation Lakes Act \nof 2001 will work with all current laws and regulations to ensure that \nrecreation is given a seat at the table when the management decisions \nare made for our federal lakes.\n  This is a good bill. In everything from the creation of jobs to the \nmoney that tourists like myself spend at the marinas and local stores \nsurrounding the lake--our Federal lakes and reservoirs have an immense \nrecreational value that can and does bring revenues into our local \neconomies. The best way to encourage and expand this aspect is to \nensure that recreation is given a higher priority in the management of \nour federal lakes.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation and look \nforward to the debate on how we can promote recreation on our federal \nlakes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 531\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Recreation Lakes \n     Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I want to express my support for the \nNational Recreation Lakes Act which is being introduced today by \nSenator Blanche Lincoln and others. This bill will give recreation \ninterests a seat at the table when decisions are made about the use of \nFederal lakes. I think that this bill in an important part of \nrecognizing the great benefits that our Federal lakes provide to \ncommunities all across the country.\n  This bill creates a pilot program that will encompass 25 national \nrecreation demonstration lakes. These lakes will ensure that \nrecreational interests get a voice in the decision making process. We \nrely on these lakes for so many different things: irrigation, hydro-\npower, navigation. In many cases, recreational interests are an \nafterthought. This bill will give recreation the priority that it \ndeserves.\n  Lake Sakakawea is located in my home state of North Dakota. I have \nworked with the community leaders there to try and make the importance \nof recreational interests a part of the discussion regarding the level \nof the lake and the use of the water in the lake. This is a perfect \nexample of a lake that would benefit from this legislation.\n  I commend Senator Lincoln for the hard work that she has done on this \nlegislation and I look forward to working with her to move this bill \nthrough the legislative process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Burns, Mr. Daschle, \n        Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Conrad):\n  S. 532. A bill to amend the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and \nRodenticide Act to permit a State to register a Canadian pesticide for \ndistribution and use within that State; to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today, along with Senators Baucus, Burns, \nDaschle, Johnson, and Conrad, I am introducing legislation that would \nprovide equitable treatment for U.S. farmers in the pricing of \nagricultural pesticides. This legislation would allow a state, a \nperson, or a farm organization or cooperative/farm supply company to \nserve as a registrant for a Canadian pesticide which is identical or \nsubstantially similar to a U.S. registered pesticide. This bill is \nidentical to the legislation I introduced last September.\n  The need for this legislation is as great as ever. We are about to \nstart spring planting, and U.S. farmers are once again going to be \nrequired to pay more--in some cases almost twice as much--than their \nCanadian counterparts for crop protection products that are virtually \nidentical in substance.\n  I have pointed out in the past that when the U.S.-Canada Free Trade \nAgreement came into effect, part of the understanding on agriculture \nwas that our two nations were going to move rapidly toward the \nharmonization of pesticide regulations. Howsever, we have entered a new \ndecade, and century, no less, and relatively little progress in \nharmonization has been accomplished that is meaningful to family \nfarmers.\n  Since this trade agreement took effect, the pace of Canadian spring \nand durum wheat, and barley exports to the United States have grown \nfrom a barely noticeable trickle into annual floods of imported grain \ninto our markets. Over the years, I have described many factors that \nhave produced this unfair trade relationship and un-level playing field \nbetween farmers of our two nations. The failure to achieve \nharmonization in pesticides between the United States and Canada \ncompounds this ongoing trade problem.\n  Our farmers are concerned that agricultural pesticides that are not \navailable in the United States are being utilized by farmers in Canada \nto produce wheat, barley, and other agricultural commodities that are \nsubsequently imported and consumed in the United States. They \nrightfully believe that it is unfair to import commodities produced \nwith agricultural pesticides that are not available to U.S. producers. \nHowever, it is not just a difference of availability of agricultural \npesticides between our two countries, but also in the pricing of these \nchemicals.\n  A year ago, our farmers were denied the right to bring a pesticide \nacross the border that was cleared for use in our country, but was not \navailable locally because the company who manufacturers this product \nchose not to sell it here. They were selling a more expensive version \nof the product here. The simple fact is, this company was using our \nenvironmental protection laws as a means to extract a higher price from \nour farmers. This simply is not right.\n  I have pointed out, time and time again, the fact that there are \nsignificant differences in prices being paid for essentially the same \npesticide by farmers in our two countries. In fact, in a recent survey, \nfarmers in the United States were paying between 117 percent and 193 \npercent higher prices than Canadian farmers for a number of pesticides. \nThis was after adjusting for differences in currency exchange rates at \nthat time.\n  The farmers in my state are simply fed up with what is going on. They \nsee grain flooding across the border, while they are unable to access \nthe more inexpensive production inputs available in our ``free trade'' \nenvironment. And I might add, this grain coming into our country has \nbeen treated with these products which our farmers are denied access \nto. This simply must end.\n  As I stated earlier, today, my colleagues and I are reintroducing \nlegislation that would take an important step in providing equitable \ntreatment for U.S. farmers in the pricing of agricultural pesticides. \nThis bill would only deal with agricultural chemicals that are \nidentical or substantially similar. It only deals with pesticides that \nhave already undergone rigorous review processes and whose formulations \nhave been registered and approved for use in both countries by the \nrespective regulatory agencies.\n  The bill would establish a procedure by which states may apply for \nand receive an Environmental Protection Agency label for agricultural \nchemicals sold in Canada that are identical or substantially similar to \nagricultural chemicals used in the United States. Thus, U.S. producers \nand suppliers could purchase such chemicals in Canada for use in the \nUnited States. The need for this bill is created by pesticide companies \nwhich use chemical labeling laws to protect their marketing and pricing \nstructures, rather than the public interest. In their selective \nlabeling of identical or substantially similar products across the \nborder they are able to extract unjustified profits from farmers, and \ncreate un-level pricing fields between our two countries.\n  This bill is one legislative step in the process of full \nharmonization of pesticides between our two nations. It is designed \nspecifically to address the problem of pricing differentials on \nchemicals that are currently available in both countries. We need to \ntake this step, so that we can begin the process of creating a level \nplaying field between farmers of our two countries. This bill would \nmake harmonization a reality for those pesticides in which their actual \nselling price is the only real difference.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 532\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my support of the \nPesticide Harmonization Act. Last year, Senator Dorgan attempted to \naddress this problem in the VA/HUD Appropriations Conference. I \ncommitted myself to work with him and move this legislation this year. \nI am a cosponsor of this bill because of this commitment and to even \nout a serious trade imbalance facing the agriculture industry in our \ncountry.\n  In my home State of Montana and many other western and mid-western \nStates, we have faced a number of trade disputes between Canada and the \nUnited States. One of the most glaring discrepancies deals with \npesticides. Chemicals that are sold for one price just across the \nborder in Canada are sold at a considerably higher cost to American \nproducers. Why does this happen you may ask? The EPA places strong \nregulations on chemicals used in the United States and therefore, the \nchemical companies believe they should hike up the prices to pay for \ntheir trouble.\n  The chemicals in Canada and the United States, in most cases, have \nthe exact same chemical make-up. The same company manufactures them, \nbut often gives them a different name and nearly always prices the \nAmerican chemicals higher. The crops treated with chemicals our farmers \nare not allowed to use are easily imported into the United States. \nThese crops were developed at a lower production cost and are now \ncompeting with American products. I am a strong believer in fair trade, \nbut for free trade to actually occur, this problem must be addressed.\n  Currently, American farmers are facing a serious economic recession. \nPrices are the lowest they have been in a number of years and there \ndoes not appear to be a light at the end of the tunnel. Additionally, \nthe West is looking at yet another year of severe drought. Already, \nsnow packs are considerably below normal. Also, fertilizer costs are \nsky-rocketing with the high cost of fuel and energy. Compounding their \nproblem is being forced to pay twice as much for nearly the same \nchemicals as their foreign neighbors.\n  If enacted, this bill would eliminate current obstacles and even the \nplaying field for our farmers. It would allow States or individual \nproducers to seek a registration for a Canadian pesticide. This could \nonly be done if, upon request by the State, the pesticide is found to \nbe identical or substantially similar to the U.S. pesticide. The EPA \nstill has final authority to disapprove the registrations within 90 \ndays. Once the pesticide is found to be the same or similar and the EPA \napproves, the State or individual can travel to Canada and purchase the \nchemical.\n  Our farmers and ranchers have been paying too much for their \npesticides and chemicals for too long. From my years as a football \nreferee, I learned everyone needs to follow the same rules to play the \ngame. We need to make sure Canadian farmers and U.S. farmers are \nplaying under the same rules. I\n\n[[Page S2316]]\n\nbelieve this bill makes that happen. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on this crucial issue to America's farmers and ranchers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 534. A bill to establish a Federal interagency task force for the \npurpose of coordinating actions to prevent the outbreak of bovine \nspongiform encephalopathy (commonly known as ``mad cow disease'') and \nfoot-and-mouth disease in the United States; to the Committee on \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Mad Cow Prevention \nAct of 2001 which would help ease the American consumer's growing \nconcern about our food supply. We can no longer take for granted that \nour food supply will not be tainted by bovine spongiform \nencephalopathy, BSE, commonly known as Mad Cow Disease, which has \ninfected over 175,000 cattle in Great Britain and Europe. We also \nshould be concerned about the growing threat of foot-and-mouth disease \nand other associated diseases to America's meat supply.\n  The bill I introduce today establishes a Federal Interagency Task \nForce, to be chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture, for the purpose \nof coordinating actions to prevent the outbreak of Mad Cow Disease. The \nagencies will include the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of \nCommerce, the Secretary of Health and Human Service, the Secretary of \nTreasury, the Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, the \nDirector of the National Institutes of Health, the Director of the \nCenters for Disease Control, the Commissioner of Customs, and any other \nagencies the President deems appropriate.\n  No later than 60 days after the enactment of this legislation the \ntask force will submit to Congress a report which will describe the \nactions the agencies are taking and plan to take to prevent the spread \nof BSE and make recommendations for the future prevention of the spread \nof this disease to the United Sates. The Task Force should also \nconsider and report on foot-and-mouth disease, chronic wasting disease \nand other diseases associated with our meat industries.\n  Recently, a situation developed in Texas prompting the quarantine of \nover a 1000 head of cattle. The animals were quickly purchased and \ntaken out of the food chain by Purina. But, this incident shows how \neasily a contamination may start. It also has raised questions on how \nthis disease can be controlled.\n  In order to address this problem, on February 9, 2001, I wrote to \nSecretary Veneman and requested a report from the USDA regarding our \ngovernment's response to mad cow disease specifically addressing: what \nUSDA is doing to address this problem; what other federal agencies are \ndoing; what any future plans are; and how USDA proposes to prevent the \nintroduction and spread of mad cow disease in the United States.\n  However, since I sent my letter to the USDA Secretary, the situation \nin Europe has gone from bad to worse. Therefore, I believe a \ngovernment-wide approach is now necessary and that is why I am \nintroducing this bill today. We simply must act quickly.\n  Currently, our nation's farmers and ranchers are benefitting from \nprofitable good cattle prices, and our meat supply is safe. But, as a \nWestern Senator from a state with a significant cattle industry that \ntrades in the international market, I share the growing fears of \nconstituents about the potential devastating impact mad cow disease \nwould have if it spreads to and within the United States. The emerging \npotential for mad cow disease in the United States would also raise \ndevastating health implications for humans. We cannot, in good \nconscience, take a chance that would allow an outbreak to occur in the \nU.S. which would destroy America's cattle industry and devastate \nconsumers' confidence in our food supply.\n\n  In my home state of Colorado alone there are more than 3.15 million \nhead of cattle and more than 12,000 beef producers. Nationwide, \nColorado ranks 4th in cattle on feed and 10th in overall cattle \nnumbers. Nearly one-third of Colorado counties are classified as either \neconomically dependent on the cattle industry or a vital role in their \neconomies. It is critical that we in Congress do everything we can to \nprotect this industry in Colorado and across the country.\n  Over the past two months, there has been a series of news reports \nwhich highlight the spread of Mad Cow in Europe. Newsweek ran a cover \nstory, ABC aired a provocative story and countless other reports have \nshown the potential situation we could face. And, today, the crisis \nsurrounding foot-and-mouth disease is on the front page of our major \nnewspapers. With the focus shifting to the United States, consumers are \nbecoming wary and growing more concerned about the potential of the \nspread of the disease to our shores.\n  The Mad Cow Prevention Act of 2001 I introduce today is a necessary \nstep towards addressing the potential disaster of this disease in our \ncountry. I urge my colleagues to support its speedy passage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that recent news clips, and the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 534\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Others are being incinerated but the \n     ashes themselves are contaminated.\n       Michael Hansen, of the consumer advocacy group the \n     Consumers Union, says the infectious strain is ``virtually \n     indestructible . . . it defies all of our thinking about what \n     living things are and how they should act.''\n       No cases of mad cow disease have been found yet in the \n     United States, but some say America is not in the clear.\n\n\n                    possible threat in united states\n\n       Professor Richard Lacey is one of the leading experts on \n     mad cow disease and was one of the first to sound the alarm \n     in Britain. He says America needs to be very much on the \n     alert. ``It is just possible that there is no mad cow disease \n     in the U.S.A., but I believe it's more likely there is, but \n     not detected yet,'' he says.\n       Lacey, a microbiologist at Leeds University in England, was \n     perhaps the most outspoken scientist to warn British \n     authorities that human could contract bovine spongiform \n     encephalopathy by eating infected beef. The warning was \n     largely ignored and dismissed as scientifically impossible \n     until five years ago when people began to die.\n       Victims of the degenerative brain disease lose their motor \n     skills and slowly waste away. There is no vaccine and no \n     treatment, which is why Lacey is concerned that the United \n     States isn't doing all it could to protect itself.\n       The U.S. banned British beef and cattle products in 1989 \n     and the American beef industry has taken additional \n     precautions. The head of the National Cattleman's Beef \n     Association, Chuck Shroeder, says that along\n\n[[Page S2317]]\n\n     with federal regulators, his group has actually gone through \n     mock drills to prepare for the discovery of mad cow disease. \n     Containment procedures have been planned and a full-scale \n     public relations campaign is ready to go. ``We're not just \n     whistling on our way past the graveyard on this,'' he \n     says.\n       Shroeder is confident that necessary measures have been \n     taken and protections in place. ``If the disease were ever \n     discovered here, we could number one, identify it, number two \n     contain it, and number three, eliminate it as quickly as \n     possible.'' The government reports that its inspectors have \n     yet to find a single cow with mad cow disease in the U.S.\n\n\n                        Feeding Cattle to Cattle\n\n       How was mad cow disease able to spread from cow to cow in \n     England and elsewhere in Europe?\n       A key reason, Lacey says, was the practice of including \n     group-up remnants of cattle in cattle feed. This practice was \n     widespread in Europe and, to a lesser extent, the United \n     States.\n       Lacey refers to this as a kind of forced animal \n     cannibalism.\n       When mad cow disease broke out, the practice of feeding \n     cattle back to cattle was stopped in England, but it \n     continued in the United States until four years ago. And \n     Hansen says other potentially dangerous feeding practices now \n     banned in the U.K. continue in the United States today.\n       It remains legal in the United States, for example, to \n     ``grind up cattle, feed them to pigs, and then grind up the \n     pigs and feed them to the cows,'' says Hansen. Lacey calls \n     this a ``real danger,'' that ``must be stopped immediately.''\n       But government and industry officials say there's no reason \n     to follow Europe in banning the practice, because there's no \n     evidence to date that the disease can spread between pigs and \n     cattle.\n       Lacey says nevertheless the United States should adopt the \n     same ban as a precaution: ``My advice to the U.S. authorities \n     is to simply ban the incorporation of animal remains in \n     animal feed.''\n       But Shroeder defends U.S. practices. ``We have been driven \n     here by the best science that we can access, we have \n     protected the U.S. beef supply very, very carefully,'' he \n     says.\n\n\n              Chronic Wasting Disease: A Different Strain?\n\n       There's another concern no so easily answered. There is \n     growing concern about a possible American version of mad cow \n     disease showing up in deer and elk in the West. It is called \n     chronic wasting disease and some suspect it has already \n     claimed human lives.\n       Hansen says this chronic wasting disease is dangerously \n     similar to mad cow disease. ``It's a different strain of the \n     disease and it appears to be spreading in the wild,'' he \n     says.\n       Tracie McEwen believes her 30-year-old husband Doug, who \n     ate elk all his life, may have been a victim. He died of a \n     rare brain disorder normally only seen in people older than \n     55, with symptoms remarkably similar to those who died the \n     slow, agonizing death of mad cow disease in England.\n       The death of Tracie McEwen's husband and that of two others \n     under the age of 30 have raised questions for health \n     officials concerned about the similarity to mad cow disease.\n       Lacey thinks the ``link between eating deer and getting a \n     type of mad cow disease is very plausible,'' and it's one \n     more reason that American authorities shouldn't think they \n     have all the answers about the disease. He says, ``you have \n     to act on the assumption that the disease may well be there, \n     because if you wait until you know it's there, then it's too \n     late.''\n       Meanwhile, some members of Congress have asked for an \n     investigation into whether the government should be taking \n     additional steps to protect against the spread of mad cow \n     disease should it arrive in this country.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From Newsweek, Mar. 12, 2001]\n\n            Cannibals to Cows: The Path of a Deadly Disease\n\n                          (By Geoffrey Cowley)\n\n       Health officials say they've got Mad Cow under control, but \n     millions of unaware people may be infected. Why it could \n     still turn into an epidemic.\n       Peter Stent was a seasoned dairyman, but he had never seen \n     anything like this. Just before Christmas, in 1984, one of \n     his cows at Pitsham Farm in South Downs, England, started \n     shedding weight, losing its balance and acting as skittish as \n     a cat.\n       When the vet came to investigate, the animal was acting \n     completely crazy--drooling, arching its back, waving its \n     head, threatening its peers. And by the time it died six \n     weeks later, Stent was seeing the same symptoms in other \n     cows. Nine were soon dead, and no one could explain why. The \n     vet dubbed the strange malady Pitsham Farm syndrome, since it \n     didn't seem to exist anywhere else. Little did he know.\n       Alison Williams was 20 years old at the time, and living in \n     the coastal village of Caernarfon, in north Wales. She was \n     bright and outgoing, a business student who loved to sail and \n     swim in the nearby mountain lakes. but her personality \n     changed suddenly when she was 22. She lost interest in other \n     people, her father recalls, and quit school to live at home \n     with her parents and her brother. She still enjoyed the \n     outdoors, but she took to sitting alone on her bed, staring \n     out the window for hours at a time. By 1992, Alison was \n     having what her doctors diagnosed as nervous breakdowns, and \n     by 1995 she had grown paranoid and incontinent. ``A month \n     before she died, she went blind and lost use of her tongue,'' \n     her dad recalls. ``She spent her last five days in a coma.''\n\n\n                           something bigger?\n\n       Anyone with a television has heard such stories, maybe even \n     sussed out the connection between them. Mad-cow disease, or \n     bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), has killed nearly \n     200,000 British and European cattle since it cropped up on \n     Pitsham Farm. The human variant that Alison Williams \n     contracted has claimed 94 lives as well. What few of us \n     realize is that these tolls could mark the beginning of \n     something vastly bigger. No one knows just how BSE first \n     emerged. But once a few cattle contracted it, 20th-century \n     farming practices guaranteed that millions more would follow. \n     For 11 years following the Pitsham Farm episode, British \n     exporters shipped the remains of BSE-infected cows all over \n     the world, as cattle feed. The potentially tainted gruel \n     reached more than 80 countries. And millions of people--not \n     only in Europe but throughout Russia and Southeast Asia--have \n     eaten cattle that were raised on it.\n       It's possible, of course, that the worst is already behind \n     us. After dithering for a decade, governments in the United \n     Kingdom and Europe have lately taken bold steps to control \n     BSE. The number of bovine cases is now falling in Britain--\n     and the United States has yet to even report one. American \n     officials banned British cattle feed in 1988, as soon as \n     scientists implicated it in BSE, and later barred the \n     recycling of domestic cows as well. The U.S. government, the \n     cattle industry and many experts now voice confidence in the \n     nation's fire wall and say the risk to consumers is slight. \n     In truth, however, America's safeguards and surveillance \n     efforts are far weaker than most people realize. And in many \n     of the developing countries that now face the greatest risk, \n     such efforts are nonexistent. How many of the world's cattle \n     are now silently incubating BSE? How many people are \n     contracting it? The truth is, we don't know. ``We have no \n     idea how many deaths we're going to seek in the coming \n     years,'' says Dr. Frederic Saldmann, a French physician who \n     has recently seen both cows and people stricken in his \n     country. ``We've been checkmated.''\n       Mad cow is the creepiest in a family of disorders that can \n     make Ebola look like chickenpox. Scientists are only \n     beginning to understand these afflictions. Known as \n     transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, or TSEs, they \n     arise spontaneously in species as varied as sheep, cattle, \n     mink, deer and people. And once they take hold they can \n     spread. Some TSEs stick to a single species, while others \n     ignore such boundaries. But each of them is fatal and \n     untreatable, and they all ravage the brain--usually after \n     long latency periods--causing symptoms that can range from \n     dementia to psychosis and paralysis. If the prevailing theory \n     is right, they're caused not by germs but by ``prions''--\n     normal protein molecules that become infectious when folded \n     into abnormal shapes. Prions are invisible to the immune \n     system, yet tough enough to survive harsh solvents and \n     extreme temperatures. You can freeze them, boil them, soak \n     them in formaldehyde or carbolic acid or chloroform, and most \n     will emerge no less deadly than they were.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 14, 2001]\n\n  U.S. Adds To Ban on European Meats--Foot-and-Mouth Epidemic Is Cited\n\n                            (By David Brown)\n\n       The Agriculture Department yesterday banned importation of \n     most pork and goat products from the 15 European Union \n     countries to protect American livestock from an epidemic of \n     foot-and-mouth disease causing panic overseas.\n       Canada instituted a similar ban yesterday in an effort to \n     keep the highly contagious animal disease out of North \n     America. Foot-and-mouth does not spread to human beings, but \n     can kill or severely sicken animals. The disease was last \n     seen in the United States in 1929, and in Canada in 1952.\n       An epidemic of the disease broke out in England last month \n     and French officials confirmed yesterday that it had found \n     foot-and-mouth in a herd of cattle in the nation's northwest \n     region. It was the first detection of the viral infection in \n     the country since 1981 and the first case on the continent \n     since the British outbreak began.\n       While the economic impact of the U.S. ban is relatively \n     small, the move illustrates the level of concern about this \n     pathogen in particular, and the ease of spread of infectious \n     diseases across national boundaries in general.\n       The ban will cover about $294 million worth of meat \n     products and about $1 million in live animals. The vast \n     majority of the meat is pork from Denmark and other \n     Scandinavian countries.\n       Certain dairy products, such as hard cheeses and yogurt, \n     will not be covered by the ban. Canned hams also will not be \n     affected by the ban. Importation of horses will be permitted.\n       ``This temporary ban is in place for USDA to take time to \n     assess our exclusion efforts as a precaution to ensure that \n     we do not get'' foot-and-mouth disease in the United States, \n     said department spokeswoman Meghan Thomas.\n       A spokeswoman for the European Commission expressed \n     surprise at yesterday's announcement, saying the organization \n     learned\n\n[[Page S2318]]\n\n     of it from reporters. ``We've had no formal prior \n     notification,'' said Maeve O'Beirne. ``We don't know what the \n     definitive list [of banned products] O'Beirne. ``We don't \n     know what the definitive list [of banned products] will \n     be. This is, hopefully, a temporary measure.''\n       The value of the products is small compared to total meat \n     imports to the United States, although not trivial. Total \n     pork imports from all countries last year totaled slightly \n     more than $1 billion in value. Beef and veal imports from all \n     sources in 1999 were worth $2.1 billion.\n       This latest move almost eliminates non-fish meat imports \n     from Europe. Beef imports from Britain were banned in 1989 as \n     protection against bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also \n     known as ``mad cow disease.'' Beef and sheep products have \n     also been banned from other European countries.\n       Nicholas D. Giordano, international trade specialist with \n     the National Pork Producers Council, said the pork imported \n     from Europe consists mostly of ribs produced in Denmark. The \n     United States is a net exporter of pork, and European imports \n     equal about 1 percent of U.S. pork production, he said.\n       Non-meat products covered by the new ban consist mostly of \n     purebred pigs and pig seman, an Agriculture Department \n     official said.\n       The ban was also praised by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), a \n     member of the Senate Agriculture Committee from a large pork-\n     producing state.\n       ``If [the disease] were to return to America, the results \n     would be absolutely devastating,'' he said in a statement. \n     ``USDA is taking the right step in temporarily banning \n     imports . . . Right now we just don't know how far this \n     disease has spread. It is common sense to take protective \n     measures.''\n       Although horses can still be brought from Europe to the \n     United States, they must be cleaned and disinfected, along \n     with any equipment that accompanies them, said Thomas, the \n     USDA spokeswoman. Straw and manure are burned.\n       Agriculture officials have alerted airports and ports of \n     entry to more closely inspect travelers from Europe for \n     products that might possibly carry the foot-and-mouth virus. \n     Food-sniffing dogs are being used in some places. The virus \n     can persist in feed and environmental surfaces for weeks, and \n     people reporting visits to farms or contact with livestock \n     must have any footwear disinfected.\n       French Agriculture Minister Jean Glavany yesterday \n     announced that the disease had been found among cattle on a \n     farm in Mayenne, between Paris and the Atlantic coast. The \n     disease was evidently carried by sheep imported from Britain \n     to a nearby farm, and then spread to the Mayenne cows.\n       In Britain, more than 120,000 carcasses have been burned \n     because of the disease, the Agriculture Ministry said, with \n     another 50,000 due for destruction. Separate cases have \n     broken out at more than 200 farms and sluaghterhouses.\n       France has burned some 20,000 sheep that were imported from \n     Britain before the outbreak was known, and another 30,000 \n     home-grown animals that might have been exposed. Most other \n     European countries have also burned animals imported from \n     Britain. Now, they will presumably burn any recent imports \n     from France as well--as some parts of Germany started doing \n     yesterday.\n       The basic approach is to kill and burn any animal that may \n     have been exposed to the disease. The animals are lined up, \n     shot, and then piled around gasoline-stacked timbers for \n     burning. Farms where even a single case was suspected now \n     have no animals left--and thus no source of income. \n     Governments are now gearing up large-scale compensation \n     programs.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 14, 2001]\n\n         Meat From Europe Is Banned by U.S. as Illness Spreads\n\n           (By Christopher Marquis and Donald G. McNeil Jr.)\n\n       Washington, March 13.--The United States banned imports of \n     animals and animal products from the European Union today \n     after learning that foot-and-mouth disease had spread to \n     France from Britain.\n       The Agriculture Department said it was taking the \n     precaution to protect the domestic industry from a possible \n     outbreak of the virus, which could cost the American industry \n     billions of dollars in just one year.\n       The virus poses little danger to people, even if they eat \n     the meat of infected animals. But it is virulently contagious \n     and is devastating for cattle, swine, sheep, deer and other \n     cloven-hoofed animals, which it generally debilitates and \n     often leaves unable to grow or produce milk.\n       The ban, which applies to exports from all 15 countries of \n     the European Union, prompted some European officials to \n     complain that the Bush administration was overreacting.\n       But three members of the European Union--Belgium, Portugal \n     and Spain--are closing their borders to French meat, as is \n     Switzerland. Norway banned imports of French farm products, \n     and Germany and Italy took protective measures. Canada also \n     banned meat imports from the European Union, as well as from \n     Argentina, which has found foot-and-mouth disease in the \n     northwest. Argentina said it would voluntarily restrict beef \n     exports.\n       Kimberley Smith, a spokeswoman for the Agriculture \n     Department, said many items including most cheeses and cured \n     or cooked meats, are not affected because they are heated in \n     a way that kills the virus.\n       The ban is expected to hit pork producers the most. \n     European beef is already banned by the United States because \n     of mad cow disease, which can cause fatal Creutzfeldt-Jakob \n     disease in humans.\n       The Agriculture Department is ``taking this time to assess \n     our exclusion activities as a precaution to ensure that we \n     don't get foot-and-mouth disease in the United States,'' Ms. \n     Smith said. She said the department could not say how long \n     the ban would last.\n       Department officials did not detail which European products \n     would be subject to the ban. But they said it would prohibit \n     the importation of live swine, pork and meat from sheep and \n     goats, regardless of whether it is fresh or frozen. Yogurt \n     and most cheeses would be permitted, they said, because those \n     sold in the United States are made from pasteurized milk.\n       Canned ham or any other food products that have been heated \n     above 175 degrees Fahrenheit are permitted because such \n     processing inactivates the virus, the officials said.\n       The production of such favored items as French brie and \n     Italian prosciutto is closely monitored to meet stringent \n     export standards, she said, so they are not affected by \n     today's ban. Brie entering the United States is made from \n     pasteurized milk and is considered safe.\n       A spokesman for the European Commission in Washington, \n     Gerry Kiely, said the ban would cost European exporters as \n     much as $458 million a year in sales. The agriculture \n     department put the cost at $400 million at most.\n       Earlier today French officials confirmed that foot-and-\n     mouth disease was found among cattle at a dairy farm in \n     Laval, in northwestern France. Officials said farmers in the \n     area had imported sheep from Britain, which is at the center \n     of the current outbreak and has already slaughtered about \n     170,000 animals to contain the disease.\n       The disease, which is so infectious that it can be spread \n     by footwear and cars, appeared in France despite tight \n     precautions. The infected dairy farm, near La Baroche-\n     Gondouin in the Mayenne district, was inside an isolation \n     zone.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Daschle, Mr. \n        Baucus, Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Domenici, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Kennedy, \n        Mr. Johnson, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 535. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nclarify that Indian women with breast or cervical cancer who are \neligible for health services provided under a medical care program of \nthe Indian Health Service or of a tribal organization are included in \nthe optional medicaid eligibility category of breast or cervical cancer \npatients added by the Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and \nTreatment Act of 2000; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nwith 11 original cosponsors, including Senators McCain and Daschle, \nentitled the ``Native American Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment \nTechnical Amendment Act of 2001.'' The legislation makes a simple, yet \nimportant, technical change to the ``Breast and Cervical Cancer \nTreatment and Prevention Act'' by correcting a provision of last year's \nbill to ensure the coverage of breast and cervical cancer treatment for \nNative American women.\n  The National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program, \nfunded through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, \nsupports screening activities in all 50 states and through 15 American \nIndian/Alaska Native organizations. However, the CDC program provides \nfunding only for screening services and not for treatment.\n  Last year's bill, which passed the Senate by unanimous consent and \nhad 76 cosponsors, gives states the option to extend Medicaid treatment \ncoverage to certain women who have been screened by programs operated \nunder the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program \nand diagnosed as having breast or cervical cancer. Through passage of \nthe ``Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment and Prevention Act,'' for \nthose women not otherwise eligible for Medicaid, States may elect to \nexpand their Medicaid programs to provide breast and cervical cancer \ntreatment as an optional benefit and receive an enhanced federal match \nto encourage participation.\n  Last year's legislation restricts Medicaid treatment coverage to \nthose who have no ``creditable coverage'' or treatment options. \nUnfortunately, the term ``creditable coverage'' is defined under\n\n[[Page S2319]]\n\nthe Act to include the Indian Health Service, IHS. In short, the \nreference to IHS in the law effectively excludes Indian women from \nreceiving Medicaid breast and cervical cancer treatment, as provided \nfor under last year's bill, regardless of whether a State chooses to \nprovide that coverage. Not only does the definition deny coverage to \nNative American women, but the provision runs counter to the general \nMedicaid rule treating IHS facilities as full Medicaid providers. My \nlegislation corrects these issues.\n  During 2001, almost 50,000 women are expected to die from breast or \ncervical cancer in the United States despite the fact that early \ndetection and treatment of these diseases could substantially decrease \nthis mortality. While passage of last year's bill makes significant \nstrides to address this problem, it fails to do so for Native American \nwomen and that must be changed as soon as possible.\n  In support of Native American women across this country that are \nbeing diagnosed through CDC screening activities as having breast or \ncervical cancer, my legislation would assure that they can also access \nmuch needed treatment through the Medicaid program. I urge its \nimmediate adoption.\n  I request unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 535\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to provide for a \nlimitation on sharing of marketing and behavioral profiling \ninformation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Freedom \nfrom Behavioral Profiling Act of 2001.'' This legislation would require \nfinancial institutions to provide proper notice and obtain permission \nfrom a consumer before they could buy, sell or otherwise share an \nindividual's behavioral profile.\n  Everyone recognizes the importance of insuring the accuracy and \nsecurity of credit and debit card transactions. Without basic safety \nfeatures, consumers would avoid non-cash transactions and our economy \nwould greatly suffer as a result. However, financial institutions have \ntaken their data gathering efforts far beyond what is necessary to \nprotect consumers from fraud, inaccurate billing and theft. Companies \nare using transactional records generated by debit and credit card use \nand are developing detailed consumer profiles. From these files they \nknow the food you eat, the drugs you must take, the places you go, and \nthe books you read, as well as every other thing about you that can be \ngleaned from your buying habits.\n  Troubling as it is that financial institutions are assembling such \nprofiles, I find it even more worrisome that these companies are \nselling and trading these intimate details without consumer knowledge \nor consent. In as much, ``your'' sensitive personal information has \nbecome a commodity bought and sold like some latter day widget. I \nbelieve the American people have the right to be informed of these \nactivities and should have the option to decide for themselves whether \nor not their personal information is shared or sold.\n  I find it quite ironic that the very institutions that work so hard \nto secure sensitive corporate information are the same companies that \nwork so hard to exploit the personal information of consumers. \nUnfortunately, it would seem that corporate America has decided that \nthe ``Golden Rule'' is not applicable in the Information Age.\n  The American people are only now becoming aware of the behavioral \nprofiling practices of the industry. The more they find out, the more \nthey do not like it. That is why I am offering this legislation, to \ngive the consumer the ability to control his or her most personal \nbehavioral profile. Where they go, who they see, what they buy and when \nthey do it, all of these are personal decisions that the majority of \nAmericans do not want monitored and recorded under the watchful eye of \ncorporate America.\n  Colleagues in the Senate, I hope you will join me in an effort to \ngive the people what they want, the ability to control the \nindiscriminate sharing of their own personal, and private, consumption \nhabits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/03/14/senate-section/article/S2319-1", "month": "03", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2319-S2320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 60--URGING THE IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF KOSOVAR ALBANIANS \n        WRONGFULLY IMPRISONED IN SERBIA, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S.
