Mr. President, the people of this country always come \nthrough when there are tough problems, as long as they know everyone is \npitching in and doing their fair share.\n  That is the problem with much of what is coming out of Washington, \nDC, today, when it comes to this country's energy policy. Oregonians \nare telling me, for example, at townhall meetings that what alarms them \nabout the energy debate in Washington, DC, is that it seems everybody \nis supposed to tighten their belt except for the powerful. I don't \nbelieve that passes the fairness test for most Americans. Even business \nleaders at home tell me the country just is not going to rally behind \nan energy plan that is not balanced, an energy plan that does not say: \nEverybody has to do their fair share.\n  There is not a whole lot of balance in a plan that would open up the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling now, although it will not \nproduce any gas for at least 8 to 10 years, when our consumers are \ngetting clobbered at the gas pump today.\n  Where is the balance in a plan that cuts funding for renewable \nenergy--solar, wind, and geothermal--while building as many as 1,900 \nnew powerplants? Where is the balance in a plan that would provide \nlarge new tax breaks for the energy industry and tells consumers the \nanswer is to spend their tax relief on misguided energy policies? With \nall due respect, the idea that Americans should have to use their much \nneeded tax relief to prop up ill-conceived energy policies is the \nultimate in throwing good money after bad.\n  I want to take a few minutes to talk about where I think Congress \nought to go with respect to the energy issue and what could constitute \nsome of the core principles of an effective bipartisan energy policy.\n\n[[Page S4852]]\n\n  First, it is time to provide significant and real financial rewards \nfor conservation. Everybody talks about conservation. We all know it \nmakes sense to conserve energy. But there are very few actual financial \nrewards for conserving. I think it is time to put real dollars behind \nthose who are willing to make the tough decisions with respect to \nconservation. For example, if it is a hardship to move your energy use \nfrom peak hours to times when demand is lower, let's reward that \nfinancially. Let's reward real-time pricing so as to take steps that \nare meaningful to decrease electric power shortages that are now \ncausing price spikes and blackouts.\n\n  Second, I think it is time to lift the veil of secrecy around energy \nmarkets in this country. It is clear that energy is being commoditized, \nbut it is not possible to get real information about supply and demand \nand transmission, which is what is needed when energy is being bought \nand sold in markets all across this country.\n  In electricity markets today, power is, in fact, being traded as a \ncommodity, but basic information about how electric power systems and \nmarkets work is just unavailable in much of the United States. If \nelectricity is going to be traded as a commodity, let the Congress take \nsteps to ensure access to information so those markets can function \nefficiently.\n  I intend to introduce legislation shortly to ensure that Americans in \nevery part of this country can get access to information about \ntransmission capability, outages, and the information that is needed to \nbe in a position to make energy markets work in a fair way.\n  Third, to encourage responsible power production, reward developers \nwho demonstrate a commitment to good environmental policy. I do not \nthink energy production and meeting this country's environmental needs \nought to be mutually exclusive. There are ways to do both. I think \nthere ought to be an effort by Congress to reward energy developers who \nmeet tough environmental standards by moving them to the head of the \nline, the head of the queue for permits. This country needs new \npowerplants. I think there is bipartisan support for that effort. But \nwe ought to say to power producers and power generators, when you are \ngoing to be an environmental leader, we are going to move you to the \nhead of the regulatory queue.\n  Fourth, we need to bring free enterprise back into the energy \nmarkets. In my home State of Oregon, four companies essentially control \n70 percent of the gas that is sold at the pump. I believe if there were \nreal competition at the gas pump, prices would come down. Competition \nworks in Oregon and across this country. But a variety of anti-\ncompetitive practices are squeezing competition out of the oil \nindustry. I do not think it is an accident that people of my State have \nlost more than 600 gasoline stations in just a few years. It is true in \nmuch of the country that three or four companies control delivery of \ngas at the pump. Unfortunately, the Federal Government seems to have \ntaken the position with respect to competition that, unless you have a \nhandful of big energy producers huddled up, say, at a steak house in a \ndowntown hotel dividing up energy markets, there is really nothing \nwrong.\n  In fact, we learned last week that even though west coast gasoline \nmarkets are being redlined--there is significant evidence that those \nwest coast gasoline markets are being redlined--the Federal Government \nis not prepared, under the laws as written today, to take significant \naction to deal with it.\n\n  Just because something is not illegal doesn't mean it is not anti-\nconsumer and that it does not have anti-competitive ramifications. So I \nthink it is extremely important we look now to steps that actually \nproduce competition in the gasoline markets rather than to conclude \nthat just because you do not have energy producers huddled up at a \nsteak house dividing markets everything is all right.\n  Finally, it seems to me that good science ought to be the basis of a \nbipartisan effort to address our energy predicament in this country. \nThe Vice President recently stated the United States has to build 1,300 \npowerplants to meet projected increases in demand for energy over the \nnext 20 years. However, scientists at the Energy Department's National \nLaboratories recently said that new technologies could reduce projected \ngrowth in energy demand by 20 percent to 47 percent, which could \ntranslate into as many as 600 fewer powerplants.\n  Certainly on a bipartisan basis this Senate can agree that we cannot \nignore the science. More efficient transmission lines, moving away from \nthe old model of a central powerplant and towards cleaner energy with \ncombustion-free fuel cell technology, is just one of the options \navailable. When it comes to the oil and gas sector, that fuel cell \ntechnology could be making cars run cleaner and more efficiently within \na few years. Instead of subsidizing just the old fossil fuel industries \nwith an energy proposal that says, go do your thing, our energy policy \ncould be jump-starting a variety of renewable energy technologies with \nreal promise for the future.\n  What I have discussed today--first, financial rewards for \nconservation; second, lifting the veil of secrecy around energy \nmarkets; third, creating incentives for energy developers to comply \nwith tough environmental laws; fourth, bringing some free enterprise \nback into energy markets; and, fifth, looking at the science that comes \nout of the Energy Department itself--are five initiatives that the \nSenate could use on a bipartisan basis to build a sensible energy \npolicy.\n  I was struck at the end of last week when the President of the United \nStates said that Americans should use their tax relief as the primary \nway to deal with the energy crisis in this country. I don't think \nAmericans ought to have to use their much needed tax relief to prop up \nmisguided energy policies. I think that is just throwing good money \nafter bad. I think it is important--and the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer, the Senator from Kansas, and I have home roots in a place that \nknows something about energy production--to create incentives for \nenergy production in this country. I think it is possible to do it \nwhile rewarding those who are going to meet tough environmental \nstandards.\n  So I am hopeful that this week, as Congress focuses on energy \npolicies and the President unveils his proposal, that we recognize this \ncountry is ready for bold and bipartisan leadership on the energy \nissue. This Congress can provide it. We can insist on policies that \nmake sense for the environment and for consumers and for the energy \nindustry, but it has to be a policy that says everybody does their fair \nshare. It has to be a policy that says everybody has to be part of the \nsolution and we are not just going to say to the country: You tighten \nyour belts while the power folk get a free ride.\n  I believe it is possible to bring together responsible leaders in \nindustry, the environmental sector, and the consumer movement to create \nan energy policy that will get us beyond the very difficult months \nahead and build a sound foundation for the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last week we had the opportunity to \nintroduce a bill called the ``Rural Mental Health Accessibility Act of \n2001.''\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Conrad, Domenici, Johnson, \nRoberts, and Nelson from Nebraska to bring forward the opportunity for \nus to strengthen medical provisions for mental health in rural States \nin particular.\n  As you might imagine, rural States have many unique problems. We have \nsmall towns and small cities where not all medical specialties are \npresent. We\n\n[[Page S4853]]\n\nhave to build sort of a network of health care for small towns. One of \nthe things that has been most difficult to provide in those rural areas \nis mental health in small towns where kids need some counseling, and \nwhere there are real problems with no one there who is a specialist in \nmental health.\n  This Rural Mental Health Accessibility Act reflects on those unique \nneeds and provides States and local communities flexibility.\n  The Federal programs that assist in health care needs in Wyoming are \ndifferent than they are in Pennsylvania, or in Rhode Island. We need to \nhave flexibility in all cases, particularly in the case of mental \nhealth which is more of a speciality.\n  This act provides for creative and collaborative provider education \nto help provide education for the mental health provider so they can \ncome to those rural areas and give some assistance in education.\n  It increases access to mental services to vulnerable children and \nseniors in unserved rural areas throughout these States.\n  Certainly the circumstances are unique. With the stigma associated \nwith mental illness, people do not seek the services. They are not \nhandled there, and it cannot be done easily.\n\n  Seventy-five percent of the 518 nationally designated mental health \nprofessional shortage areas are located in rural areas, which, I guess, \nis not hard to understand.\n  One-fifth of all rural communities have no mental health services of \nany kind.\n  Frontier communities have even more drastic numbers. Ninety-five \npercent have no psychiatrists. Sixty-eight percent have no \npsychologists. Seventy-eight percent have no social workers.\n  You can see that it is really necessary to have a network where \npeople can move around to provide the services that the communities do \nnot have.\n  Suicide rates among rural children and adolescents are higher in \nurban areas. That is a very surprising statistic. We don't think of it \nthat way. In fact, it is true.\n  Twenty percent of the Nation's elderly population lives in rural \nareas. Only 9 percent of our Nation's physicians practice in rural \nareas.\n  Often the primary care physicians are the only ones who are the \nsource of treatment in these particular areas.\n  Primary care physicians do not necessarily have the specialized \ntraining in terms of mental health.\n  To address these issues, this bill does the following: Create the \nMental Health Community Education Grant Program; States and communities \nto conduct targeted public education campaigns focused on mental \nillness, focused on suicide, and focused on substance abuse. These are \nthings that all communities to some extent are trying to keep out of \nthe public eye, kind of acting as if it really isn't true. But, indeed, \nwe know that it is, and especially in rural communities.\n  I must tell you, frankly, that I am surprised at the suicide rate in \na rural State such as Wyoming, which is higher than most places. It \nreally points out the need for the kind of health services that we are \nhoping to provide.\n  It creates an Interdisciplinary Grant Program; permits universities \nand other entities to establish interdisciplinary training programs so \nthey can provide, hopefully, training for these kinds of health \nproviders.\n  Mental health and primary care providers are taught side by side in \nthe classroom, so that with clinical training in rural areas we can \nhelp provide for all of these kinds of needs that exist. We encourage \nmore collaboration, certainly, amongst providers, so we can have this \nnetwork we talk about.\n  It actually authorizes $30 million for 20 mental telehealth \ndemonstration projects. And it is equally divided. I think as we get \nmore and more into high-tech telemedicine, it will be even more \nimportant. Of course, to do that you have to have equipment, you have \nto have people on both ends who have some training to provide these \nkinds of services.\n  It provides mental health services to children and elderly residents \nat long-term care facilities located in mental health shortage areas.\n  Projects also provide mental illness education and targeted \ninstruction on coping and dealing with the stressful experiences of \nchildhood, adolescence and aging. One might even think it is \nappropriate where we have some of the kinds of problems we have in \npublic schools. There is often the necessity to have help in these \nstressful experiences.\n  It requires a study. The Director of the National Institute of Mental \nHealth of the Office of Rural Health Policy will report to Congress on \nthe efficacy and effectiveness of mental telemedicine.\n  So I think it is something that is very much needed, something we can \nhelp provide in communities where it does not now exist. Frankly, \nwithout some special assistance, it probably will not exist in the \nforeseeable future.\n  There are a number of supporting organizations. The Rural Mental \nHealth Accessibility Act is strongly supported by the National Rural \nHealth Association, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the \nAmerican Psychiatric Association, and the American Psychological \nAssociation.\n  So I believe it is critically important that we consider this \nlegislation as we talk about health care. Again, I cannot overemphasize \nthe need for flexibility and taking a look at all the areas to be \nserved. It is one thing to serve in a downtown metropolitan center--and \nthey have their difficulties, of course--but it is also difficult to \nserve in Medicine Bow, WY, where you have to reach out from somewhere \nelse to bring in people to provide these kinds of services.\n  So, first of all, I thank the Presiding Officer for being a sponsor, \nbut also I thank him for the time and the support he has given to \nhelping those in need of health care and mental health care.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I believe we are in an hour of time \nallocated to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 2 \np.m. is under the control of the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Thomas, or \nhis designee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/14/senate-section/article/S4853-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4853-S4855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 TAXES\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I rise to talk, again, about taxes.\n  The legislation now before the Senate includes education, which we \nwill be debating this afternoon and which we will be working on until \nthe tax bill comes from the committee, and taxes--probably two of the \nmost important issues the Senate will address this year. Certainly \neveryone is most interested in education, and there are a number of \nbroad topics within education that are legitimate to discuss. One of \nthem is the role of the Federal Government in financing education.\n  Most would agree that the basic responsibility for elementary and \nsecondary education lies with local government and State government. \nTraditionally, the Federal Government has provided about 7 percent of \nthe total financing for education. It is an important contribution but \ncertainly a relatively small one in terms of the total cost.\n  One of the other issues will be that of deciding how much flexibility \nthere will be in terms of expending Federal moneys made available, \nwhether or not, as was the case in the last administration, where the \ndollars which were allocated to education were generally assigned to \nthe purpose for which they were allocated, either for smaller \nclassrooms or for building improvements, new buildings, in reality, the \nreal decision as to how moneys are used by local districts ought to be \nwhat the way local leaders believe they should be.\n  The needs are quite different in one place or another. I come from a \nState of small communities. The needs there are quite different often \nthan they would in be in downtown Pittsburgh, PA. We need flexibility.\n  There will also be and there have been, in fact, great discussions \nabout the amount of money that ought to be\n\n[[Page S4854]]\n\nspent and, more importantly, how we are able to have accountability in \nterms of the dollars that are spent to see, in fact, if those dollars \nthat are being spent are creating a better education opportunity for \nchildren. We will be back on that later. We should be.\n\n  Of course, with any program we discuss comes the question of taxes. \nWe find ourselves in an interesting position, a somewhat enviable \nposition of having a projected surplus over time, a substantial surplus \nover the next 10 years, a surplus each year during that time. There is \nsome question if that can be counted on. Whenever you project into the \nfuture, there is always an element of uncertainty. Nevertheless, we \nhave to make decisions in the future. Whether one is in business, \nwhether it is a family, whatever, we have to make decisions for the \nfuture. Sometimes they are not exactly the same, but I feel confident, \nas do the people who make the projections, that this is a fairly modest \nprojection in terms of the surplus over time.\n  There are broad issues involved, and great detail in taxes, \nobviously, but there are also some concepts that ought to be debated: \nWhat kind of taxing limits should be placed on people; should we have \ntaxes that offset what we believe are the fundamental costs, the \nnecessary activities of the Federal Government? To be sure, not \neveryone would agree on what those necessary activities are. \nNevertheless, if you have a surplus in Washington, beyond the needs the \nCongress has adjudicated to these items, you can bet your life it will \nbe spent. Then you ask: What should be the concept? Where do we want to \nbe down the road? Do we want more and more Federal Government? Do we \nwant to spend on all the programs? Do we want to be somewhat \nconservative and try to make a decision as to which programs are best \ndone at the Federal level and which decisions are best left to local \ngovernments and people and taxpayers themselves?\n  These are some of the philosophical issues that lie behind the \ndebate. We argue all the time as to whether or not it will be $20 \nmillion or $50 million or $1 billion for this. Before that, we ought to \nestablish in our own minds what the role of taxation is at the Federal \nlevel. Are we there to support the needed programs? If not, there is no \nend to the amount of money that can be spent.\n  Then there is the question of simplification, particularly around \nApril 15. How can we make tax laws more simplified; how can we make it \neasier; how can we get away from all of the pages of activities \ntaxpayers have to go through? But at the same time we talk about that, \nwe will have 20 or 30 different ideas on this floor during the next \ncouple of weeks as to how we ought to have a tax break for this or a \ntax incentive for that, to the point where we almost become more \ninvolved in using taxes as a method of impacting behavior and directing \nbehavior than we do to using it as an income source to pay for basic \nservices.\n  Again, there is a difference of view about that. We will see a great \ndeal of that.\n  The other area, of course, is, as we look into tax reductions and \nsurpluses, we have to ask: What are the things we really need to be \ncareful about? One, obviously, is to have the money to fund those \nprograms that are decided to be essential programs: defense, education, \nand all of those.\n  Recall that almost two-thirds of the budget is nondiscretionary. \nAlmost two-thirds of the budget is already predetermined. It is Social \nSecurity, health care; it is Medicare. It is those things for which \nthere are not alternatives to be decided each year. Out of a $1.9 \ntrillion budget, we make determinations for about $661 billion. So \nthere are some basic things we talk about.\n\n  The President has put forth a plan. He has, obviously, indicated the \ntwo areas of his highest priority: education and tax reductions, with \nthe general concept that taxpayers ought not to send more of their \nmoney to Washington than is necessary to carry out the functions of the \nGovernment.\n  His plan is to give a tax cut to every family that pays income taxes. \nHe replaces the current tax brackets by reducing them to lower rates: \n39 to 33, 15 to 10, and so on, so everyone who pays taxes would have a \ntax reduction. He doubles the child credit to a $1,000 and reduces the \nmarriage penalty. That is really a fairness issue.\n  The idea that a man and a woman who are single have two jobs, earn X \namount of dollars, pay X amount of taxes, they are married, they \ncontinue to make the same amount of money, but they pay more taxes, is \na fairness issue and one that needs to be dealt with.\n  Under his plan, one in five taxpaying families with children would no \nlonger pay any income tax at all, completely removing 6 million \nAmericans from the tax rolls. Remember that there is a large percentage \nof Americans who don't pay Federal income tax. Families of four making \n$35,000 would have a 100-percent tax reduction in what they pay, and on \nup. So, of course, the more taxes that are paid, logically the \nreduction would accommodate more reduction in dollars. That is the \ncase.\n  We need tax reductions, obviously, because our taxes are the highest \nwe have paid as a percentage of gross national product since even in \nWorld War II--higher than that now. Obviously, we have asked taxpayers \nto send more of their money into Washington than is necessary to \nprovide the essential functions. And therefore, a tax reduction is \nlegitimate--not  only legitimate now, of course, but also even more \nneeded because of the economy turndown, the economy stabilization, \nwhichever it is, the lack of growth that we have had, and certainly \nhaving less taxes paid and more money available to be used by the \ntaxpayers themselves--their money. It will help that economic turndown.\n\n  It also deals with debt reduction. We have a very large debt, of \ncourse--about $2.5 trillion in publicly held debt as opposed to Social \nSecurity. It is debt that has been placed because of you, me, and all \nof us who are now adults. If we don't do something, it will have to be \npaid for by young people who are beginning to have their first pay \nchecks; 12\\1/2\\ percent of their earnings will be withheld to pay for a \ndebt we helped to create.\n  Over this 10-year period, about $1.5 trillion of that would be \nreduced, leaving about $800 million. That is a tremendously large \nnumber. But, as a matter of fact, that is about all that is eligible to \nbe removed over that time because it is held and secured. So we would \nhave debt reduction in this plan. The debt reduction now held in \nprivate hands is $2.4 trillion, reduced to $800 billion. That is a \npretty good reduction. We would have relief for every taxpayer--$1.35 \ntrillion over 11 years would be reduced in terms of taxpayers having to \nsend their money to the Federal Government.\n  In addition to that, there would be an immediate surplus this year of \nabout $100 billion--for the next 2 years--that could be used to get it \nback to taxpayers more quickly so it could be put back into the private \nsector and help strengthen the economy. At the same time, we have \ncommitments to protect seniors for today and tomorrow--the $2.5 \ntrillion of Social Security. That portion of Social Security that comes \nin during this time would be set aside for Social Security so that we \nwould be able to meet our obligations there. And, of course, there are \nsome discussions going on about some changes in Social Security, to \nincrease the amount of moneys that would be there. The budget includes \n$300 billion for a reserve fund for reforming Medicare, which needs to \nbe done, of course, and to have an opportunity to make Medicare more \nuseful, make Medicare more easily useful and accessible. One of the \nissues would be to create a prescription drug benefit. Hopefully, that \nwould be done, as well, at the same time some changes are made in \nMedicare so that it would fit together.\n  At the same time, there would be sufficient spending increases. \nDiscretionary spending in this year's budget would be 5 percent. \nSomebody on the news said today that was below inflation, which isn't \nthe case. Five percent is inflationary growth--in fact, beyond that. It \nwould boost the veterans fund over 10 years, veterans hospitals, for \nveterans retirement, for doing those kinds of things. It raises defense \nspending, which I think is needed. Certainly, if we are going to have a \nvoluntary military, the payments to those folks, the payrolls need to \nbe competitive somewhat to what you could do in the\n\n[[Page S4855]]\n\nprivate sector. This is needed so that people don't get trained in the \nmilitary for a specialized job and then leave for more pay in the \nprivate sector. So defense spending would be increased.\n  It provides for $80 billion over 10 years for assistance to farmers \nand ranchers. We are in the process, during the next year, of coming up \nwith a new farm bill before the one now in place runs out. There will \nbe something to replace that. Hopefully, an effort will continue to \nmove toward a marketplace in agriculture but also to provide some kind \nof a safety net so we don't go through the sort of trauma that we have \nover the last several years.\n\n  It also expands child tax credits and earned income tax credits--an \n$18 billion increase over that time. So there are a lot of great \ndetails that could be talked about, obviously, and will be talked \nabout, and indeed should be talked about.\n  The real question is, If you have a surplus, what should you do with \nit? You should certainly accommodate those things that are high \nnecessities and priorities in the budget, and then you ought to return \nthat money to the taxpayers, the people who paid it in. That is the way \nit ought to be. We ought to be able to understand that it is really the \nresponsibility of the Federal Government to provide these programs but \nnot to excessively spend the money that could very well be either spent \nby the taxpayer or, indeed, if there are special programs that need to \nbe done, we would make an opportunity for the States and local \ngovernments to make the taxation they need so the things could be done \nthere.\n  Mr. President, we are going to enter into a very lively debate. I \nsuppose taxes and budgets probably personify as well as any other thing \nthe differences in view about how people would approach governance. \nThat is perfectly legitimate. That is what this place is for, to talk \nabout differences in view. There are those who think that we ought to \nbe spending much more on the Federal Government; the Federal Government \nought to be funding every need that exists; and the Federal Government \nought to grow and have more expansion into people's lives.\n  I am one of the others who believe there ought to be a limitation on \nthe role of the Federal Government, that governance closer to the \npeople is the kind of governance that is best, and we ought to tax to \nthe extent necessary to pay for those functions. But when it is beyond \nthat, we ought to do something about leaving taxpayers' money in the \ntaxpayers' pockets.\n  Those are the decisions that are before us. Those are the decisions \nthat we will be dealing with, hopefully this week, certainly next week, \nand they are tough. I just hope that we have an opportunity. We have a \n50/50 Senate now, which is an unusual division of parties, and somewhat \nof an unusual division philosophically. Yet our challenge is to come \ntogether with something that is good for the country. Nobody would \nargue with that. But everybody has a different view of what is good.\n  I hear people say you need to do it ``the right way.'' I don't know \nof anybody who wants to do it the wrong way.\n  There are differing views and there should be. The President has laid \nout a program that is quite good. There are those who would like to \ndiscredit the President's program, of course, in order to create their \npolitical ideas. But that is not why we are here. We are here to \nresolve problems that exist. We are here to govern. That is our job. We \nneed to move forward. We have been a little slow. I think we have to \nreally come to grips with the fact that we are here to make decisions, \nto move forward, to do something with education, to do something with \ntaxes, and we are here to take on many of the other issues. That is our \ntask.\n  Mr. President, I think there will be others joining me in a few \nmoments. In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are in a period \nfor morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/14/senate-section/article/S4855-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4855-S4857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               TAX RELIEF\n\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, today I join with several of my colleagues \nto talk about an issue that has dominated the Senate and the Congress \nof the United States for many months. That dominance, I think, has been \nshared in most of the minds of our American citizens as we have worked \nto complete a budget for fiscal year 2002. Tax relief is an important \ncomponent of that budget and an important issue to the American people.\n  As a matter of fundamental fairness, the most heavily taxed \ngeneration in America's history, in my opinion, deserves tax relief. \nThere is plenty of room in this budget for tax relief. Listening to \nsome of the speeches in this Chamber last week, one would assume we \nwere dramatically cutting the budget of the American people in order to \ngive some of that money back. That is simply not true.\n  The budget resolution increases overall spending by about 5 percent. \nImportant national needs will be met. We are taking less than a third \nof the total surplus--surplus tax dollars--to provide tax relief. \nWithout question, there is room in this budget to provide tax relief to \nthat overtaxed American consumer taxpayer and to adequately fund a \nbudget for America's citizens.\n  According to the Tax Foundation, May 3 was tax freedom day this year. \nIn other words, the average working American had worked from January 1 \nthrough May 3 just to pay his or her taxes. Said another way, on May 3, \nthe American worker finally was beginning to put money in his or her \npocket and provide money for the breakfast table of his or her family.\n  The average American works the first 123 days--the first one-third of \nthe year--to support the appetite of Government, and still we heard in \nthis Chamber this past week the siren song saying that appetite was not \nbig enough, that somehow it needed to grow ever increasingly larger.\n\n  May 3 is the latest tax freedom day in the history of this country. \nTax Freedom Day occurred as early as April 18 in 1992, before the \nrecord tax hike enacted in 1993. But from 1992 to now, another half-\nmonth has been added to the amount of time the average worker is \nrequired to work just to meet his or her tax obligation.\n  May 3 is actually a national average because, because it brings in \nthe State and local tax burdens. In Idaho, for example, at least that \nburden is less than in other States, and Idaho's Tax Freedom Day fell \non April 25, making its citizens the tenth least taxed group of \ncitizens of any State in the Nation. There is no wonder Idaho is a \nfast-growing State. Somehow the word is out that if you live and work \nin Idaho, because of our attitudes about government and the way we \nmanage our government in Idaho, and thanks to my colleague, our \nGovernor, Dirk Kempthorne, who once served with us in the Senate, we \ntax citizens less, even though we provide adequate government for their \nneeds.\n  Americans have never been more heavily taxed than they are now. The \naverage American family pays 37 percent of its income in all taxes at \nall levels, half again as much as our parents paid in the 1950s.\n  Stop and think about that. Compare the wages, compare the cost of \nliving, compare everything else then relative to now, and yet today \ntaxes have dramatically increased, by about half, compared to our \nparents' generation.\n  No wonder the personal average savings rate in America is now a \nnegative 1 percent. Government is taking away what the people otherwise \nwould save - what they would save for their retirement, for their \nchildren's education, for their parents' care, or to build a better \nstandard of living. Oftentimes we hear economists analyze the negative \nsavings rate in our country compared with other nations of the world, \nand they say: It is a matter of culture. Certain nations have a culture \nof savings.\n  My suggestion to our citizens is this: If you were granted the \nopportunity or the incentive, my guess is you would be saving a great \ndeal more than you are saving now. When you are paying 37 percent of \nyour income for taxes at all\n\n[[Page S4856]]\n\nlevels, you simply have less to live on, less to save, and, therefore, \nyou are using more of what you have for necessities.\n  The total Federal tax take this year will be 20.7 percent of the \ntotal economy. In other words, 20.7 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct of this country is required to pay for Government, the highest \nlevel ever, except for one year, 1944. Of course, we can all remember \nwhere the nation was in 1944. We were at the peak of World War II. We \nhad committed this country to saving the world and saving the free \nworld from tyranny and knocking down the powers of fascism. We had \ncommitted all of our resources to doing that. Only at that time, \ncompared with now, did we have comparable tax burdens.\n  In fact, in the six years of highest taxes in American history, two \nfell during World War II and the other four have been the most recent \nfour.\n  Where is the war today? Are we committed to saving all of the world \nfrom the direct threat of a powerful enemy of the kind we saw in World \nWar II? That is not at all the case. Simply, our Government's domestic \nappetite has dramatically grown from 1944 to today, and as a result of \nthat, our hard-working Americans have fallen victim to that appetite.\n  Can anyone seriously claim that the Federal Government is now engaged \nin a life-and-death struggle, compared to World War II? I don't think \nso. Oh, we have a lot of problems to solve and challenges to meet. \nThere is no doubt about it. We are attempting to address them. On the \nfloor this week we are debating education and are committed to putting \na substantial increase in Federal funding into what is a traditional \nState and local funding priority, to help enhance the ability of State \nand local educators and education-providers to improve the conditions \nunder which our children learn.\n  Still, on top of all that, we have the opportunity to provide the tax \nrelief that will go a long way toward helping our economy and freeing \nthe American people.\n  The new budget provides for paying down more than $2.4 trillion worth \nof debt in the next 10 years. Some Senators said we are going to give \nall the money back to the taxpayers, that we are not going to deal with \nthe debt. Somehow in the midst of all this debate, somebody did not \nlook at the plain numbers in the budget resolution to recognize that, \nif we stay this course, over the next 10 years we are paying down $2.4 \ntrillion of that debt. That is nearly twice the amount of tax relief \nthat is in the budget and 50 percent more in debt relief than in the \namount of tax relief requested by the President.\n  So we clearly will have more debt paid down than tax relief. But in \nthe balance of both, my guess is Alan Greenspan is going to say: ``Good \njob. That means Government will not grow larger. That means the \nappetite of Government has been curtailed. That means a freeing up of \nthe domestic productive economy of this country, which means that \nmonetary policy and fiscal policy are a good deal more in synch.''\n  This Senator is glad we are paying down the debt. I hope in my time \nof service here I can turn to my children and grandchildren and say: Of \nall the things my generation and I have not done for you, there is one \ngood thing we did do for you in my lifetime, and that was to rid our \ncountry of debt and therefore to rid you of your obligation as current \nand future taxpayers of having to respond to that debt by a very large \nchunk of your tax dollars being consumed by it. That ought to be the \nresponsibility and obligation of my generation. Clearly, we have set a \ncourse with this budget and this budget resolution for doing so.\n  I think we have to go even further than that. The budget already \ncalls for paying down debt at a fast pace - the fastest pace at which \nthe debt can be paid down.\n  The budget includes overall spending increases of about 5 percent. \nFrankly, in my State of Idaho, folks are not so sure why Government \nshould grow at all, that 5 percent is maybe even too large. There is no \nquestion there are some very real needs out there. We are going to meet \nsome of those needs. At the same time, it is important to recognize we \ncan in fact give tax relief and pay down debt.\n  This year's tax relief will only be about 5 percent of total revenues \nover the next 10 years. It will be about one-half of President John \nKennedy's tax cut, adjusted for the times and the size of the economy. \nYet we hear people now suggesting this is a devastating tax cut, that \nthis simply destroys the revenue flow of Government. Yet in another \nera, another time, comparing economies in a fair way, the Kennedy tax \ncut was nearly double the one we are dealing with today.\n  This year's tax relief will be about a third of the package that was \nenacted under President Ronald Reagan. Yet of course it was the Ronald \nReagan tax cut that fueled the booming economy of the late 1980s.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has reached 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, let me wrap up. With the passage of the \nbudget resolution, and now with the beginning of the work of the \nFinance Committee to produce a tax bill, we are clearly receiving the \nmessage from the American people. We are acting on their goal for us, \nto deliver back to them in both the immediate and long term, some tax \nrelief--to offer up to them the right--government may act like it is a \nprivilege, but it is a right to keep a little more of their own, hard-\nearned money.\n  Now is the time to stop the government tax man from being the \nuninvited guest at every wedding, the unwelcome intruder at family \nfunerals, and the rude bill collector at every graduation. Maybe, just \nmaybe, next year's Tax Freedom Day will come not in May but in April \nonce again. If that is true, we will have accomplished a great deal \nmore than anyone thought we could, not too long ago.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I join my colleagues to talk a little \nabout taxes this week since we are expected to bring up some tax relief \nlegislation here the latter part of this week. I think it is time for \nus to remember that tax freedom day was May 3 of this year. This is the \nlatest it has ever been.\n  What does that mean? It means the average American family will work \nthe first 123 days of the year to pay the combined tax bill from all \nlevels of government. That is Federal, State, and local. Obviously, the \nFederal bite out of the family's budget is the largest of all three of \nthose. I hope I have time to get into a little more detail on that. But \ncertainly it is time for a tax cut.\n  We frequently discussed the budget surplus, but I think it is more \naccurate to refer to it as a tax surplus. The tax surplus represents an \noverpayment by taxpayers and should be refunded to those who overpaid. \nTax cuts will benefit all Americans by making the economy stronger. Low \ntaxes help reward work, savings, and investment. Low taxes provide the \nfuel for our economy to create new jobs and raise our standard of \nliving. I think it is reasonable to conclude if we raise taxes, just \nthe opposite is going to happen.\n  In today's economy, it would be ill advised if we did not make a \nsincere effort to cut taxes. This allows people to keep their own money \nand helps our economy. It makes sense. People are in a better position \nthan the Government to know what they believe. I believe in the \npeople's priorities instead of Washington's priorities.\n  This tax cut we are going to be talking about is real money that can \nbe used for things such as helping to buy a home, helping to pay for a \ncollege education, or help in purchasing a computer to help the kids \nthrough school so they can learn math and become more proficient in \nEnglish. Some have attempted to shift the focus on tax cuts by claiming \nwe cannot afford tax cuts. In fact, tax cuts do not jeopardize debt \nrepayment or the Government's other obligations.\n  I would like to take a moment to look at that. The budget that has \nbeen proposed now allows the Government to return a major portion of \nthe surplus to its rightful owners, the taxpayers. It continues to pay \ndown our national debt, and it continues to protect Social Security and \nMedicare surpluses. The Congressional Budget Office forecasts the 10-\nyear surplus is large enough to allow the Federal Government to retire \nall available debt held by the public.\n\n[[Page S4857]]\n\n  I would like to refer my colleagues to my efforts over the past 4 \nyears. Four years ago, I introduced legislation to pay down the debt in \n30 years. Then I looked at the amount of revenue that was coming into \nthe Federal Government, part of this tax surplus, and I determined 2 \nyears ago we ought to be able to pay down this debt within a 20-year \nperiod. So I introduced legislation to pay down the debt within 20 \nyears. This year, we are looking at paying down the debt in 10 years \nand still being able to provide for a $1.6 trillion tax cut.\n  The Congress has backed off on what was originally proposed by the \nPresident and finally agreed on somewhere between $1.35 and $1.4 \ntrillion in tax cuts. Certainly we have allowed ourselves plenty of \nmargin.\n  The tax bill that is supposed to be coming to the Chamber contain \nmany important provisions. Many of them have been referred to by the \nPresident. First, the tax rates are lowered across the board. This will \nbenefit Americans in all categories who pay taxes. This year, taxpayers \nwill get immediate relief when the 15-percent rate is lowered to 10 \npercent on a significant portion of that income.\n  The tax bill also lowers the top rate significantly, increases the \nchild tax credit, provides tax relief for education expenses, and \neliminates the death tax.\n  I am particularly pleased to support repeal of the death tax.\n  The United States retains among the highest estate taxes in the \nworld, and top estate tax rates can reach over 55 percent. This is \nmoney that was already taxed when it was earned.\n  The estate tax can destroy a family business. This is the most \ndisturbing aspect of the tax. No American family should lose its \nbusiness because of the estate tax.\n  Similarly, more and more large ranches and farms are facing the \nprospect of breakup and sale to developers in order to pay the estate \ntax.\n  We feel it acutely in Colorado, especially because of the rapid \ngrowth and demand for real estate in Colorado.\n  One change which is not included is a reduction in the capital gains \ntax. I hope that this can be added to this tax bill or one later in the \nyear. This change would actually increase revenue to the Treasury.\n  I support a reduction in the top rate from 20 to 14 or 15 percent. I \nalso believe that we should include indexing so that taxes are paid \nonly on real capital gains, not those which result only from inflation.\n  In 1997 we reduced the capital gains tax from 28 to 20 percent.\n  Many of you will recall the debate over whether this would raise or \nlower revenues. We now have the answer--revenues from capital gains \nincreased dramatically after the rate cut.\n  In fact, in just the 4 years since the rate cut, 1997 through 2000, \nthe Government has received $200 billion more capital gains revenue \nthan forecast before the rate cut.\n  That is $200 billion of added revenue in just 4 years.\n  I think the Tax Foundation does some very good work. I have been \nlooking at a chart that was put out by the Tax Foundation.\n  From 1992 until the year 2001, we actually see a large spike in rates \nof increases for taxes and the total tax revenues that are being paid \nto the Federal Government.\n  We see the tax burden days go from April 18 to May 3--within a period \nof a little less than a decade. I think this is a phenomenal amount of \nrevenue increase that has come from working Americans.\n  Of the 123 days that America spends laboring for Federal, State, and \nlocal taxes, it is interesting how this breaks out. Fifty days of that \ngoes toward individual income taxes, 42 days goes to Federal and State, \nand for local it is 8 days.\n  For social insurance taxes, 29 days goes to that category. And all of \nthat is Federal. There is no State or local part in that aspect of the \ntax.\n  Of the 123 days, 16 days go toward sales and excise taxes. Three days \nof that is allocated towards Federal and 13 days is allocated towards \nState and local. Property taxes--the Federal Government has no property \ntaxes, but State and local governments do. Ten days out of that 123 \ndays goes for property taxes for State and local governments.\n  Let's look at the corporate box that has been analyzed by the Tax \nFoundation. Corporate income taxes make up 12 days of the total of 123 \ndays. The Federal part of it is 10 days and the State and local part of \nit is 2 days.\n  If we look at other business taxes, there is a total of 3 days put in \nthat category. The Federal Government doesn't have any, but State and \nlocal has a total amount of 3 days. For all other taxes is that general \ncategory. There are 2 days allocated to that box. One of them is \nFederal and one is State and local.\n  I think those are some interesting factors coming out.\n  Then there are those who say the tax cut is way too much. We know \nwhat happens.\n  If we go with the President's tax cut that he proposed--I remind the \nSenate that it hasn't gone as much as the President proposed--then \nbasically what you are doing over the next 9 or 10 years is holding the \ntax burden day on May 3, 2001.\n  What happens if we don't have any tax cuts? Suppose we didn't go with \nany tax cut at all? We would see the tax freedom day move out to May 9. \nThis is not a particularly remarkable tax cut, but it is something that \ncertainly is badly needed.\n  I am looking forward to the debate because I think it is very \nimportant that we move forward with the tax cut right now. If my memory \nserves me correctly, we have raised taxes retroactively. I don't see \nwhat the problem is with trying to cut taxes retroactively, \nparticularly in light of the fact that we have the surpluses we are \nfacing today.\n  In summary, Americans are spending more than ever on taxes. In fact, \nwe now pay more taxes than we do for food, shelter, and clothing \ncombined. Since when did the Federal Government become more important \nthan life's essentials? It is time to reverse this trend by cutting \ntaxes across the board. Lower taxes would help our economy and would \nalso help America's families.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/14/senate-section/article/S4857-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4857-S4858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           U.S. TRADE POLICY\n\n  Mr. HAGEL. Mr. President, last week President Bush laid out an \naggressive trade agenda for America. Few policy areas will be more \ncritical to the future prosperity of not only the United States, but \nthe world.\n  Trade is essential to the continued growth of our economy. U.S. \nexports totaled more than $1 trillion last year, an increase of 12 \npercent from 1999. Those exports accounted for 11 percent of our GDP in \n2000.\n  The impact and importance of trade extends far beyond our borders. \nThe nations of the world live in a global community--underpinned by a \nglobal economy. We are all directly affected by the development and \ngrowth of markets around the world. Stability, security, economics, \nmarkets, communications, trade, and investments are all interconnected.\n  Taking advantage of the opportunities of this hopeful new world will \nrequire vision and leadership--bold Presidential leadership with the \nvision to see through the haze of the present and into the \npossibilities of the future. This will require leadership that is wise \nenough to seize the moment and help move the world forward. Nations of \ntoday are not the nations of yesterday. We must rise above past \ndifferences and old conflicts. This is not without risk. But the risk \nmust be taken.\n  Trade connects people. Increased commerce and the bridges it builds \nhas broad implications for human rights, democracy and increased \nstability and freedom around the world.\n  Trade binds nations together in strategic and political alliances. \nThroughout history trade and commerce have been key instruments that \nhave helped break down totalitarian governments and dictatorships, and \nopened the doors to democracy and higher standards of living for all \npeople--improved health, better diets, and hope for the future. Trade \nand international investment have helped pave the way for peace in many \nareas of the world. Trade and democracy are interconnected. Trade and \ninvestment lead to political and economic stability.\n  The key to this is a strong trade agenda that pursues our interests \nwhile balancing them with other priorities.\n\n[[Page S4858]]\n\n  First and most important is the granting of Trade Promotion Authority \nto the President. Every day that goes by without this authority is \nanother day of wasted opportunity. We cannot afford for America to \nstand idle while other nations negotiate trade agreements that give an \nadvantage to the competitors of American goods and services. Congress \nneeds to get this done, and get it done quickly.\n  We have many other challenges that lie ahead. We need to move the \nJordan and Vietnam Trade Agreements through Congress.\n  We also should look to our own hemisphere. Canada and Mexico are our \nlargest trading partners. American exports to Western Hemisphere \nnations comprised more than one-third of all U.S. exports in 2000. We \nmust strengthen our ties to our Western Hemisphere neighbors.\n  This is good for all peoples in this hemisphere. We need to move on \nrenewing the Andean Trade Preference Act this year. And we should \npursue a trade agreement with Chile, and a free trade agreement for all \nthe Americas.\n  We will face another hurdle in again granting normal trade relations \nto China. Establishing a stable trade relationship with China is in our \nbest interest.\n  Turning our backs on China will not improve human rights in China, \npromote greater freedom, or improve the stability in Asia--rather, it \nwould have a dangerous and negative impact on all these important \nefforts.\n  This year we must help lead efforts to launch another round of World \nTrade Organization negotiations.\n  The challenges are many, and they are great, but so are the \nopportunities. President Bush has laid out a strong, forward-looking \nagenda on trade. He has an excellent team in Ambassador Zoellick, \nSecretary Evans, and those charged with moving this agenda forward.\n  I look forward to working with the President and his team on \nAmerica's trade agenda. It is fundamental to our future.\n  Trade and investment are building blocks for the world's mutual \ninterests. We have the opportunity to make the world more stable, more \nsecure, more prosperous, and more democratic. Let's not squander this \nvery historic and unique opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida).

Mr. President, in the State of Nevada in Las Vegas, there \nis a very innovative teacher. Her name is Priscilla Rocha. She is a \nwonderful woman who has been a friend of mine for many years. She is \nalso a member of the State board of education. She teaches the fourth \ngrade, and she has had almost 20 years of experience. She has taught in \nTexas. As I indicated, she now teaches in Las Vegas.\n  About 3 years ago, she started an afterschool program in her \nclassroom in response to the many struggles she saw with children who \nhad limited English proficiency. She observed that the parents were not \nequipped with English skills or the academic background to help these \nchildren with their homework. Children were going home in some \ninstances with no supervision because both parents worked. She found \nthat these children kept falling further and further behind in their \nacademic work, and she recognized that it was only a matter of time \nuntil the children dropped out of school.\n  What she calls her homework center operates as follows: Children in \ngrades 1-5 are referred to the program by teachers and school \ncounselors. Parents are first notified, and they have to sign a consent \nthat the children can enter into this afterschool homework program. She \nhas found it easy to get college students to help by tutoring the \nchildren on a one-to-one basis. She has also found that some children \nneed to stay in the program only for a matter of weeks. Others need to \nspend a matter of years in the program.\n  Currently, the Las Vegas program is funded through a HUD community \nblock grant from Clark County and the city of Las Vegas. This is held \nin a school classroom, but direct funding does not come from the school \ndistrict. The funding goes to a community-based organization that Ms. \nRocha helped found in 1992 called Hispanic Association for Bilingual \nLiteracy in Education, or HABLE. Ms. Rocha is the Executive Director of \nHABLE. This program has been a remarkable success. Starting with six \nstudents in 1993,\n\n[[Page S4859]]\n\nshe has worked with about 250 students since then. Most of these \nchildren do not speak and did not speak a single word of English when \nthey came to Ms. Rocha. Now almost 100 of these kids have graduated \nfrom high school, and a like number, almost another hundred, are on the \nway to successfully completing high school in the next few years.\n  It was hard to find examples that I should bring to the Chamber today \nbecause there are really so many, but I have chosen a few with the help \nof Ms. Rocha. For instance, Evilia Gomez was one of the original fourth \ngraders to start with Ms. Rocha in 1993. While she has always been a \nbright girl and had been a good student in Mexico, when she came to \nAmerica, she didn't speak a word of English. We find that far too often \nstudents like Evilia simply are put in a special education program. \n``They can't read; they must be dumb if they can't read.''\n  Well, this little girl wasn't dumb. The fact that she couldn't speak \ndid not mean that she was slow or learning disabled. With the extra \nattention she was given, she rapidly learned English and quickly \ntransitioned to regular classes. She did so much extra course work that \nshe graduated from Las Vegas High School 2 years early as valedictorian \nof the class. Of all the students who graduated from Las Vegas High \nSchool in the class of 1999, a girl who didn't speak a single word of \nEnglish 6 years earlier ended up with the highest grade point average \nof any student in that very large high school. Not only is this a \nspecial child, this is a special program, and we need to replicate it.\n  Another girl in Las Vegas, Johanna Rangel, has a similar success \nstory. She didn't graduate as valedictorian, but she did extremely \nwell. She is one of the original six who worked with Priscilla when \nthis program started. When she came to this program, she didn't speak a \nsingle word of English. Now she is President of a Latino students' \norganization at Desert Pines High School and is involved in many extra \ncurricular activities. She will graduate in a month. She did extremely \nwell in school, and she plans to attend college this fall.\n  She is quick to point out that her success is due to her being able \nto come to the program Priscilla Rocha developed, and she believes the \nprogram is the reason she was able to graduate from high school. In \nfact, she said, when she invited Ms. Rocha to her graduation:\n\n       This would not have been possible without you. I wouldn't \n     be graduating without your help.\n\n  There are many others. You have to understand that Johanna's parents \ndidn't speak a word of English when they brought her from Mexico to the \nUnited States. They couldn't help with her homework; no matter how \nbadly they wanted to help, they couldn't. They didn't speak English. \nHer risk of failure and thus dropping out, was dramatic, but this \nprogram turned things around for her.\n  Children want to learn. They want to be productive. There is a lot \ngoing on in America today about English as an only language. States are \npassing, have passed, and are trying to pass laws saying that there \nshould only be one language.\n  Mr. President, there is only one language anyway. If you want to \nsucceed in America, you don't need to pass a law saying English is the \nonly language. It is the only language. If you want to succeed, you \nhave to speak English. It used to be if you wanted to be a diplomat, \nyou had to speak French. Not anymore. The language of diplomacy is \nEnglish. If you want to fly an airplane anyplace in the world, the air \ntraffic controllers' language is English.\n  So not only did Johanna want to succeed, she wanted to learn to speak \nEnglish. She needed help. Her parents could not help in that regard. So \nI am excited about this program. We have all kinds of success stories.\n  Alvaro Rodriguez is a 10-year-old fourth grader who began Ms. Rocha's \nprogram at the start of this school year. He and his family came \nstraight from Mexico. None of them were able to speak a single word of \nEnglish. By the end of this school year, Alvaro will start \ntransitioning into regular reading and writing programs in English. \nNext year, he won't be in a special program. He will be a fifth grader \nand he will be mainstreamed.\n  Carla Rojas, another 10-year-old, is benefitting from this program. \nShe came to Las Vegas from Mexico in the middle of this school year. It \nis hard enough for a 10-year-old to change schools in the middle of the \nyear, but Carla was put into a school where she didn't understand a \nsingle word of what the teacher or the kids were saying. This program \nhas helped her so much that by the end of this year it is believed that \nshe will be adapted so well that she will be able to take classes with \neverybody else this coming year.\n  Priscilla Rocha says of Carla: ``She is a very smart and energetic \ngirl. All we have to do is give her the little push she needs.''\n  So these programs work well, as they should work well. The increasing \ndiversity of our Nation enriches our communities. It also challenges \nour public schools to meet both the English language and literacy needs \nof our expanding limited English proficient student populations. The \nfamilies of these students speak their native languages at home and \noften have limited English skills, making it difficult for parents and \nfamily members to help children with their unique academic language \nstruggles.\n  Think about it. You go to school and they are speaking one language \nthere, and you go home and they are speaking a different language. How \ndo you improve upon what you don't know? It is hard to do.\n  That is why programs such as the one I have outlined are so \nimportant. To address the need for literacy for these students, my \namendment expands the current 21st century learning centers in this \nbill to include programs for limited English proficient students.\n  I have talked about the Homework Center in Las Vegas. It is vital to \nthe education of these limited English proficient students who don't \nhave the resources at home to support them. These programs need to have \nthe support of the entire education system. Why? Because it means \neconomic security and quality of life. We can't ignore the fact that \nacross this country the dropout rate for limited English proficient \nyouth remains chronically and unacceptably high at almost 45 percent. \nAlmost half the kids who have trouble with their language skills drop \nout of school.\n  Over half a million students drop out of school every year; 3,000 \nstudents drop out of school every day in America. Every child who drops \nout is less than they can be. It puts a burden on the criminal justice \nsystem and our welfare system. It is something with which we certainly \nneed to do better. We have about 5 million Americans who lack a high \nschool degree and are not in the process of getting one. In our prisons \nin America today, line them all up; 82 percent of them have no high \nschool education. Is there a correlation between education and getting \nin trouble? Of course. I didn't speak improperly. I said 82 percent of \nthe people in our prisons have not graduated from high school. Does \nthat mean that the 82 percent who haven't graduated are a bunch of \ndopes? The answer is no. The vast majority of those students, for one \nreason or another, didn't keep up, or could not keep up; they didn't \nhave the incentives, and many of them have language problems. This \namendment will help with those language problems.\n\n  The primary reason children drop out of school is a lack of success \nin school. They believe they can be a bigger hit out on the street \nbeating up on somebody or selling dope. They don't understand the \nimportance of an education. If they do understand the importance of an \neducation, they have dropped back so far that they know they can never \ncatch up. They can catch up, but they think that they can never catch \nup.\n  This is not just a problem of a few kids not getting an education. A \nhigh school dropout rate impacts the economy and quality of life, not \nonly for the children that drop out, as I have mentioned, but their \nfamilies and for each and every one of us.\n  Every time a child drops out of school, we have failed a little bit. \nIt hurts us. It hurts us because it doesn't sound right morally, but it \nhurts us economically, and it hurts the social fabric of our country.\n  We need an educated workforce. If this continues, we will have \nincreased\n\n[[Page S4860]]\n\nunemployment rates and increased prison incarceration, people on \nwelfare and other Federal programs, and unemployment rates of high \nschool dropouts are more than twice that of high school graduates. \nRemember, we are pushing kids to go beyond high school--maybe not to \ncollege, but the unemployment rates of high school dropouts are more \nthan twice those of high school graduates.\n  The probability of falling into poverty is three times higher for \nhigh school dropouts than for those who finish high school. That is 300 \npercent higher.\n  The median personal income of high school graduates, during the prime \nearning years, ages 25 to 54, is 200 percent that of high school \ndropouts.\n  The median personal income of college graduates is more than three \ntimes that of high school dropouts.\n  The children, sadly, of high school dropouts have a much greater \nchance of dropping out of school. It becomes a pattern.\n  The problem is worse for America's Hispanics--a growing segment of \nour population. Hispanics students have a dropout rate of more than 30 \npercent--three times compared to the overall rate of 11 percent.\n  Afterschool programs tailored for limited English proficient students \nwill go a long way toward helping to keep these fine young people in \nschool.\n  There is an increasing need all over America for language services. \nNearly 20 percent of the students in U.S. schools speak a foreign \nlanguage at home. According to the National Clearinghouse for Bilingual \nEducation, that figure will grow.\n  In some parts of the country, non-English speakers are referred to \nspecial education, as I have indicated, based solely on their inability \nto speak English the way teachers and others believe they should. Some \nmay think if they don't speak English correctly, they must be dumb. Not \nso. Some school systems--and I believe this may be in violation of the \ncivil rights laws of our country--continue to assign students to \nspecial education programs on the basis of criteria that essentially \nmeasures and evaluates English skills of students.\n  Currently, students fail to receive the right programs because the \nguidance and funding districts receive is inadequate to develop \ncomprehensive programs for limited English proficiency students.\n  I say to my friend, the Senator from Vermont, who is managing this \nbill, I have always appreciated his forceful advocacy of fully funding \nIDEA--programs for those with special needs. The reason I do that is, \nit is the right thing to do for the children, and it is the right thing \nto do for the school districts because it leaves them money to do \nthings like this--special programs, such as helping a kid who doesn't \nspeak English. The way it is now, they are so strapped for money, all \nthey are able to do is the basics. If we fully fund the IDEA program, \nas we should do, it will allow some money for these programs that will \nmake a difference in kids' lives.\n  More funding is needed to develop effective special education \nprograms for diverse students to meet the many challenges that they \nface.\n  Funding would provide schools with the support they need to devise \nlanguage programs that fit the needs of the districts.\n  School districts all over America are scrambling to meet the basics. \nSome have more problems than others. Some have problems with crumbling \nschools. In Nevada, especially in southern Nevada where 70 percent of \nthe people live, we have problems with the inability to build enough \nnew schools.\n  We need to build one new school in the Clark County school district \nevery month to keep up with the growth. We hold the record. One year we \ndedicated 18 new schools in the Clark County School Districts.\n  Schools have problems for various reasons. We in southern Nevada have \nthe problem of not being able to keep up with the growth. We need help \nwith construction. We need help with class size reduction. I am \nspeaking today about the need to fully fund IDEA and to also allow this \namendment to be adopted so that we have the ability, within this new \neducation bill we are going to pass, to fund programs for kids who do \nnot speak English as well as they would be able to with a little bit of \ndirection.\n  I appreciate President Bush focusing on education, but we cannot \neducate kids on the cheap. It costs money to educate kids. Most of the \ncontroversy in the school choice debate attached to the President's \nproposal is to let low-income parents use Federal aid to apply to \nprivate school alternatives when their children are in public schools \nand they believe the schools do not provide services for their \nchildren's needs.\n  I believe a better approach is to look at something that Priscilla \nRocha has done in Las Vegas. We do not need to take these kids out of \npublic schools. What we need to do is take care of funding, let people \nlike Priscilla Rocha be inventive, give her the resources so she, and \nother educators like her, can have afterschool programs that are \nimportant and help the limited English proficient student. I believe a \nbroader approach to the President's parental choice option is \nnecessary, one that calls for a revamping of a 30-year-old underfunded \npolicy for limited English proficiency education.\n  The principles behind properly funding these programs are simple. For \none, the millions of American children with limited proficiency in \nEnglish should not be consigned to years of classes that avoid helping \nthem gain rapid English proficiency. For that, increased funding is \nnecessary.\n  If one of these children is put in a special education class, think \nwhat that does to that child. They know they are as smart as the kid \nnext to them, they just cannot talk, or maybe they do not know they are \nas smart as the kid next to them. That is even more sad.\n  I think of literacy as an empowerment issue. I think that education \nempowers us, and that education does not mean you have to be a doctor, \nlawyer, or college professor. It means being able to read and write. It \nmeans having an opportunity to go to a technical school to be an \nautomobile mechanic.\n  Mr. President, when you and I graduated from high school, if we \nwanted to be an automobile mechanic, we got out of high school and \nstarted working on cars. Students cannot do that anymore. They have to \nbe able to read manuals. They have to attend classes and get a \ncertificate before anyone will hire them.\n  Automobile agencies in Las Vegas for a number of years--I did not \nrealize this--imported people to work on these cars from Utah because \nUtah issued certificates. Our community colleges in southern Nevada \noffer training and a degree in the automotive field. A student can then \ngo to Pete Findley Oldsmobile or Fletcher Jones Chevrolet or any of the \nautomobile dealerships, and they will hire them. It takes an education.\n\n  Literacy is an empowerment issue. While these children are in \nAmerica, we want them to have the very best, and having the very best \nis not an act of generosity on our part. It is an act of doing the \nright thing, not only for them but for us. Every child who drops out of \nschool not only hurts himself or herself and his family, but hurts us. \nWe have to recognize that making programs available to help these kids \nthrough school is good for all of us.\n  Look at the practicality of literacy as an empowerment issue. It is \nnot a question of picking one method or another. It has more to do with \nthe idea that we have millions of children with limited proficiency in \nEnglish. These children should be equipped with the necessary tools to \nprosper in America.\n  The sooner you speak English, the sooner you are a fully functioning \ncitizen who can participate in society.\n  I have given the example of Priscilla Rocha's program, but I am sure \nthere are many others around the country that work. I am familiar with \nMs. Rocha's program because she has been a friend of mine for many \nyears. I know what a caring individual she is.\n  I am not advocating a set program. I am advocating that we make sure \nthis education bill allows us to do what, in my opinion, the country \nneeds.\n  The 21st Century Community Learning Centers program in this \nlegislation expands eligibility to include programs that emphasize \nlanguage support for limited English proficient students.\n  There are all kinds of afterschool programs around the country that \nwork. For example, there is a program in Madison, WI. The city operates \na\n\n[[Page S4861]]\n\nsafe haven afterschool program for more than 200 children at three \nelementary schools in communities with high crime and poverty rates.\n  The program activities include homework help, academic enrichment, \narts and crafts, supervised games and physical education, and field \ntrips. As the program enters its third year, the schools report \nimproved attendance and reduced conflicts during afterschool hours. \nChildren in the program also show greater interest in completing their \nhomework.\n  Another example can be found in New York City where the YMCA of \nGreater New York, in partnership with the New York City Board of \nEducation, is working to bring extended school services to 10,000 \npublic school children by turning 200 of the city's underserved public \nschools into virtual Y's from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. after school each day.\n  There are all kinds of programs. Second, third, and fourth graders \ntake part in these programs.\n  A program in Charleston, WV, helps 60 students who live in a \ncommunity plagued by crime and drugs attend a summer camp operated by \nChandler Elementary School.\n  I have given examples of programs that help 10,000 schoolchildren, \nand one that helps 60 schoolchildren. Is one any better than the other? \nProbably not, but they both work.\n  Finally, a program in Waco, TX, the Lighted School Program, has kept \nmiddle schools open after school until 7 p.m. at night Monday through \nThursday for activities and services to approximately 200 students who \nattend regularly. Nineteen local organizations provide activities and \nservices. Baylor University contributes 115 college students as \nmentors. Each works with one child for a full school year.\n  The recreation department of that city leads supervised field trips \nand games. Two art centers send instructors to the schools to lead \nhands-on activities, and library staff help children read and act out \nstories.\n  Children who participated in the Lighted School Program say they \nappreciate having a safe place to go after school, that it keeps them \noff the streets and it is more fun, they say, than sitting at home in \nfront of the television. Several say if the program did not exist, they \nwould be in big trouble.\n  There are programs that do help. My afterschool literacy amendment \nwill not substitute for school-based academic instruction but will \ncomplement it.\n  My amendment expands the existing 21st Century Community Learning \nCenters Program. This program helps fund a variety of valuable \nprograms. This grant program is directed at inner-city and rural \nschools that are working in partnership with community organizations to \nprovide learning and enrichment programs outside of regular school \nhours for children and adults.\n  A community learning center is an entity within a public elementary, \nmiddle, or secondary school building that provides educational, \nrecreational, health, and social service programs for residents of all \nages within a local community. It is generally operated by a school \ndistrict which is legally responsible within a State for providing the \npublic education for these students.\n\n  There are many examples of afterschool programs including: literacy \nprograms; senior citizen programs; children's daycare services; summer \nand weekend school programs; nutrition and health programs; expanded \nlibrary services; telecommunications and technology education programs; \nparenting skills; employment counseling, training, and placement; and \nservices for individuals with disabilities. These are already included \nin the bill. I want to make sure there is no confusion, that everyone \nunderstands we need to make sure the 21st Century Community Learning \nCenter also includes school-based instruction for children who have \nlimited English skills.\n  It is important we do that. These programs, I believe, are essential \nto decreasing the number of students who dropout of school. Just think, \ninstead of having 3,000 children dropping out of school, let's say we \nhave 2,500, if there are 500 kids we can keep in school, I think it \nwill be well worth it.\n  I hope we send a message by voting unanimously as a Senate for this \nlegislation. I hope it has a strong vote. It is something that is \nimportant to the country. I think it is important to this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator for his excellent \npresentation. He has put his finger on one of the most serious problems \nwe have in this Nation, and that is the dropout problem.\n  We have to be very careful when we find somebody is proud of their \nrecord because their averages have improved, because then we find out \nthe reason they have improved is so many kids dropped out of school \nthat the ones who are left average a higher percentage of successful \nstudents. So we have to be very careful when we examine these matters.\n  Also, the Senator did a very excellent job pointing out the group of \nstudents who have the most difficult problems staying in school are \nthose with language difficulties, Hispanics in particular.\n  His amendment is an excellent one. I would love to accept it, but I \nunderstand it can further serve another purpose, which, as we are \naware, happens on Mondays. So I ask at some point, when the Senator is \nready, we call for a vote.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield my time if there is any.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I yield back my time.\n  Mr. REID. I ask the amendment be set aside for further business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, as we begin this critical week with debate \non the education bill, I wanted to make some points that I think apply \nthroughout the debate on education, and I wanted to share with my \ncolleagues some of my hopes, aspirations, and concerns. I thank the \nmanager on the minority side for allowing us to do so.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator coming. I know \nhe has an important message. I look forward to listening to him.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the manager.\n  Mr. President, there have been numerous times that I have come to the \nSenate floor to say--and I come, once again, to repeat--that education \nis a national priority, but it is an obligation and responsibility of \nthose at the State and local level. The education of our children has \ntraditionally been--and ought to be in the future--carried out and \nimplemented at the local level.\n  I remember a couple of years ago when we were talking about Federal \ncontrol that one of my colleagues, who is now no longer with us, was in \na debate with a representative in the Department of Education. The \nDepartment of Education person said: I care just as much about your \nchildren and their needs and their operations in school and their \nsuccess as you do, to which he replied: Well, that's great. Do you know \ntheir names? No. Do you know what their scores are? No. Do you know \nwhat their challenges are? No. Do you know where their schools are? No.\n  The simple fact is that none of us here in Washington, no matter how \nmuch we are concerned about education in general and children in \ngeneral, can know what the problems are and what the challenges are and \nhow best to meet those challenges for students in each local school \ndistrict throughout this Nation.\n  I think we would all say that each child is different. Each school \ndistrict is different. Each school is different. I think for that and \nother good reasons the Federal role in education has been a limited \none, and I believe it should be.\n\n[[Page S4862]]\n\n  The underlying bill before us--S. 1--recognizes the nature and the \nscope of this role. The legislation creates a leadership role for the \nFederal Government in encouraging States to adopt commonsense systems \nbased upon standards, measurements, and accountability. The underlying \nbill as reported out of our committee did not attempt to micromanage \nthe local schools and classrooms.\n  S. 1 also would give us the opportunity to redefine how we measure \nsuccess. For too long, many of my colleagues here have supported \nthrowing more and more money at education. And the Washington-based \neducation establishment generally has determined our success in \neducation programs based on the dollars spent--not on the academic \nachievements, not on the progress, and not on what our children are \nlearning in school to be better prepared for their role in this \nincreasingly complex and competitive society.\n  If more money were the answer, we wouldn't be debating this bill \nbecause we wouldn't have the problem. We have poured more and more \nFederal money into education, and the academic achievement of our \nstudents has been level or in some cases it has fallen behind.\n  In pouring more money into public education, we have gone to great \nlengths to detail precisely how those teachers--the men and women who \nknow the names of the child in their classroom, and know what his or \nher problems are, more and more they are being told what to do by \nWashington.\n  According to the Education Commission of the States:\n\n       In the 1999-2000 budget, the federal government spent \n     almost $44 billion on elementary and secondary education \n     programs. This funding was spread across 35 different \n     education programs in 15 different federal departments.\n\n  We did a little research a couple years ago and found out there are \nover 760 education programs. It was that proliferation of good ideas \nfrom Washington that led me at the time to propose what we call the \nDirect Check For Education, to combine some of those biggest programs, \ncut the redtape, send it back to the school districts, and tell the \nschool districts these are all things we think you ought to consider \nbut do not require them to dot every i and cross every t, jump through \nthe hoops, and fill out forms and fill out reports and play ``Mother \nMay I'' with the Federal Government.\n  All of these programs that exist today were started with good \nintentions, and they have gotten more money. Look at the money. Shown \non this chart are the appropriations for ESEA programs in billions of \ndollars. Starting in 1990, it looks as if, oh, around $7 billion was \nspent, and now it has gone up to, oh, I would say close to $380 \nbillion.\n  This shows what has happened in the average national scale math \nscores for 9-year-olds. That is measured on the chart with the green \nline. It is a flat line. If that were a line on a key chart in a \nhospital measuring the heartbeat of the patient, it would say the \npatient is dead. All the money has produced no appreciable benefits. \nThat is the math scores.\n  Maybe we can look at another chart to see if we got any better \nresults. How have we done in reading? This chart has the appropriations \nfor ESEA programs in billions of dollars. It is the same type of chart \nas the last one. It shows the national 4th grade reading scores: a flat \nline, no life in the patient. We are not getting any better. We are \nspending more money to do no better.\n  I am afraid we are about to hijack S. 1 and turn it into a replay of \nthe same kind of Federal micromanagement and Federal direction of \neducation that has managed to use a whole lot of money without getting \nany results.\n  These Federal programs--the Education Commission of the States says \n35; I say over 760--have gotten us burdensome regulations, unfunded \nmandates, and unwanted meddling. The folks at the local level--whether \nthey be parents or teachers or school board members or administrators--\nsay they have less and less control. Jobs of our teachers and \nadministrators are harder than they should be. We have eroded the \nopportunity for creativity and motivation.\n  I don't know how many of you have taken the opportunity to do what I \nhave done in Missouri. Over the last 3 years, I have traveled \nthroughout the State--in the metropolitan areas, the suburban areas, \nthe rural areas--and I have met with representatives of teachers, of \nschool board members, of administrators. I have asked: What is the \nproblem here? And too many of them have come back to say: We are \nspending our time as glorified grantsmen, trying to get more money from \nthe Federal Government, trying to jump through the hoops, trying to do \nwhat the Federal Government wants us to do. We don't have the time to \nprepare our lessons and to prepare our students for the education they \nneed for a lifetime.\n\n  This is a serious problem. This is what the teachers, the \nadministrators, the school board members are telling us throughout my \nState. It comes through loud and clear, and it is on a bipartisan \nbasis. From the most conservative Republicans to the most liberal \nDemocrats, the people in Missouri, who are involved at the local school \nlevel, tell us there is far too much time, effort, and energy wasted on \ncomplying with Federal dictates, Federal mandates.\n  Some of our schools say that, although the Federal Government only \nprovides an average of about 5 percent--I guess in Missouri it is a \nlittle less than the national average of the dollars going to \neducation--it, in effect, controls about 50 percent of what is done \nbecause these Federal mandates and these Federal dictates--all these \ngood ideas that went into these programs--tell the local schools how \nthey ought to handle the programs they would otherwise be doing to \neducate their kids. And most of them say, well over 50 percent of the \nredtape and the headache and the requirements and the hassle they go \nthrough comes from the Federal Government.\n  How can we afford to keep spending Federal education dollars in the \nsame way we have been doing it for years if it is not achieving any \nsuccess? I do not think we can. I do not think we should stand for it. \nI have talked to too many parents and teachers, school board members, \ncommunity and business leaders who say: Our children deserve better. \nThis country deserves better.\n  Over the past several years, I have opposed the creation of specific \nnew programs and their dictates on the style of their education, even \nthese amendments that have been offered in good faith. These amendments \nwere good ideas, if we had taken our good ideas and ran for membership \non a school board. I am sure many of my colleagues could make great \ncontributions if they were on the school board in Mexico, MO, or the R-\n6 school district or the St. Louis city school board or the Jefferson \nCity school board, but we are not.\n  The problem is, there are different needs and different challenges in \nMissouri, in Washington, in Arizona, in Maine, or in Florida. When we \npass a law, when we pass a dictate or a requirement, we do not know how \nthat is going to impact the kids who are the ones who have to be \ntaught. We may understand education in general, but there are \neducational needs that are specific and direct in each school district \nas the individual student involved.\n  I cannot believe, if my colleagues went back home, spent some time, \nsaddled up the horses, went out and just rode the circuit, that you \nwouldn't hear the same things. I know, first hand. Our State has some \nof the best teachers, the best principals, superintendents, and school \nboard members in the country. They are outstanding people. They are \nreally concerned.\n  You think we are concerned about education. Well, we were concerned \nabout education last week and will be this week, but we have to be \nconcerned about the budget, we have to be concerned about tax policy, \nand we are going to be concerned about energy policy.\n  These dedicated men and women are spending their lifetime dedicated \nto one thing; that is, teaching our children. What do the people who \nare actually involved in education have to say?\n  The superintendent of Springfield, MO, public schools said:\n\n       . . . the amount of paperwork that the federal government \n     causes local school districts to engage in is \n     often overwhelming. The extra effort and time often \n     reduces productive classroom time and energy that could\n\n[[Page S4863]]\n\n     better be spent working directly with children.\n\n  Mr. Berrey of the Wentzville R-IV school said:\n\n       Limiting federal intrusion into decisions best left to \n     local communities is what I believe our founding fathers had \n     in mind.\n\n  From the Neosho, MO, R-5 school district:\n\n       The individuals who are working most closely with the \n     students are indeed the ones who can best decide how this \n     money can be spent for the benefit of students' education.\n\n  The superintendent of the Special School District of St. Louis County \nsaid:\n\n       As head of a school district specializing in special \n     education, I fully understand how my district's financial \n     needs differ from other school district's needs. In order to \n     best utilize the limited funds that are at my disposal, I \n     need maximum flexibility in determining how to put those \n     funds to the best use.\n\n  The president of the board of education of the Blue Springs, MO, \nschool district said:\n\n       Without local control, the focus is taken away from the \n     needs specific to the children in each school system.\n\n  But I think maybe the superintendent of the Taneyville, MO, R-II \nschool district sums it up well:\n\n       I feel that State and Federal government has tied our \n     school's hands with mandated programs and mandated uses for \n     the monies we are receiving. The schools are likened to \n     puppets on a string. Pull this string this way and the school \n     does this; pull it another way and the school does that. \n     School systems and communities are as different from one \n     another as individual people are different. What works for \n     one will not work for another.\n\n  I offer those because that is the kind of information all of us need \nas we move forward on any kind of education bill, certainly one as \nimportant as the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act. My colleagues haven't been in a position to listen to \nthose people and ask them questions directly, but I suggest to them, if \nthey go home and ask questions, they will hear the same, with similar \neloquence and similar heartfelt concern, in their States.\n  To me the issue is simple: We must give our States and localities the \nflexibility to utilize the limited amount of Federal resources as they \nsee fit and hold them accountable in the form of academic achievement. \nWe must recognize and reward States and localities that succeed in \nimproving academic achievement. There also should be consequences for \nStates and localities that fail.\n  We have a choice between having Washington, DC, control our schools \nand the local level. Who is most likely to waste money? There is no \ncontest there. Unfortunately, we have demonstrated in Washington \ncollectively that no matter how good our ideas, how well intentioned \nour efforts are to provide direction and counseling and hope for \nschools, we may not be doing the right job; we may be causing them more \nproblem.\n  A little girl hustling to school--she was late for school--said a \nlittle prayer that she would get to school on time. She went about \nanother half block and got going too fast and fell down on her face. \nShe offered up another little prayer: I would like you to help me to \nget to school, but don't push so hard. I fell down.\n  Sometimes we are pushing a little too hard. Sometimes what we try to \ndo to help the people who are trying to deliver education try to uplift \nand empower our children pushes them down on their face. I think it is \ntime that we consolidate those programs, that we take all these great \nrevenues and give parents a say. Let school boards determine the \npolicy, let administrators know how to run their school, and let \nteachers who know the names and the problems and the opportunities and \nthe potential of each child make those educational decisions.\n  S. 1, the underlying bill, consolidates a myriad of Federal programs \ninto a set of programs designed to allow States and local school \ndistricts to make decisions on their own, to determine their \npriorities, recognizing that education reform will take place in the \nclassroom, not because of all of the wonderful, great ideas we have in \nWashington, DC. The underlying concept of S. 1 is the right way to go.\n  Amendments on class size are absolutely unnecessary. Class size \nreduction is an option in S. 1's larger, more flexible program for \nimproving the quality of classroom teaching. It should be an option, \nnot a mandate.\n  Let me ask this question: Has it been shown that a fifth grade class \nmust have only so many children in it to be successful? I have talked \nto a lot of administrators who say the most important thing for \nteaching that fifth grade class and each child in it is to make sure \nthe quality of the teacher is good. If we can't come up with two \nquality teachers, all we do, in splitting up the class, is say to those \nchildren who go with a less qualified teacher that they don't get as \ngood an education.\n  What if the school district has already devoted its money to reducing \nclass size, used its local funds? What they need is better pay to keep \nthose teachers there.\n  On classroom funding, are we going to say: You can only use this \nmoney to hire more teachers? What if the principal said: I have some \ngreat teachers, but they are going to go into the private sector if I \ndon't give them a pay increase? How does that make sense for us to say \nto every school district in the Nation: Thou shalt hire more teachers? \nIt doesn't make sense to me.\n\n  Local school districts are best equipped to determine what they need. \nMany have already reduced class size where they thought necessary. They \nmight have done that at the expense of some other things: Teacher pay, \ntechnology, class books. Maybe they need professional development for \nthe teachers they have. How do we know? I will guarantee you, we don't \nknow. We can't know for every school district in the Nation. That is \nwhy we ought not be mandating that Federal dollars be spent for a \npurpose that may or may not be the top priority need of that district.\n  Mandating specific resources for class size reduction really takes \nmoney off the table for other schools that have already addressed that \nspecific issue. As I said earlier, they may have decided that \nprofessional development for their teachers to improve the quality of \nteaching is more important to obtain academic success for the students \nand schools.\n  We always deal with limited budgets. There is not going to be an \nunlimited source of money going into anything we need. The question is \nhow best we spend the money we have. All of us agree that a good, \nquality education is our top national priority. We can't say we are \ngoing to have all the specific programs and we are going to meet every \nneed of every school district because State and local funds still cover \nat least 90 percent--in most States more--of education funding. We are \nnot going to replace that. We shouldn't because we didn't run for this \noffice to be a national school board.\n  The President and the Secretary of Education are men deeply committed \nto education, but they are not good superintendents of schools or \nprincipals or even teachers, in this instance, because they have to \ndeal with all the schools and they can't know all the kids' names.\n  The American public is and should be interested in the debate in \nWashington because they overwhelmingly believe that good education for \nour children is a top priority. But they also know what really matters \nis what goes on in the schools and the classrooms around the country. \nAs much as we like to argue among ourselves, what is said in this \nChamber or even in the other body is not going to drive the education \nof a student or make sure that student is better educated. That depends \nupon a teacher and the school in which that child studies.\n  Individuals on one side of this debate believe that the Olympians on \nthe hill, those of us in Washington with fine titles, those of us with \nnational responsibilities in the Congress or those in the Education \nDepartment, a group of very concerned individuals, know what is best \nfor the folks down in the valley.\n  I happen to be on the side who believe that the great ideas, the \naccomplishments, the successes that are going to make our children \nbetter educated for the future, that are going to help them meet the \nchallenges of this wonderful but challenging century are going to be \nmade by the folks in the valley, the men and women who staff our \nschools, who are the teachers, administrators, superintendents, \nprincipals who run the school boards, and who are the parents who, \nabove all, are the ones with the greatest stake in the education of \ntheir children.\n\n[[Page S4864]]\n\n  I hope this body does not hijack S. 1 and make it into another system \nof categorical grants: Jump through this hoop and you will get some \ndollars. But then you will have to fill out reports and check in with \nWashington to see how you used them, and then you will have to file \nmore reports, or you can jump through this hoop if you make a \nsuccessful application. And if you jump through the right hoops and \nsomebody in Washington agrees that it is OK, then you have to follow up \nwith more reports and redtape and forms and tell them what you did. I \ndon't think that is the way we ought to be going on education.\n  I urge my colleagues, as we look at these amendments before us, to \nask these basic questions: Is this amendment or provision going to \nenable somebody who is teaching children in a school in my State to do \na better job? Is it going to be across the board? Is it going to enable \nevery teacher in every school district? Or is it only going to affect a \nfew school districts, where our priority happens to be that school's \npriority?\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to rethink how we are going in \nterms of setting up too many hoops for schools to jump through. We want \nto see better education, but Federal hoops are not the way to get \nthere.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I commend the Senator for his dedication \nto education. He is a very valuable member of my committee. I have \nlistened carefully to his message, and I thank him.\n  I yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senator from Vermont thanks the Senator \nfrom Vermont for yielding to the Senator from Vermont, and the Senator \nfrom Vermont thanks the Chair for recognizing both Senators from \nVermont.\n  Someday somebody looking through trivia in the Record will try to \nfigure out what the heck that was all about.\n  Mr. President, what is the parliamentary situation? Are there \namendments pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are amendments pending. It would take \nunanimous consent to set them aside.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 424\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n424 be added to the list of those amendments that are now pending. I \nsend the amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy], for Mr. Hatch, for \n     himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Thurmond, and Mr. Kohl, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 424.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment reads as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the establishment of additional Boys and Girls \n                           Clubs of America)\n\n       On page 893, after line 14, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. BOYS AND GIRLS CLUBS OF AMERICA.\n\n       Section 401 of the Economic Espionage Act of 1966 (42 \n     U.S.C. 13751 note) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(2)--\n       (A) by striking ``1,000'' and inserting ``1,200'';\n       (B) by striking ``2,500'' and inserting ``4,000''; and\n       (C) by striking ``December 31, 1999'' and inserting \n     ``December 31, 2006, serving not less than 6,000,000 young \n     people'';\n       (2) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, \n     and 2001'' and inserting ``2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, and \n     2006''; and\n       (B) in paragraph (2)--\n       (i) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by striking \n     ``90 days'' and inserting ``30 days'';\n       (ii) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``1,000'' and \n     inserting ``1,200''; and\n       (iii) in subparagraph (B), by striking ``2,500 Boys and \n     Girls Clubs of America facilities in operation before January \n     1, 2000'' and inserting ``4,000 Boys and Girls Clubs of \n     America facilities in operation before January 1, 2007''; and\n       (3) in subsection (e), by striking paragraph (1) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(1) In general.--There are authorized to be appropriated \n     to carry out this section--\n       ``(A) $60,000,000 for fiscal year 2002;\n       ``(B) $60,000,000 for fiscal year 2003;\n       ``(C) $60,000,000 for fiscal year 2004;\n       ``(D) $60,000,000 for fiscal year 2005; and\n       ``(E) $60,000,000 for fiscal year 2006.''.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, does this become the 12th amendment, or one \non the list on those now pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is on the list of those that are now \npending.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I join with the chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee in offering this amendment. As the Senators know, this \nreauthorizes Department of Justice grants for new Boys and Girls Clubs \nin each of our 50 States.\n  This bipartisan amendment authorizes $60 million in Department of \nJustice grants for each of the next 5 years to establish 1,200 \nadditional Boys and Girls Clubs across the Nation. In fact, this will \nbring the number of Boys and Girls Clubs to 4,000. That means they will \nserve approximately 6 million young people by January 1, 2007.\n  I am very impressed with what I see about the Boys and Girls Clubs as \nI travel around the country. In 1997, I was very proud to join with \nSenator Hatch and others to pass bipartisan legislation to authorize \ngrants by the Department of Justice to fund 2,500 Boys and Girls Clubs \nacross the Nation. We got very strong bipartisan support. We increased \nthe Department of Justice grant funding for the Boys and Girls Clubs \nfrom $20 million in fiscal year 1998 to $60 million in fiscal year \n2001. That is why we have now 2,591 Boys and Girls Clubs in all 50 \nStates and 3.3 million children are served. It is a success story.\n  I hear from parents certainly across my State how valuable it is to \nhave the Boys and Girls Clubs. I hear it also from police chiefs. In \nfact, one police chief told me, rather than giving him a couple more \npolice officers, fund a Boys and Girls Club in his district; it would \nbe more beneficial. This long-term Federal commitment has enabled \nVermonters to establish six Boys and Girls Clubs--in Brattleboro, \nBurlington, Montpelier, Randolph, Rutland, and Vergennes. In fact, I \nbelieve the Vermont Boys and Girls Clubs have received more than a \nmillion dollars from the Department of Justice grants since 1998.\n  Last week at a Vermont town meeting on heroin prevention and \ntreatment, I was honored to present a check for more than $150,000 in \nDepartment of Justice funds to the members of the Burlington club to \ncontinue helping young Vermonters find some constructive alternatives \nfor both their talents and energies, because we know that in Vermont \nand across the Nation Boys and Girls Clubs are proving they are a \ngrowing success at preventing crime and supporting young children.\n  Parents, educators, law enforcement officers, and others know we need \nsafe havens where young people can learn and grow up free from the \ninfluence of the drugs and gangs and crime. That is why the Boys and \nGirls Clubs are so important to our Nation's children. Indeed, the \nsuccess already in Vermont has led to efforts to create nine more clubs \nthroughout my home State. Continued Federal support would be critical \nto these expansion efforts in Vermont and in the other 49 States as \nwell.\n  I was disappointed when the President's budget request called for \neliminating funding for Boys and Girls Clubs from the Department of \nJustice's programs for State and local law enforcement assistance. I \nrealize there was an effort to bring down the budget to compensate for \nwhat has been a very large tax cut, but I think this money should have \nbeen left in. I think the administration makes a mistake in cutting out \nthe money for the Boys and Girls Clubs.\n  In fact, based on last year's appropriations, the failure of the Bush \nadministration to request funding for the Department of Justice grants \nfor Boys and Girls Clubs amounts to a $60 million cut in our Federal \ndrug and crime prevention efforts. I have written to the \nadministration. I hope the President will reconsider this decision. I \nhope he will realize that the Boys and Girls Clubs is not a Democratic \ninitiative or a Republican initiative; this is a commonsense initiative \nthat both parties have endorsed.\n  Those of us who have children or grandchildren know instinctively how \nimportant it is. If we have any doubt, we can just talk to any of the \nparents in the towns or communities where there are Boys and Girls \nClubs; they will tell you how valuable they are. In\n\n[[Page S4865]]\n\nfact, the Boys and Girls Clubs of America are the most successful youth \norganization in the country today, according to the Chronicle of \nPhilanthropy.\n  I worked together on the Senate Judiciary Committee with Attorney \nGeneral Ashcroft, and I applaud him because he is a big booster of the \nBoys and Girls Clubs. He spent a lot of his youth at a club in \nMissouri, he told me.\n  I am hopeful that the Attorney General will also support additional \nDepartment of Justice funding for more Boys and Girls Clubs. He was \nvery helpful to the debate when Senator Harkin and I offered an \namendment to add one-half billion dollars to the Department of Justice \nDepartment in fiscal year 2002 that would fund programs that assist \nState and local law enforcement. Our amendment, the Leahy-Harkin law \nenforcement budget amendment, passed the Senate unanimously. It does \ncontinue funding for the Boys and Girls Clubs and their Department of \nJustice grants.\n  In fact, the budget resolution conference report retained most of the \nfunding increases in the Leahy-Harkin law enforcement amendment.\n  I hope the amendment today to reauthorize the Department of Justice \ngrants to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America will clear the way for \nthe administration to endorse Federal funding for this effort. It is \nsomething on which Senator Hatch and I have joined forces. We want to \ndemonstrate this is not a Liberal, Conservative, Republican, or \nDemocratic effort. It is a commonsense effort because these clubs make \nsuch a real difference in the lives of millions of America's young \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I see others in the Chamber, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This title takes effect 1 day after the date of enactment \n     of this Act.\n\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, for years, the Boy Scouts of America \norganization has been subjected to malicious assaults by some \nhomosexuals and some liberal politicians simply because the Boy Scouts \nof America organization, and many individual scout groups, have \nsteadfastly continued to uphold their moral and decent standards for \nscouting and the leaders of that great organization.\n  I have long admired and supported scouting--its leaders, and the Boy \nScouts themselves. (I was one a long time ago, although we will not \ndiscuss how long ago that was.) In any case, it comes as no surprise to \nme that the Supreme Court properly upheld in June of last year the \nconstitutional rights of the Boy Scouts of America--their rights to \nestablish their own membership guidelines, which included no obligation \nwhatsoever to accept homosexuals as Boy Scout members or leaders.\n  Nor was there any surprise that there came the customary discordant \ncompany of radical militants demanding that this landmark decision of \nthe U.S. Supreme Court be undermined.\n  Mr. President, they never miss a beat, not one--those who demand that \neverybody else's principles must be laid aside in order to protect the \nrights of homosexual conduct, or they go on and on like Tennyson's \nBrook. These radical militants are up to the same old tactics when \ntargeting an honorable and respectable organization, the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica.\n  Where else do you suppose these people are aiming their attacks now? \nThe answer: the public schools of America. School districts across \nAmerica are now being pressured to kick the Boy Scouts of America out \nof federally funded public school facilities. Why and how come, you may \nask. I will tell you. It is because the Boy Scouts will not agree to \nsurrender their first amendment rights, and they will not accept the \nagenda of the radical left in this country.\n  I asked the Congressional Research Service for a report about how \nmany school districts have already taken hostile actions against the \nBoy Scouts of America. The Congressional Research Service reported to \nme that at least nine school districts are known to have publicly \nattacked the Boy Scouts of America, and in the majority of these cases \nthey have done so in an outright rejection of the Supreme Court's \nruling protecting Boy Scouts' rights.\n  One of the more publicized instances occurred in Broward County, FL--\na place which earned some notoriety last fall due to its ballot \nconfusion during the Presidential election. Obviously, Broward County, \nFL, is in another state of confusion: Its school board voted \nunanimously to forbid--get this--forbid the Boy Scouts of America to \nuse the public school facilities for their meetings, as had \nhistorically been the case, unless the Boy Scouts compromised with, \nguess who? That is right: the homosexual leaders of Broward County. \nThankfully, the U.S. district court in Florida intervened at that \npoint, and the court has issued a preliminary injunction prohibiting \nBroward County from moving forward in evicting the Boy Scouts from the \nschool premises.\n  I am obliged to acknowledge that Broward County is not the only \nschool district taking such action. In my own State of North Carolina, \nmembers of the Chapel Hill School District have demanded that the Boy \nScouts of America change their policy (which was upheld, Mr. President, \nyou will remember, by the Supreme Court in June of last year), or the \nChapel Hill School District will send the Boy Scouts packing to find \nanother meeting place. Either do it their way or get out of the school. \nThat is what they are saying in Chapel Hill, NC.\n  Only if they will accept homosexuals as their leaders and fellow \nscouts will these Boy Scouts be allowed to continue their meetings on \nschool property. But those very same meeting places at school remain \nopen for more than 800 Gay-Straight Alliance clubs. These are \nhomosexual school clubs that have been formed with the assistance of \nthe Gay, Lesbian, and Straight Education Network, which is a radical \ngroup committed to promoting immoral lifestyles in the school systems \nof America.\n  With groups such as these welcomed in our public schools, while the \nBoy Scouts are kicked out, schoolchildren need, it seems to me, to have \nthe Boy Scouts stick around, and that is what I want to do with this \nlegislation, if I can, and if the Senate will go along with it.\n  This arrogant discriminatory treatment of Boy Scouts of America must \nnot be allowed to continue, and that is why I am sitting here this \nafternoon offering amendments to reinforce the U.S. Supreme Court's \ndecision upholding the first amendment rights of the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica and not oblige those Boy Scouts to compromise their membership \nor leadership guidelines, nor any of their moral principles.\n  Specifically, the pending first-degree and second-degree amendments \npropose that any public school receiving Federal funds from the \nDepartment of Education must provide the Boy Scouts or youth groups \nsuch as the Boy Scouts equal access to school facilities and must not \ndiscriminate against the Boy Scouts of America by requiring scouts or \nany other youth groups to accept homosexuals as members or as leaders \nor any other individuals who reject the Boy Scouts' oath of allegiance \nto God and country. The penalty for such violation, could constitute \nthe risk of their Federal funding being eliminated.\n\n  This amendment provides the Office of Civil Rights within the \nDepartment of Education the statutory authority to investigate any \ndiscriminatory action taken against The Boy Scouts of America based on \ntheir membership or leadership criteria.\n  In other words, DOE will handle cases of discrimination against the \nBoy Scouts, in the same manner that DOE currently handles other cases \nof discrimination, which are barred by Federal law and may result in \ntermination of Federal funds.\n  For those unfamiliar with the existing process: DOE has given their \nOffice of Civil Rights oversight responsibility over discrimination \ncomplaints. The Office of Civil Rights typically notifies and warns a \nfund recipient--such as a school--to correct its actions or else.\n  However, it should be noted that according to CRS:\n\n       Historically, the fund termination sanction has been \n     infrequently exercised, and most cases are settled at . . . \n     the investigative process. . . .\n\n  Therefore, it's highly unlikely that any school will in fact ever \nhave its funding cut-off; unless it adamantly refuses to provide the \nBoy Scouts of America equal access to school facilities.\n  Mr. President, 70 years ago, I remember raising my hand to take the \nScout Oath. I have it written here but I really do not need it. How \nmany times on Friday night would we stand with our hands up and say:\n\n       On my honor as a Scout, I will do my best to do my duty to \n     God and my country, and to obey the Scout Law. To help other \n     people at all times, to keep myself physically strong, \n     mentally awake, and morally straight.\n\n  Mr. President. I hope the Senate will, as the U.S. Supreme Court has \nalready done, uphold the constitutional rights of the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica to continue to take this oath, meaningfully and sincerely.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the two memoranda, prepared by the \nCongressional Research Service and a legal analysis, which was prepared \nby the American Center for Law and Justice in support of my amendment \non the grounds that it is constitutional--I ask\n\n[[Page S4867]]\n\nthat all of these documents be printed in the Congressional Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nMemorandum to Hon. Jesse Helms from American Law Division, CRS, Mar. 5, \n                                  2001\n\n Federal Civil Rights Enforcement by the Office of Civil Rights of the \n            U.S. Department of Education and Related Matters\n\n       At your request, this memorandum summarizes our recent \n     discussions relative to enforcement by federal administrative \n     agencies--in particular, the Office of Civil Rights (OCR) in \n     the Department of Education--of Title VI of the 1964 Civil \n     Rights Act and other federal statutes prohibiting \n     discrimination in state and local programs receiving federal \n     financial assistance.\n       OCR is responsible for enforcing federal laws barring \n     discrimination based on race, sex, national origin, \n     disability or age in all federal education programs or \n     activities funded by the federal government at the \n     elementary, secondary, or higher educational level. It \n     derives its authority mainly from the following statutory \n     sources: Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which enacted \n     a generic ban on race, color, or national origin \n     discrimination in all federally assisted programs, \n     educational or otherwise; Title IX of the Education \n     Amendments of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the \n     basis of sex in education programs or activities that receive \n     federal financial assistance; Section 504 of the \n     Rehabilitation Act of 1973, banning discrimination because of \n     handicap in all federally funded activities; and the Age \n     Discrimination Act of 1975.\n       Federal agencies were authorized by Title VI to enforce \n     nondiscrimination ``by issuing rules, regulations, and orders \n     of general applicability'' and to secure compliance through \n     imposition of sanctions, which may include the ``termination \n     or refusal to grant or to continue assistance'' to \n     recipients, or by ``any other means authorized by law.'' An \n     early target of Title VI enforcement efforts were segregated \n     ``dual school'' systems in the South, which had resisted the \n     mandate of Brown v. Board of Education to desegregate with \n     ``all deliberate speed.'' The Civil Rights Act enlisted the \n     executive branch--in this case, the former Department of \n     Health Education and Welfare--as an ally of the courts in \n     effectuating compliance with desegregation requirements by \n     means of threatened fund cutoffs. With statutory creation of \n     the Department of Education in 1979, OCR was made the \n     principal entity responsible for administratively enforcing \n     the panoply of federal laws barring discrimination in \n     programs and activities carried on by federally financed \n     schools, school districts, and higher education institutions.\n       OCR enforces the noted statutes by conducting \n     investigations of complaints filed in its ten regional \n     offices or at national headquarters in Washington, or by \n     conducting compliance reviews. Compliance reviews are \n     internally generated and are intended as broad investigations \n     of overall compliance by recipients of Federal financial \n     assistance from the Department of Education. Institutions are \n     targeted for such review by examining information gathered in \n     surveys by OCR and from other sources. The surveys are \n     intended to assist the agency in identifying potential areas \n     of ``system discrimination.'' Upon finding an apparent \n     violation of Title VI or other applicable law, OCR notifies \n     the fund recipient, i.e. the state or local education agency, \n     and must then seek voluntary compliance. If voluntary \n     compliance cannot be secured, OCR may pursue enforcement \n     through fund termination proceedings within the agency or \n     seek compliance by other authorized means. The administrative \n     fund termination process entails notifying the alleged \n     discriminatory entity of the opportunity for hearing before a \n     DOE administrative law judge. Alternatively, and more often \n     the case, the matter may be referred to the Department of \n     Justice (DOJ) with recommendation for appropriate legal \n     action.\n       Historically, the fund termination sanction has been \n     infrequently exercised, and most cases are settled at one of \n     four stages of the investigative process: early complaint \n     resolution; during negotiations prior to a ``letter of \n     finding'' by the agency of a violation, or following such a \n     finding; and at the administrative enforcement stage, when \n     the institution is given a final opportunity to correct any \n     violation found by the ALJ. In addition, litigation \n     instituted by DOJ, on referral from DOE, or by private \n     parties pursuant to an implied right of action has been an \n     important avenue for Title VI enforcement. Although much \n     litigation has concerned public school desegregation, Title \n     VI judicial remedies have also been invoked for claims of \n     discrimination in school disciplinary proceedings, failure to \n     provide bilingual or supplemental instruction for non-English \n     speaking students, student grades and ability grouping, \n     financial aid or scholarship programs.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n                                  ____\n\n\n [Memorandum to Hon. Jesse Helms from American Law Division, CRS, Mar. \n                                6, 2001]\n\n   Actions by Various School Districts Across the Nation to Restrict \n   Access by Local Scouting Organizations to Public School Facilities\n\n       This memorandum responds to your inquiry, and our recent \n     conversation, relative to the above.\n       In Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, the U.S. Supreme Court \n     ruled, by a 5 to 4 vote, that the Boy Scouts have a \n     constitutional right to exclude homosexual members and \n     leaders. Since then, controversies have arisen in Broward \n     County, Florida, New York City, and several other \n     jurisdictions concerning continued local school board support \n     of scouting programs. In Broward County, school authorities \n     reportedly ``evicted 57 Boy Scout troops and Cub Scout packs \n     from school property in December [2000]'' for violating a \n     nondiscrimination clause in their agreement for use of the \n     facilities. The Boy Scouts responded with a federal lawsuit \n     in Miami district court, apparently still pending, which \n     challenges the officials' action as unlawful ``viewpoint \n     discrimination.'' The action claims that the school district \n     violated the Scouts' right to free expression and equal \n     access to public facilities. As we discussed, presumably \n     neither Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act nor Executive \n     Order 13160, issued by former President Clinton, would \n     prohibit denial by local educational agencies of school \n     facilities or services to scouting organizations.\n       A search of the Westlaw all news database revealed that the \n     following state or local educational agencies have taken, or \n     are considering, actions to restrict Boy Scout access to \n     public school facilities since the Supreme Court decision in \n     Boy Scouts of America:\n       Broward County, Fla.: ``Broward County's school board voted \n     unanimously to keep the Boy Scouts of America from using \n     public schools to hold meetings and recruitment drives \n     because of the groups ban on gays.'' 11/16/00 Fla.

Alexandria Women's Health Clinic, 113 S.Ct. \n     753 (1993); United States v. Kokinda, 497 U.S. 720 (1990); \n     Westside Community Schools v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226 (1990); \n     Frisby v. Shultz, 487 U.S. 474 (1988); Board of Airport \n     Commissioners v. Jews for Jesus, 482 U.S. 569 (1987). As \n     reflected by these cases, the ACLJ has a substantial interest \n     in preserving First Amendment freedoms for groups in various \n     speech fora.\n       The Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act (S. 1) is \n     consonant with the Free Speech and Free Association \n     provisions of the First\n\n[[Page S4868]]\n\n     Amendment. The denial of equal access for speech or \n     association by the Boy Scouts in a forum generally open to \n     all other types of speech is unconstitutional viewpoint-based \n     discrimination. See generally, Lamb's Chapel v. Center \n     Moriches Union Free School Dist., 113 S.Ct. 2141 (1993). And, \n     as to this issue in particular, a Federal District Court in \n     Florida has very recently ruled that such discriminatory \n     exclusion of the Boy Scouts from public school facilities was \n     unconstitutional, and enjoined the school district from such \n     further discrimination. See generally, Boy Scouts of America \n     v. Till, Case No. 00-7776-Civ-Middlebrooks-Bandstra (S.D. \n     Fla. Mar. 21, 2001). The Boy Scouts of America Equal Access \n     Act follows in that determination to prevent discrimination \n     and seeks to insure equal and constitutional treatment of \n     youth groups, such as the Boy Scouts, without regard to such \n     organizations oath of allegiance to God and country, or the \n     acceptance of homosexuality.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       The Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act is not only \n     constitutional, the equal access that it seeks to protect is \n     mandated by the Constitution.\n\n\n   exclusion of the boy scouts from an otherwise open forum would be \n              regarded with strict scrutiny by the courts\n\n       When a school district by policy or practice rents its \n     facilities to community groups it has clearly created an open \n     forum and cannot then exclude speech because of its content. \n     As the Supreme Court has said, ``[w]here the State has opened \n     a forum for direct citizen involvement, exclusions bear a \n     heavy burden of justification.'' Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. \n     at 268.\n       When the government excludes speech from an open forum, the \n     government ``must therefore satisfy the standard of review \n     appropriate to content-based exclusions. It must show that \n     its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state \n     interest, and that it is narrowly drawn to achieve that \n     end.'' Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. at 270. See also, Perry, \n     460 U.S. at 45; Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense and \n     Education Fund, 473 U.S. at 800. When an otherwise available \n     public facility has erected a content-based prohibition \n     against religious speech in an open forum, for example, it \n     must justify that burden by showing that it has a compelling \n     governmental interest implemented by the least restrictive \n     means. Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. at 270; accord Adams \n     Outdoor Advertising v. City of Newport News, 373 S.E.2d 917, \n     923 (Va. 1988). Like the City of Hialeah in Church of Lukumi \n     v. City of Hialeah, 113 S. Ct. 2217 (1993), those that would \n     target the Boy Scouts for special disabilities misunderstand \n     that ``the interest given in justification of [such a] \n     restriction is not compelling.'' Lukumi, 113 S.Ct. at 2234. \n     If Establishment Clause concerns were not a compelling reason \n     for the targeted restrictions in Lukumi, then generalized \n     concerns about the Boy Scouts taking a politically incorrect \n     stand on the issue of homosexuality is also not compelling.\n\n\n      EVEN IN A NONPUBLIC FORUM SUCH CONTENT-BASED EXCLUSIONS ARE \n                            UNCONSTITUTIONAL\n\n       The Supreme Court has made it clear that even in the \n     context of a non-public forum, this type of viewpoint-based \n     exclusion is unconstitutional and discriminatory. As the \n     Supreme Court explained in Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense \n     and Educ. Fund. Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 806 (1985), in a non-\n     public forum ``the government violates the First Amendment \n     when it denies access to a speaker solely to suppress the \n     point of view the espouses on an otherwise includible \n     topic.''\n       In Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School \n     Dist., 113 S.Ct. 2141 (1993), the U.S. Supreme Court declared \n     that a religious speech exclusion (which is parallel to the \n     moral viewpoint exclusion here) was unconstitutional \n     viewpoint-based discrimination. The per se exclusion of a \n     certain moral perspective is viewpoint-discriminatory. To \n     make this point clear, the Court in Lamb's Chapel used non-\n     public forum standards to emphasize that even in that context \n     the Center Moriches School District has engaged in \n     unconstitutional viewpoint-based discrimination because of \n     its religious speech exclusion. See e.g., Lamb's Chapel, 113 \n     S.Ct. at 2141.\n       In Lamb's Chapel, the Center Moriches school district \n     allowed dozens of groups to engage in a host of First \n     Amendment expressive activities, but denied a church the \n     right to rent the facilities after school hours to show a \n     film series to adults on child-rearing because of its \n     religious content. Lamb's Chapel, 113 S.Ct. at 2144. In \n     declaring the religious speech ban to be unconstitutional the \n     Court stated:\n       The film involved here no doubt dealt with a subject \n     otherwise permissible under Rule 10, and its exhibition was \n     denied solely because the film dealt with the subject from a \n     religious standpoint. The principle that has emerged from our \n     cases is that the First Amendment forbids the government to \n     regulate speech in ways that favor some viewpoints or ideas \n     at the expense of others.--113 S.Ct. at 2147-48 (emphasis \n     added, citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n       Like the school district in Lamb's Chapel, public school \n     districts afford hundreds of thousands of people the \n     opportunity to express themselves through a myriad assortment \n     of words and phrases. And, as in Lamb's Chapel, the sole \n     rationale for the exclusion of the Boy Scouts is a reliance \n     upon the censorship itself as a justification for such a flat \n     ban. This circular reasoning cannot withstand the strict \n     scrutiny which must applied to such censorship. Such ``overt, \n     viewpoint based discrimination contradicts the Speech Clause \n     of the First Amendment.'' 113 S.Ct. at 2149, (Kennedy, J. \n     concurring).\n       Even if the public school facilities were deemed to be non-\n     public fora, a policy targeting the Boy Scouts for exclusion \n     would fail the governing constitutional test. The Supreme \n     Court has explained that ``[c]ontrol over access to a \n     nonpublic forum can be based on subject matter and speaker \n     identity so long as the distinctions drawn are reasonable in \n     light of the purpose served by the forum and are viewpoint-\n     neutral.'' Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 806 (emphasis added). The \n     Boy Scouts exclusion fails even this deferential standard.\n       There is simply no reasonable basis for the per se \n     exclusion of speech by private actors based upon speech \n     content. Ultimately, some public school districts claim the \n     sheer power to exclude the private speech of the Boy Scouts \n     for no better reason than just because the school district \n     says so. Such an assertion of a stark power to discriminate \n     against a particular group because of its message is \n     incompatible with the Constitution under any standard.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n\n                               CONCLUSION\n\n       The Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act is fully \n     constitutional, and properly exercises Congress power of the \n     purse to insure the constitutionally recognized rights and \n     privileges of all youth groups, like the Boy Scouts, are \n     protected and honored. While it may be that exclusion of the \n     Boy Scouts has become a cause celebre for some since the U.S. \n     Supreme Court's decision in Boy Scouts of America v. Dale, \n     120 S.Ct. 2446 (200), censorship and discrimination are not \n     answers to disagreements over stands on moral issues. The \n     First Amendment specifically permits a variety of viewpoints \n     to be expressed in the marketplace of ideas, without fear of \n     censorship or exclusion.\n       The Boy Scouts of America Equal Access Act bill merely \n     mandates what is constitutionally required. As Boy Scouts of \n     America v. Till clearly illustrates, however, there is a \n     clear and present need for such legislation.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nWisconsin is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator from Wisconsin yield for \na question?\n  Mr. President, I ask consent to be recognized following the remarks \nof the Senator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Helms amendment in two degrees.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask the Helms amendment be temporarily \nlaid aside so I can speak on the bill itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I rise to add my thoughts to this important debate \nabout the proposed annual testing requirements for students in grades \n3-8. This bill that we are debating would require states to implement \nannual testing in reading and math by the 2005-2006 school year; to \ndevelop standards for science and history by the 2005-2006 school year; \nand to implement annual assessments in science for students in grades \n3-8 by the 2007-2008 school year.\n  I commend the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] for his \ncommitment to ensuring that these tests are high in quality and do not \nhave an adverse impact on students, teachers, schools, school \ndistricts, and States. I am pleased to be listed as a cosponsor of a \nnumber of his amendments to this bill to improve its testing \nprovisions.\n  I actually heard a lot about this proposal for testing from the \npeople of Wisconsin, and their response has been almost universally \nnegative. My constituents oppose this proposal for many reasons, \nincluding the cost of developing and implementing additional tests, the \nloss of teaching time every year to prepare for and take the tests, the \nlinking of success on these tests to ESEA administrative funds, and the \npressure that these additional tests will place on students, teachers, \nschools, and school districts.\n  I share my constituents' concerns about this proposed Federal \nmandate. I find it interesting that proponents of the BEST Act say that \nthis bill will return more control to the states and local school \ndistricts. I strongly support local control over our children's day-to-\nday classroom experiences. In my view, however, this massive new \nfederal testing mandate runs counter to the idea of local control.\n  Many States and local school districts around the country already \nhave\n\n[[Page S4869]]\n\ntesting programs in place. We should leave the means and frequency of \nassessment up to the States and local school districts who bear the \nresponsibility for educating our children. Every State and every school \ndistrict is different. A uniform testing policy may, therefore, not be \nthe best approach.\n  I am extremely concerned that this new Federal requirement will teach \nour children that education is not about preparing for their futures, \nbut rather about preparing for tests. That education is really about \nsharp number two pencils and test sheets; about making sure that little \nround bubbles are filled in completely; and--if their school districts \nand states have enough money--maybe about exam booklets for short \nanswer and essay questions.\n  American students are already tested at many levels--in their \nclassrooms, in their schools, in their districts, and in their States.\n  My home state of Wisconsin currently tests students in reading in \ngrade 3 through the Wisconsin Reading Comprehension Test, and in \nreading, language, math, science, and social studies in grades 4, 8, \nand 10 with the Wisconsin Knowledge and Concepts Examinations. \nWisconsin also will require a high school graduation test beginning in \nthe 2003-2004 school year. And this is in addition to regular classroom \ntests and quizzes and tests given at the district level by many of the \n426 school districts in my State. Then, for those students hoping to go \nto college, there is the pre-SAT, the SAT, the ACT and on and on.\n  I know; I have four kids who are just completing all that process, or \nhave in the last couple of years. It is an awful lot of testing \nalready.\n  One of my constituents who is a high school counselor said the high \nschool students in her district spend so much time taking standardized \ntests that the district could award them one-half of a credit for \ntesting. How much testing is worth one-half of a credit? During their 4 \nyears in high school, the students in this district will spend 84 hours \ntaking standardized tests--84 hours. This does not even include regular \nclassroom tests, final exams, or instruction time spent on test \npreparation.\n  According to one teacher who recently contacted me regarding this \nlegislation:\n\n       Already I see that teachers are spending too much time on \n     test preparation rather than good instruction. The test \n     administration itself takes valuable time away from \n     instruction and does not provide new data on individual \n     children for the well informed teacher. . . . [M]ultiple \n     choice tests with some short answer [questions] only measure \n     rudimentary knowledge. They rely on memorizing and \n     regurgitating isolated facts and most items only allow one \n     correct answer. Students are being evaluated on one single \n     test. What if the student has a bad day? Lastly, the truly \n     scary part is that standardized tests ensure that half of our \n     students will always be `below average.' How can we meet the \n     benchmark that everyone will score proficient and advanced \n     when the tests are designed to never let that happen?. . \n     .Taking more tests is not going to improve learning.\n\n  I have heard from many education professionals such as these in my \nstate that this new testing requirement is a waste of money and a waste \nof time. These people are committed to educating the children of my \nstate, and they don't oppose testing. I think we can all agree that \ntesting has its place. What they oppose is the magnitude of testing \nthat is proposed in this bill.\n  One of the biggest concerns I have heard about this program is its \ncost. In my home state of Wisconsin, where the state imposes limits on \nthe amount of money school districts can raise and spend annually, \neducation budgets are already stretched to the breaking point, and \nfederal funding is absolutely critical. And to add a federally-mandated \ntesting program with little in the way of resources to implement it \nwill only compound this problem. I am pleased that the Senate passed an \namendment offered by the Chairman of the HELP Committee, Mr. Jeffords, \nto increase funding for this testing program but I remain concerned \nthis bill still falls far short of authorizing enough funding for this \nprogram.\n  Under the provisions of the BEST Act, Wisconsin would have to develop \nnew reading tests for grades 5, 6, and 7 and new math tests for grades \n3, 5, 6, and 7. According to the Wisconsin Department of Public \nInstruction, the estimated cost to add these additional tests would be \nbetween $2 million and $5.3 million annually, depending on the type of \ntests chosen by the state. And this is over and above the $1.5 million \nthe state already spends on testing in grades 3, 4, and 8. And this \nfigure does not include the cost of the state-mandated Wisconsin \nKnowledge and Concepts Examination for grade 10, which also fulfills \nthe federal requirement to tests students in math and reading at least \nonce between grade 10 and grade 12. And it does not include the cost of \nthe Wisconsin High School Graduation Test. And it does not include the \nadditional cost that the state will have to incur to develop and \nimplement the additional science tests in grades 3, 5, 6, and 7 that \nthis bill requires to begin in the 2007-2008 school year.\n  Teachers in my state are concerned about the amount of time that they \nwill have to spend preparing their students to take the tests and \nadministering the tests. They are concerned that these additional tests \nwill disrupt the flow of education in their classrooms. One teacher \nsaid the preparation for the tests Wisconsin already requires can take \nup to a month, and the administration of the test takes another week. \nThat is five weeks out of the school year. And this bill would require \nteachers to take a huge chunk out of each year in grades 3-8. In my \nview, and in the view of the people of my state, this time can be \nbetter spent on regular classroom instruction.\n  In addition to the financial cost and the instruction time lost, my \nconstituents are concerned about the value of these tests to students, \nparents, and teachers. According to one teacher, the existing tests \ndon't have any meaning to students and have little meaning to classroom \nteachers.\n  The impact of these tests on students varies. Some students have high \ntest anxiety and, as a result, grow to fear tests. Others simply do not \ncare about the tests, and fill in random answers on their test sheets. \nAnd for students who are struggling, a low test score on a standardized \ntest can be demoralizing.\n  Most students, of course, try their best. But they are confused about \nwhy they are taking these tests, and many students and parents are \nconfused by the results of these tests.\n  Many teachers are unsure about how to interpret the test results. \nThey see statistics that tell them about the numbers of right and wrong \nanswers and about percentiles, but the test results provide little in \nthe way of information for teachers and parents to know where students \nare having problems. Because so many standardized tests are copyrighted \nand are used more than once, students, parents, and teachers do not \nhave the opportunity to compare the students' answers to the correct \nanswers. They are unable to determine which concepts the students need \nhelp with, or for which concepts the students have demonstrated \nunderstanding.\n  Our children are real people, not numbers. Yet the testing program \ncontained in this bill would judge our students, teachers, schools, \nschool districts, and states by test scores.\n  In my view, linking funding sanctions to test performance sends the \nwrong signal. As I noted earlier, students respond differently to \ntests. To link education funding to a series of high-stakes tests not \nonly does a disservice to our children, but to our teachers, parents, \nschools, school districts, and states.\n  I also fear that this new annual testing requirement will \ndisproportionately impact disadvantaged students. As the Senator from \nMinnesota, Mr. Wellstone, has said so many times on this floor, we must \nensure that all students have an equality of opportunity to be \nsuccessful in school. To that end, I am pleased that the Senate adopted \nan amendment to this bill offered by the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nDodd, and the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, that would authorize \nfull funding of Title I over the next ten years.\n  I am also pleased to be an original cosponsor of the amendment that \nwill be offered by the Senator from Minnesota which would modify the \nannual testing provisions of the bill to clarify that states will not \nbe required to implement the annual tests unless Title I is funded at \n$24.7 billion by July 1, 2005, which is consistent with the funding \nlevels in the Dodd-Collins amendment.\n  Study after study shows that disadvantaged students lag behind their\n\n[[Page S4870]]\n\npeers on standardized tests. We must ensure that schools have the \nresources to help these students catch up with their peers before \nstudents are required to take these new annual tests. If we fail to \nprovide adequate resources to these schools and these students, we run \nthe risk of setting disadvantaged children up for failure on these \ntests--failure which could damage the self-esteem of our most \nvulnerable students.\n  The issue of standards and testing is addressed in the cover story in \nthe May 2001 issue of Phi Delta Kappan magazine, which is published by \nthe International Association of Professional Educators of the same \nname. In his article, ``Undermining Standards,'' John Merrow discusses \nthe dangers of high-stakes testing, arguing that ``in many places \ntesting has gotten ahead of developing and then implementing \nstandards.'' He also expresses a concern about the impact of testing on \nthe classroom environment and on classroom teachers: that ``test \npreparation is dominating classroom time, stifling creativity and \nimagination, and taking the joy out of teaching.''\n  Merrow also addresses the annual testing program proposed by the \nPresident and included in this bill. He says, ``As I read President \nBush's proposals, it seems to me that . . . about six things can \nhappen, and five of them are bad. Such high-stakes testing may (1) lead \nto an even more arid curriculum, (2) drive away talented teachers, (3) \ntempt states to lower the bar in order not to lose federal money, (4) \nincrease pressure to cheat, and (5) alienate educated parents. That's \nnot `reform with results,' at least not the results those who support \npublic education would wish for.''\n  Merrow continues, ``Of course, the President's plan might actually \nwork the way he hopes it will. That is if he backs away from making \ntest scores the be-all and end-all of schooling, his plan might just \nscare school systems into putting more energy into learning.''\n  As my constituents have told me, this proposal does scare them--but \nnot in the way the President has intended.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to take a few minutes to read this \narticle.\n  I am concerned that the emphasis that is placed on testing as a means \nof accountability in this bill could result in a generation of students \nwho know how to take tests, but who don't have the skills necessary to \nbecome successful adults.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nNorth Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Sessions has asked to be \nrecognized for 2 minutes, I believe to call up an amendment.

I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide for confidential reporting of individuals \n                 suspected of imminent school violence)\n\n       On page 577, line 2, strike the end quotation mark and the \n     second period.\n       On page 577, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 4304. CONFIDENTIAL REPORTING OF INDIVIDUALS SUSPECTED \n                   OF IMMINENT SCHOOL VIOLENCE.\n\n       ``Subject to the provisions of this title and subpart 4 of \n     part B of title V, funds made available under such titles may \n     be used to--\n       ``(1) support the independent State development and \n     operation of confidential, toll-free telephone hotlines that \n     will operate 7 days per week, 24 hours per day, in order to \n     provide students, school officials, and other individuals \n     with the opportunity to report specific threats of imminent \n     school violence or to report other suspicious or criminal \n     conduct by juveniles to appropriate State and local law \n     enforcement entities for investigation;\n       ``(2) ensure proper State training of personnel to answer \n     and respond to telephone calls to hotlines described in \n     paragraph (1);\n       ``(3) assist in the acquisition of technology necessary to \n     enhance the effectiveness of hotlines described in paragraph \n     (1), including the utilization of Internet web-pages or \n     resources;\n       ``(4) enhance State efforts to offer appropriate counseling \n     services to individuals who call hotlines described in \n     paragraph (1) threatening to do harm to themselves or others; \n     and\n       ``(5) further State effort to publicize services offered by \n     the hotlines described in paragraph (1) and to encourage \n     individuals to utilize those services.''.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I simply ask that this amendment be \nconsidered. Its purpose is to deal with the situation that we have seen \nin recent years in which teenagers at school have caused serious \nviolence or committed criminal acts and in which other people knew \nabout it and did little to respond. I believe we can improve upon that.\n  In my State of Alabama, a crisis hotline was set up several years \nago. In just a few weeks, they had 800 calls. For example, parents were \ncalling in to say they heard that a certain child had a gun or a weapon \nor that they were threatening the lives of other people. Having such a \nhotline would allow the police and school administrators to know about \nthose situations and to perhaps intervene and keep this from happening.\n  I think Senator Cleland has some similar language in his legislation. \nOur language goes into more detail and was made part of the juvenile \njustice bill that we passed in this Senate but which never became law.\n  I think it is appropriate that this amendment be made a part of this \nlegislation involving education. It does not appropriate money. It \nprovides an authorized use. The moneys can be used for this, but it \ndoes not mandate it on the States. I do believe it is a policy that if \nmore States followed, it could save lives by simply providing a 1-800 \nnumber that would be readily available to everyone in and about the \nschool, including parents, to have a place to call to express concerns \nthat something serious may be going on.\n  Maybe they just want to say: Billy has a gun. Maybe the police could \nstop by and knock on Billy's door and see if he has a gun and perhaps \nstop a crime.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and the Senator from Nevada.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 640 To Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so I can call up amendment No. 640.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       The Senate Finds:\n       The price of energy has skyrocketed in recent months;\n       The California consumers have seen a 10-fold increase in \n     electricity prices in less than 2 years;\n       Natural gas prices have doubled in some areas, as compared \n     with a year ago;\n       Gasoline prices are close to $2.00 per gallon now and are \n     expected to increase to as much as $3.00 per gallon this \n     summer;\n       Energy companies have seen their profits doubled, tripled, \n     and in some cases even quintupled; and\n       High energy prices are having a detrimental effect on \n     families across the country and threaten economic growth:\n\n     SEC.  . SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING THE NEED TO ESTABLISH \n                   A JOINT COMMITTEE OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF \n                   REPRESENTATIVES TO INVESTIGATE THE RAPIDLY \n                   INCREASING ENERGY PRICES ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND \n                   TO DETERMINE WHAT IS CAUSING THE INCREASES.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that there should be \n     established a joint committee of the Senate and House of \n     Representatives to--\n       (1) study the dramatic increases in energy prices \n     (including increases in the prices of gasoline, natural gas, \n     electricity, and home heating oil);\n       (2) investigate the cause of the increases;\n       (3) make findings of fact; and\n       (4) make such recommendations, including recommendations \n     for legislation and any administrative or other actions, as \n     the joint committee determines to be appropriate.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate \namendment calling for the creation of the House-Senate select committee \nto investigate energy prices.\n  I would like to speak just for a few minutes about the issue. Energy \nprices, as all Americans understand, have been skyrocketing through \nprice spikes and other devices in recent months. The price of gasoline \nin many parts of the country is now over $2 a gallon. Some say it is \ngoing to go much higher.\n  The price of natural gas has doubled in much of the country over what \nit was a year ago. Those who, in the first 2 months of this past \nwinter, suffered the coldest 2 months on record discovered that the \ncost of heating with natural gas put quite a hole in their budget \nbecause natural gas prices were doubled at a time when we had a very \nsignificant cold spell. Natural gas prices are still much higher than \nthey have been previously.\n  Electricity prices are up. In some parts of the country they are way \nup.\n  As all of us know, energy is not some option that people have the \nability to decide to take or not take. Every morning virtually ever \nAmerican has a requirement to use energy. So this is not some optional \ncommodity that people can use or not use as they see fit.\n  Some say, the reason for these price spikes is because that is just \nthe market system working. It is not the market system working. The \nfact is, the market system is broken. In many of these areas, we have \nhad merger after merger of big oil companies, with oil companies \ngetting much larger and, therefore, exhibiting much greater control \nover markets. We see spot markets developing with a new class of energy \ntraders. It is a very large enterprise where they are able to trade \nback and forth, often at prices that are not disclosed or not \ntransparent.\n  Let me, for a minute, discuss what is happening on the West Coast as \npart of this price problem. Two years ago, the cost of power in \nCalifornia was $7 billion. This year it is estimated it will be $70 \nbillion--a tenfold increase. How does all that happen? Well, the price \nof natural gas moving into plants that produce electricity goes from an \nunregulated market into a regulated market; it goes from one seller to \na trader; then traded on the spot market; and an MCF that cost a \ncertain amount in the morning could be double or triple or quadruple \nthat value in the afternoon because it is in someone else's hands, and \nnow it is being traded again for a second time on the spot market.\n  So those folks in California who are paying dramatically higher \nprices for electricity are being hurt very badly. Some say that is just \nthe market working. It is not. As I said before, the market is broken. \nWe are supposed to have, in a circumstance where you have markets with \ngreat concentration of power, a referee of sorts. In this area of \nCalifornia, power would have been FERC, the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission. But FERC, for 2 or 3 years, has done its best imitation of \na potted plant. It essentially has been unwilling to take any action in \nany set of circumstances.\n  So we have the opportunity and the possibility--in fact, in my \njudgment, the very real circumstance--of market manipulation and price \nmanipulation in California and on the West Coast.\n  Gasoline prices, as I indicated, are up, way up. Contrary to the \nviews of the administration, and some others, these price spikes are \nnot due to environmental regulations for reformulated gasoline and \nmore. In fact, reformulated gasoline contributed only 1 to 3 cents of \nthe cost of making gasoline that we witnessed last summer. Even in \nCalifornia, environmental regulations are contributing about 5 to 8 \ncents of gasoline production costs.\n\n  A March 2001 Federal Trade Commission investigation shows that \nindividual refiners made deliberate decisions not to modify or expand \nrefining capacity so they could tighten market supply and therefore \ndrive up gasoline prices.\n  For example, the Federal Trade Commission found that three refiners \nonly modified facilities to produce reformulated gasoline for their own \nbranded stations so the independent stations--the mom-and-pop \nstations--could not get reformulated gasoline. It created a spot market \nwhich drove up prices. One company even admitted to withholding \nsupplies of reformulated gasoline at the most critical time to maximize \nprofits.\n  All of this is going on, and the American people suffer because of \nit. I had once followed a car at an intersection in rural North Dakota \none time. It was a 20-year-old car with a broken back bumper that had a \nbumper sticker that said: We fought the gas war, and gas won. That \nbumper sticker would fit a lot of cars these days.\n  Senior citizens, with declining income years, have to pay \nsubstantially higher energy bills. Farmers, trying to buy anhydrous \nammonia these days--80 percent of the cost of which is natural gas--are \ndiscovering a horrible price for anhydrous ammonia. In addition to \nthat, the price of the fuel they must put in their tractors in order to \ndo spring's work has been driven up dramatically. Truckers moving \nacross this country back and forth have discovered they hardly make it \nthese days with the price of gasoline and diesel fuel. And \nmanufacturers are struggling with the cost of these increased energy \nspikes in price.\n  So if the market isn't working, what should happen? I think we should \nhave a select House-Senate committee to investigate energy prices.\n  Let me hasten to say quickly that there are some legitimate reasons \nwe have had some price changes. We have had a tightening of supply in a \nnumber of areas. I will explain why.\n  When the price of oil went to $10 a barrel, people stopped looking \nfor oil and natural gas because it was not very productive or was not \nvery rewarding to do so. The price of oil spiked then to $35 a barrel--\nfrom $10 a barrel--and more people were looking for it. So there will \nbe more supply coming on line. There is that element of price spikes. \nAnd there is that element of supply and prices. And that is very real. \nI do not discount that.\n  But you cannot attribute what is happening with energy prices just to \nthat circumstance. We now have larger enterprises. We have bigger \neconomic concentrations in this country that have the ability to \ncontrol prices and manipulate supply. And this Congress, in my \njudgment, ought to convene an investigative body to evaluate when and \nwhere that is happening.\n  Congress has been very anxious to investigate almost anything in the \nlast 10 years or so. It seems to me it ought to be anxious to \ninvestigate, on behalf of the American consumer, what has happened, and \nwhy, with respect to the cost of energy in this country.\n  A century ago Teddy Roosevelt carried a big stick and said that Mr. \nRockefeller could not control the price of gasoline and took effective \nsteps to make that happen. It is time for us to do a thorough \ninvestigation with a select House-Senate committee to investigate \nenergy pricing.\n\n[[Page S4872]]\n\n  I know at 4 o'clock the Presiding Officer is to recognize the Senator \nfrom Georgia. Is this an appropriate time to seek the yeas and nays on \nmy amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). The Senator may do that if he \nwishes.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The modified amendment I offer today reduces funding for the National \nCenter for School and Youth Safety from $50 million to $25 million, and \nit creates separate authorizations for the National Center and the Safe \nCommunities, Safe Schools grant program.\n  It has been almost 2 years ago to the day that a 16-year-old boy \nbrought a .22-caliber rifle and .375 magnum revolver to Heritage High \nSchool in Conyers, GA and opened fire on six students. The shooting \noccurred in my hometown of Lithonia, GA, where I grew up. The day was \nMay 20, 1999, exactly one month after the deadly Columbine High School \nmassacre, which took the lives of 15 people.\n  Growing up in my hometown, I was fortunate to have had a great \nchildhood--with two wonderful parents, supportive teachers in school \nand in church, and a community that cared. When I was in school, the \nstrongest drug around was aspirin, and the most lethal weapon was a \nslingshot. The shootings at Heritage High, at Columbine, the school \nshootings in Springfield, OR, in Jonesboro, AR, in West Paducah, KY and \nother school tragedies around the country underscore in red the crisis \nof juvenile violence in America. Our schools were once safe havens in \nthis country. Today, according to data from the Department of \nEducation, they are the setting for one-third of the violence involving \nteenagers in this Nation. In fact, data from the Departments of Justice \nand Education found that in 1998, ``students aged 12 through 18 were \nvictims of more than 2.7 million total crimes at school . . . and they \nwere victims of about 253,000 serious violent crimes. . . .''\n\n[[Page S4873]]\n\n  These statistics are incredible and they cannot--they must not--be \naccepted or tolerated.\n  The amendment I am offering today is based on legislation developed \nin the last Congress by Senator Robb of Virginia, and it is a response \nto a seminal 1998 report by the Department of Education, entitled \n``Early Warning, Timely Response,'' which concluded that the reduction \nand prevention of school violence are best achieved through safety \nplans which involve the entire community. Accordingly to that landmark \nreport, the most effective plans are those which: emphasize both \nprevention and intervention; train school personnel, parents, students, \nand community members to recognize the early warning signs of potential \nviolent behavior and to share their concerns or observations with \ntrained personnel; establish procedures which allow rapid response and \nintervention when such signs are identified; and provide adequate \nsupport and access to services for troubled students.\n  My amendment, The School Safety Enhancement amendment, would \nestablish a National Center for School and Youth Safety tasked with the \nmission of providing schools with adequate resources to prevent \nincidents of violence. Under my amendment, the center would offer \nemergency assistance to local communities to respond to school safety \ncrises, including counseling for victims, assistance to law enforcement \nto address short-term security concerns, and advice on how to enhance \nschool safety, prevent future incidents, and respond to incidents once \nthey occur. My amendment would also establish--and this is important--a \ntoll-free, nationwide hotline for students to report criminal activity, \nthreats of criminal activity, and other high-risk behaviors such as \nsubstance abuse, gang or cult affiliation, depression, or other warning \nsigns of potentially violent behavior. Finally, the National Center for \nSchool and Youth Safety would compile information about the best \npractices in school violence prevention, intervention, and crisis \nmanagement. Specifically, the center would work to ensure that local \ngovernments, school officials, parents, students and law enforcement \nofficials and agencies are aware of the resources, grants, and \nexpertise available to enhance school safety and prevent school crime, \ngiving special attention to providing outreach to rural and \nimpoverished communities.\n\n  In addition, my amendment would boost coordination among the three \nFederal agencies most involved with the crucial issue of school safety \nby authorizing a total of $24 million in grants by the secretaries of \nEducation and Health and Human Services and the Attorney General to \nhelp communities develop community-wide safety programs involving all \nits members: students, parents, educators, counselors, psychologists, \nlaw enforcement officials and agencies, and civic leaders. Grant funds \nmay be used for activities that may include efforts to increase early \nintervention strategies; expand parental involvement; increase \nstudents' awareness of warning signs of violent behavior; promote \nconflict resolution; increase the number of afterschool programs; and \nexpand the use of safety-related equipment and technology.\n  The School Safety Enhancement amendment is endorsed by the National \nEducation Association, the Children's Defense Fund, the International \nBrotherhood of Police Officers and the Georgia Association of Chiefs of \nPolice. On behalf of America's schoolchildren and safety in our \nschools, I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that time under \nthe quorum call be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use. Is \nthe time evenly divided?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is equally divided between the \nSenator from Georgia and an opponent of the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator from Georgia would be good \nenough to yield on his time, I don't know of opposition. We haven't \nbeen notified of the opposition. I want to take a moment to share with \nour colleagues a bit of the background on this amendment. This has been \nsomething that the Senator from Georgia has been interested in and \ncommitted to for some period of time.\n  During the past weeks and months, he has taken the time to speak to \nme on a number of different occasions. He has talked to the members of \nthe Education Committee about this issue. I am familiar with the fact, \ngoing back over a period of time when the Senate considered the \nreauthorization of this legislation previously, over a year ago, that \nthe Senator from Georgia was very much involved in the developing of \nthe legislation. He has read closely, obviously, the Department of \nJustice and Education study, which came out in 1998. In that study, \nthis was one of the very important recommendations that they had. But \nhe has taken a broad recommendation and sharpened it a good deal.\n  I know he has spent a good deal of time talking to those who had \ninitially been involved in recommending the study and has prepared this \nin a way which I think is enormously important and can be incredibly \nhelpful. As I was listening to the good Senator and thinking about the \ntimes he has talked to me about it, I hope we are going to have the \nsufficient resources to be able to deal with this issue. I am convinced \nthat if we can get this started and get to do even part of the things \nthat the good Senator from Georgia has hoped that it would achieve and \naccomplish, we can develop the kind of enhanced support for this \nprogram that is necessary.\n  What the Senator is basically pointing out is the great challenges of \nso many of the young people who are in school, going to school, after \nschool, in a school community, and the kind of violence that is \naffecting these young people. It is a form of intimidation, a form of \nbullying, and it obviously has very important adverse impact on the \nwillingness of children to either go to school or their attitude toward \nschool when violence takes place in the time period after school but in \nthe proximity of the school. He has framed it in a broad way to \nchallenge the center itself to draw on all of the community and \ncommunity resources, which I think is obviously enormously useful. He \nis talking about the entire community, and he is talking about steps \nthat can be taken in terms of prevention and intervention. He is \ntalking to the various school personnel so they will have the training \nwhich too many of them don't have now to be able to anticipate these \nproblems. He is talking about involvement of the students themselves \nand community members in these activities.\n  I can think of a number of different schools in my own city of Boston \nwhere the students themselves have become very much involved in \nassuring safe passage, so to speak, for children to be able to go to \nthe school, while they are at school, and after school. It is a very \nimportant success. This is one of those situations where some guidance, \nsome training, some information in the community can have an enormous \npayoff. I think the result will be a safer climate and an atmosphere in \nwhich the children can learn.\n  I think this is a very well thought through program. He has done a \ngreat deal of work in the fashioning and shaping of it. The security of \nthe children in school we try to address to some extent in the safe and \ndrug-free schools. I can see this as a complement to those efforts as \nwell. I think as a result of this amendment the children in that \ncommunity, as well as teachers and parents, and the whole climate and \natmosphere around schools, which in too many instances, tragically, are \nthreatened, would be made safer and more secure.\n\n  I commend the Senator for his initiative and thank him for his work \nin this\n\n[[Page S4874]]\n\narea, and I indicate that I hope, when the Senate does address this \nissue, we have very strong and overwhelming support.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I want to give people notice that there \nwill be a change in the time of the vote this evening. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the previously scheduled vote begin at 5:45 today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nproceed without the time being charged to either side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 460\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was not here at the time my good \nfriend, the Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid, offered his amendment about \nafterschool literacy programs. This would expand the 21st Century \nCommunity Learning Centers' eligibility to certain organizations to \ninclude projects with an emphasis on language and life skill programs \nfor limited-English-proficient students.\n  I wish to add my support for that program. We had an excellent debate \nlast week when the Senate addressed the issue about increasing support \nfor the limited-English-speaking programs. We pointed out at the start \nof the debate that, under the existing legislation, we were only \nreaching about 25 percent of the children who would need these \nprograms.\n  Then time was taken by the good Senator from Arkansas, myself, and \nothers to point out what has been happening in our school systems with \nlimited-English-speaking students. The number of children has doubled \nin the last 10 years.\n  If one looks at what happened over the next several years, the \nnumbers went up dramatically. This is true with regard to Hispanics, \nbut it is also applicable to other children.\n  I mentioned earlier in the debate my not so recent, several months \nago, visit to Revere High School in Revere, MA, where they have \nchildren speaking 43 languages. The school is involved in 12 to 14 \nlanguage classes and expects to expand in the next few years. It is an \nenormous challenge to schools, but schools are attempting to respond in \nan extraordinary way.\n  Encouraging afterschool programs, encouraging programs in these \nafterschool settings makes a good deal of sense to me. There are a \nvariety of activities in the afterschool programs. In many instances, \nthere are excellent tutorial services, excellent supplementary \nservices. In some areas, there are just athletic programs.\n  There are different programs in each afterschool program. For \nexample, in one I visited recently, they have an excellent program in \nphotography and also a second program in graphic arts. A number of the \nchildren were coming to this afterschool program.\n  The fascination of the children in graphic arts and also in \nphotography was overwhelming. Because children were interested in those \nactivities, they were becoming more interested in their school work as \nwell. It has a symbiotic effect.\n  Senator Reid's amendment makes sure children will also have an \nopportunity for continued training in language in the afterschool \nprograms. If the local jurisdiction chooses to do so, it can utilize \nthe assets they have for that type of activity. It makes a great deal \nof sense to me. The Senator is to be commended for it.\n  We have found that where we have these effective programs, the \nfavorable impact in student achievement has been extraordinary, and \nwhere we do not have these programs, the children have difficulties.\n  This is a continuum of opportunity for children with limited English \ncapability, and it is a wise policy decision. I congratulate the \nSenator for his initiative and hope the Senate will support the \namendment when we have the opportunity to do so.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, with the time to be charged to the \nopposition to the amendment of the Senator from Georgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, how much time is in opposition?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 5 minutes 8 seconds left in \nopposition.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my friend on the floor, the Senator \nfrom Georgia, who is the primary sponsor of this amendment. I now have \nthe excellent study which was the basis of his amendment, ``Early \nWarning, Timely Response: A Guide to Safe Schools.'' I know he is \nfamiliar with this study. One of the conclusions in this excellent \nstudy is that there is valuable information available on recognizing \nthe warning signs of violent behavior; that in dealing effectively with \na school crisis, one of the tragedies is schools have become the \nexperts after they face violence that is destructive and harmful to the \nchildren themselves who are attending these schools.\n  As I understand, one of the principal reasons the Senator is offering \nthe amendment is so that we will have a central clearinghouse available \nto public schools all across the country where the school \nadministrators, teachers, and others with responsibility for security \nwithin the schools can tap into and draw from the experience of other \nschools that have had successful programs.\n  Is this one of the purposes for the amendment?\n  Mr. CLELAND. The Senator is absolutely correct.\n  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his leadership role not \nonly in the area of education and in working with this piece of \nlegislation, but in the area of school safety.\n  The Senator is correct; this report from 1998 that the Senator refers \nto is, quite frankly, shocking to me in the sense that it has indicated \nhow broad based the real question of violence in our schools really is. \nIt indicates to me that we need a broad-based approach.\n  The facts from this report indicate that a third of the violence \ninvolving teenagers in this Nation occurs in our schools. That is \nshocking. It seems to me, then, that the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts is correct that we need this broad-based approach and a \nnational center, a national clearinghouse to make sure that communities \nare in touch with one another.\n  I can testify that the little community of Conyers, GA, not far from \nmy hometown of Lithonia, GA, has within it Heritage High School. That \ncommunity was in shock, in trauma really, for months after the school \nshootings there. The community was wondering what in the world to do, \nwhether to enhance counseling, whether to improve police protection, \nwhether to enforce tighter laws or what.\n  With this center that we are setting up, the National Center for \nSchool and Youth Safety, one call can inform any community that goes \nthrough such a tragedy and such trauma what other communities have done \nand what resources are available to assist them. These are not \nresources just available to schools; these are resources available to \ncounselors and law enforcement agencies.\n  I note that not only are the teachers of America--the National \nEducation Association--behind this legislation, and those who defend \nour children in America--the Children's Defense Fund--but also law \nenforcement is behind this piece of legislation--the International \nBrotherhood of Police Officers and the Chiefs of Police in my own home \nState.\n  I am thrilled with this kind of support, but, again, the Senator is \ncorrect. It was not my idea. This amendment was really the outgrowth of \na report in 1998, issued by the Department of Education, that found, in \ncoordination\n\n[[Page S4875]]\n\nwith the Department of Justice, this incredibly high number of \nincidents of violence. I thought it was incredible that students from \nage 12 to 18 were victims of more than 2.7 million crimes at school and \nthe victims of 253,000 serious violent crimes.\n  When I was growing up in my home community, this level of violence, \nthis level of crime, was unheard of, unthinkable. I can remember our \nhigh school principal articulated a principle that is embodied actually \nin this legislation, that a school cannot live apart from the \ncommunity. So our schools are not just separate oases out there, \nmonasteries that are separate from the community; they reflect what is \ngoing on in the community. That is why our approach isn't just some \nassistance to schools or teachers and counselors; it is assistance to \nlaw enforcement, to community leaders, nonprofit organizations, because \nviolence is that broad bound, and it is not just located in one \nparticular place.\n  The distinguished Senator from Massachusetts is correct. It is one \nreason why we have incorporated immediate access to this center in the \nform of a toll free, nationwide hotline for students to report criminal \nactivity, threats of criminal activity, high-risk behavior such as \nsubstance abuse, gang or cult affiliation, or other warning signs of \npotentially violent behavior.\n  There is a special emphasis, too, on rural and impoverished \ncommunities. Violence knows no boundaries. Our rural and impoverished \ncommunities are just as susceptible to violence as any others.\n  I thank the Senator for his willingness to assist me in this \namendment. I thank him and his staff for the courtesies they have \nexhibited toward us.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I remind the Senate that the study, which \nis the basis for this amendment, is entitled ``Early Warning, Timely \nResponse: A Guide To Safe Schools.'' The study itself was sent out to \nprincipals of schools across the country, but if teachers or parents \nare interested, they can write the Department of Justice or the \nDepartment of Education and get this study. It is also available on \nline as well.\n  I want to mention one quote from Wilmer Cody, Kentucky Commissioner \nof Education:\n\n       Coordinated school efforts can help. But the solution does \n     not just rest in the schools. Together we must develop \n     solutions that are community-wide and coordinated, that \n     include schools, families, courts, law enforcement, community \n     agencies, representatives of the faith community, business, \n     and the broader community.\n\n  I think that is what is unique in the Cleland proposal. It isn't just \nrelying on one aspect of the community; it includes all of those \nelements. It is described in this report. I think it will be a center \nwhich will have information of essential importance to every school in \nthis country. I think every school in the country would be wise to \ncontinue to upgrade their own information because it will be a resource \nthat will explain what is working, what has been effective, what has \nbeen successful.\n  Finally, we have to start by recognizing that schools are safe \nplaces. They are safe places for children. We are all mindful of the \ntragedies, the tragic killings that have taken place, the shootings \nthat have brought such enormous tragedy to the families of people who \nhave been affected by acts of violence.\n  Parents are constantly concerned about how safe their children are \nwhen they go to school every day. But the essential fact is, children \nare safe in their schools. I think people understand that. We \nunderstand that. But we want to make sure they are going to continue to \nbe safe. There are too many instances of violence. The instances that \nhave occurred are a real concern to us. We want to reduce them and make \nthe schools even safer.\n  That is what the amendment of the Senator from Georgia is all about. \nAs I mentioned, I hope those who follow this debate--and it is a \ndifficult debate to follow since we are on this legislation for a few \ndays and then have intervening matters, but nonetheless, I hope they \nwill have the chance to review that study and this amendment. We think \nthis amendment will be an important addition to the bill.\n  I thank the Senator again.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes, I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLevin be added as a cosponsor to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Fitzgerald). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for his \nleadership. I urge the Senate to adopt the amendment.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We will have that chance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 465 To Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the two \npending amendments be temporarily laid aside and I call up amendment \nNo. 465.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone], for himself and \n     Mr. Feingold, proposes an amendment numbered 465 to Amendment \n     No. 358.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment reads as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To improve the provisions relating to assessment completion \n                                bonuses)\n\n       On page 776, strike lines 1 through 5, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(b) Assessment Completion Bonuses.--\n       ``(1) In general.--At the end of school year 2006-2007, the \n     Secretary shall make 1-time bonus payments to States that \n     develop State assessments as required under section \n     1111(b)(3)(F) that are of particularly high quality in terms \n     of assessing the performance of students in grades 3 through \n     8. The Secretary shall make the awards to States that develop \n     assessments that involve up-to-date measures of student \n     performance from multiple sources that assess the range and \n     depth of student knowledge and proficiency in meeting State \n     performance standards, in each academic subject in which the \n     State is required to conduct the assessments.\n       ``(2) Peer review.--In making awards under paragraph (1), \n     the Secretary shall use a peer review process.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment that I have called up--I \ndo it now because I am hoping--and I certainly thank the Senator from \nVermont for his focus on policy last week and his support of an \namendment I had on testing. But this amendment is really simple and \nstraightforward. I thought tonight would be a good time to introduce \nit.\n  Right now, in S. 1, the Secretary can give bonuses to States if they \ncomplete their assessments ahead of the deadline outlined in the law, \nwhich is the 2005-2006 school year.\n  What we are saying in the amendment is that actually what we ought to \ndo is to, instead, give bonuses to States for developing and using \nhigh-quality assessments. That is really where any bonus ought to go.\n  So what this amendment would do is change the bonus grant so the \nrewards would go to States if they develop high-quality assessments as \ndetermined by a peer review process that would be set up by the \nSecretary--that is done all the time--instead of awarding grants to \nStates just because their assessments get done quickly.\n  The point is not whether they are done quickly, the point is to make \nsure this is high-quality assessment. To emphasize the thoughtful \ndevelopment of high-quality assessments, these bonuses would not be \nrewarded until the date at which the new annual testing goes into \neffect.\n  So I want to start out by saying to colleagues that this is very \nconsistent, interestingly enough, with the piece that Secretary Paige \nwrote in the Washington Post this weekend. He writes:\n\n       A good test, the kind the President and I support, is \n     aligned with the curriculum so the schools know whether \n     children are actually learning the material that their States \n     have decided the child should know.\n\n  So I am saying now and what I was saying last week--that I absolutely \nagree and, of course, the majority of my colleagues agreed--is let's \nmake sure we meet the basic criteria that the tests are comprehensive--\nyou don't just have to take off-the-shelf, single standardized test--\nand that the tests\n\n[[Page S4876]]\n\nare coherent, that they are measuring the curriculum being taught, and \nthey are continuous so we can measure the progress of a child over \ntime.\n  Well, I think what Secretary Paige said in his op-ed piece in the \nWashington Post is, yes; we want to make sure that this is high-quality \ntesting. So I was looking at the language in the bill, I say to my \ncolleagues, and I thought, wait a minute, we don't want to have an \nincentive saying that the sooner you do the assessment, the more likely \nyou are to get a bonus because then the incentive is all in the wrong \ndirection.\n  What we really want to say is we do not want people rushing and we do \nnot want people as a result of that rush--and I have heard Senator \nKennedy talk about this more than once--to use off-the-shelf, \nrelatively low level tests. We want to reward States and provide \nbonuses for doing high-quality testing. That is what this amendment is \nabout.\n  I was not here earlier, but I thank my colleague and friend from \nWisconsin, Senator Feingold, who is a cosponsor of this amendment. He \ncame to the Chamber earlier, and I understand he made some very \nthoughtful comments on the general issue of high quality and fair \nassessments, and he also raised some very legitimate questions and \nconcerns about the direction in which we are moving.\n  I could spend a lot of time on this. I do not think I need to draw \nfrom the different reports and studies that have taken place about the \nimportance of getting it right and making sure this is high-quality \ntesting.\n  If we want to get the tests right, then we ought to provide bonuses \nfor States that do the best job. That is really where the bonuses \nshould go.\n  My point is, let us enhance the accountability systems by enhancing \nthe quality of assessments so that we do not make a mistake, and the \nway to do that is to provide incentives for States, bonuses for States \nthat do a high-quality job with high-quality tests.\n  That is what I tried to do last week and this week--and I so \nappreciate the support of the Senators from Massachusetts and Vermont. \nThere will come a point in the debate where I am going to raise the \nphilosophical question--which I do not know I have answered in my own \nmind--as to whether the Federal Government ought to be dictating this \nto States and local school districts. That is the question. We have \ndone it before with title I, but this goes way beyond what we have \ndone.\n  The part of the op-ed piece Secretary Paige wrote with which I do not \nagree is the opening sentence:\n\n       Anyone who opposes annual testing of children is an \n     apologist for a broken system of education that dismisses \n     certain children and classes of children as unteachable.\n\n  My fear is, I say to Senator Jeffords, I thought when we were marking \nup this bill we were saying two things. We were saying yes to \naccountability and we want to do it the right way, and we were also \nsaying yes to making sure there were resources for the tools, for the \nstudents and for the teachers to do well.\n  My concern is, given where we are heading with the budget resolution \nand where we are heading with this tax cut, as a matter of fact, we are \nnot going to have the resources to help students do better. In which \ncase it seems to me a little disingenuous at best and, I frankly argue, \ncruel at worst, to take a fourth grader or a third grader, since we \nstart at age 8, who has been in a school where there have been two or \nthree teachers during the school year--that is not uncommon in some of \nthe inner-city schools, and expect those children to do as well as \nstudents who have had the best teachers and the best opportunities.\n  Low income children do not have the support necessary to do well, \nmost particularly in the area of early childhood education. A child who \ncomes to kindergarten and is way behind other children who had good \nnurturing, stimulation, had the best of early childhood development \neither from their own family or in a really good childcare center the \nparents could afford, has an immeasurable disadvantage. Yet, we will \nbasically say, without any additional help, that we are going to fail \nher.\n  We already know these children are not going to do well. The thing \nSecretary Paige is missing in his piece today is what he testified to \nbefore our committee. He said, yes, we need the resources. I do not see \nthose resources, and I think this will end up not being a good piece of \nlegislation if we do not have both.\n  The two colleagues who are in the Chamber, the Senator from \nMassachusetts and the Senator from Vermont, have made the same point: \nWe need the resources to go with accountability.\n  I have an amendment--I am ready to do it at a good time--that is a \ntrigger amendment--linking the new testing to the funding 79 of us \nvoted for in the Dodd-Collins amendment on fully authorizing title I. \nMy amendment would ensure that there is additional money for reading \nhelp, quality teachers, preschool and afterschool care.\n  All that is going to be a key debate. Right now I am in a pragmatic \nmood, and I am just trying to make sure the testing is done the best \npossible way. Even if I do not end up voting for the bill, I still want \nit to be the best possible bill.\n  I think we ought to provide the bonuses for the high-quality testing. \nIt seems to me a mistake that the bonuses go only to the States that \ndevelop their assessments as quickly as possible. I hope I get support \nfrom my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for what I hope will \nbe an accepted amendment. The administration is offering the bonuses to \nencourage States to move ahead. The Senator has rightfully put his \nfinger on the fact that we want to make sure the tests are not going to \nbe off-the-shelf tests and responding to rote information but are a \nreflection of what the children actually learned and how they think.\n  That is done in a number of States at the present time. The \nadministration wanted to provide encouragement to States to do it. We \nhad, the Senator may remember, in the previous elementary and secondary \neducation title I program, put in a provision encouraging States to do \nit, and only 10 or 12 States actually did it. We provided flexibility \nfor them to do it in the elementary, middle, and then the senior year. \nA number of the States did but most did not.\n  The administration was trying to encourage States to move ahead. I \nsupport that concept, but I absolutely agree with the Senator from \nMinnesota: First, we want to have good tests. We had that debate last \nweek.\n  The bill is strengthened with the amendment of the Senator from \nMinnesota. This is a follow-on that says we want to encourage good \ntests and we want to get it done as early as possible.\n  As I understand, there are 15 States now which have tests between the \nthird and the eighth grade. The basic reviews, the studies that have \nbeen done on those tests, say of the 15, 7 States have very well \ndesigned tests that are generally recognized to meet this criterion to \ntest the children's ability to think and comprehend the information and \nthen be able to respond to challenges using that information in an \neffective way in response to questions. We want to encourage that.\n  It takes time to do tests well. There are a number of steps. We want \ngood tests. We want a good curriculum. We want well-trained teachers. \nThat is what we are trying to do, get well-trained teachers, and we \nhave the provisions in the legislation to do that. We want to get the \ncurriculum formed, and we have provisions in the legislation to do \nthat.\n  We want accountability with tests which we are encouraging, and with \nthe Wellstone amendment we can do that. With the Wellstone amendment \nand the bonuses, this is a very useful and helpful amendment. I am very \nhopeful at the appropriate time we will be able to successfully urge \nSenators to accept this amendment.\n  Senator Wellstone has targeted one area of concern to me and I think \nto many here, and that is to make sure we are going to get good tests \nand not just the off-the-shelf tests which are taught to and really do \nnot reflect the progress all of us want to see in terms of children \nlearning.\n  I thank him very much. We had talked about this concept before, and \nhe has taken the concept and put it into legislative form. I had not \nseen it before. There may be some parts to it--but I cannot spot them--\nthat may be\n\n[[Page S4877]]\n\nof trouble to some of our colleagues, but I hope at the appropriate \ntime we can move ahead and accept the amendment.\n  I thank the Senator for the development of this amendment. This \namendment and the other amendment he had immeasurably strengthen the \nlegislation.\n  I don't want to end this part of the discussion without saying I \nagree with him about the importance of the resources. I am somewhat \nmore hopeful than he is that by the end of the day we are going to be \nable to get them. Maybe it is a false hope. I do not believe it is. But \nI know he will be helping us and doing everything he can to help us get \nthem whenever we can.\n  I know the depth of his own feeling. I respect it, although I might \nhave some difference in the final conclusions he comes to with regard \nto the overall legislation.\n  This is an important amendment. I am hopeful it will be accepted at \nan appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the Senator for his gracious remarks and thank \nhim for his support of this amendment.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 600\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, earlier today I had a followup amendment \n600 that I offered to create a crisis hotline so parents and \nschoolchildren who see a child carrying a weapon or making a serious \nthreat can call on that hotline and something would be done about it \nbecause in the most serious high school violent cases we have had in \nAmerica those children were sending signals in advance and perhaps \nlives have been saved in that regard.\n  I offered the amendment earlier, and I ask unanimous consent to ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But in any event, the objective \nwhich I have sought will be accomplished by the underlying bill, and it \nwould simplify the process if I withdraw the amendment, which I hereby \ndo.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 600\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to make a few remarks on \namendment No. 600, as agreed to.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Go ahead.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. We appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Alabama. \nBut I think we are not quite prepared to offer a consent agreement on \nthe procedures for tomorrow. We are awaiting that agreement. We welcome \nthe Senator's comments on that legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, one of the things we have learned from \nthe shootings in a number of the schools that have traumatized all of \nAmerica is that quite often certain individuals, family, schoolmates, \nor others had reasonable cause to believe that a child might be about \nto commit some serious act of violence. But in each of those cases, no \nreal intervention occurred, and the act of violence was carried out.\n  Back in my hometown of Mobile, AL, we had a problem of children using \nguns and bringing them to school. I was a U.S. Attorney, and we had a \nbig meeting with the district attorney and the sheriff, the juvenile \njudge, the juvenile referee, the Colleagues for Drug Free Mobile, and \nthe Drug Council. We talked about how to deal with it, and we came up \nwith the idea of a bumper sticker that we called ``Kid With A Gun Call \n911.''\n  The police chief said if they received a call from a parent or a \nchild who made a serious allegation that another child was carrying a \nweapon or maybe about to plan something dangerous, the police would \nfollowup on that call. Bumper stickers were put on the police cars, and \nthe message got about town.\n  Later, the State of Alabama adopted a hotline in which they set up \nthe same kind of thing with a centralized 24-hour-a-day center to \nreceive those calls from all over the State. Within 2 weeks of the \nsetting up of that hotline, quite a number of calls were received. I \nthink there were about 400 calls in that short period of time. Many of \nthose came from 5 to 9 o'clock at night and came from parents or \ngrandparents of children who had seen or heard things that troubled \nthem where the kids went to school.\n  I believe a hotline of this kind should be given serious \nconsideration by other States.\n  This legislation will make clear that the funds already appropriated \ncan be used for safe schools and violence prevention, and that creating \na hotline of this type would be a permissible use of that money.\n  A mechanism needs to be set up so that anyone who has a serious cause \nfor concern would know precisely where they could call. They would not \nhave to give their name under most circumstances. Then perhaps \nsomething could be done to intervene in the situation.\n  If, for example, a child comes home and says that down the street in \nthe vacant lot Billy is playing with a gun, and he says he is going to \nshoot somebody, the mother, the grandmother, or somebody at home could \nmake that call. Somebody would come out and check it out. They are not \ngoing to arrest the person if he doesn't have a gun. They are just \ngoing to ask questions about it.\n  Perhaps those kinds of immediate responses and immediate \ninterventions would be effective in reducing the likelihood that a \nchild would actually go and shoot someone. In fact, we could get a lot \nof illegal weapons off the street.\n  I think this is a good approach. It is legislation that we discussed \nin depth when the juvenile justice bill was moving through this Senate \nand passed this Senate, but it never became law. I think that this \nprovision is appropriate for schools. I believe it would be a good \npreventive tool for violence.\n  I thank the Senate and the leaders on both sides for agreeing to \nallow this amendment to be approved and made a part of this bill. I \nhope and pray that this type of intervention may prevent violence and \npossibly save lives.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?

Mr. President, this amendment will encourage young \nteachers to go into early childhood education, encourage further \nlearning and credentialing of early learning educators, and lead to \nbetter education for our nation's youngest children.\n  I am pleased to be joined by Senators Feinstein, Cochran, Baucus, \nLandrieu, Murray and Corzine in offering this amendment.\n  If one asks virtually any scientific expert in human development or \nany mother for that matter--and they will tell you that there is no \nmore important time in a child's life than their earliest years.\n  In terms of priorities, the experiences and learning that fill a \nchild's first years have a critical and decisive impact on the \ndevelopment of the brain and on the nature and extent of their adult \ncapacities--in other words, who they will become as they grow older. \nThat window of opportunity can be impacted by things that are within \nour control.\n  To maximize their potential, we must begin to teach our children the \nnecessary learning skills as early as possible; well before they reach \nkindergarten.\n  There is countless amounts of research and data that shows that by \nfocusing on these earliest years, we can make the greatest difference \nin a child's development and capacity to learn, and I know of few other \nprograms that provide that kind of focus as does Head Start.\n  The amendment that I am offering is designed to encourage currently \nenrolled and incoming college students working on a bachelor's or a \nmaster's degree to pursue a career as a Head Start teacher.\n  In exchange for a 5-year teaching commitment in a qualified Head \nStart program, a college graduate with a minium of a bachelor's degree \ncould receive up to $5,000 in forgiveness for their federal Stafford \nstudent loan.\n  When I was Governor of Ohio, we invested heavily in Head Start, \nincreasing funding from $18 million in 1990, to $180 million in 1998.\n  By the time I left office, there was a space available for every \neligible child in Ohio whose parents wanted them in a Head Start or \npreschool program, and because of our efforts, Ohio led the Nation in \nterms of children served by Head Start. Today, there are 60,000 \nchildren in our Head Start programs.\n  Now that I am in the Senate, I continue to believe that it is \nabsolutely critical that we do more to help our young people prepare to \nbegin school ready to learn.\n  In this regard, I was pleased to work with Senators Jeffords and \nStevens last year to help pass the Early Learning Opportunities Act. \nStill, we must now do more to help those teachers who educate our \nyoungest children.\n  The results of a survey undertaken by the U.S. Department of Health \nand Human Services in 1999 and 2000 has shown a significant correlation \nbetween the quality of education a child receives and the amount of \neducation that child's teacher possesses; that is, the more education a \nteacher has, the more effectively they teach their students cognitive \nskills, the more likely the students are to act upon those skills.\n  Current Federal law requires that 50 percent of all Head Start \nteachers must have an associate, bachelor's, or advanced degree in \nearly childhood education or a related field with teaching experience \nby 2003.\n  Under Ohio law, by 2007, all Head Start teachers must have at least \nan associate's degree. It is hoped that this requirement will encourage \nHead Start educators to pursue a bachelor's or even an advanced degree. \nAfter all, the more education our teachers have, the better off our \nchildren will be. Unfortunately, as we all know, education can be \nexpensive.\n  In Ohio today, only 11.3 percent--242--of the 2,126 Head Start \nteachers employed in the State have a bachelor's degree. Additionally, \nless than 1 percent--20--of Ohio's Head Start teachers have a graduate \ndegree. We must do more to help our teachers afford the education that \nwill be used to help educate our children.\n  If we do not intervene at this critical time in a child's life with \nprograms such as Head Start and the Early Learning Opportunity Act, we \nwill not likely reach our goal of ``no child left behind.'' One of the \nbest uses of our Federal education resources is to target them toward \nour youngest citizens where they can have the most impact.\n  Recruiting and retaining Head Start and early childhood teachers \ncontinues to be a challenge for Ohio and other States.\n  This amendment--which is based on the bill that Senator Feinstein and \nI introduced, the Loan Forgiveness for Head Start Teachers Act, S. 123 \nwill help communities, schools and other Head Start providers to meet \nthe challenge of recruiting and retaining high-quality teachers.\n  It is one of the best ways that I know of where we can make a real \ndifference in the lives of our most precious resource--our children.\n  I am pleased to have been able to work with the National Head Start \nAssociation, the Ohio Head Start Association, and my Senate colleagues \non this legislation. I urge the Members of this Chamber to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of Senate passage of \nthe James Guelff and Chris McCurley Body Armor Act. This bill is named \nafter two police officers who were killed in the line of duty by \ncriminal assailants wearing body armor.\n  I thank Senator Sessions, Senator Hatch, and Senator Leahy, among \nothers, for working so diligently with me to craft and pass this \nbipartisan legislation.\n  I would also like to recognize Lee Guelff, brother of James Guelff, \nas well as the many other individuals who worked tirelessly on behalf \nof this legislation.\n  I introduced this legislation almost six years ago in response to the \ndeath of San Francisco police officer James Guelff. on November 13, \n1994, Officer Guelff responded to a distress call. Upon reaching the \ncrime scene, he was fired upon by a heavily armed suspect who was \nshielded by a kevlar vest and bulletproof helmet. Officer Guelff died \nin the ensuing gunfight.\n\n[[Page S4880]]\n\n  The James Guelff and Chris McCurley Body Armor Act is designed to \ndeter criminals from wearing body armor, and to distribute excess \nFederal body armor to local police.\n  Lee Guelff, brother of Officer James Guelff, wrote to me about the \nneed to revise the laws relating to body armor. He wrote:\n\n       It's bad enough when officers have to face gunmen in \n     possession of superior firepower . . . But to have to \n     confront suspects shielded by equal or better defensive \n     protection as well goes beyond the bounds of acceptable risk \n     for officers and citizens alike. No officer should have to \n     face the same set of deadly circumstances again.\n\n  I strongly agree with Lee.\n  The legislation has three key provisions. First, it directs the U.S. \nSentencing Commission to provide an appropriate sentencing enhancement \nfor any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime in which the \ndefendant used body armor.\n  Second, it makes it unlawful for a person who has been convicted of a \nviolent felony to purchase, own, or posses body armor.\n  It is unconscionable that current laws permit felons to obtain and \nwear body armor without restriction when so many of our police lack \ncomparable protection.\n  Finally, the bill enables Federal law enforcement agencies to donate \nsurplus body armor (approximately 10,000 vests) directly to local and \nstate police departments;\n  Far too many of our local police officers do not have access to body \narmor. The United States Department of Justice estimates that 25% of \nState, local, and tribal law enforcement officers, approximately \n150,000 officers, are not issued body armor.\n  Getting our police officers more body armor will save lives.\n  According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, more than 30% of \nthe 1,200 officers killed by guns in the line of duty since 1980 could \nhave survived if they wore body armor.\n  This bill has the support of organizations representing 500,000 law \nenforcement personnel nationwide including: Fraternal Order of Police; \nNational Association of Police Organizations; National Sheriff's \nAssociation; National Troopers Coalition; International Association of \nPolice Chiefs; Federal Law Enforcement Officers Assn; Police Executive \nResearch Forum; International Brotherhood of Police Officers; Major \ncity Chiefs; and National Assn. Black Law Enforcement Executives.\n  Once again, I commend the Senate for passing this important and long \noverdue legislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 10:30 \na.m. on Tuesday the Senate resume consideration of the Murray amendment \nNo. 378 and there be 120 minutes equally divided in the usual form.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that at 2:20 on Tuesday the Senate \nproceed to a vote in relation to the amendment and no amendments be in \norder to the amendment and there be 5 minutes equally divided for \nclosing remarks prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, with regard to the Sessions amendment, I \nask unanimous consent that the previously agreed to Sessions amendment \nNo. 600 be modified to be drafted to the pending substitute. This is a \ntechnical change. It does not change any of the amendment's legislative \nlanguage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I saw in the newspaper this morning the \nheadline in the Washington Post ``Business Seeks Tax Breaks in Wage \nBill.'' This is a reference to the inevitability that I and others are \ngoing to offer an increase in the minimum wage. This story is a \nreference to what the business lobbying groups are doing in preparation \nfor that particular legislation and how they intend to add additional \nkinds of tax reductions for companies and corporations on that piece of \nlegislation.\n  We have just seen in the Senate last week a tax reduction of $1.35 \nthat is excessive and unfair in terms of its allocation among \nAmericans. A number of us voted in opposition to it. We recognized that \neven in that proposal there wasn't a nickel--not 5 cents--increase for \neducation over the next 10 years--not even a 5-cent increase.\n  We found $1,350,000,000,000 in tax reductions, but we couldn't divert \nany of those resources to education, particularly educating the needy \nchildren on whom this legislation is focused, recognizing that these \nchildren are our future, recognizing that what we are trying to do is \nto give greater support to the children and to get greater \naccountability for the children, the schools, parents, and communities, \nas well, in this legislation.\n  It is good legislation, I support it, but it does need to have the \nresources to be able to have life to it. We didn't get any increase on \nthat.\n  We are going to have a chance to revisit that issue when the Finance \nCommittee reports back in the next few days with their product on the \nallocation of taxes, on who is going to get the tax reductions. Many of \nus will have the opportunity again to present to the Senate: Do we want \nto see the reduction in the highest rates for the wealthiest \nindividuals, or do we want to use that money, which otherwise would go \nback in terms of reduced taxes--do we want to use that money to fund \neducation for children in this country?\n  We will have an opportunity to vote on that several times when the \nbill comes back. The idea that the ink isn't even dry on that \nlegislation and already our Republican friends on the other side are \nlicking their lips, waiting for an increase in the minimum wage, which \nis a target to try to help working families working 40 hours a week, 52 \nweeks of the year, to help them out of poverty.\n  We have the Republican leader Armey saying:\n\n       There is a general resolve, especially among Republicans, \n     that you can't put this kind of disincentive in the \n     employment of people on the lowest rungs into play without \n     trying to compensate for its adverse employment effects.\n\n  In other words, schools are out, and we are going to have a lot more \nbesides the $1.35 trillion in tax reduction, that evidently the \nRepublican leadership is waiting for the Senate and the House to take \naction to increase the minimum wage, hopefully $1.50 over 3 years, with \na 60-, 50-, 40-cent increase in 3 steps, in order to help some of the \nhardest working Americans.\n  This is a question about human dignity. It is a question of whether \nwe are going to say to Americans working at the lowest end of the \neconomic ladder that the work they do is important. What is the work \nthey do? Many of them are teachers' aides. Many of them work in \nchildcare centers. Many of them work as nursing aides. Many of them \nwork in the buildings across this country, cleaning them late at night, \naway from their families. That is what many of these low-income jobs \nare all about. People work hard at them. They sacrifice in order to get \nthem in many instances. We want to say to those workers that when we \nhave had the strongest economy in the history of the Nation, people who \nwork hard should not have to live in poverty.\n  It is interesting to note that over the history of the minimum wage \nwe have increased the minimum wage 17 times. It was only the last time, \nwhen we increased it, which was 4 years ago, and evidently this time, \nthat we have seen the minimum wage loaded up with tax goodies, tax \nbenefits. We didn't do it the previous 17 times. We didn't do that. But \nnow our Republican friends are looking for a vehicle to carry this load \nabout further tax reductions for the wealthy corporations.\n\n  We have had consideration of the tax reduction bill. We have all seen \nthat.\n\n[[Page S4881]]\n\n We have heard it. We have debated it. That has been done. Hopefully, \nthat will be it. Hopefully, we are not going to have another backdoor \ntax reduction here and effectively do it on the backs of our needy \nworkers. I certainly hope not. I understand we might have to make some \nadjustments on this.\n  The last time we had an increase, it was in the $18 to $20 billion \nrange. I found that offensive but nonetheless supportable. But last \nyear our Republican leadership was talking about over $100 billion. I \nwould certainly do everything I could to resist that kind of action \nhere.\n  Let me review briefly what is happening with the minimum wage at the \npresent time. This says: Working hard but losing ground, the declining \nreal value of the minimum wage. If we look at what has happened, in \n1992, we have an increase in the minimum wage. Again, we voted it in \n1996; it went into effect in 1997. What we have seen since that time \nis, now at the year 2000, 2001, we have effectively wiped out the \nincrease, the purchasing value of the increase we had in 1996.\n  What we are talking about is what the red line shows, which would be \nan increase of $1.50, which would bring it up to a purchasing power of \n$6.14, and we are still not even close to what it was from 1968, 1978, \nup to, really, 1980. We are not even close to that.\n  We are talking about the neediest of the needy. Look at this. If we \nlook at what has happened to the minimum wage, we have historically \ntried to have a minimum wage which is going to be half the average \nhourly earnings. That has been the basic kind of reference point. Look \nat what has happened in recent years, how the average hourly earnings \nhave been going up but the purchasing power, the real minimum wage for \nworkers, is falling further and further behind.\n  This is another chart. This reflects: The minimum wage no longer \nsupports a family above the poverty line. This is the real value of \npoverty guidelines and the minimum wage. If you look at what the \npoverty line is, for a family of three at $15,000, if you look at where \nthe minimum wage is, you will see that it is falling further and \nfurther behind the poverty line. The fact is, the poor today continue \nto be poor and are poorer than at any time in the last 40 years.\n  This is our proposal we will be looking at, a minimum wage increase. \nWe will be asking for the 60 cents in 2001, 50 cents in 2002, and 40 \ncents in 2003. This represents the percent of our proposed increase in \nthe minimum wage in relationship to past increases. This is relatively \nsmall. We are talking about a 12-percent increase. We increased it \nabout 12 percent in 1996, in 1991. In 1990, we were higher than in \n1978. We were just about there in 1976, a great deal higher in 1969, \nhigher in 1968. So this is right in the mainstream of increases. A 60-\ncent increase is right in the mainstream; 50 cents is a little below \nthe mainstream, and the final 40 cent increase is down even further.\n  This is what we are going to have before us. I reiterate: This is \nbasically an issue that affects women because the great majority of \nminimum-wage workers are women--the great majority of workers are \nwomen. This is a children's issue because a majority of the women have \nchildren.\n  And so it is their relationship, how the minimum wage worker is going \nto be able to provide for the children in that home. What happens, of \ncourse, is that by and large the mothers have more than one minimum \nwage job; they have two, or even three jobs, in order to provide for \ntheir families. I read with interest the report last week about how \nparents are spending more time with their parents. While that may be \ntrue, I don't know where they find the time and can only imagine at \nwhat price. Low-wage workers are working 416 more hours a year than \nthey did twenty years ago. And studies have shown that in 1996, \nfamilies, on average, had 22 hours a week less to spend with their \nchildren then they did in 1969, because their parents are working \nlonger hours and, in some cases, working two, sometimes even three \njobs.\n  So it is a women's issue, a children's issue. It is a civil rights \nissue because many of the men and women who earn the minimum wage are \nmen and women of color. And, most of all, it is a fairness issue, that \nhere with the strength of our economy, we ought to be able to say that \nin the United States of America, if you work hard, play by the rules, \ntry to bring up children, you should not have to live in poverty.\n  Finally, I point out that the Senate of the United States was quite \nwilling to increase its own salary last year by $3,800. We were glad to \ndo that, but we are unwilling to have an increase in the minimum wage. \nNow we are told that they are going to hold the minimum wage hostage \nunless they get billions and billions and billions and billions more in \ntax breaks for the wealthiest corporations and individuals in America--\nthat is wrong; that is absolutely categorically wrong--and add that on \ntop of the tax breaks they have just had. I mean, how much greed can \nthere be, Mr. President? How much greed can there be, and at the \nexpense of the lowest income working Americans? How much greed can \nthere be?\n  This idea, well, we have to look and see the pressure that this \nprovides in terms of--that it puts on businesses in terms of \nemployment, and the inflation rate, well, I hope we are not going to \nhear much about that. You will hear much about it, but it has been so \ndiscredited, so discredited. We could go back to the times of the last \nincrease in the most recent times--1992, 1997--and I will show you the \nexpansion in the job rate here in this country among every group, \nincluding teenage minorities. We are going to hear a lot that you \nreally don't care about teenage minorities.\n  It is the same people who say I don't care about teenagers who say \nyou are not really interested in health insurance; but if you pass a \nPatients' Bill of Rights, a lot of companies will drop the health \ninsurance and you will get a lot more uninsured, and that is the reason \nI am not voting for it. That is the first time words ever came out of \ntheir mouths about how they are interested in expanding health \ninsurance--when they are opposing the Patients' Bill of Rights.\n  We are going to hear similar arguments, and those arguments have been \ndismissed, shattered, and I understand that we are going to have to pay \na toll because the Republican leadership is going to insist on it. They \ninsisted last year. The price was going to be $100 billion last year--\n$100 billion. The newspaper report today says it is going to be just \nabout that much this year. That is the toll to get through the gate for \nan increase in the minimum wage put on there by the Republican \nleadership.\n  Make no mistake about it. If the Speaker and the majority leader said \nno, it would not be there. It is the second time in the history of the \nminimum wage we are going to have it packaged with tax goodies for the \nwealthiest individuals. The ink is not even dry on the most dramatic \ntax reduction that we have had in recent times, Mr. President, at the \nexpense of other vital priorities. It just doesn't work.\n  Maybe the Republican leadership is able to try to muscle that \nthrough, but they are going to take some time on this and they are \ngoing to have some votes on it. We are going to find out--the American \npeople are--who is on the side of those working families and who is on \nthe side of trying to make sure that we are not going to have a \ngiveaway in terms of these taxes. That would be absolutely wrong.\n  Sooner or later, it is going to come down to which party represents \nyou and stands by you. Well, you are going to find out; you can tell \nwhere those special interests are going to be. They will know who \nstands by them. It is going to be the Republican leadership because \nthey are going to try to add $100 billion more in tax goodies for them. \nBut the workers of America are going to know who stands by them as well \nby the end of this debate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank Senator \nKennedy for his very strong words about the minimum wage. I want him to \ncount me in as a very strong supporter as we bring this legislation to \nthe floor of the Senate. I think the Senator from Massachusetts, in his \nown characteristic strong, proud way, has made it very clear what is at \nstake with this minimum wage legislation. I thank him for his remarks.\n  I will use this opportunity to reinforce some of the comments made by \nmy friend, the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  It is pretty amazing to see a front page story in the Washington \nPost,\n\n[[Page S4882]]\n\n``Business Seeks Tax Breaks in Wage Bill''--I believe I heard the \nSenator from Massachusetts say perhaps to the tune of $100 billion or \nthereabouts.\n  I want to say to Senators, I think this minimum wage bill goes to the \nheart and soul of the question of whether we have a heart and soul as a \nSenate. We are now at $5.15 an hour, and we are talking about trying to \nget this up to $6.15 an hour, then to $6.65 an hour, in increments.\n  I am going to make two or three points. The first is personal, but it \nreally is true. If we are going to vote ourselves a raise of over \n$4,000 a year--Senators make about $140,000-some a year--it seems to me \nwe ought to be able to vote for a raise in the wage of the lowest paid \nworkers. We are talking about people who work 40 hours a week, almost \n52 weeks a year, and they are still poor.\n  I think there is no standard of justice here if we are going to vote \na hefty increase for ourselves--we are handsomely rewarded for our \nwork--and yet are unable to raise the minimum wage for the lowest paid \nworkers.\n  Second, in Minnesota there is a stereotype that it is teenagers \nworking part-time who receive the minimum wage. The fact is, many more \npeople are paid the minimum wage. At the moment--and we will see what \nhappens with the economy, some employers are paying higher wages--many \npeople are working minimum wage, a disproportionate number of them \nwomen. I think it is a matter of elementary justice for women and other \nworking poor people to raise the minimum wage.\n  Finally, it takes some real chutzpah on the part of my colleagues, \nthe Republican leadership, to say the only way you are going to get a \nminimum wage bill through, which speaks to people who are working 52 \nweeks a year and are still poor in America, is to add in all kinds of \ncorporate welfare and breaks for large businesses.\n  Democratic Senators, that is the deal you have to accept. We are \ngoing to bleed the revenue base with these Robin-Hood-in-reverse tax \ncuts that the majority party is trying to push through the Senate this \nweek or next week, with over 40 percent of the benefits going to the \ntop 1 percent, and a pittance, if that, for children, for education. \nWhatever happened to our commitment for affordable prescription drug \ncosts for elderly people? Now, according to this piece, the strategy is \nto load onto a minimum wage bill more corporate welfare and more breaks \nfor large financial interests and economic interests in the country.\n  I think it is transparent. I look forward to the debate. Not that \nlong ago--it seems like just yesterday--we had several weeks' worth of \ndebate about campaign finance reform. There were a variety of different \narguments made. I suggest that our failure to raise the minimum wage is \nall about the need for campaign finance reform. These working poor \npeople, men and women in our States--nobody can say they are not hard \nworking --who cannot support their families, they are the last people \nin the world to be able to hire the lobbyists. They do not have \nlobbying coalitions here. They are the last people in the world to give \nthe big contributions. They are the last people in the world to be the \ninvestors in either political party.\n  But you know what? If you believe it is important for people to earn \na decent standard of living so they can support their families and give \ntheir children the care they know their children need and deserve, then \nwe ought to be willing to support a raise in the minimum wage. It is \njust unbelievable to see in today's Washington Post this story.\n\n  I don't know, maybe I should not be surprised. Frankly, I do not want \nto be dishonest. You never want to be dishonest. I don't want to feign \ntotal shock because I have looked at the greed that is reflected by \nthis tax cut bill that my colleagues want to bring to the floor, and I \nhave looked at who gets the benefits. So I guess I should not be \nsurprised that now what we have is this all-out vigorous opposition to \nraising the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.15 and to $6.65 unless there \nis corporate welfare, unless we do well by all these large economic \ninterests, unless we get yet more tax breaks for them.\n  It is really pretty simple to figure out. When I was a political \nscience professor, was it Harold Lasswell's definition that politics is \nall about who gets what, when, why? That is what this question is \nabout: Who gets what, when, and why?\n  As I would put it as a Senator from Minnesota: Who decides and who \nbenefits and who is asked to sacrifice? Who decides to keep the minimum \nwage so low that there are so many people who are poor still today in \nAmerica?\n  If you are working hard, and, as some of my colleagues have said, \nplaying by the rules of the game, then you shouldn't be poor in \nAmerica. You should be able to support your family.\n  Who decides to keep the minimum wage down? Who decides that instead \nnow we have to load on all kinds of corporate welfare and all kinds of \nadditional tax breaks for large economic interests in the country?\n  I think people in the country are going to focus on this debate. I \nlook forward to joining Senator Kennedy and other Senators.\n  I remember a number of years ago when we first started this debate. I \nam a proud original cosponsor of this legislation. I don't think any of \nthe arguments that have been made about how, if we raise the minimum \nwage, we would see a decline in jobs that turned out to be true. The \nlast time we had a raise in the minimum wage--it was very modest--we \nhad colleagues in the Chamber talking about how people were going to \nlose their jobs. It didn't happen. I would be willing to say that if \nthere is a point at which you raise the minimum wage at too high of a \nlevel you could lose jobs, but it is not going from $5.15 an hour to \n$6.65 an hour.\n  It seems to me Senators are in a fairly awkward situation when we \nvoted ourselves over a $4,000 increase in our already high salary and \nwe are not willing to vote to raise the minimum wage for working poor \nwomen and men in this country from $5.15 an hour to $6.65 an hour so \npeople have a better chance of being able to support their children and \nsupport their families. This is a perfect example of the song that was \nwritten by Florence Reese from Harland County, KY--the song about which \nside you are on. In this particular case, it is, whose side are you on? \nAre you on the side of hard-working people? We all say we are for hard-\nworking people. Or are you on the side of large economic interests? Are \nyou on the side of elementary justice to raise the minimum wage for \nworkers and their families? Or are you going to insist on somewhere in \nthe neighborhood of $100 billion of yet more tax breaks for economic \ninterests so there is even less for children, even less for education, \nand even less for affordable prescription drug costs?\n  I am telling you, my colleagues like to say in the Republican \nmajority that some of these comments are class warfare. And I just have \nto smile because if there ever were an example of ``class warfare'', if \nthat is what you want to call it, it would be a U.S. Senate that is so \ngenerous to itself in giving ourselves big increases in a big salary \nand are unwilling to raise the minimum wage for poor working people in \nour States and in our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/14/senate-section/article/S4882-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4882]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CRAIG M.

Mr. President, on April 29, the Los Angeles Times \nprinted a thoughtful op-ed article by former Costa Rican President \nOscar Arias that raises troubling questions about President Bush's \nnominee to serve as Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere \nAffairs, Otto Reich.\n  President Arias discusses the important role played by the Assistant \nSecretary, and questions Otto Reich's suitability for this position, in \nlight of his record as head of the State Department's Office of Public \nDiplomacy, his support of President Reagan's policies toward Central \nAmerica, his involvement in lifting the ban on the sale of advanced \nweapons to Latin America, and his views on U.S. policy toward Cuba.\n  I urge my colleagues to read the article. The significant concerns \nraised by this distinguished Nobel Peace Prize recipient must be \ncarefully considered. I ask unanimous consent that the article by \nPresident Arias be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Los Angeles Times, April 29, 2001]\n\n                      A Nominee Who Stands for War\n\n                            (By Oscar Arias)\n\n       Given the importance of the role of the U.S. assistant \n     secretary of State for Western Hemisphere affairs, many of us \n     in Latin America are surprised and disappointed by George W. \n     Bush's nomination of Otto J. Reich for this post. Reich \n     headed the Office of Public Diplomacy, which was closed down \n     by Congress in the wake of the Iran-Contra scandal because it \n     had, to quote official investigations, ``engaged in \n     prohibited covert propaganda activities designed to influence \n     the media and the public.''\n       More than almost any other U.S. diplomat, the person in \n     this post will have the power to shape the relationship \n     between the United States and Latin America for better or \n     worse. Virtually everything that the U.S. needs to do with \n     Latin America, from establishing a free-trade area to dealing \n     with drug policy and immigration, will require a bipartisan \n     approach. Appointing someone of Reich's ideological stripe \n     and experience would be a real setback in hemispheric \n     cooperation.\n       I offer my experience as president of Costa Rica as \n     testament to the importance of compromise on hard-line \n     policies. With my region torn by civil wars in Nicaragua, El \n     Salvador and Guatemala, I proposed a peace plan whose essence \n     was democracy as a precondition for lasting peace. The plan \n     was signed by five Central American presidents in August \n     1987, but President Ronald Reagan refused to support it. He \n     would settle for nothing less than military victory over the \n     Sandinistas in Nicaragua. It was not until George Bush became \n     president in 1988 that the United States backed off its \n     dogged support for war and let the Central American leaders \n     give diplomacy a chance. It was Bush the elder and his \n     foreign-policy staff, including Secretary of State James A. \n     Baker and Bernie Aronson, then-assistant secretary of State \n     for inter-American affairs, who changed U.S. policy from one \n     of undermining our efforts to strongly supporting them, and \n     thus contributed greatly to a peaceful solution to the \n     Central American conflicts.\n       I am afraid that Reich will cling more closely to the \n     Reagan model than that of the former Bush administration. \n     There is plenty of evidence to suggest that this will be so. \n     His involvement in the Office of Public Diplomacy until 1986 \n     demonstrated his allegiance to the Reagan administration's \n     hawkish policies toward Central America. The purpose of his \n     office was none other than to get the American people to side \n     with war over peace, using propaganda methods determined to \n     be ``improper.''\n       Reich's support of militarism did not end with the wars in \n     Central America. According to news reports, he has made his \n     living in recent years as a lobbyist and consultant \n     representing corporate interests in Washington, among which \n     is the arms manufacturer Lockheed Martin. Reich apparently \n     helped Lockheed overcome the executive ban on the sale of \n     advanced weaponry to Latin America. As a result, the company \n     is poised to sell a dozen of its F-16 fighter jets with \n     advanced missile technology to Chile.\n       Ever since the ban was lifted in 1997, I have been active, \n     along with former President Jimmy Carter, in trying to \n     convince Latin American leaders to submit to a voluntary \n     moratorium on buying such weapons. If a Latin American \n     country goes shopping for sophisticated weaponry, it will \n     touch off the last thing this hemisphere needs--an arms race. \n     In the face of continued poverty, illiteracy, hunger and \n     disease in so much of our region, investing in unnecessary \n     military technology is an act of grave irresponsibility. That \n     Reich has been an accomplice to this deal makes me feel very \n     uneasy about what ends will be served by his potential \n     leadership in our hemisphere.\n       One last example will illustrate the poor fit that Reich \n     would be for the interests of hemispheric cooperation: his \n     unwavering support for the long-running and unproductive \n     embargo against Cuba. I believe many American farmers and \n     businessmen are aware that U.S. economic warfare against Cuba \n     harms broader U.S. interests, while at the same time injuring \n     the people, but not the government, of Cuba.\n       To those who think it unbecoming for a foreigner to comment \n     on the appointment of a U.S. official, I would say that \n     although the assistant secretary of State for Western \n     Hemisphere affairs will make little difference in the lives \n     of ordinary people in the United States, he could have a \n     profound effect on the lives of Latin Americans.\n       There is so much work to be done in our part of the world \n     over the next four years, and enough inherent problems and \n     strains in the relationship between the United States and \n     Latin America, that we will be assuring ourselves of getting \n     nowhere if we give in to hard-line ideology over flexibility \n     and bipartisanship. On behalf of Latin Americans, I hope that \n     the administration of George W.

I have \nnoted for some time, however, that our defense in depth seems more like \na defense in doubt. I want to be confident that the United States has a \nwell-thought out, overarching national drug control strategy, involving \nall components of both supply and demand reduction, including \neradication and fumigation, alternate development, trade incentives, \ninterdiction, prevention, treatment, and education. I am very pleased \nthe President is ready to appoint the new Director of the Office of \nNational Drug Control Policy, ONDCP, to assist with reviewing our \nplans, programs, and strategy. But I am concerned that we lack coherent \nthinking on our interdiction efforts. I am concerned about rumblings \nfrom the Department of Defense, DOD, that it is going to duck and weave \non supporting such a plan.\n  I desire our interdiction efforts to be integrated and balanced, both \ninteragency and internationally, as well as between the source zone, \ntransit zone, and arrival zones. We need balance, within the transit \nzone, between the Caribbean and the Eastern Pacific, as well as balance \nwith in the eastern, central, and western portions of the Caribbean \nitself. We need to have adequate intelligence community and DOD support \nfor both the source zone and the transit zone. We need to be balanced \nbetween our air and maritime interdiction efforts. We need to be \nequally dynamic and risk adverse as the smuggling organizations are, \nwhen route and conveyance shifts are detected. Our counterdrug forces \non patrol should also be aware of the terrorism threats that are \nincreasing focused against our country. It is not clear to me that we \ncurrently have these things I have outlined.\n  The Senate Drug Caucus is planning an upcoming hearing on the Transit \nzone on May 15, 2001 to discuss the broader questions of ``What is our \ntransit zone strategy?'' and ``Do we have a balanced approach in the \ntransit zone?'' I hope for a discussion on the current threat, agency \ncapabilities, current shortcomings, the relationship with the source \nzone and Plan Colombia, the projected future threat, any needed \nimprovements, interagency and international relationships, and DOD and \nintelligence community support to our transit zone operations. I am \nespecially concerned about reports of aging aircraft and vessels in the \nboth the Customs Service and Coast Guard fleet inventories. I am also \nparticular interested in the countries of Haiti, Jamaica, Cuba, \nVenezuela, Mexico, and the Bahamas, as well as the Commonwealth of \nPuerto Rico. Success in the transit zone is so critical for both the \nUnited States as well as the many countries throughout the Caribbean, \nwho are so dependent on trade and\n\n[[Page S4884]]\n\ntourism, and who struggle to avoid the dark influences of the narcotics \nthreat.\n  I want to be sure we are doing our transit zone missions effectively \nand competently. I appreciate the difficult task of foreign \ninvestigations and interdiction, and appreciate the daily efforts of \nthe Customs Service, Coast Guard, Drug Enforcement Administration, \nDepartment of Defense, Department of State, and our international \nallies. The mission is an important one and deserves our serious \nattention and sustained effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/14/senate-section/article/S4884-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      WTO APPELLATE BODY DECISION\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, two weeks ago, the World Trade \nOrganization's Appellate Body issued a decision affirming a Dispute \nSettlement Panel opinion from last December that ruled that the United \nStates' imposition in July 1999 of restrictions on imports of lamb meat \nunder Section 201 of the Trade Act of 1974 was inconsistent with our \nobligations under the WTO's Agreement on Safeguards. The December Panel \ndecision was so obviously wrong in virtually every respect that one \nwould have expected the Appellate Body to reverse the panel and \nrecognize the U.S. International Trade Commission's decision for the \nwell-reasoned and balanced determination that it was. Instead, the \nAppellate Body has once again taken it upon itself to substitute its \njudgment for the ITC's. This is a continuation of a troubling trend, in \nwhich WTO dispute settlement panels and the Appellate Body fail to give \nadequate deference to expert administrative bodies that have carefully \nreviewed the facts. This kind of decision risks eroding U.S. support \nfor the WTO's dispute settlement procedures.\n  While there is a lot not to like in the Appellate Body's decision, I \nam particularly outraged by the Appellate Body's conclusion that the \nITC erred in concluding that lamb farmers, ranchers, and commercial \nfeeders are properly part of the domestic industry for purposes of \ndetermining injury and threat of injury. The Appellate Body concluded \nthat growers and feeders produce a product--live lambs--that cannot \nstrictly be considered ``like'' lamb meat within the meaning of the WTO \nSafeguards Agreement, and by implication, under Section 201 of the \nTrade Act of 1974; according to the Appellate Body, only packers and \nprocessors produce a ``like'' product. Had this been an antidumping or \ncountervailing duty decision, such a conclusion would have precluded \nlamb growers and feeders from petitioning for relief along with packers \nand processors--a notion that I find intolerable. Fortunately, Section \n201 and the Safeguards Agreement give standing to producers of both \n``like'' and ``directly competitive'' products, and the Appellate \nBody's opinion appears to leave open the possibility that lamb growers \nand feeders could properly be counted as part of the domestic industry \non the grounds that live lambs are ``directly competitive with,'' as \nopposed to ``like,'' lamb meat.\n  The WTO will lose all credibility if growers of agricultural products \nare disqualified from petitioning for relief when massive imports of \nfood products create oversupplies and cause domestic price levels to \nplummet. Thousands of families in my home state have a long history of \nsheep ranching. Sheep ranchers and farmers are the very heart of the \nU.S. industry producing lamb meat, and the WTO needs to recognize such \nbasic economic realities.\n  Predictably, the government of Australia and New Zealand, which \nbrought the WTO appeal, have already called for the United States to \nimmediately terminate the U.S. import relief program in response to the \nAppellate Body's decision. As bad as the Appellate Body's decision is, \nI believe that it is clear that it does not require termination of the \nUnited States' import relief program for the lamb industry. I am today \ncalling on U.S. Trade Representative Robert Zoellick to reject \nAustralia and New Zealand's demands and instead invoke the procedure \nprescribed by Section 129 of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act. \nAmbassador Zoellick should promptly request the ITC to provide him with \nan advisory report on whether it believes that its original decision \ncan be brought into compliance with the Appellate Body's decision. If \nthat advice is affirmative, I hope and expect that Ambassador Zoellick \nwill take the further prescribed step of asking the ITC to issue a \nrevised determination in conformity with the Appellate Body's decision.\n  The period of relief originally proclaimed by President Clinton is \nscheduled to run through July of next year, and I am confident that the \nITC will be able to revise its original determination so that this \nbadly needed relief can run its course. In the meantime, I call upon \nPresident Bush--whose own home state is the United States' largest \nproducer of lamb--to direct USDA and other agencies to redouble their \nefforts to see that the industry gets the full measure of assistance \nthat it was promised as part of the import relief package.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/14/senate-section/article/S4884-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4884-S4885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE SMALL BUSINESS LIABILITY REFORM ACT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last Thursday, Senator Lieberman and I \nintroduced S. 865, the ``Small Business Liability Reform Act,'' which \naims to restore common sense to the way our civil litigation system \ntreats small businesses. In our legal system, small businesses, which \nform the backbone of America's economy, are often forced to defend \nthemselves in court for actions that they did not commit and to pay \ndamages to remedy harms they did not cause. These businesses also \nfrequently find themselves faced with extraordinarily high punitive \ndamages awards. These unfortunate realities threaten the very existence \nof many small businesses, and when American small businesses go under, \nour economy is harmed as new products are not developed, produced, or \nsold, and employers cannot retain employees or hire new ones.\n  Small businesses, those with 25 or fewer full-time employees, employ \nalmost 60 percent of the American workforce. Because the majority of \nsmall business owners earn less than $50,000 a year, they often lack \nthe resources to fight unfair lawsuits which could put them out of \nbusiness. When faced with such a lawsuit, many of these entrepreneurs \nmust either risk a lengthy battle in court, in which they may be \nsubjected to large damage awards, or settle the dispute out of court \nfor a significant amount even though they did not cause the harm in the \nfirst place. Either way, our current system jeopardizes the livelihood \nand futures of small business owners and their employees.\n  The Small Business Liability Reform Act remedies these ills with \nthree common-sense solutions, all of which protect our nation's \nentrepreneurs from unfair lawsuits and excessive damage awards. First, \nit would award punitive damages against small business only upon clear \nand convincing evidence, rather than upon a simple preponderance of \nevidence, and would set reasonable limits, three times the total of all \ndamages or $250,000, whichever is less, on the amount of punitive \ndamages that can be awarded.\n  Second, our bill would restore basic fairness to the law by \neliminating joint and several liability for small businesses for non-\neconomic damages, such as pain and suffering, so a small defendant is \nnot forced to pay for harm he did not cause. Under the current joint \nand several liability, small businesses, when found liable with other \ndefendants, may be forced to pay a disproportionate amount of the \ndamages if they are found to have ``deep pockets'' relative to the \nother responsible parties. For example, a small business who was found \nresponsible for only 10 percent of the harm may have to pay half, two-\nthirds, or even all of the damages if his co-defendants cannot pay. \nAgain, without altering a small business's joint and several liability \nfor economic damages, such as medical expenses, the Small Business \nLiability Reform Act provides that small businesses are responsible for \nonly the portion of the non-economics damages they caused. Thus, the \nbill partially relieves a situation where a small business is left \nholding the bag with respect to injuries it did not inflict.\n  Third and finally, our bill addresses some of the iniquities facing \nnon-manufacturing product sellers. Currently, a person who had nothing \nto do with a defective and harmful product other than selling it can be \nsued along with the manufacturer. Under the reforms in the Small \nBusiness Liability Reform Act, a product seller can only be held\n\n[[Page S4885]]\n\nliable for harms caused by his own negligence, intentional wrongdoing, \nor breach of his own warranty.\n  This bill provides much needed protection and relief to both small \nbusiness owners and consumers. By making our legal system reasonable \nand fair to small businesses, we will remove one of the greatest \nbarriers to the market, the threat of crippling, excessive lawsuits, \nthat prevent entrepreneurs from starting a small business. That means \nincreased competition, better goods, and more jobs at a time when the \nhealth of America's economy and job market appear uncertain. And by \ninjecting common sense into these laws, we will remove the excessive \nlitigation costs that drive up the cost of goods and services for all \nAmericans. The Small Business Liability Reform Act is a win for \nAmerica's entrepreneurs, consumers, and workers, and it is my hope that \nthe Senate will enact this bi-partisan bill. Finally, I would ask \nunanimous consent that letters in support of this bill from the \nNational Federation of Independent Business and the Small Business \nLegal Reform Coalition be placed in the Record.\n                                                    Small Business\n\n\n                                       Legal Reform Coalition,\n\n                                                     May 10, 2001.\n     Hon.

We \n     commend you for your efforts to restore common sense to our \n     civil justice system--one that takes a particularly heavy \n     toll on the smallest of America's businesses.\n       The frequency and high cost of litigation is a matter of \n     growing concern to small businesses across the country. \n     Today's civil justice system presents a significant \n     disincentive to business start-ups and continued operations. \n     If sued, business owners know they have to choose between a \n     long and costly trial or an expensive settlement. Business \n     owners across the nation risk losing their livelihood, their \n     employees and their future every time they are confronted \n     with an unnecessary lawsuit.\n       This legislation would make two reforms that have topped \n     the small business community's agenda for years: cap punitive \n     damages and abolish joint liability for non-economic damages \n     for those with fewer than 25 employees. These reforms have \n     been among the recommendations of the White House Conference \n     on Small Business since the early 1980s--and the time has \n     come to protect the smallest of small businesses from \n     excessive damage awards and frivolous suits.\n       This bill would also hold non-manufacturing product sellers \n     liable in product liability cases when their own wrongful \n     conduct is responsible for the harm and thus reduce the \n     exposure of innocent product sellers, lessors and renters to \n     lawsuits when they are simply present in a product's chain of \n     distribution or solely due to product ownership. Should the \n     manufacturer be judgment-proof, the product seller would be \n     responsible for any damage award, ensuring that deserving \n     claimants recover fully for their injuries.\n       In the end, we believe that enactment of the Small Business \n     Liability Reform Act will inject more fairness into the legal \n     system and reduce unnecessary litigation and legal costs. We \n     also believe that it protects the rights of those with \n     legitimate claims.

Mr. President, although little noticed, a native \nson of Montana passed away at his home in Lafayette, CA.\n  John Winterholler, a three-sport Hall of Famer at the University of \nWyoming was a survivor of the Bataan death march.\n  Winterholler was among the inaugural class inducted into the \nUniversity of Wyoming Athletics Hall of Fame in 1993. He lettered in \nbaseball, basketball, and football from 1936-1939.\n  Upon graduation in 1940, he accepted a commission as a lieutenant in \nthe United States Marine Corps rather than play professional baseball.\n  Winterholler served with the 4th Marine Regiment on Bataan and \nCorregidor in the Philippines and suffered brutal treatment as a \nJapanese prisoner during World War II.\n  During captivity, he experienced severe weight loss and was paralyzed \nfrom the waist down and near death from malnutrition. He was confined \nto a wheelchair the rest of his life.\n  He earned two battlefield decorations, the Silver Star and the Bronze \nStar with ``V'' for valor before Corregidor fell, and he subsequently \nreceived the Purple Heart and 26 other medals and awards for his \nservice in the United States Marine Corps. He retired with the rank of \ncolonel.\n  Although he was born in Billings, MT, he grew up just over the 45th \nparallel which is known as the Montana/Wyoming State line. It was there \nin Lovell, WY, where he met his future wife, Dessa. They both attended \nthe University of Wyoming and were married in 1945 in his hospital room \nat Mare Island Naval Base in Vallejo, CA, shortly after his release \nfrom the Japanese prison camp.\n  He is just another American who has given so much for this country \nand all it stands for. An American that believed in the future of this \ncountry so deeply that he gave all that was asked in her defense. I, \nlike many, give thanks every day for what they sacrificed and their \ndedication.\n  He is survived by a daughter, Deborah Harms; a son, David; a sister, \nLydia Showalter; and three brothers, Henry, Phillip, and \nAlfred.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/14/senate-section/article/S4886-4", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4886-S4887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IN MEMORY OF EDMUND DELANEY\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the \nlate Edmund T. Delaney, an accomplished lawyer, lecturer, historian and \nauthor, and a man that I felt privileged to consider a friend.\n  Ed Delaney graduated from Princeton University in 1933 and Harvard \nLaw School in 1936. He was a gifted attorney who practiced law for over \n40 years in New York and Connecticut. He was a partner in the New \nLondon and Essex firm of Copp, Koletsky and Berall. Ed was a member of \nthe Association of the Bar of the City of New York where he served as \nChairman of the Committees on Corporate Law, Law and Medicine, and Art. \nDuring his career, he specialized in investment company law, serving \nfor 39 years as a director of the Oppenheimer Funds.\n  Ed Delaney was also extremely active in civic and community affairs \nthroughout his professional life, making numerous contributions to his \ncommunity and to the State of Connecticut. He dedicated himself to \nprotecting the region's rich cultural history and natural beauty. The \npreservation of the Connecticut River and the Connecticut River Valley \nwas just one of the causes that he championed through his extensive \nwritings. Ed was a former president of both the Chester Historical \nSociety and the Chester Rotary Club, a trustee of the Connecticut \nWatershed Council, and a member of the Connecticut Historical \nCommission in Hartford. He was also a trustee of the Connecticut River \nMuseum in Essex and he was active in the Rockfall Foundation in \nMiddletown.\n  Long interested in historic preservation and conservation, he was a \nmember of the historical societies of Deep River, Essex, and Lyme, of \nthe Antiques and Landmarks Society, and of the National and Connecticut \nPreservation Trusts and Nature Conservancies. He was also involved in \nChester town affairs as a chairman of the Conservation Commission as a \nmember of the town retirement board, and as a Justice of the Peace. In \naddition, he also served on the Middlesex County Revitalization \nCommission. His contributions to future generations and to the state of \nConnecticut were truly remarkable.\n  Long before he demonstrated his prodigious appetite for community and \ncivic engagement, Ed Delaney amassed a distinguished record of military \nservice. After serving in the Squadron A Cavalry of the New York \nNational Guard, he went on active duty in the field artillery in 1940, \ngraduating from the Field Artillery School at Fort Sill, OK, and \nserving as battery commander in the 105th Field Artillery. In 1941, he \nwas transferred to the Military Intelligence Service as part of the \ngeneral\n\n[[Page S4887]]\n\nstaff in Washington, where he became a lieutenant colonel and chief on \nthe Western European Branch and French Specialist in the War \nDepartment. He accompanied the Assistant Secretary of War, John J. \nMacEloy, on a special mission to North Africa in 1943. In 1945, he \nbecame Acting Counsel to the Army-Navy Liquidation Commission in Paris. \nHe received three War department citations, the Army Commendation \nRibbon, and the French Medaille de la Reconnaissance Francaise.\n  Edmund Delaney was a remarkable man in a great many respects. He was \na distinguished member of the armed services, a successful attorney, \nand an energetic leader in a variety of organizations devoted to \nadvancing the public good. He brought to all of his endeavors an \nunusual depth of insight, compassion and understanding. He was \ndedicated to his family, his friends, his community, and not least, his \ncountry. He was a fine and patriotic man. And he was someone whom I \nrespected and whose ideas I admired.\n  My heartfelt sympathies go out to his wife Barbara, to his children \nand grandchildren, and to his other surviving family members. He will \nbe missed greatly by them, and many others. But there is some comfort \nin knowing that his good deeds have made a lasting impact on the lives \nof those he left behind.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/14/senate-section/article/S4887-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO CRAIG BENSON\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

Mr. President, the ninth of June marks an \nhistoric and important occasion for the Allenhurst Fire Department, its \n100th anniversary. For the past century, a commendable number of \ndedicated volunteer firefighters have risked their lives and sacrificed \ntheir spare time to protect the lives and property of the people of \nAllenhurst. Therefore, it is with great pleasure that I bring these \nindividuals from the great State of New Jersey to your attention.\n  Volunteer firefighters are the great unsung heros of everyday life \nand we often take their diligent efforts for granted. When the fire \nalarm sounds, these devoted individuals put their lives on hold and \nrespond, whether it be a call for assistance or a full-fledged fire, \nthey are on the scene and prepared. Let us not forget that firefighters \nroutinely put themselves in harm's way to protect us. This dedication \nto their community is worthy of only the highest praise.\n  At a time in our Nation when things are in a constant state of \nchange, it is truly refreshing to honor a selfless and noble enterprise \nthat has endured for an entire century. It is appropriate to applaud \nboth the longevity of the Allenhurst Fire Department and the charitable \nacts of courage that have fueled it. I am proud to wish them a very \nhappy 100th anniversary and continued success for many more years to \ncome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/14/senate-section/article/S4887-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              LIEUTENANT GENERAL DANIEL WILLIAM CHRISTMAN\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \noutstanding national service of Lieutenant General Daniel William \nChristman. On June 30, 2001, General Christman will retire upon \ncompletion of a highly successful five-year assignment as the 55th \nSuperintendent of the United States Military Academy in West Point, New \nYork. The Military Academy that General Christman leaves this June is \nnoticeably improved due to his commitment to high standards in \nmilitary, academic, physical and morale development for the cadets.\n  It is only fitting that his final post would be at West Point as, in \n1965, Daniel Christman graduated first in his class thereby beginning \n36 years of illustrious service both in peace and in war to the United \nStates. Over the course of his career, General Christman has served as \nthe nineteenth U.S. Representative to the NATO Military Committee in \nBrussels, Belgium, 1993-94; Commanding General, U.S. Army Engineer \nCenter and Fort Leonard Wood and Commandant, U.S. Army Engineer School, \nFort Leonard Wood, Mo., 1991-93; Commander of the Savannah District, \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Savannah, Ga., 1984-86; Commander of \nthe 54th Engineer Battalion in Wildflecken, Germany 1980-82; Company \nCommander in the 326th Engineer Battalion, Hue, Vietnam, 1969-70; and \nCompany Commander, 2nd engineer Battalion, Changpo-Ri, Korea, 1966.\n  Prior to becoming the Commanding General and the Superintendent of \nthe United States Military Academy, General Christman served as \nAssistant to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) where he \nsupported Secretary of State Warren Christopher as a member of the \nMiddle East Peace Negotiating Team and in arms control negotiations \nwith the Russian Federation. In addition, he has served as Director of \nStrategy, Plans and Policy in Department of Army Headquarters, \nWashington, D.C. His duties in this assignment focused on negotiations \nrelating to the Conventional Forces in Europe, CFE, arms control talks \nbetween NATO and the Warsaw Pact. In the course of supporting these \nnegotiations on behalf of the Chief of Staff of the Army and the \nChairman, JCS, General Christman briefed President George H.W. Bush and \ntraveled to Europe to brief allied heads of state and the NATO \nSecretary General.\n  During the course of his career, General Christman's illustrious \nservice to this country can be exemplified by the honor and decorations \nhe has received, from the Defense Distinguished Service Medal (two \nawards), Distinguished Service Medal, two awards, Defense Superior \nService Medal, Legion of Merit, two awards, Bronze Star Medal, two \nawards, Meritorious Service Medal, two awards and the Air Medal, three \nawards.\n\n  General Daniel William Christman has exemplified the impeccable \nintegrity, honor, and character that the American people have come to \nexpect from the professional Army. As a member of the U.S. Military \nAcademy Board of Visitors, I have valued and appreciated General \nChristman's insight, leadership and commitment to our United States \nArmy. General Christman's service to this nation demonstrates the \nhighest standards and proud traditions of the United States military. \nAs he moves forward in his life, I wish General Christman and his \nfamily continued success and happiness in all his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/14/senate-section/article/S4887-4", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4887-S4888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   IN MEMORY OF ANTOINETTE F. DOWNING\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mrs. \nAntoinette F. Downing.\n  Mrs. Downing, acclaimed architectural historian and founding member \nof the Providence Preservation Society, passed away on Wednesday \nmorning, May 9, 2001 at the age of 96.\n  During her extraordinary lifetime, Antoinette believed in the \nintrinsic value of historic buildings, a revolutionary idea that \nchanged Providence and Rhode Island. Mrs. Downing began her \ndistinguished career as a scholar, researching and recording the \nState's historic structures. In 1937, her book Early Homes of Rhode \nIsland was published, and remains the standard reference on 17th, 18th, \nand early 19th century building in the State. During the\n\n[[Page S4888]]\n\n1930s and 1940s, Mrs. Downing raised a family and taught school. In the \nlate 1940s, she returned to the study of architecture by assisting the \nnewly founded Preservation Society of Newport County with a program to \ndocument and bring attention to the magnificent historic buildings in \nNewport. The effort produced the publication of The Architectural \nHeritage of Newport, Rhode Island, co-authored by Vincent J. Scully, \nJr., in 1952.\n  In the 1950s', Mrs. Downing's scholarship turned into activism in the \nCollege Hill neighborhood of her adopted hometown of Providence, an \narea with many dilapidated and unappreciated historic buildings \nthreatened by plans for demolition. Mrs. Downing and other residents, \ndetermined to maintain the character of this neighborhood, organized \nthe Providence Preservation Society. A report, which she helped to \nresearch and write, College Hill, A Demonstration Study of Historic \nArea Renewal (1959), became the blueprint for the neighborhood's \nrestoration and a national model for using historic preservation as a \nmeans of community renewal.\n  Through her hard work and conviction, Mrs. Downing made historic \npreservation part of every life in Rhode Island. Under her leadership, \nthe Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission's statewide survey \nhas identified about 50,000 historic buildings and sites in Rhode \nIsland's 39 cities and towns. In all, more than 15,000 Rhode Island \nproperties have been listed on the National Register of Historic \nPlaces. Furthermore, the reuse and rehabilitation of historic buildings \nhas become an important part of the state's economy in the last decade.\n  Throughout Antoinette Downing's lifelong work has run the belief that \nour historic districts, structures, and sites are resources worth \nkeeping. Her work has created for our time and coming generations a way \nof connecting to history while building links to the future. We \nremember and thank Antoinette for her tireless efforts to save our \nheritage. We are all the beneficiaries of her visionary \nleadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/14/senate-section/article/S4888-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/14/senate-section/article/S4888-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/14/senate-section/article/S4888-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4888-S4889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, which were referred \nas indicated:\n\n       EC-1787.

A bill to preserve and protect the free choice of individual \nemployees to form, join, or assist labor organizations, or to refrain \nfrom such activities; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. HELMS. Mr. President, I am honored to join my distinguished \ncolleagues, the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. Thurmond, the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, and the Senator from Arkansas, Mr. \nHutchinson, in introducing legislation to protect workers from having \nto pay dues to a labor union simply to keep their jobs. This bill, \nbriefly titled the National Right to Work Act, repeals Federal labor \nlaws allowing union bosses to coerce dues from workers who want to go \nto work, earn honest paychecks and support their families without being \nforced to support a labor organization.\n  The legislation we are introducing today proposes to put an end to \nmore than half a century of Federal labor policy that directly \ncontradicts Thomas Jefferson's famous statement that ``to compel a man \nto furnish contributions of money for the propagation of opinions which \nhe disbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical.''\n  Specifically, the National Right to Work Act proposes the repeal of \nthose sections of the National Labor Relations Act, NLRA, and the \nRailway Labor Act, RLA, that allow unions to enter into collective \nbargaining agreements forcing workers to pay dues as a condition of \nemployment.\n  These so-called ``union security'' clauses have been a central tenet \nof Federal labor law despite interfering with the rights of freedom of \nspeech and association that most Americans take for granted. Under this \nunfair Federal scheme, labor organizations succeeded in creating \nworkplaces where individual workers have two choices: 1. they either \nmust march in lockstep with local union bosses; or 2. they must forfeit \ntheir job.\n  That's clearly not fair, and in response to the excesses of this \nabuse of the free association rights of employees, Congress enacted the \nTaft-Hartley Act in 1947. While this reform bill did not fully right \nthe wrongs of earlier labor legislation, it did grant States the \nability to pass legislation overriding the NLRA regarding union \nsecurity clauses.\n  Since Taft-Hartley freed State legislature to protect workers, 21 \nStates have passed Right to Work laws, and, not surprisingly, these \nStates have reaped the economic benefits associated with a fair and \nfree labor market. In fact, the 21 States that have passed Right to \nWork laws have outperformed non-Right to Work States in job creation, \nreal income, and entrepreneurial growth.\n  But much work remains unfinished. More than 8 million workers in 29 \nnon-Right to Work States must pay dues to a union as a condition of \nemployment, and another 1 million workers in Right to Work States are \nforced to pay dues under the Federal Railway Labor Act, which cannot be \npreempted by State Right to Work laws.\n  Make no mistake, that warms the hearts of union bosses who take \nadvantage of union security clauses to use workers as cash machines. \nThis gives them an endless source of funding for union activities, \nincluding activities not related to collective bargaining activity. The \ngrowing influence unions have on the political process--financed by \ncoerced worker dues--is openly acknowledged. During the past election \ncycle, the AFL-CIO bragged of its plans to spend more than $40 million \non worker-subsidized political activity, nearly all on behalf of \nliberal candidates.\n  These politicians who continue to benefit from the Big Labor cash cow \nhave been successful in protecting the union's ability to coerce money \nfrom their membership. But the American people aren't fooled. For more \nthan 20 years, Americans have consistently told pollsters that they \nbelieve that a requirement to pay union dues as a condition of \nemployment is unfair. In 1997, a Mason-Dixon poll found that 77 percent \nof Americans agreed with the statement that workers should be able to \nkeep their job regardless of whether they belong to unions.\n  They're right, and I hope that this legislation will soon put an end \nto congressional tolerance of forced worker dues. I'm proud to stand \nwith my distinguished colleagues in supporting the National Right to \nWork Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. TORRICELLI:\n  S. 874. A bill to require health plans to include infertility \nbenefits, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce \nlegislation that would greatly improve the lives of millions of \nAmericans, thousands of whom live in my State of New Jersey, who are \ninfertile. The Fair Access to Infertility Treatment and Hope, FAITH, \nAct first introduced during the 106th Congress, will again give hope to \nthose families who have struggled silently for years with the knowledge \nthat they cannot have children.\n  For many American families, the blessing of raising a family is one \nof the most basic human desires. Unfortunately almost fifteen percent \nof all married couples, over six million American families, are unable \nto have children due to infertility.\n  The physical and emotional toll that infertility has on families is \nimpossible\n\n[[Page S4893]]\n\nto ignore. I have heard from a number of men and women from New Jersey \nwho have experienced the pain and trauma of discovering that their \nbodies, which appear normal and function perfectly, are somehow \ndeficient in the one area that matters most to them. This is only \ncompounded when patients discover that their insurer, which they rely \non for all of their critical health needs, refuse to cover treatment \nfor this disease. The deep sense of loss expressed by those who desire \na family as a result of this gap in coverage is real and significant. \nTheir pain should no longer be ignored.\n  Infertility is a treatable disease. New technologies and procedures \nthat have been developed in the past two decades make starting a family \na real possibility for many couples previously unable to conceive. In \nfact, up to two thirds of all married couples who seek infertility \ntreatment are subsequently able to have children.\n  Unfortunately, due to the high cost of treating this illness, only 20 \npercent of infertile couples seek medical treatment each year. Even \nworse, only four out of every ten couples that seek infertility \ntreatment receive coverage from health insurers, and only one quarter \nof all health plans provide coverage for infertility services.\n  My bill will end this inequity by requiring all health insurance \nplans to ensure testing and coverage of infertility treatment. \nSpecifically, FAITH requires health plans to cover all infertility \nprocedures considered non-experimental that are deemed appropriate by \npatient and physician, up to four attempts, with two additional \nattempts provided for those successful couples that desire a second \nchild.\n  One reason often cited by health insurers for their continued refusal \nto provide infertility treatment is the negative impact that this \ncoverage would have on monthly premiums. However, recent studies \ndemonstrate that FAITH would raise the costs of health coverage by as \nlittle as $.21 cents per month per person, an insignificant amount \ncompared to the enormous premium increases we have recently seen from \nHMOs.\n  Similar legislation that recognizes the vital right of families to \ninfertility treatments has already been passed in thirteen states, \nincluding Texas, California, New York, Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, \nMaryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Arkansas, Hawaii, Montana, and \nWest Virginia. In my home state, both branches of the New Jersey \nLegislature recently passed legislation that mandates this coverage.\n  Reproduction is one of the most important values for both men and \nwomen, and those individuals who desire the gift of family should have \naccess to the necessary treatments that make life possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 874\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Access to Infertility \n     Treatment and Hope Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) infertility affects 6,100,000 men and women;\n       (2) infertility is a disease which affects men and women \n     with equal frequency;\n       (3) approximately 1 in 10 couples cannot conceive without \n     medical assistance;\n       (4) recent medical breakthroughs make infertility a \n     treatable disease; and\n       (5) only 25 percent of all health plan sponsors provide \n     coverage for infertility services.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit against income tax for taxpayers owning certain commercial power \ntakeoff vehicles; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, today I rise with my colleague Senator \nEnsign to introduce the Fuel Tax Equalization Credit for Substantial \nPower Takeoff Vehicles Act. This bill upholds a long-held principle in \nthe application of the Federal fuels excise tax, and restores this \nprinciple for certain single engine ``dual-use'' vehicles.\n  This long-held principle is simple: fuel consumed for the purpose of \nmoving vehicles over the road is taxed, while fuel consumed for ``off-\nroad'' purposes is not taxed. The tax is designed to compensate for the \nwear and tear impacts on roads. Fuel used for a non-propulsion ``off-\nroad'' purpose has no impact on the roads. It should not be taxed as if \nit does. This bill is based on this principle, and it remedies a \nproblem created by IRS regulations that control the application of the \nfederal fuels excise tax to ``dual-use'' vehicles.\n  Dual-use vehicles are vehicles that use fuel both to propel the \nvehicle on the road, and also to operate separate, on-board equipment. \nThe two prominent examples of dual-use vehicles are concrete mixers, \nwhich use fuel to rotate the mixing drum, and sanitation trucks, which \nuse fuel to operate the compactor. Both of these trucks move over the \nroad, but at the same time, a substantial portion of their fuel use is \nattributable to the non-propulsion function.\n  The current problem developed because progress in technology has \noutstripped the regulatory process. In the past, dual-use vehicles \ncommonly had two engines. IRS regulations, written in the 1950s, \nspecifically exempt the portion of fuel used by the separate engine \nthat operates special equipment such as a mixing drum or a trash \ncompactor. These IRS regulations reflect the principle that fuel \nconsumed for non-propulsion purposes is not taxed.\n  Today, however, typical dual-use vehicles use only one engine. The \nsingle engine both propels the vehicle over the road and powers the \nnon-propulsion function through ``power takeoff.'' A major reason for \nthe growth of these single-engine, power takeoff vehicles is that they \nuse less fuel. And a major benefit for everyone is that they are better \nfor the environment.\n  Power takeoff was not in widespread use when the IRS regulations were \ndrafted, and the regulations deny an exemption for fuel used in single-\nengine, dual-use vehicles. The IRS defends its distinction between one-\nengine and two-engine vehicles based on possible administrative \nproblems if vehicle owners were permitted to allocate fuel between the \npropulsion and non-propulsion functions.\n  Our bill is designed to address the administrative concerns expressed \nby the IRS, but at the same time, restore tax fairness for dual-use \nvehicles with one engine. The bill does this by establishing an annual \ntax credit available for taxpayers that own a licensed and insured \nconcrete mixer or sanitation truck with a compactor. The amount of the \ncredit is $250 and is a conservative estimate of the excise taxes \nactually paid, based on information compiled on\n\n[[Page S4895]]\n\ntypical sanitation trucks and concrete mixers.\n  In sum, as a fixed income tax credit, no audit or administrative \nissue will arise about the amount of fuel used for the off-road \npurpose. At the same time, the credit provides a rough justice method \nto make sure these taxpayers are not required to pay tax on fuels that \nthey shouldn't be paying. Also, as an income tax credit, the proposal \nwould have no effect on the highway trust fund.\n  I would like to stress that I believe the IRS' interpretation of the \nlaw is not consistent with long-held principles under the tax law, \ndespite their administrative concerns. Quite simply, the law should not \ncondone a situation where taxpayers are required to pay the excise tax \non fuel attributable to non-propulsion functions. This bill corrects an \nunfair tax that should have never been imposed in the first place. I \nurge my colleagues to cosponsor this important piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 875\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Board may also consider \n     suggestions received by the Department of Justice regarding \n     the design of the medal, including those made by persons not \n     employed by the Department.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is taking up \nthe Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor Act, S. 39, which was \nintroduced by Senator Stevens, and its House counterpart, H.R. 802, \nwhich already passed the House of Representatives in March. I am proud \nto be a cosponsor of this important piece of legislation.\n  I congratulate Senator Stevens for introducing the measure and thank \nhim for his leadership. We had worked together on a number of law \nenforcement matters and the senior Senator from Alaska is a stalwart \nsupporter of the men and women who put themselves at risk to protect us \nall. I looked forward to enactment of this measure and to seeing the \nextraordinary heroism of our police, firefighters and correctional \nofficers recognized with the Medal of Valor.\n  On May 18, 1999, I was privileged to be on the floor of the Senate \nwhen we proceeded to consider S. 39 and passed it unanimously. I took \nthat occasion to commend Senator Stevens and all who had worked so hard \nto move this measure in a timely way. That was almost two years ago, \nduring National Police Week of 1999. The measure was sent to the House \nwhere it lay dormant for the rest of the last Congress. That delay was \nmost unfortunate.\n  Again, in this Congress, I have worked with Senator Stevens, Senator \nHatch, and others to prefect the final version of this bill and finally \nget it enacted into law. We have crafted bipartisan improvements to \nensure that the Medal of Valor Board will work effectively and \nefficiently with the National Medal of Valor Office within the \nDepartment of Justice. Our legislation should establish both of these \nentities and it is essential that they work well together to design the \nMedal of Valor and to create the criteria and procedures for \nrecommendations of nominees for the award. The men and women who will \nbe honored by the Medal of Valor for their brave deeds deserve nothing \nless.\n  I look forward to the President signing the Public Safety Officer \nMedal of Valor Act into law.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee substitute be agreed to, the bill be read the third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 39), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/14/senate-section/article/S4897-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4897-S4898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         JAMES GUELFF AND CHRIS McCURLEY BODY ARMOR ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 38, S. 166.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will state the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 166) to limit access to body armor by violent \n     felons and to facilitate the donation of Federal surplus body \n     armor to State and local law enforcement agencies.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the bill, which had been reported \nfrom the Committee on the Judiciary with an amendment to strike all \nafter the enacting clause and insert in lieu thereof the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``James Guelff and Chris \n     McCurley Body Armor Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) nationally, police officers and ordinary citizens are \n     facing increased danger as criminals use more deadly \n     weaponry, body armor, and other sophisticated assault gear;\n\n[[Page S4898]]\n\n       (2) crime at the local level is exacerbated by the \n     interstate movement of body armor and other assault gear;\n       (3) there is a traffic in body armor moving in or otherwise \n     affecting interstate commerce, and existing Federal controls \n     over such traffic do not adequately enable the States to \n     control this traffic within their own borders through the \n     exercise of their police power;\n       (4) recent incidents, such as the murder of San Francisco \n     Police Officer James Guelff by an assailant wearing 2 layers \n     of body armor, a 1997 bank shoot out in north Hollywood, \n     California, between police and 2 heavily armed suspects \n     outfitted in body armor, and the 1997 murder of Captain Chris \n     McCurley of the Etowah County, Alabama Drug Task Force by a \n     drug dealer shielded by protective body armor, demonstrate \n     the serious threat to community safety posed by criminals who \n     wear body armor during the commission of a violent crime;\n       (5) of the approximately 1,200 officers killed in the line \n     of duty since 1980, more than 30 percent could have been \n     saved by body armor, and the risk of dying from gunfire is 14 \n     times higher for an officer without a bulletproof vest;\n       (6) the Department of Justice has estimated that 25 percent \n     of State and local police are not issued body armor;\n       (7) the Federal Government is well-equipped to grant local \n     police departments access to body armor that is no longer \n     needed by Federal agencies; and\n       (8) Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce \n     clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United \n     States, to enact legislation to regulate interstate commerce \n     that affects the integrity and safety of our communities.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Body armor.--The term ``body armor'' means any product \n     sold or offered for sale, in interstate or foreign commerce, \n     as personal protective body covering intended to protect \n     against gunfire, regardless of whether the product is to be \n     worn alone or is sold as a complement to another product or \n     garment.\n       (2) Law enforcement agency.--The term ``law enforcement \n     agency'' means an agency of the United States, a State, or a \n     political subdivision of a State, authorized by law or by a \n     government agency to engage in or supervise the prevention, \n     detection, investigation, or prosecution of any violation of \n     criminal law.\n       (3) Law enforcement officer.--The term ``law enforcement \n     officer'' means any officer, agent, or employee of the United \n     States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, \n     authorized by law or by a government agency to engage in or \n     supervise the prevention, detection, investigation, or \n     prosecution of any violation of criminal law.\n\n     SEC. 4.

DONATION OF FEDERAL SURPLUS BODY ARMOR TO STATE AND \n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section, the terms ``Federal \n     agency'' and ``surplus property'' have the meanings given \n     such terms under section 3 of the Federal Property and \n     Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40 U.S.C. 472).\n       (b) Donation of Body Armor.--Notwithstanding section 203 of \n     the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 \n     (40 U.S.C. 484), the head of a Federal agency may donate body \n     armor directly to any State or local law enforcement agency, \n     if such body armor--\n       (1) is in serviceable condition;\n       (2) is surplus property; and\n       (3) meets or exceeds the requirements of National Institute \n     of Justice Standard 0101.03 (as in effect on the date of \n     enactment of this Act).\n       (c) Notice to Administrator.--The head of a Federal agency \n     who donates body armor under this section shall submit to the \n     Administrator of General Services a written notice \n     identifying the amount of body armor donated and each State \n     or local law enforcement agency that received the body armor.\n       (d) Donation by Certain Officers.--\n       (1) Department of justice.--In the administration of this \n     section with respect to the Department of Justice, in \n     addition to any other officer of the Department of Justice \n     designated by the Attorney General, the following officers \n     may act as the head of a Federal agency:\n       (A) The Administrator of the Drug Enforcement \n     Administration.\n       (B) The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n       (C) The Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization \n     Service.\n       (D) The Director of the United States Marshals Service.\n       (2) Department of the treasury.--In the administration of \n     this section with respect to the Department of the Treasury, \n     in addition to any other officer of the Department of the \n     Treasury designated by the Secretary of the Treasury, the \n     following officers may act as the head of a Federal agency:\n       (A) The Director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and \n     Firearms.\n       (B) The Commissioner of Customs.\n       (C) The Director of the United States Secret Service.\n       (e) No Liability.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the United States shall not be liable for any harm \n     occurring in connection with the use or misuse of any body \n     armor donated under this section.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \ncommittee substitute be agreed to, the bill be read the third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The committee amendment in the nature of a substitute was agreed to.\n  The bill (S. 166), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/14/senate-section/article/S4898-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4898-S4899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n COMMEMORATING AND ACKNOWLEDGING THE DEDICATION AND SACRIFICE MADE BY \n                        LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 39, S. Res. 63.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 63) commemorating and acknowledging \n     the dedication and sacrifice made by the men and women who \n     have lost their lives while serving as law enforcement \n     officers.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to the consideration \nof the resolution.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to be an original cosponsor of \nthis resolution to honor our Federal, State and local law enforcement \nofficers who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our public safety. I \ncommend Senator Campbell for his leadership in submitting Senate \nResolution 63.\n  I want to recognize the other cosponsors of the resolution on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee: Senators Hatch, Kennedy, Thurmond, Biden, \nGrassley, Kohl, DeWine, Feinstein, Sessions, Feingold, Brownback, \nSchumer, McConnell, and Durbin.\n  Since my time as a State prosecutor, I have always taken a keen \ninterest in\n\n[[Page S4899]]\n\nlaw enforcement in Vermont and around the country. Vermont has the \nreputation of being one of the safest States in which to live, work and \nvisit, and rightly so. In no small part, this is due to the hard work \nof those who have sworn to serve and protect us, and we should do what \nwe can to honor them and their families.\n  Our Nation's law enforcement officers put their lives at risk in the \nline of duty everyday. No one knows when danger will appear. \nUnfortunately, in today's violent world, even a traffic stop may not \nnecessarily be ``routine.''\n  Each and every law enforcement officer across the Nation deserves our \nheartfelt respect and appreciation on Peace Officers Memorial Day.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. Res. 63, \nrecognizing the dedication and sacrifice of the men and women who have \nlost their lives while serving as public safety officers.\n  On Sunday, May 13, 2001, in a candlelight vigil, the names of 313 \nofficers, many of whom were lost during the past year, were added to \nthe National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Sadly, every year we \nadd hundreds of names to this Memorial in a fitting honor, but also a \nterribly painful commendation to the people who risk their lives every \nday to protect our communities.\n  Wisconsin owes five officers a special tribute today for their \nservice. I would like to honor them again by placing their names in the \nRecord along with the date of their untimely passing.\n  Sung Hui Bang of Milwaukee County--8/17/2000; Edward R. Hoffman of \nMarinette County--5/26/2000; Frank Moran of Darlington--5/8/1927; Todd \nJeffrey Stamper of Crandon--7/15/2000; Ralph Edward Zylka of Milwaukee \nCounty--8/17/2000.\n  I only hope that these moments of recognition bring some solace to \nthe officers' families and express our appreciation for their service. \nWe are forever in their debt.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, and any statements relating to the \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Res. 63\n\n       Whereas the well-being of all citizens of the United States \n     is preserved and enhanced as a direct result of the vigilance \n     and dedication of law enforcement personnel;\n       Whereas more than 700,000 men and women, at great risk to \n     their personal safety, presently serve their fellow citizens \n     as guardians of peace;\n       Whereas peace officers are on the front line in preserving \n     the right of the children of the United States to receive an \n     education in a crime-free environment, a right that is all \n     too often threatened by the insidious fear caused by violence \n     in schools;\n       Whereas 150 peace officers lost their lives in the line of \n     duty in 2000, and a total of nearly 15,000 men and women \n     serving as peace officers have now made that supreme \n     sacrifice;\n       Whereas every year, 1 in 9 peace officers is assaulted, 1 \n     in 25 peace officers is injured, and 1 in 4,400 peace \n     officers is killed in the line of duty; and\n       Whereas, on May 15, 2001, more than 15,000 peace officers \n     are expected to gather in the Nation's Capital to join with \n     the families of their recently fallen comrades to honor those \n     comrades and all others who went before them: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes May 15, 2001, as Peace Officers Memorial \n     Day, in honor of Federal, State, and local officers killed or \n     disabled in the line of duty; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     this day with appropriate ceremonies and respect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/14/senate-section/article/S4899-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICER MEDAL OF VALOR ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS.
