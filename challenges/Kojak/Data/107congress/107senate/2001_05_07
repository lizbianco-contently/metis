Mr. President, the purpose of my addressing my \ncolleagues today is to question just what kind of energy policy is \nsupportable in this country as a consequence of many of the leading \nopinion makers and newspapers relative to just how we go about \naddressing our energy crisis.\n  It might get the attention of the Chair to recognize that California \nalone, which has received an awful lot of notoriety, clearly has a \ncrisis. It can probably best be addressed by indicating that in 1998 \nCalifornians spent $9 billion for energy--electric energy. In the year \n2000, they spent $20 billion. In the year 2001, it is estimated they \nwill have spent somewhere between $65 and $75 billion. It is not really \nnecessary to say much more. If that is not an acknowledgment of that \nbeing a crisis, I do not know what is.\n  What I find frustrating is the inconsistency of just how we are going \nto get out of this crisis. I refer to an editorial appearing in the \nWashington Post today. It is entitled ``selling the Energy Plan.'' I \nask unanimous consent that the editorial be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S4408]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Selling the Energy Plan\n\n       Soon President Bush will unveil his energy policy, and last \n     week his administration began sounding some of the themes \n     that will be used to sell it. The country faces an energy \n     crisis, officials repeated. ``We're running out of energy in \n     America,'' the president said; both new supplies and \n     conservation are needed because ``we can't conserve our way \n     to energy independence.'' Simple, compelling messages. The \n     only trouble is, they're not exactly right.\n       The problem isn't ``running out of'' resources, it's \n     getting them to the right places at the right time. While \n     many consumers struggle with high bills, there's not a crisis \n     of supply unless you live in California. And America won't \n     reach true energy independence through any combination of \n     production and conservation, at least as long as \n     transportation runs on oil.\n       That's not to say there aren't serious challenges. There \n     are, and meeting them will require hard choices. But it's \n     important to be clear about the critical issues. Those \n     include expanding infrastructure--such as pipelines, \n     transmission lines and refineries--so that electricity and \n     fuel can be produced and delivered when needed. They also \n     include a serious look at how to guard against damaging price \n     spikes or supply interruptions in deregulated energy markets. \n     Currently, one effect of deregulation has been the erosion of \n     incentives for maintaining the extra supply or generating \n     capacity that can cushion against sudden jumps in demand.\n       Along the way, policymakers must be clear-eyed about \n     prices. Protecting against economy-damaging price hikes is \n     one thing; promising an endless supply of cheap energy is \n     another. The energy debate ought to include a hard look at \n     where prices should be to reflect energy's true cost and to \n     encourage responsible use. Any discussion must acknowledge \n     that the world market will continue to set oil prices, no \n     matter what America does to boost domestic supply.\n       It's also worth noting that the energy market is responding \n     already. Natural gas drilling increased last year. Vice \n     President Cheney noted this past week that growing \n     electricity demand will require the equivalent of 1,300 to \n     1,900 new power plants during the next two decades; power \n     suppliers already have reported to the Energy Department \n     plans to add more than 40 percent of that capacity between \n     now and 2005. For the short term, as President Bush \n     acknowledged last week in ordering federal energy use cut in \n     California, conservation can ease the pinch between supply \n     and demand.\n       However, conservation and increased efficiency are also \n     critical components of any long-term policy. They can \n     contribute much more than the administration has so far been \n     inclined to admit. Candor must be part of the discussion. The \n     issues are complex and call for balanced and wide-ranging \n     solutions; one way to get them is to avoid over-simplifying \n     the debate at the start.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I agree with a good deal of the editorial's comments \nrelative to the fact the energy crisis is upon us. They indicate we \ncannot conserve our way to energy independence, and I agree with that. \nBut what I find a little bit inconsistent is the reference that somehow \nwe are going to have to interject some kind of Government control on \nprices. Now, they did not go into a great deal of detail suggesting \nthat we increase supply and that the traditional increase of supply \nshould take care of the price.\n  Clearly, California is the victim of a situation of supply and demand \nbecause for a number of years California simply decided it was easier \nto buy energy outside the State of California than developing energy \nfrom sources within. Clearly, last year, California found itself \ndepending on imported energy from other States. Those States chose to \nmarket that energy at the going price--whatever they could get for it. \nThe difficulty, of course, is that now California finds itself in a \nmess.\n  The controls on retail pricing which exist in California have \nresulted in the consumers taking the full brunt of what that energy \ncosts. By having a wholesale cap on California's energy, why, it is \nacting to inhibit investments coming into California to build more \nplants.\n  It should be noted that Vice President Cheney, in commenting on the \ngrowing electricity demand, indicated that the country is going to have \nto put in about 1,300 to 1,900 new powerplants during the next two \ndecades. The Department of Energy evidently supports that reference \nbecause they indicate that is between the plants they anticipate as \nnecessary to pick up the shortage.\n  What we have is a reference in general terms that we should address \nthis crisis but not specifically how we are going to address it or \nspecifically what means we are going to use. The Washington Post \neditorial indicates that conservation and increased efficiency are \ncritical components. And they are, Mr. President, but we should \nrecognize one fact. Less than 4 percent of our power generation in this \ncountry currently comes from renewables or alternatives. In other \nwords, the renewables would be the wind power, hydropower, and it \ncertainly could be fuel cells or various other components. The point is \nwe have invested about $6 billion in subsidies and grants for \nrenewables. They still only take a very small percentage.\n  What I find rather ironic is that there is no identification of just \nhow we are going to get out of this energy crisis. We are going to get \nout of it by going back to our traditional energy sources--coal, \nnuclear, oil, gas, hydro--and recognizing we can do a better job of \nconservation and work towards renewables.\n  What is frustrating is there is no identification of any consistency \nof what people will support. As a consequence of that, we find \nourselves with the recognition that not only do we have an energy \ncrisis but we also have an inadequate distribution system, whether it \nbe our pipelines or whether it be our electric transmission lines. Many \nof these have not been expanded over the last several years.\n  We also have a shortage of refinery capacity in this country. We have \nnot built a new refinery in 25 years. It is almost the perfect storm \ncoming together. We don't have the refining capacity. We have not built \nany coal-fired powerplants since 1995. We have not built a new nuclear \npowerplant in over 10 years. We have been concentrating on natural gas. \nWe saw the price of natural gas go up to $2.16 per thousand cubic feet \n18 months ago. Now it is $4 or $5. It has been as high as $8.\n  Here we have, if you will, not only an aging infrastructure for \ndelivery but a rather curious inconsistency in our foreign policy. We \nare currently importing about 700,000 barrels a day from Iraq. Many \npeople forget that in 1991-1992 we fought a war over there. We lost 147 \nAmerican lives. Yet today we enforce a no-fly zone over Iraq. We have \nflown over 230,000 individual sorties enforcing that no-fly zone and \nputting American men and women in danger. Saddam Hussein proceeded \nvaliantly and, fortunately, he has been unsuccessful in his effort to \nshoot down one of our aircraft. We are putting men and women in harm's \nway so we can continue to get oil from the Mideast--get it from one \nperson who is an enemy.\n  I can simplify it. I have used this often. But it seems as if we take \nhis oil and put it in our airplanes and then fly missions over Iraq. He \ntakes the money that he gets from us and develops a missile capability \nafter paying his Republican Guards to keep him alive and aims his \nmissiles at our ally, Israel.\n  What kind of a foreign policy is that? As a consequence, we see our \nNation 56-percent dependent on imported oil.\n  It is kind of interesting to note what other people are saying. A \nnoted investment banker, Matt Simmons, told the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources, which I chair, that ``we are now in the early stages \nof the most serious energy crisis this country has ever faced--worse \nthan 1973. As the crisis unfolds, it could become the most critical \nthreat to our economy since World War II.''\n  I don't know if we are heeding that call, but we certainly try. \nSeveral of us--Senator John Breaux and myself, among others--have \nintroduced comprehensive bipartisan solutions in our energy bill \npending before the Energy Committee. The objective is to promote the \nuse of alternative fuels, encourage efficiency, increase domestic \nsupplies of energy, a balanced, comprehensive approach that addresses \nall of our conventional sources and uses of technology as a consequence \nof the advancements we have made in the last several years. We have \nprovisions to provide for more efficient appliances in our homes, \nalternative fuel cars, and to make it easier for communities to make \nschools more efficient. It encourages the development of clean coal, \nnuclear, and other domestic energy sources.\n  One of the problems with this bill is you might not know what is in \nit because most of the coverage has been around one single issue in my \nState of\n\n[[Page S4409]]\n\nAlaska; that is, whether or not we should include the development of \nANWR in the bill.\n  ANWR is a very small piece of land, but it has turned into the focal \npoint of a very large argument. The reason is the environmentalists \nneed an issue such as ANWR--an issue that is far away, that Americans \ncan't see for themselves. If one looks at the makeup of the huge area \nthat includes ANWR and recognizes how insignificant that very small \nportion is that we are planning to open, one begins to understand the \nmerits of, indeed, the realization that we can do it safely.\n\n  In any event, I think it is important to note the inconsistency \nrelative to several of our major newspapers and their positions on this \nas evidenced by editorials that have been written over the last several \nmonths. I refer first to an article in the New York Times. That was \nMarch 5, 2001. It comments on the bill that we have introduced. The \nhighlight of the editorial suggests that this paper last addressed the \nfolly of trespassing on this wonderful wildlife preserve of ANWR for \nwhat by officials estimate is likely to be a modest amount of \neconomically recoverable oil. As a consequence of that, they go on in a \nlater article of January 31, 2000, indicating that the country needs a \nrational energy strategy, but the first step in that strategy should \nnot be punching holes in the Arctic refuge, even with improved drilling \ntechniques. They go on to say Mr. Bush's plan to open the refuge is \nenvironmentally unsound and as intellectually shaky as it was when \nRonald Reagan suggested it 20 years ago and when Mr. Bush's father \nsuggested it a decade ago.\n  Isn't that rather curious? I will put the poster up because I think \nall Members should have an opportunity to reflect on the inconsistency \nof our national news media on this issue. It did three articles. They \ndid an article on April 23, 1987. It reads:\n\n       (Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge . . . the most \n     promising untapped source of oil in North America.\n       . . . A decade ago, precautions in the design and \n     construction of the 1,000-mile-long Alaska pipeline saved the \n     land from serious damage. If oil companies, government \n     agencies and environmentalists approach the development of \n     the refuge with comparable care, disaster should be \n     avoidable.\n\n  Then they came long on June 2, 1988, and indicated:\n\n       . . . the potential is enormous and the environmental risks \n     are modest . . . the likely value of the oil far exceeds \n     plausible estimates of the environmental cost.\n       . . . the total acreage affected by development represents \n     only a fraction of 1 percent of the North Slope wilderness.\n       . . . But it is hard to see why absolutely pristine \n     preservation of this remote wilderness should take precedence \n     of the nation's energy needs.\n\n  Isn't that rather ironic? The New York Times has suddenly done a \nflip-flop when in June of 1988 they supported it, and in March of 1989 \nthey stated:\n\n       . . . Alaskan oil is too valuable to leave in the ground.\n       . . . the Single most promising source of oil in America \n     lies on the north coast of Alaska, a few hundred miles east \n     of the big fields at Prudhoe Bay.\n       . . . Washington can't afford . . . to treat the [Exxon \n     Valdez] accident as a reason for fencing off what may be the \n     last great oilfield in the nation.\n\n  It is interesting to note that the New York Times has done a flip-\nflop. It seems to me that it is more dangerous today when we are \nimporting 56 percent of our energy from overseas and worse than it was \nin the late 1970s when we were importing 37 percent.\n  In 1973, when we had the Arab oil embargo, there was a reaction in \nthis country. We created the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, and we made a \nmandate not to be dependent on the Mideast. As a consequence, we had a \nvery accurate effort in legislation, and so forth, to ensure that we \nwould not increase our oil imports. We had a crisis. We recognized it. \nWe wanted development of oil here at home. But now the New York Times \nhas suddenly turned around with very little explanation given.\n  In fact, I had an opportunity to meet with the editorial board of the \nNew York Times. I asked for an explanation of why they had changed \ntheir position when clearly the situation and the crisis as a \nconsequence of increased imported energy and the California crisis had \nheightened. The response to me was: Well, we had a different editor \nthen, and he is gone. I don't think that is a reasonable explanation.\n  You might think I am picking on the New York Times. But I had the \nsame situation with the Washington Post. The Washington Post some time \nago supported opening up ANWR. But as of December 25, 2000, they \nindicated:\n\n       Gov. Bush has promised to make energy policy an early \n     priority of his administration. If he wants to push ahead \n     with opening the plain as part of that, he'll have to show \n     that he values conservation as well as finding new sources of \n     supply. He'll also have to make the case that in the long \n     run, the oil to be gained is worth the potential damage to \n     this unique, wild and biologically vital ecosystem. That \n     strikes us as a hard case to make.\n\n  Then in another editorial from the Washington Post dated February 25:\n\n       Mr. Bush wants to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \n     to oil exploration. . . .\n       America cannot drill its way out of ties to the world oil \n     market. . . . But the most generous estimates of potential \n     production from the Alaska refuge amount to only a fraction \n     of current imports. To reduce dependence on foreign oil \n     requires reducing dependence on oil in general, through \n     lowered consumption [and so forth].\n\n  They did not say how we are going to move the transportation network \nof this country: our ships and our planes. We do not fly in and out of \nWashington, DC, on hot air. We have to have jet fuel from refineries. \nSomebody has to produce it.\n  My point is the Washington Post, too, has changed. One wonders why. \nBecause in 1987, on April 23, an editorial in the Washington Post read:\n\n       . . . Preservation of wilderness is important, but much of \n     Alaska is already under the strictest of preservation laws. . \n     . .\n       . . . But that part of the arctic coast is one of the \n     bleakest, most remote places on this continent, and there is \n     hardly any other place where drilling would have less impact \n     on the surroundings life. . . .\n       . . . That oil could help ease the country's transition to \n     lower oil supplies and . . . reduce its dependence on \n     uncertain imports. Congress would be right to go ahead and, \n     with all the conditions and environmental precautions that \n     apply to Prudhoe Bay, see what's under the refuge's [of \n     ANWR]. . . .\n\n  That sounds pretty good. Then on April 4, 1989, they further say in \nan editorial:\n\n       . . . But if less is to be produced here in the United \n     States, more will have to come from other countries. The \n     effect will be to move oil spills to other shores. As a \n     policy to protect the global environment, that's not very \n     helpful. . . .\n       . . . The lesson that conventional wisdom seems to be \n     drawing--that the country should produce less and turn to \n     even greater imports--is exactly wrong.\n\n  How ironic can these two national organizations--the New York Times \nand the Washington Post--be in completely flip-flopping the position \nthey both had in the mid-1980s, to turn around and now be in opposition \nwhen we truly have an energy crisis in this country? I encourage my \ncolleagues to inquire of the Washington Post and New York Times why \nthat is so.\n  The explanation I got, as I indicated, from the New York Times is \nthey changed editorial editors, and that person is gone. I asked the \nWashington Post for an explanation. The explanation from the Washington \nPost is rather interesting: Of the group who was there, one person \nvolunteered an explanation. That explanation was that they thought \nPresident-elect Bush was a little too forward on the issue in his \ncomments during his campaign. I do not think that is an adequate answer \neither.\n  I will tell you what we have. We have general comments about an \nenergy policy and the need for an energy policy but no specific \nidentification of how we are going to achieve, if you will, more \nproduction of energy in this country, more transmission lines, and how \nto use our technology to lessen the footprint.\n  One of the ways, clearly, is to reduce dependence on foreign imported \noil and by opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Preserve. By doing \nthat, we can hasten the day when we can reduce our dependence on \nimported oil.\n\n  Let me conclude with one reference and I do not have the charts in \nthe Chamber to show you, but I think it is important to keep in mind \nthat ANWR is the size of the State of South Carolina. It is 19 million \nacres. We have taken 8.5 million acres and put them in a wilderness in \nperpetuity. Nine million acres are in a refuge. Congress has the sole \ndiscretion on opening up the 1.5 million acres. It is estimated that if\n\n[[Page S4410]]\n\nthe oil is in the abundance that it needs to be, it will take a \nfootprint of roughly 1,000 to 2,000 acres. That is about half the size \nof the Dulles International Airport.\n  To me, one of the startling things about new technology is a \nstatement an engineer made in my office saying he could drill under the \nCapitol Building and come out at gate 17 at Reagan Airport. That gives \nyou some idea of the advanced technology for oil and gas drilling.\n  I know my friend, the chairman of the Committee on Finance, is \nanxious to be heard and to ask for 5 minutes of my time. I will grant \nhim 5 minutes of my time. One of these days I will expect reciprocity.\n  I am going to be speaking again on this crisis in energy and the role \nof the national environmental community in challenging the realistic \nmanner in which we can achieve greater relief from the energy crisis in \nthis country. I will be doing that in the coming days.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, now I know who I have to thank that I \ncan get 5 minutes. So I thank the Senator from Alaska. But in show of \nmy appreciation, I say to him that on the matter he spoke about in \nrelation to our energy needs, I look forward to helping solve a great \ndeal of our energy issues because through our Committee on Finance we \nwill be dealing with a lot of tax issues that deal with the efforts to \nspur production and alternative energies.\n  A very big part of your program that you have introduced--and we \ncompliment you for being a leader in trying to solve the energy \ncrisis--will be the work of the committee on which the Senator and I \nserve. I will be very happy to work on that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/07/senate-section/article/S4410-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     IN RECOGNITION OF JOANN OWENS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the month of May, since 1963, has helped \nthe Nation focus on the contributions and achievements of America's \nolder citizens because the month of May is a month where we recognize \nthese achievements. Congress does this by cooperating with various \norganizations in bringing senior interns to Washington, DC, for 1 week \nout of the month of May. There are other things that are done as well.\n  The image of those over the age of 65 is dramatically different than \nit was as recently as a generation ago. Older Americans increasingly \nredefine modern maturity. They reshape cultural boundaries, and they \ndispel age-old stereotypes associated with getting older. They are \nleaders in our families, in our workplaces, and in our communities.\n  Each week this month I am going to recognize a different Iowan and \nhighlight what these older Iowans are doing as a contribution to the \nworkplace and communities. The one I recognize this week is a 68-year-\nold woman from Sioux City, IA. JoAnn Owens understands the value of \nfamily and understands community involvement. Through her initiative, \nher concern, and her commitment, she has touched the lives of many in \nher family and in the entire Sioux City community.\n  Born and raised in Sioux City, Ms. Owens moved to New York in her \ntwenties and spent much of her adult life on the east coast. In 1993, \nat the age of 60, she moved back to Sioux City to care for her ailing \nmother. Seeking a way to keep herself active, and at the same time \nstimulate her mind, Ms. Owens began to volunteer in the community. For \nthe last 7 years, she has served as a senior companion by providing \ncare to people in the community who need extra assistance in order to \nlive independently.\n  She currently volunteers 4 days a week helping young people suffering \nfrom brain injuries to develop their academic skills. Ms. Owens also \nserves as a volunteer judge for the Woodbury County Drug Court Program. \nShe is a member of the city's Human Rights Commission and active in the \nQuota Club, an international service organization.\n  Ms. Owens describes herself as a woman motivated by challenges. As a \nvolunteer with the Sioux City Police Department, Ms. Owens took the \ninitiative to develop a program to provide domestically abused women \nwith cellular phones so they could better protect themselves. She also \nspent a series of weeks attending the Sioux City Police Citizens \nAcademy where she was trained on the responsibilities and challenges \nfacing police officers.\n  Ms. Owens' concern for her family is also a driving force for her \ninvolvement. Her desire to play an active role in her mother's care \nprompted Ms. Owens to join the care review board at the care center \nwhere her mother lived. Although Ms. Ownens' mother passed away 5 years \nago, she is still involved as a resident advocate, currently serving as \nthe chairperson for the care review committee. She visits with the \nresidents at least once a month and works with staff to take care of \nany problems at the center.\n  Ms. Owens has six grandchildren and one great-grandchild. Her concern \nfor their education motivated her to become a member of the Board of \nEducation equity committee. She is currently the chairperson of the \ncommittee. Her mission is to ensure that education in Sioux City is \nequally and equitably dispensed to all students.\n  Beyond her community involvement, Ms. Owens enjoys raising tomatoes, \nreading, and feeding the birds, squirrels and rabbits. She lives with \nher cat Mr. Roberts and her dog Jordan.\n  I thank Ms. Owens for helping to make Sioux City a better place to \nlive. Her initiative and compassionate care for others is an example to \nus all that we should contribute to our communities, no matter what our \nage.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, am I correct that the Senate is now in \na period of morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/07/senate-section/article/S4410-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4410-S4412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BUDGET RESOLUTION DELIBERATIONS\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \ndeliberations that are now going on in both Houses of the Congress \nabout the budget resolution, which will be before the Senate certainly \nsome time this week.\n  This is a most important time in this session and, I believe, is a \nmoment of historic opportunity for our economy. As I have followed the \ndebate, I have seen questions raised about, where is the Centrist \nCoalition in the Senate? Where are the so-called moderates? I know some \nvoted for the Senate-passed budget resolution when it came up in the \nSenate earlier. I think some of those moderates are having second \nthoughts or are raising questions about the state in which that \nresolution came out of the conference committee, from which, as we \nknow, Members of the Democratic Party were excluded.\n  I want to speak with my colleagues today about my own feelings on \nthis budget resolution. I do so as someone who has been a proud \nfounding member of the Senate bipartisan Centrist Coalition, a founding \nmember of the Senate New Democratic Coalition, because I truly believe \nthis budget resolution, as it has come out of the conference committee, \nchallenges and tests each of us on our fundamental views about what \nGovernment is about and what, most of all, fiscal responsibility is \nabout.\n  I have always believed that at the heart of being a so-called \ncentrist or moderate is fiscal responsibility--that we will take care \nof the people's money here--more than a trillion dollars of it that we \nhave charge of every year--with the same fiscal responsibility that the \nAmerican people handle their own money in their personal lives, in \ntheir families, and in their businesses.\n\n  As I looked at this budget resolution that has emerged from the \nconference committee, it is my strong feeling that it lacks more than \njust the two missing pages that are now being retrieved. This budget \nresolution profoundly lacks fiscal responsibility. It will not only do \nnothing to address the economic downturn that more and more Americans \nare feeling the pinch and pain of right now; I fear that it will set us \non the road back to increasing debt,\n\n[[Page S4411]]\n\nto budget deficits, to increasing interest rates that go with \nincreasing deficits and debt, and to the rising unemployment and \nfalling investment that go with higher interest rates.\n  This budget resolution is fiscally irresponsible. It is a tax plan, \nas colleagues have said, that is trying to look like a budget plan. I \nwill put it this way: It is a tax plan, but it is not what we need, \nwhich is a prosperity and progress plan. It does not answer the \nquestion of how we continue the prosperity and progress of the last \nseveral years.\n  I want to cite a few concerns I have about this budget resolution as \nit has emerged from the conference committee, which we will debate this \nweek. First, to the best of my understanding, there is no longer a \nshort-term, immediate economic stimulus component to this budget. \nDuring the recent debate on the Senate-passed budget resolution, \nseveral of us in both parties spoke to the need for an economic \nstimulus, as we watched important economic indicators going down. When \nthe budget resolution came up in the Senate, our colleague, Senator \nHollings from South Carolina, and several of the rest of us, sponsored \nand passed an amendment that set aside $85 billion of the current \nyear's surplus for an economic stimulus in order to get money out to \nthe taxpayers--every one of them, whether they pay the payroll tax or \nthe income tax, as soon as humanly possible. We believed it was and \nstill is important to put money in the pockets of all taxpayers this \nfiscal year so they can go spend it, boost the economy, and raise \nconsumer confidence. It is my understanding that the conference \ncommittee has effectively removed the stimulus component from the \nbudget resolution that will come before us this week. It is gone even \nas the economic indicators from the official bureaus of our Government \nand other organizations tell us that we need that economic stimulus \neven more today than when we voted in this Chamber just a few short \nweeks ago to adopt it. But it is not there.\n  Just last week we learned that the unemployment rate for April shot \nup to 4.5 percent. That is the highest level of unemployment in America \nin more than 2\\1/2\\ years. Even more troubling, last month U.S. \nbusinesses cut their payrolls by the largest amount, 223,000 jobs, \nsince the recession year of 1991. That is as clear an alarm bell as we \ncould have and as clear a call for a short-term economic stimulus as we \nshould need. Yet, it is not in this resolution.\n  In addition, the University of Michigan, which has been measuring \nconsumer sentiment in this country for many years, reported that \nconsumer confidence fell last month to the lowest level it has been in \n7 years. This is not some political group, some partisan group; these \nare credible indicators. They cry out for the short-term economic \nstimulus--to get the money back into the pockets of America's consumers \nto spend and raise consumer confidence. And it is not there in this \nbudget resolution.\n\n  Secondly, the tax cut in this conference report seems to be growing \nwell beyond the Senate-passed figure of $1.18 billion and even beyond \nthe $1.25 billion that the Republican conferees claim is in this budget \nresolution. It seems that the $100 billion that was supposed to go \ntowards an immediate economic stimulus is being rolled back into the \nlarger Bush tax plan, bringing the real total to $1.350 trillion. Add \nto that an additional $50 billion in this budget resolution for other \nrevenue reductions and you are up to $1.4 billion. That number doesn't \ninclude some of the automatic tax extenders that get renewed on a \nregular basis. It doesn't include necessary reforms to the alternative \nminimum tax that will be necessitated by this $1.4 trillion tax plan. \nIt doesn't include increased interest payments on the debt that will \nhave to be paid because we are spending so much of the surplus.\n  Mr. President, I predict to you that if we should adopt this \nunfortunate, mistaken and, in my opinion, threatening-to-our-economy \nbudget resolution, the tax plan will cost, at a minimum, $1.6 trillion. \nIt will probably cost much closer to $1.8 trillion. I am sure when we \nget the resolution on the floor, we will have a clearer estimate of \nthat. That tax cut will be taken out of what remains of a projected of \n$2.5 trillion 10-year on-budget surplus. But that $2.5 trillion surplus \nis based in part on an economic growth rate of 2.4 percent this year.\n  However, the Congressional Budget Office has actually run some \nnumbers on what would happen to that projected surplus if the growth \nrate slows this year. Some economists do think we are going into a \nrecession this year, where at the end of the year we will actually have \nnegative growth. I hope and pray not. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, if that happened, if the growth rate for this year alone \ndropped to .1%, there would be a $47 billion drop in the projected \nsurplus this year and a total reduction in the surplus of $133 billion \nover the following 10 years.\n  That analysis even assumes that there would be continued robust 3.1-\npercent growth over the following 9 years, which no one can assume. So \nyou take whatever the tax cut ends up being--$1.7 trillion or $1.8 \ntrillion--out of that, and then you look at the spending side of this \nbudget resolution, next year's domestic discretionary spending in the \nbudget resolutions coming out of the conference committee does not keep \nup with the expected rate of inflation.\n  So at a time when we are looking forward to surpluses, when we know \nfrom our families and our businesses that you have to make responsible \ninvestments to continue to grow, this budget is spending it almost all \non the tax plan and saving very little for the kinds of investments \nthat we need to make to keep our country strong, to continue the \nprosperity and the progress.\n  Where are we going to get the money after this enormous tax plan \nproposal by President Bush and our colleagues in Congress is taken out \nof the surplus that we hope will exist--where are we going to get the \nmoney to invest in education, which every conversation I have had with \npeople in my State of Connecticut, and every public opinion survey says \nis the No. 1 priority of the American people? Where are we going to get \nthe money to invest in keeping our Nation strong, our national \ndefenses? The numbers that are coming out of the Pentagon--rumored at \nthis point--are quite high.\n  I am a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. I am privileged \nto serve with the distinguished occupant of the Chair, the Senator from \nFlorida. One could make a case for some of these numbers, in my \nopinion. We need to invest more in our defense, but where is that money \ngoing to come from if domestic discretionary spending is held below the \nrate of inflation and so much goes to that tax plan?\n  We are going to do serious harm to our economic future if we pass \nthis fiscally irresponsible budget resolution. There is no way we can \ncontinue the operations of our Government in a realistic and \nresponsible way if we adopt this budget. That is even assuming that \ngood economic times return soon again next year and that this current \ndownturn does not develop into a longer recession. There is no way we \nare going to pay the bills that are part of this budget resolution \nwithout dipping into the Social Security and Medicare trust funds.\n  What happened to the lockbox everybody was talking about for Social \nSecurity and Medicare? Our seniors and those in the baby boom \ngeneration who are going to be coming into their senior years are \nexpecting Social Security and Medicare to be there. With this \nconference report, they are going to find the viability of those funds \nhave been hurt by a fiscally irresponsible budget. These are pivotal \nconsiderations and votes we are going to have this week.\n  We have learned a lot in the last decade about the role of Government \nin the economy. One of the things we have learned, certainly centrist, \nNew Democrats know, is that the Government does not create jobs. The \nprivate sector creates jobs. But Government can create an environment \nfor growth, an environment in which the private sector can flourish.\n  The first and most important thing that Government can do is to be \nfiscally responsible.\n  The second thing is to have some money to invest in what creates \ngrowth, particularly in the high-tech information age. Nothing creates \ngrowth more than an educated public.\n\n[[Page S4412]]\n\n We need to invest in our schools. We need to invest in training and \nretraining of existing workers. Yes, we ought to have tax cuts. We \nought to have some tax cuts that help working families deduct the cost \nof higher education for their children or the cost of retraining \nprograms for themselves.\n  I am afraid this budget resolution, which carries out a campaign \npromise the President made in New Hampshire more than a year and a half \nago when the economy was not in a downturn, when others he was running \nagainst were proposing flat taxes and he responded, will take us down \nthe road to exactly where our history should tell us we do not want to \ngo.\n  This budget resolution is fiscally irresponsible. The economics do \nnot make any sense. I am tempted to call it voodoo economics, Mr. \nPresident. The numbers do not add up and America's economy will suffer \nfor it. Even more to the point, and personally, what will be hurt if we \ndo not gather together, centrists of both parties, to speak for fiscal \nresponsibility and reasonable investments and fiscally responsible tax \ncuts is the quality of life of millions of American families and the \nstrength and stability of millions of American businesses.\n  I urge my colleagues to look closely at this budget. Let us work \nacross party lines on it and let us make it what the American people \ndeserve and expect it to be: a fiscally responsible progress and \nprosperity budget.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I associate myself with the comments \nmade by the Senator from Connecticut. If the budget comes back as \nreports indicate the conference may send it back, I, who voted for it \nthe first time, will not be able to vote to support that budget \nconference report.\n  The Senator from Connecticut has very well made the points. For me, \nit is a profound disappointment that something I thought we had worked \nout and was understood is going to be reversed and come back in a \nconference report which is, for most of us, unacceptable.\n  Mr. President, I know the hour of 2 o'clock is approaching. I ask \nunanimous consent that the time be extended just so I may finish my \ncomments today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/07/senate-section/article/S4412-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4412-S4413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ENERGY PRICES AND THOSE WHO BENEFIT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, last week I rose to speak about the \nbusinesses and consumers in California and the West who are facing \nexorbitant energy bills that could threaten the very livelihood of \ntheir businesses. These are people who have been hurt by the crisis. \nToday I want to talk about those who have benefited from the crisis.\n  One can look at this chart and you can see something is wrong because \nthe total cost of power in California in 1999 was $7 billion, the total \ncost in the year 2000 was $32 billion, and the projected cost in the \nyear 2001 is $65 billion.\n  That kind of a hike does not happen without someone profiting.\n  Electricity is not an automobile. It is not a fur coat. It is not a \nhome. Electricity is a basic staple of human life. If the street lights \ndo not function, there are accidents. If people cannot run their \nrespirators, death may result.\n  California is now in a position where businesses are laying off \nemployees, businesses are closing. I cannot emphasize enough how people \nare hurt by this.\n  Let us look at an example of high power prices by taking one random \nday this past winter: December 15, 2000. On this day, electricity \nprices ranged from $429 a megawatt hour to $565 a megawatt hour, \ndepending on the time of day.\n  What makes that significant? Look back 1 year to 1999, same day, same \nmonth. The price was $12 a megawatt hour to $29 a megawatt hour. These \nare wholesale prices. This represents in 1 year an increase of 3,500 \npercent and 1,900 percent, respectively.\n  If we want to take a look at prices in a more recent month, let us \nlook at February 2001. Wholesale energy costs in February averaged $361 \na megawatt hour, more than 12 times the average wholesale cost of $30 a \nmegawatt hour in February of 2000.\n\n  I mentioned earlier that the utilities, as a product of a very flawed \nState bill, had to divest themselves of their power-generating \nfacilities. To show the difference, consider that when Southern \nCalifornia Edison had its generating facilities, it was selling power \nat $30 a megawatt hour. When Edison sold it to an out-of-State \ngenerator, the generator immediately turned around and charged $300 a \nmegawatt hour. That is what is happening.\n  Clearly, California's deregulation has turned out to be an abysmal \nfailure for the State, for consumers, for businesses, and for \nCalifornia's investor-owned utilities, one of which is in bankruptcy, \nPG, and the other which is perilously close, Southern California \nEdison.\n  Last week, the Federal Reserve estimated that, on average, each \nCalifornia household will pay $750 out of their pocket to compensate \nfor higher energy costs this year. Additionally, over the past year, \nthe natural gas component of the CPI rose by 68 percent in western \nmetropolitan areas, boosted in part by a nearly 135-percent increase in \nthe index in the San Francisco Bay area.\n  However, having said this, not everyone has been a loser. Let us talk \na moment about the winners because it is quite revealing.\n  California's six largest nonutility energy suppliers are all based \noutside the State. Together they own or market roughly 17,000 megawatts \nof capacity. That is roughly a third of the total capacity in the \nState, and it is roughly enough for 17 million households. They are \ncompanies such as Dynegy, Duke Energy, Mirant, NRG Energy, Reliant, and \nWilliams. These are not the only ones benefiting from the crisis. But \nfor these six companies, profits more than doubled from 1999 to 2000. \nIn some cases, the companies' subsidiary operating units doing business \nin California's wholesale power posted even larger gains than their \nparent companies.\n\n  If you look at this chart, the gray is 1999 and the red is 2000. \nWilliams Energy Marketing and Trading Company, a subsidiary of Williams \nEnergy Services, which sells energy from California facilities, saw \nprofits increase nearly tenfold, from $104 million in 1999 to over $1 \nbillion in 2000.\n  For Reliant's wholesale energy business, which supplies energy to \nCalifornia and other competitive markets, operating income rose almost \n1800 percent, from $27 million in 1999 to $482 million in 2000. These \nare last year's numbers, but already these firms are again posting \ndramatically higher profits from this winter. Recent first quarter \nearnings announcements by energy companies reveal that firms continue \nto profit big time.\n  For example, Calpine Corporation announced a 424-percent increase in \nearnings, raking in $94.8 million in the first 3 months of the year \ncompared with $18 million last year.\n  Mirant, formally Southern Company, announced record first quarter \nearnings of $175 million, up 84 percent, the equivalent of 51 cents per \nshare.\n  Williams reported a first quarter profit of $378 million, more than \ndouble its results a year ago.\n  It is important to note that supply and demand have remained \nvirtually the same over this period of time. There has been less than a \n4-percent increase in demand. The imbalances in the market do not \njustify these astonishing increases in price.\n  One of the most amazing things to me is to see how little concern \nthere is about what is happening in this very large State. Last week, \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered the Williams Company \nto refund $8 million for withholding power from the California market \nlast summer. This is the first action of its kind by FERC, who found \nthat Williams intentionally and improperly shut down plants with the \nimplicit understanding that withholding power from the market would \ndrive up prices. We know it is happening now.\n  Last April and May, Williams shut down two of its generating units in \nLong Beach and Huntington Beach that were obligated to sell electricity \nto the California grid operator, forcing the ISO to look elsewhere for \npower. Williams--this is the rub--Williams\n\n[[Page S4413]]\n\nwould have been paid $63 a megawatt hour if the power plants were \nrunning; instead, the ISO had to spend $750 a megawatt hour to purchase \nelectricity from other generating units. This withholding of power \nnetted Williams $11 million.\n  The Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Company has agreed to \nrefund $8 million under the FERC order, although they profited $11 \nmillion by purposely shutting down the plants to raise the price.\n  Last week it was reported that Duke Energy was attempting to \nnegotiate with Governor Davis to settle similar allegations about Duke \nplants that were off line. Documents released last week reveal that in \nMarch, Duke approached the Governor's office to offer a discount on \nsome of the $110 million owed to the company in exchange for an \nassurance by the Governor that Duke would not be investigated for \nkeeping plants off line. I think that is just dreadful. A major \ngenerator approaches the Governor and tries to make a settlement so \nthat company will not be investigated. This evidence demonstrates that \npower has been intentionally withheld from the market.\n\n  This is not an issue about supply and demand. Vice President Cheney, \nSecretary Abraham, and FERC Chairman Hebert argue if we try to regulate \nprices, companies will not build new plants. Traditionally, companies \nhave earned 10 to 15 percent profit in the energy sector, but now we \nare seeing profits in the hundreds and thousands of percents. The \nadministration says companies need these high profits to build new \npowerplants. But at what point does reasonable profit become price \ngouging?\n  Again, electricity isn't a luxury good, it is a staple of life. \nAgain, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has found these prices \nunjust and unreasonable. But the FERC will do nothing about it. \nCalifornians are outraged.\n  Last week, the Lieutenant Governor of California sued Duke, Mirant, \nReliant, Williams, and Dynegy in Los Angeles Superior Court accusing \nthe firms of price fixing in violation of State antitrust and unlawful \nbusiness practices laws.\n  Today, the California State Assembly speaker and State Senate \npresident pro tempore will sue FERC for the Commission's failure to \nensure that rates are just and reasonable as required under the Federal \nPower Act. I support their cases. Again, I call on FERC to cap \nwholesale prices until new plants can come on line in California.\n  The price gouging I have talked about today will have rippling \neffects that will affect everyone not only in California but likely the \nentire country. Already, Washington and Oregon are suffering from high \nelectricity prices.\n  If the FERC and the Federal Government continue to offer piecemeal \nsolutions, the world's sixth largest economy, California, and the \nNation's economy may very well pay the price. Now is the time to act. \nThat is why Senator Gordon Smith and I have introduced comprehensive \nlegislation to address the price and supply problems up to March of \n2003, at which time it is estimated there will be enough power on line \nto protect against the price gouging we are experiencing today.\n  Today, California may well experience the first rolling blackouts of \nthe summer. As a matter of fact, we have just learned that the Major \nLeague baseball games are going to go on a rain delay should there be a \nrolling blackout. The games will stop until after the blackout ceases. \nThis is clearly a problem for California and other States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/07/senate-section/article/S4413-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DOMESTIC DRUG UPDATE\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

It is clear we must take further steps to combat this increase \nin availability.\n  The report included information collected from cities all over the \ncountry, both urban and rural. It found that heroin use is increasing \nrelative to cocaine. The availability of heroin has been increasing. In \nfact, drug experts reported that heroin is readily available on our \nstreets, and about half of these experts stated that access to heroin \nis getting easier. Heroin purity is also increasing, especially as \nColombian white heroin is showing up on our door. One major trend found \nacross the nation is that more and more young people are taking up \nheroin. This is a scourge that must be stopped.\n  There is another drug that's devastating our young people: Ecstasy \nand other so-called ``club drugs.'' The report highlighted the dramatic \nincreases in use, particularly among teenagers. Eighteen of twenty \ncities in the report found Ecstasy to be an emerging concern. Ninety \npercent of drug treatment and law enforcement experts attest that the \navailability of Ecstasy has increased in the past year, in spite of all \nthe attention it's been given. It's time we stop just talking about \nthis problem that's destroying our youth, and start taking real action \nto educate our children and stop the easy availability of this drug at \nparties and clubs and increasingly in our schoolyards.\n  Use of other drugs remain at high levels. Marijuana is still widely \navailable, and law enforcement officials regard marijuana as a major \nthreat to our cities. Cocaine, crack, methamphetamine, and other drugs \nare also increasing in availability and presenting a growing threat to \nour law enforcement personnel and to all Americans. The Pulse Check \nreport found that the one trend that transcended all drugs was that the \nusers were increasingly likely to be younger people. The age of onset \nof use is dropping. This heightened assault on our young people cannot \nbe allowed to continue. We must stop the drug trafficking in our \nschools and near our children.\n  There were a few positive signs in the report, however. Crack and \nmarijuana use seem to be leveling off, and it appears our efforts are \nbeginning to work in these areas. More effort should be placed in these \nareas so we do not lose any momentum in fighting these drugs.\n  I received another report, from the Pew Research Center, that \ndiscusses the American people's feelings on the drug war. Pew reports \nthat 74 percent of Americans feel that we are losing the drug war. \nDrugs also ranked as the number one concern for rural areas, such as my \nhome state of Iowa. This is an issue that clearly affects everyone; \nthere is no place left to hide from this scourge. Americans are worried \nabout this problem, and with good cause.\n  I wish I had more good news to report, but unfortunately the drug \nproblem remains serious. Drug use is up sharply among our youth, and \navailability of most drugs is increasing as traffickers are increasing \nthe flow of drugs into our country and into our schools. Bold steps \nmust be taken to let our children know the risks of these drugs, while \nalso stopping the pushers before they reach young people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/07/senate-section/article/S4413-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4413-S4414]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE NEED FOR CONTROL OF GREENHOUSE GASES\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that is \nvery important to a large number of Americans. It is the issue of \nglobal climate change and the control of greenhouse gases.\n  One of the most profound challenges we face in the 21st century is \nthe problem of global climate change. Global climate change has the \npotential to cause widespread damage to large parts of our planet. An \nincreasing body of scientific evidence indicates that human activities \nare altering the chemical composition of the atmosphere through the \nbuildup of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, methane, and \nnitrous oxide. The heat trapping property of these greenhouse gases is \nundisputed. Scientists and public policy experts are convinced that we \nneed to address this problem.\n  We cannot wait longer for even more scientific proof of when and how \nclimate change will begin. One Pacific leader summarized our dilemma \nbest when he said ``We do not have the luxury of waiting for conclusive \nproof of global warming. The proof, we fear, will kill us.''\n  Prudence dictates that we start addressing this issue immediately. \nSolutions may not be easy, quick, or cheap;\n\n[[Page S4414]]\n\nhowever, if we do not address this problem soon, the costs will be much \nhigher.\n  President Bush's reversal of his carbon dioxide pledge is a serious \nblow to the efforts to control greenhouse gases. The Administration's \nposition on the Kyoto Protocol diminishes the role of the United States \nin developing a suitable framework to deal with the challenge of global \nclimate change in a cooperative manner with other countries. The United \nStates has the scientific and technical prowess and industrial might to \nplay a leading role in controlling the emissions of greenhouse gases. \nAs the source of over a quarter of the planet's carbon dioxide \nemissions, we have a responsibility to act decisively. If we abandon \nour leadership role, not only will history judge us harshly, but we \nwill also pay a dear price for our shortsightedness.\n  I represent the state where debate over global warming began. The \nMauna Loa Climate Observatory in Hawaii was the first to document a \nsteady increase in the atmospheric carbon dioxide levels more than 30 \nyears ago. Since then many authoritative studies have been conducted \nthat document increased levels of greenhouse gases. It is now widely \naccepted by the scientific community that human activities such as \nburning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and certain land-use practices \nare increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and other \ngreenhouse gases. Careful measurement of those gases in the atmosphere, \nand analyses of ancient ice cores in Greenland and Antarctica, leave no \ndoubt that their global concentrations are increasing.\n  Modeling studies show that emissions of greenhouse gases due to human \nactivities are affecting the atmosphere in a predictable manner. \nConfidence in the ability of complex models to project future climatic \nconditions has increased. There is new and stronger evidence that most \nof the warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human \nactivities.\n\n  Temperatures have risen during the past four decades in the lowest 8 \nkilometers of the atmosphere. Snow cover and ice extent have decreased. \nThere has been widespread retreat of glaciers in the non-polar regions \nduring the 20th century. Average global sea level has risen and ocean \nheat content has increased.\n  The effects of major global climate change on the U.S. and the rest \nof the world will be devastating. I would like to describe the possible \neffects of climate change on Hawaii. As an island state with limited \nland mass, we are very sensitive to global climate changes. The \nworldwide problem of greenhouse gases threatens Hawaii. Honolulu's \naverage temperature has increased by 4.4 degrees over the last century. \nBy 2100, average temperatures in Hawaii could increase by three to five \ndegrees Fahrenheit in all seasons and slightly more in the fall. \nRainfall has decreased by about 20 percent over the past 90 years. \nEstimates for future rainfall are highly uncertain because reliable \nprojections of El Nino do not exist. It is possible that large \nprecipitation increases could occur in the summer and fall. The \nintensity of hurricanes may be affected. Expansion of the habitat of \ndisease-carrying insects could increase the potential for diseases such \nas malaria and dengue fever.\n  In Honolulu, Nawiliwili, and Hilo, our major harbors, sea level has \nincreased six to fourteen inches in the last century and is likely to \nrise another 17 to 24 inches by 2100. The expected rise in the sea \nlevel could cause flooding of low lying property, loss of coastal \nwetlands, beach erosion, saltwater contamination of drinking water, and \ndamage to coastal roads and bridges. The shorelines of the Hawaiian \nIslands contain some of the world's most famous white-sand beaches. The \neffects of an accelerated sea level rise on the coral reef ecosystem \nwhich protects our islands are poorly understood. Higher temperatures \ncould cause coral bleaching and the death of coral reefs. Hawaii's \neconomy could also be hurt if the combination of higher temperatures, \nchanges in weather, and the effects of sea level rise on beaches make \nHawaii less attractive to visitors.\n  Hawaii's diverse environment and geographic isolation have resulted \nin a great variety of native species found only in Hawaii. However, 70 \npercent of U.S. extinctions of species have occurred in Hawaii, and \nmany species are endangered. Climate change would add another threat.\n  People around the world are beginning to take this problem seriously. \nTo reduce carbon dioxide output, Mexico is planning to double its \ngeothermal power generation, placing it third behind the United States \nand the Philippines in the use of geothermal power. China, with 11 \npercent of the world's carbon dioxide output, second to the U.S., has \nreduced its greenhouse gas output by 17 percent between 1997 and 1999.\n  In the U.S., municipal governments are working to reduce carbon \ndioxide emissions. In 1993, Portland, Oregon, became the first U.S. \ncity to implement its own CO2 reduction plan. Portland has \nbeen joined by Denver and Minneapolis.\n\n  In recent years, more and more multinational corporations have taken \npositive steps to address the problem of greenhouse gases. British \nPetroleum set the goal of cutting carbon dioxide output 10 percent \nbelow its 1990 level. Four years later it is halfway there. Last \nOctober, Alcan, DuPont, and others pledged to reduce their greenhouse \nemissions to levels meeting or exceeding the Kyoto requirements. \nPolaroid, IBM, Johnson & Johnson, and others are also committed to \nreducing corporate greenhouse gas emissions. Fuel cells are on the \nverge of providing big breakthroughs in the use of clean energy. All \nmajor automobile companies are committeed to this new, clean \ntechnology.\n  We cannot wait for further scientific proof to materialize. If we do \nnot begin to control greenhouse gases in a reasonable time frame, we \nmay reach the point where it may be exceedingly difficult to avoid the \ndrastic effects of global warming. It will not take extremes of warming \nto lead to major impacts.\n  We need to address the problem of global climate change, and the \nsooner we start on this the better off we will be. No one wants our \nefforts to combat carbon dioxide emissions to become an economic \nnightmare.\n  An effective program to fight climate change need not involve huge \nincreases in energy prices or draconian rules that choke industries and \ndamage our economic well-being. We need to employ creative approaches \nand let American ingenuity loose. We must invest in the development of \nnew technologies that will provide new and environmentally friendly \nsources of energy, newer and environmentally friendly technologies that \nallow use of conventional and non-conventional energy sources. We must \nwork with other nations in a cooperative manner. A well-crafted \nstrategy can address global climate change and maintain our preeminent \neconomic position in the world.\n  I urge President Bush to reconsider his position on the control of \ncarbon dioxide. I urge the Administration to work with other countries \nin developing suitable and equitable approaches in solving this shared \nproblem of control of greenhouse gases. Our positive leadership is \nnecessary if we are to avoid the catastrophic effects of global climate \nchange. Our world cannot afford widespread disruption of ecosystems and \nweather patterns that may result from unmitigated emissions of \ngreenhouse gases.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/07/senate-section/article/S4414-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4414-S4415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, from time to time historians like to engage \nin a sort of parlor game in speculating whether circumstances create \ngreat leaders or whether leaders serve as the catalyst for great \nchange.\n  In my view, there's no doubt that greatness springs from the \ncharacter of individuals. President Reagan understood this fundamental \ntruth. He also understood that the American people, particularly the \nmen and women in our armed services, will meet any challenge with \nproper encouragement to strive for excellence.\n  Ronald Reagan's faith in the American people enabled him to inspire \nour citizens and to restore our collective confidence at a critical \ntime in America's history. Inheriting a military in decline and a \nnation said to be in a ``malaise'' by his immediate predecessor, \nPresident Reagan chose not to shrink from the enormous challenges \nfacing our Nation.\n  Instead, he stood firm in his resolve. Overcoming the predictable \npartisan criticism, he successfully rebuilt our national defense and \nrestored United States power and prestige throughout the world.\n  In 1984, in rebuilding our military, President Reagan established the \nCommander-in-Chief's Annual Award for Installation Excellence. In doing \nso, he issued an open challenge to the men and women responsible for \ndefending the United States of America\": That they do the ``best job \nwith their resources to support our mission,'' and that ``they seek out \nthe most imaginative and innovative solutions to the many complex \nproblems [they] face.''\n  Mr. President, ever since Ronald Reagan's first presentation in 1985, \nthe Commander-in-Chief's Award has served as the highest commendation \nfor a military installation. It is a tangible recognition of the hard \nwork, dedication, innovation, and professionalism of the service-\nmembers and civilians who serve in our armed forces. (In each year \nsince, only five awards have been presented only to the most \noutstanding installation of the four service branches and the Defense \nLogistics Agency.)\n  This year, for only the second time in history, three installations \nin a single state rose to President Reagan's challenge and were \npresented during the same year with the Commander-in-Chief's Award.\n  In ceremonies at the Pentagon last week, Mr. President, \nrepresentatives of Seymour Johnson Air Force Base, Fort Bragg, and Camp \nLejeune--all three in North Carolina--were present to receive this \nwell-deserved recognition on behalf of their respective services.\n  Though this is just the second time a state has accomplished this \nremarkable feat, North Carolina installations have been honored \nfrequently in previous Commander-in-Chief Award ceremonies. In fact, \nNorth Carolina installations have won a total of 13 awards, more than \nany other state.\n  By the way, Mr. President, North Carolina also has the distinction of \nhaving been home to the base that has won the award more often than any \nother in the country. While not selected this year, the Cherry Point \nMarine Corps Air Station has won its services' award on six occasions \noverall, four times in the past six years.\n  In fact, North Carolina's two Marine Corps bases have so dominated \nthe award that they have won it a total of ten times and kept it in our \nstate for the past six years.\n  Mr. President, I submit that it is no accident that North Carolina's \nmilitary installations fare so well in this annual competition. The \ncommunities which embrace our bases--Goldsboro, Fayetteville, \nJacksonville and Havelock--are filled with patriots who do everything \npossible to support the young men and women who put their lives on the \nline to protect our great nation. These North Carolina communities work \nclosely with our installation commanders to support their efforts to \nmake certain that our servicemen and women have everything they need to \nsafely and successfully accomplish their missions and to improve the \nquality of their lives.\n  In 1984, President Reagan appealed to the best instincts of the men \nand women in our military when he established this annual award. In so \ndoing, he has helped highlight a legacy of excellence among the \ninstallations in my home state.\n  Mr. President, needless to say, I'm extremely proud of our bases and \ncommunities and their achievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/07/senate-section/article/S4415-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \noutstanding accomplishments of Austin Gunder, a 15-year-old freshman at \nRed Lion High School in York County, PA. Austin recently competed with \nthe U.S. Junior Aeronautic International Free Flight Model Aircraft \nTeam in the Junior World Championship Contest held in Seaimovo Usti, \nCzech Republic.\n  A member of a six-person team selected by the Academy of Model \nAeronautics, AMA, Austin achieved the World Champion Ranking in what is \nknown as the ``F1J'' or the powered event. This event involves taking a \nmodel airplane designed and constructed by the contestant, putting a \nvery small engine and propeller on it, launching it vertically for an \nexact period of no more than seven seconds to the highest obtainable \naltitude, and then having the engine shut off with the airplane going \nhorizontal at exactly the right time to starts its timed free flight \nglide. This is all done by adjusting the small airplane to obtain peak \nperformance, and by testing and practicing to assure that every \noperation is perfect. The contestant must calculate the most favorable \ntemperature and winds for the 10-minute window in which to fly. Austin \nwas the only U.S. competitor, and he achieved World Champion Ranking 9 \nminutes into his flight beating out 13 other contestants from all over \nthe world who competed in the event.\n  Austin Gunder was featured on the cover of the February 2001 issue of \nModel Aviation, the official publication of the Academy of Model \nAeronautics, and will be honored at his high school by the Federal \nAviation Administration. Austin's World Champion status in the ``F1J'' \ncompetition is the highest honor of the model airplane organization.\n  Austin Gunder is an outstanding young man and a great example for \nyouth in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and across the country. I \npersonally commend him for his accomplishments in the field of \naeronautics and wish him the very best as he prepares himself for the \nfuture challenges that lie ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/07/senate-section/article/S4415-4", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4415-S4416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNITION OF HEATHER EAGLESTON\n\n Mr. HUTCHINSON. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Miss \nHeather Eagleston of Mountain Home, AR. Heather recently won the \nArkansas 2001 ``RespecTeen Speak for Yourself'' Contest. In her entry \nletter, Heather passionately described her personal experience with her \nbrother's tragic accident and resulting paralysis and the problems he \nnow faces everyday with disabilities discrimination. It was for \nfamilies like this one that we passed\n\n[[Page S4416]]\n\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act just over 10 years ago and, during \nthe 106th Congress, the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives improvement \nAct of 1999. However, as President Roosevelt once said, ``the credit \nbelongs to the man who is actually in the arena . . . who does actually \nstrive to do the deeds.'' In this case, that credit belongs to a \nthirteen-year-old girl, who has pledged herself in an effort to combat \ndiscrimination against the disabled, and who has already taken a \nnotable step in that direction. I salute Heather for her dedication and \ncongratulate her on this achievement.\n  Mr. President, I ask that Heather Eagleston's letter and a short \nbiography be printed in the Record.\n  The material follows:\n\n                                            Mountain Home, AR,\n\n                                                 January 16, 2001.\n     Hon. Asa Hutchinson,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Asa Hutchinson: Eliminating \n     discrimination against disabled people should be a national \n     priority. Even though legislation has been passed addressing \n     their problems, enforcement of existing laws still leaves the \n     disabled individual without even the most basic resources \n     necessary to pursue a normal life.\n       Access into public buildings, and equal employment \n     opportunities are essential to every citizen of our country. \n     More than half of the population believes that the disabled \n     are being discriminated against in the workforce.\n       The Rehabilitation Act, of 1973, requires all federal \n     agencies to take an affirmative action in hiring qualified \n     employees with disabilities. Currently, federal government \n     hires only 209,284 people with disabilities. That is only \n     seven percent of the entire work force.\n       In 1993 my brother was paralyzed in a car accident. His \n     medical bills were about one million dollars, and at that \n     time we had no insurance. My mother had to go to the hospital \n     administrative board and beg them to give my brother the \n     spinal surgery he needed to function. Fortunately, after a \n     long tedious process he did qualify for government \n     assistance.\n       We have come a long way. The government is making progress \n     but only in small parts. Since 1973 we have had about 20 laws \n     passed on disability rights. The current laws are not being \n     enforced. In 1990 the Americans with Disabilities Act was \n     signed into a law. This included provisions to access all \n     public accommodations. However in 1994, when my brother went \n     to get his senior portrait taken there was no wheelchair \n     access ramp for him to get in, nor in the school sanction. \n     This is only one example of a minor problem that illustrates \n     a major issue.\n       Initiate stricter penalties for those who will not abide by \n     the laws. Inform the public concerning the law the \n     consequences of ignoring the law.\n       I will set a standard in my life that focuses on the fact \n     that no United States citizen, despite whatever limitation \n     they might have, feels that their rights are limited due to \n     public ignorance or support from our government. I will speak \n     out for the right of all individuals.\n           Sincerely,\n     Heather Eagleston.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                RespecTeen Speak for Yourself Entry Form\n\n       Judging criteria: Letters will be judged on quality and \n     clarity of thought, quality of argument, effectiveness of \n     supporting data, quality of expression, sincerity and \n     originality, as well as adherence to rules regarding form and \n     length.

A bill to amend part C of title XI of the Social Security Act \nto provide for coordination of implementation of administrative \nsimplification standards for health care information; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to amend \nthe Administrative Simplification provisions of the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act. I am pleased that Senator Byron \nDorgan and Senator Mike Crapo are joining with me in this effort today.\n  I understand the benefits of administration simplification and \nsupport the goal of getting healthcare providers to use uniform codes \nto reduce overall costs through increased efficiencies. However, it was \noriginally intended for the entire package of administrative \nsimplification regulations to be released at one time. This would have \nallowed for system changes to be included in a comprehensive upgrade. \nThese final provisions are now expected to be released over time, which \nwill drive up the cost substantially for providers and health plans as \nthey will be forced to adapt their systems with every new regulation. \nFor example, identifiers for providers, plans and employers have yet to \nbe finalized, making it impossible to incorporate this information into \nnew computer systems.\n  In addition to the costs of repeatedly updating systems to be \nincurred by providers, the overall cost of compliance with the Health \nInsurance Portability and Accountability Act is expected to exceed the \ncosts of Y2K readiness. Small providers, like those in my state of \nIdaho, cannot afford the high cost in such a short time frame. A longer \ntimeframe will allow these small providers to pay incrementally for \nsystems upgrades.\n  In addition, if health plans and providers hurry implementation of \nthese provisions, there is the serious possibility that service \nproblems will arise for consumers, including inaccurate payments and \ncustomer service issues. A longer implementation timeframe will also \nallow providers and plans to address any unanticipated consequences as \nthey arise.\n  For these reasons, with my colleagues Senators Dorgan and Crapo, I am \nintroducing this legislation to delay implementation of the \nadministrative provisions until the later date of either October 16, \n2004 or two years after the final adoption of all regulations. The \nregulations that would be impacted by this legislation include \nelectronic transactions, code sets, security standards for the \nelectronic standards, and identifiers for health plans and providers. \nTo avoid confusion, let me be clear that this legislation does not \naffect implementation of the Health Insurance Portability and \nAccountability Act medical privacy issues and does not deal with unique \nhealth identifiers for individuals.\n  To ensure that providers, plans and the Department of Health and \nHuman Services are working towards compliance to these provisions, this \nlegislation calls for the General Accounting Office to evaluate the \nprogress of implementation no later than October 31, 2003.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4418]]\n\n                                 S. 836\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na safe harbor for determining that certain individuals are not \nemployees; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, for the past several months we have focused \nextensively on the need for tax relief and the means for achieving it. \nAs the chairman of the Committee on Small Business, I have argued time \nand again that the individual rate cuts included in the President's tax \npackage will have tremendous benefits for small-business owners, the \nvast majority of whom pay taxes at the individual rather than the \nentity level. And time is of the essence since many of these hard-\nworking Americans are now feeling real pain from the down turn in our \neconomy. While I continue to believe that tax relief deserves our \nimmediate attention, I cannot ignore another tax priority for small \nbusinesses, simplification of the tax code.\n  With the year 2000 tax-filing season now behind us, thousands of \nsmall-business owners have once again been reacquainted with the stark \nrealities of our current tax code. To keep that picture clearly in \nmind, let me remind my colleague of the results of an investigation \nthat the General Accounting Office provided to my committee in the last \nCongress. A small-business owner faces more than 200 Internal Revenue \nService, IRS, forms and schedules that could apply in a given year. \nWhile no business will have to file them all, it is a daunting universe \nof forms, including more than 8,000 lines, boxes, and data \nrequirements, which are accompanied by over 700 pages.\n  Even more disturbing is that in recent years more than three quarters \nof small-business owners hired a tax professional to help them fulfill \ntheir tax obligations. When we consider the complexity of the forms, \nrules, and regulations, no one should be surprised. And these tax \nprofessionals are far from inexpensive. By some estimates, small-\nbusiness owners pay more than 5 percent of their revenues just to \ncomply with the tax law, five cents out of every dollar to make sure \nthat all of the records are kept and the forms completed, all before \nthe tax check is even written.\n  The list of tax provisions crying out for simplification has grown \nconsiderably in recent years. Therefore, earlier this year, I \nintroduced the Small Business Works Act, (S. 189), which includes a \nnumber of tax-simplification proposals. Today, I rise to introduce \nadditional legislation focusing on a particularly troubling and long-\nstanding area of complexity for America's businesses and \nentrepreneurs--the status of independent contractors.\n  Beginning in the last decade and continuing today, there has been an \nimportant shift in the American workplace, with an increasing emphasis \non independent business relationships. The traditional single-employer \ncareer is rapidly being supplanted by independent entrepreneurs who \nprovide specialized services on an ``as needed'' basis. They seek out \nindividual contracts, apply their expertise, and move onto the next \nopportunity, bound only to their creativity and stamina. The members of \nthis new workforce are often described as independent \ncontractors, temps, freelancers, self-employed, home-based businesses, \nand even free agents. Whatever their title, they are a rapidly growing \nsegment of our economy and one that cannot be ignored.\n\n  Women in particular are playing an important role in this new \nbusiness reality. Since the National Women's Small Business Summit, \nwhich I hosted in Kansas City last June, I have heard a steady stream \nof success stories about women entrepreneurs who have left the \ntraditional workforce to start their own independent businesses, often \ntimes out of their homes. Today thousands of women are running dynamic \nbusinessess in fields like public and media relations, executive \nassistance, medical transcription, financial planning, management-\ninformation-systems consulting, and event planning, to name just a few.\n  There are a number of reasons for this new business paradigm. \nContinuing innovations in computer and communication technology have \nmade the ``victual'' office a reality and allow many Americans to \ncompete in marketplaces that not so long ago required huge investments \nin equipment and personnel. In addition, many men and women in this \ncountry have turned to home-based business in an effort to spend more \ntime with their children. By working at home, these families can \nbenefit from two incomes, while avoiding the added time and expense of \nday-care and commuting. Corporate downsizing, glass ceilings, and \ncompany politics, too, contribute to the growth in this sector as many \nskilled individuals convert their knowledge and experience from \ncorporate life into successful enterprises operated on their own.\n  The rewards of being an independent entrepreneur are also numerous. \nThe added flexibility and self-reliance of having your own business \nprovide not only economic rewards but also personal satisfaction. You \nare the boss. You set your own hours, develop your own business plans, \nand choose your customers and clients. In many ways, this new paradigm \nprovides the greatest avenue for the entrepreneurial spirit, which has \nlong been the driving force behind the success of this country.\n  With these rewards, however, come a number of obstacles, not the \nleast of which are burdens imposed by the Federal government. In fact, \nthe tax laws, and in particular the IRS, are frequently cited as the \nmost significant problems for independent entrepreneurs today. Changes \nin tax policy\n\n[[Page S4419]]\n\nmust be considered by this Congress to recognize this new paradigm and \nensure that our laws do not stall the growth and development of this \nsuccessful sector of our economy.\n  Since 1995, we have made substantial headway on a number of tax \nissues critical to these independent entrepreneurs. In the Taxpayer \nRelief Act of 1997, we restored the home-office deduction putting home-\nbased entrepreneurs on a level-playing field with storefront \nbusinesses. The Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996 and the \nTaxpayer Relief Act also made some important strides on the \nunbelievably complex pension rules so that the freelance writer, home-\nbased medical transcriber, and other small businesses have the \nopportunity to plan for their retirement as they see fit. Finally, and \narguably most importantly, through several pieces of legislation in the \nlast six years, we have finally made the self-employed health-insurance \ndeduction permanent and placed it on a path to full deductibility by \n2003, although still too long in my opinion. These examples are just a \nfew of the tax law changes already enacted that are helping men and \nwomen who chose to work as independent entrepreneurs to enjoy a level-\nplaying field with their larger competitors and still maintain the \nflexibility of their independent business lives.\n\n  Amid this progress, however, one glaring problem still remains \nunsolved for this growing segment of the workplace--there are no \nsimple, clear, and objective rules for determining who is an \nindependent contractor and who is an employee. Through the Committee on \nSmall Business, I have heard from countless small-business owners who \nare caught in the environment of fear and confusion that now surround \nthe classification of workers. This situation is stifling the \nentrepreneurial spirit of many entrepreneurs who find that they do not \nhave the flexibility to conduct their businesses in a manner that makes \nthe best economic sense and that serves their personal and family \ngoals. And it is the antithesis of the new business paradigm.\n  The root of this problem is found in the IRS' test for determining \nwhether a worker is an independent contractor or an employee. Over the \npast three decades, the IRS has relied on a 20-factor test based on the \ncommon law to make this determination. At first glance, a 20-factor \ntest sounds like a reasonable approach, if our home-based financial \nplanner demonstrates a majority of the factors, she is an independent \ncontractor. Not surprisingly, the IRS' test is not that simple. It is a \ncomplex set of extremely subjective criteria with no clear weight \nassigned to any of the factors. As a result, small-business taxpayers \nare not able to predict which of the 20 factors will be most important \nto a particular IRS agent, and finding a certain number of these \nfactors in any given case does not guarantee the outcome.\n  To make matters worse, the IRS' determination inevitably occurs two \nor three years after the parties have determined in good faith that \nthey have an independent-contractor relationship. And the consequences \ncan be devastating. For example, the business that contracts with a \nmanagement-information-systems consultant is forced to reclassify the \nconsultant from an independent contractor to an employee and must come \nup with the payroll taxes the IRS says should have been collected in \nthe prior years. Interest and penalties are also piled on. The result \nfor many small businesses is a tax bill that bankrupts the company. But \nthat is not the end of the story. The IRS then goes after the \nconsultant, who is now classified as an employee, and disallows a \nportion of her business expenses, again resulting in additional taxes, \ninterest, and penalties.\n  All of us recognize that the IRS has a duty to collect Federal \nrevenues and enforce the tax laws. The problem in this case is that the \nIRS is using a procedure that is patently unfair and subjective and one \nthat forces today's independent entrepreneurs into the business model \nof the 1950s. The result is that businesses must spend thousands of \ndollars on lawyers and accountants to try to satisfy the IRS' \nprocedures, but with no certainty that the conclusions will be \nrespected. That is no way for businesses to operate in today's rapidly \nchanging economy.\n  For its part, the IRS adopted a worker-classification training manual \nseveral years ago. According to then-Commissioner Richardson, the \nmanual was an ``attempt to identify, simplify, and clarify the relevant \nfacts that should be evaluated in order to accurately determine worker \nclassification. . . .'' While I support the agency's efforts to address \nthis issue, the manual represents one of the most compelling reasons \nfor immediate action. The IRS' training manual is more than 150 pages \nin length and is riddled with references to court cases and rulings. If \nit takes that many pages to teach revenue agents how to ``simplify and \nclarify'' this small-business tax issue, I can only imagine how an \nindependent event planner is going to feel when she tries to figure it \nout on her own.\n  In recognition of the new paradigm and the IRS' archaic 20-factor \ntest, I am introducing the ``Independent Contractor Determination Act \nof 2001.'' This bill is substantially similar to the legislation I have \nintroduced in the past two Congresses to resolve the classification \nproblem for independent entrepreneurs. It removes the need for so many \npages of instruction on the IRS' 20-factor test by establishing clear \nrules for classifying workers based on objective criteria. Under these \ncriteria, if there is a written agreement between the parties, and if \nour medical transcriber demonstrates economic independence and \nindependence with respect to the workplace, based on objective criteria \nset forth in the bill, she will be treated as an independent contractor \nrather than an employee. Moreover, the service recipient, e.g., the \ndoctor or hospital, will not be treated as an employer. In addition, \nindividuals who perform services through their own corporation or \nlimited-liability company will also qualify as independent contractors \nas long as there is a written agreement and the individuals provide for \ntheir own benefits.\n  The safe harbor is simple, straightforward, and final. To take \nadvantage of it, payments above $600 per year to an individual service \nprovider must be reported to the IRS, just as is required under current \nlaw. This will help ensure that taxes properly due to the Treasury will \ncontinue to be collected.\n  While the IRS contends that there are millions of independent \ncontractors who should be classified as employees, which costs the \nFederal government billions of dollars a year, this assertion is \nplainly incorrect. Classification of a worker has no cost to the \ngovernment. What costs the government are taxpayers who do not pay \ntheir taxes.\n  The Independent Contractor Determination Act has three requirements \nthat will improve compliance among independent contractors using the \nnew rules set forth in the bill. First, there must be a detailed, \nwritten agreement between the parties--this will put the home-based \nmedia-relations consultant on notice at the outset that she is \nresponsible for her own tax payments. Second, the new rules will not \napply if the service recipient does not comply with the reporting \nrequirements and issue 1099s to individuals who perform services. \nThird, an independent contractor operating through her own corporation \nor limited-liability company must file all required income and \nemployment tax returns in order to be protected under the bill.\n  The bill also addresses concerns that have been raised about \npermitting individuals who provide their services through their own \ncorporation or limited-liability company to qualify as independent \ncontractors. Because some have contended that this option would lead to \nabusive situations at the expense of workers who should be treated as \nemployees, the bill continues to limit the number of former employees \nthat a service recipient may engage as independent contractors under \nthe incorporation option. This limit will protect against misuse of the \nincorporation option while still allowing individuals to start their \nown businesses and have a former employer as one of their initial \nclients.\n  Much has also been made to the improperly classified employee who is \ndenied benefits by the unscrupulous employer. This issue raises two \nimportant points. First, the legislation that I am introducing would \nnot facilitate this troubling situation. Under the provisions of the \nbill, it is highly doubtful that a typical employee, like a janitor, \nwould qualify as an independent contractor. In reality, this issue \nrelates to\n\n[[Page S4420]]\n\nenforcement, which my bill simply makes easier through clear and \nobjective rules. Second, the issue of benefits, like health insurance \nand pension plans, is extremely important to independent entrepreneurs. \nBut the answer is not to force them to all be employees. Rather, we \nshould continue to enact legislation like the Small Business Job \nProtection Act, the Taxpayer Relief Act, and the legislation vetoed by \nthe Clinton Administration, that permit full deductibility of health \ninsurance for the self-employed and better access to retirement savings \nplans.\n  The Independent Contractor Determination Act also addresses a special \nconcern of technical-service providers, such as engineers, designers, \ndrafters, computer programmers, and system analysts. In certain cases, \nSection 1706 of the 1986 Tax Reform Act precludes businesses engaging \nindividuals in these professions from applying the reclassification \nprotections under section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978. When section \n1706 was enacted, its proponents argued that technical-service workers \nwere less compliant in paying their taxes. Later examination of this \nissue by the Treasury Department found that technical-service workers \nare in fact more likely to pay their taxes than most other types of \nindependent contractors. This revelation underscores the need to repeal \nsection 1706 and level the playing field for individuals in these \nprofessions.\n  In the last three Congresses, proposals to repeal section 1706 \nenjoyed wide bipartisan support. The Independent Contractor \nDetermination Act is designed to treat individuals in these professions \nfairly by providing the businesses that engage them with the same \nprotections that businesses using other types of independent \ncontractors have enjoyed for more than 20 years.\n  Another major concern of many businesses and independent \nentrepreneurs is the issue of reclassification. The bill I am \nintroducing provides relief to these taxpayers when the IRS determines \nthat a worker was misclassified. If the business and the independent \ncontractor have a written agreement, if the applicable reporting \nrequirements were met, and if there was a reasonable basis for the \nparties to believe that the worker is an independent contractor, then \nan IRS reclassification will only apply prospectively. This provision \ngives important peace of mind to small businesses that act in good \nfaith by removing the unpredictable threat of retroactive \nreclassification and substantial interest and penalties.\n\n  For too long, independent entrepreneurs and the businesses with which \nthey work have struggled for a neutral tax environment. For an equally \nlong time, that tax environment has been unfairly and unnecessarily \nbiased against them. It is well past time that the tax code embraces \none of the fundamental tenets of our country, the free market. We must \nallow individuals the freedom to pursue new opportunities in the ever-\nchanging marketplace through business relationships that make the best \nsense for them. Our tax code should facilitate those opportunities \nthrough fair and simple rules that permit the freelance writer, home-\nbased day-care provider, and every other independent entrepreneur to \npay their taxes without under interference from the government. Trying \nto force today's dynamic workforce into a 1950s model serves no one. It \nonly stands to stifle the entrepreneurial spirit in this country and \ndampen the continued success of our economy.\n  The Independent Contractor Determination Act is a common-sense \nmeasure that answers the urgent plea from independent entrepreneurs and \nthe businesses that engage them for fairness and simplicity in the tax \nlaw. As we work toward the day when the entire tax law is based on \nthese principles, we can make a positive difference today by enacting \nthis legislation. Entrepreneurs have waited too long, let's get the job \ndone!\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a description \nof its provisions be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 837\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The bill is designed to \n     provide certainty for businesses that enter into independent-\n     contractor relationships and minimize the risk of huge tax \n     bills for back taxes interest, and penalties if a worker is \n     misclassified after the parties have entered into an \n     independent-contractor relationship in good faith.\n       Clear Rules for Worker Classification: Under the bill's new \n     worker-classification rules, an individual will be treated as \n     an independent contractor and the service recipient will not \n     be treated as an employer if either of two tests is met--the \n     ``general test'' or the ``incorporation test.''\n       General Test: The general test requires that the \n     independent contractor demonstrate economic independence and \n     workplace independence in addition to a written contract with \n     the service recipient.\n       Economic independence exists if the independent contractor \n     has the ability to realize a profit or loss and agrees to \n     perform services for a particular amount of time or to \n     complete a specific result or task. In addition, the \n     independent contractor must either have a significant \n     investment in the assets of his or her business or incur \n     unreimbursed expenses that are consistent with industry \n     practice and that equal at least 2% of the independent \n     contractor's gross income from the performance of services \n     during the taxable year.\n       Workplace independence exists if one of the following \n     applies: The independent contractor has a principal place of \n     business (including a ``home office'' as expanded by the \n     Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997); he or she performs services at \n     more than one service recipients facilities; he or she pays a \n     fair-market rent for the use of the service recipient's \n     facilities; or the independent contractor uses his or her own \n     equipment.\n       The written contract between the independent contractor and \n     the service recipient must provide that the independent \n     contractor will not be treated as an employee and is \n     responsible for his or her own taxes.\n       Incorporation Test: Under this test, an individual will be \n     treated as an independent contractor if he or she conducts \n     business through a corporation or a limited-liability \n     company. In addition, the independent contractor must be \n     responsible for his or her own benefits, instead of receiving \n     benefits from the service recipient. The independent \n     contractor must also have a written contract with the service \n     provider stating that the independent contractor will not \n     be treated as an employee and is responsible for his or \n     her own taxes.\n       To prevent the incorporation test from being abused, the \n     bill limits the number of former employees that a service \n     recipient may engage as independent contractors under this \n     test. The limitation is based on the number of people \n     employed by the service recipient in the preceding year and \n     is equal to the greater of 10 persons or 3% of the service \n     recipient's employees in the preceding year. For example, \n     Business X has 500 employees in 2000. In 2001 up to 15 \n     employees (the greater of 3% of Business X's 500 employees in \n     2000 or 10 individuals) could incorporate their own \n     businesses and still have Business X as one of their initial \n     clients.\n\n[[Page S4422]]\n\n     This limitation would not affect the number of incorporated \n     independent contractors who were not former employees of the \n     service recipient or independent contractors meeting the \n     general test.\n       Additional Provisions: The new worker-classification rules \n     also apply to three-party situations in which the independent \n     contractor is paid by a third party, such as a payroll \n     company, rather than directly by the service recipient. The \n     new worker-classification rules, however, will not apply to a \n     service recipient or a third-party payor if they do not \n     comply with the existing reporting requirements and file \n     1099s for individuals who work as independent contractors. A \n     limited exception is provided for cases in which the failure \n     to file a 1099 is due to reasonable cause and not willful \n     neglect.\n       New Worker-Classification Rules Do Not Replace Other \n     Options: In the event that the new worker-classification \n     rules do not apply, the bill makes clear that the independent \n     contractor or service recipient can still rely on the 20-\n     factor common law test or other provisions of the Internal \n     Revenue Code applicable in determining whether an individual \n     is an independent contractor or employee. In addition, the \n     bill does not limit any relief to which a taxpayer may be \n     entitled under Section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978. The \n     bill also makes clear that the new rules will not be \n     construed as a prerequisite for these other provisions of the \n     law.\n       Relief From Reclassification: The bill provides relief from \n     reclassification by the IRS of an independent contractor as \n     an employee. For many service recipients who make a good-\n     faith effort to classify the worker correctly, this event can \n     result in extensive liability for back employment taxes, \n     interest, and penalties.\n       Relief Under the New Worker-Classification Rules: The bill \n     provides relief for cases in which a worker is treated as an \n     independent contractor under the new worker-classification \n     rules and the IRS later contends that the new rules do not \n     apply. In that case, the burden of proof will fall on the \n     IRS, rather than the taxpayer, to prove that the new worker-\n     classification rules do not apply. To qualify for this relief \n     the taxpayer must demonstrate a credible argument that it was \n     reasonable to treat the service provider as an independent \n     contractor under the new rules, and the taxpayer must fully \n     cooperate with reasonable requests from the IRS.\n       Protection Against Retroactive Reclassification: If the IRS \n     notifies a service recipient that an independent contractor \n     should have been classified as an employee (under the new or \n     old rules), the bill provides that the IRS' determination can \n     become effective only 30 days after the date that the IRS \n     sends the notification. To qualify for this provision, the \n     service recipient must show that:\n       There was a written agreement between the parties;\n       The service recipient satisfied the applicable reporting \n     requirements for all taxable years covered by the contract; \n     and\n       There was a reasonable basis for determining that the \n     independent contractor was not an employee and the service \n     provider made the determination in good faith.\n       The bill provides similar protection for independent \n     contractors who are notified by the IRS that they should have \n     been treated as an employee.\n       The protection against retroactive reclassification is \n     intended to remove some of the uncertainty for businesses \n     contracting with independent contractors, especially those \n     who must use the IRS' 20-factor common law test. While the \n     bill would prevent the IRS from forcing a service recipient \n     to treat an independent contractor as an employee for past \n     years, the bill makes clear that a service recipient or an \n     independent contractor can still challenge the IRS' \n     prospective reclassification of an independent contractor \n     through administrative or judicial proceedings.\n       Repeal of Section 1706 of the Revenue Act of 1978: The bill \n     repeals section 530(d) of the Revenue Act of 1978, which was \n     added by section 1706 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986. This \n     provision precludes businesses that engage technical service \n     providers (e.g., engineers, designers, drafters, computer \n     programmers, systems analysts, and other similarly qualified \n     individuals) in certain cases from applying the \n     reclassification protections under section 530. The bill is \n     designed to level the playing field for individuals in these \n     professions by providing the businesses that engage them with \n     the same protections that businesses using other types of \n     independent contractors have enjoyed for more than 20 years.\n       Effective Dates: In general, the independent-contractor \n     provisions of the bill, including the new worker-\n     classification rules, will be effective for services \n     performed after the date of enactment of the bill. The \n     protection against retroactive reclassification will be \n     effective for IRS determinations after the date of enactment, \n     and the repeal of section 530(d) will be effective for \n     periods ending after the date of enactment of the bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 838. A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nimprove the safety and efficacy of pharmaceuticals for children; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator \nDeWine in introducing the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. I hope \nthat this will be the continuation of our long-term efforts to improve \nthe health of America's children.\n  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, only 20 percent of \nthe drugs on the market have been tested and labeled specifically for \ntheir safety and effectiveness in children. Children are simply not \nsmaller version of adults, their bodies actually react to drugs \ndifferently. The absence of pediatric labeling poses significant risks \nfor children, without adequate information about how a drug works in \nchildren of different ages and sizes, children are more likely to be \nunder- or over-dosed or to experience dangerous side effects.\n  We have labels on the food children eat, on the shows they watch and \nthe music they listen to. Why should we have less information when it \ncomes to the medicine they take? And while ``off-labeling prescribing'' \nis neither illegal nor improper, forcing our children to use \nmedications without adequate safety information, is a lot like playing \nRussian roulette with their health.\n  That's why four years ago, Senator DeWine and I introduced \nlegislation to take the guess work out of children's medicine. This \nlegislation, the Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, provided a \nmarket incentive for drug companies to test their products for use in \nchildren or to create kid-friendly drug formulations. And, just a few \nyears later, we've made extraordinary strides in closing the dangerous \ngap in knowledge.\n  In the 3 years since the initiative was launched, over 300 pediatric \ndrug studies have gotten underway, compared to the 11 studies conducted \nin the 6 years prior to the legislation. New pediatric information has \nbeen or will soon be added to the labels of 28 products, including \ndrugs for AIDS, diabetes, mental health, and asthma. Not only has the \ninitiative led to significant advances in pediatric medicines, in the \nlong run it will also save the nation money by reducing hospital stays, \ndoctors' visits and parents' taking time off of work.\n  But while tremendous progress has been made, we still have a long way \nto go to make sure that children aren't an afterthought when it comes \nto pharmaceutical research. Hundreds of drugs are on the market today \nthat are used in children, but still have not been tested for pediatric \nneeds. Yet, unless reauthorized, the pediatric testing incentive, and \nthe explosion of research it has prompted, will expire on January 1, \n2002.\n  In addition to ensuring that critical pediatric drug studies \ncontinue, the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act will also ensure \nthat the new safety information from pediatric studies is promptly \nadded to drug labels, require drug manufacturers to pay user fees to \nparticipate in the program, and require the Food and Drug \nAdministration to quickly disseminate information gathered from \npediatric studies to pediatricians and parents. It will also fund \nstudies of older, ``off-patent'' drugs which are not eligible for the \nexisting pediatric testing incentive, and create a new Office of \nPediatric Therapeutics at the Food and Drug Administration to \ncoordinate activities related to children.\n\n  The bill is endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the \nElizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, the National Association of \nChildren's Hospitals, the American Society for Clinical Pharmacology \nand Therapeutics, and the Allergy and Asthma Network Mother of \nAsthmatics.\n  I call on my colleagues to move quickly to enact the Best \nPharmaceuticals for Children Act, commonsense legislation that will \nensure that our children received only the very best of what medicine \nhas to offer.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 838\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Best Pharmaceuticals for \n     Children Act''.\n\n[[Page S4423]]\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I rise today to join my friend and \ncolleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, to introduce a bill that \nbuilds on a previous law that he and I wrote four years ago, called the \n``Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act.'' The bill we are \nintroducing today the ``Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act'', re-\nauthorizes our 1997 law and makes additional improvements.\n  I'd like to thank Senator Dodd for his tireless dedication to this \neffort and to other vital children's health initiatives. We have worked \ntogether on many bipartisan efforts that protect children, and I \ncommend him for his commitment to ensuring that all children are safe \nand healthy. I also would like to recognize the efforts of Elaine \nVining with the American Academy of Pediatrics and Mark Isaac with the \nElizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, who have devoted countless \nhours to providing us with technical assistance and ideas for how to \nimprove our already successful pediatric studies law.\n  Under our law, the FDA has granted market exclusivity extensions for \n28 products, of which 18 include new labeling. Let me tell you what \nthis means for me as a parent: We now have dosage, safety and adverse \nevent information that we did not previously have to help us provide \nour children the correct dose of these medicines and to avoid potential \nadverse effects. The more information doctors and parents have on \ndosing, toxicity, adverse effects, and adverse drug interactions--the \nmore informed our decisions will be when giving medicines to children \nand ultimately, the more we will be protecting our kids.\n  Creating the proper formulation, such as a liquid form, of a drug is \nalso essential. I know that my children all went through a stage in \nwhich a pill form was problematic for them to swallow or the taste of \nthe medicine was unacceptable. Having a child spit out a tablet or \nhaving to crush a tablet in order to give half of the recommended adult \ndose are compliance issues that we, as parents, have all experienced.\n  When Senator Dodd and I set out in 1997 to change the fact that only \n20 percent of all prescription drugs marketed in this country were \nlabeled for pediatric use, we heard many proposals on how to fix the \nproblem, from giving tax incentives for research to offering this \nmarket exclusivity extension. Since children only account for 30 \npercent of the population and less than 12 percent of personal health \ncare spending, they were not getting the kind of pediatric-focused \nresearch that they deserve.\n  Because of the help and support of many of my colleagues like \nSenators Frist, Kennedy, Jeffords, Bond, Mikulski, Hutchinson, Collins, \nand many others who helped us pass this landmark law, we have begun to \nturn the tide in favor of children. In considering any proposals to \nchange the current law, however, we must not lose sight of the fact \nthat the goal of this law is to encourage pediatric studies of new and \nalready marketed drugs that are currently used in children, but are not \nlabeled for such use. Anything that hinders the ability of the FDA to \nimplement this law will impede future progress in pediatric research \nand ultimately defeat the purposes of this law.\n  FDA and others, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the \nElizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, have offered many helpful \nsuggestions on how we can improve the current law. The most significant \nimprovement I would like to stress is something our original law was \nnever intended to address--the issue of how to get off-patent drugs \ntested for use in children. The market exclusivity extension only works \nas a pediatric testing incentive if a company has an existing patent to \nwhich we can attach an additional six months of market exclusivity. \nOnce the patent expires, however, there is no way to prevent \ncompetition from entering the market for that drug.\n  So, in the new bill that Senator Dodd and I are introducing today--\nthe ``Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act'', we propose creating a \n``Research Fund.'' This Fund would require the Secretary of HHS to \naward contracts for entities with expertise in conducting pediatric \nclinical trials (such as PPRU's, hospitals, universities) to conduct \npediatric studies of certain drugs that are off-patent. The list of \nthese off-patent drugs would be developed according to criteria--such \nas whether new studies might produce health benefits for children, and \nthen prioritized and published by the Secretary, acting through the NIH \nDirector and in consultation with the FDA Commissioner and experts in \npediatric research. Written requests would be issued by the FDA \nCommissioner.\n  The significance of this Research Fund is that off-patent drugs, like \nRitalin, would be tested for pediatric use. Currently, many drugs are \nbeing prescribed off-label, based on limited, if any, pediatric studies \nand/or on the personal experiences of health professionals. Ritalin, \nfor example, includes the following precaution and warning:\n\n       Precaution: Long-term effects of Ritalin in children have \n     not been well established. Warning: Ritalin should not be \n     used in children under six years, since safety and \n     [effectiveness] in this age group has not been established.\n\n  The point is that Ritalin is being prescribed off-label for children \nunder six, and yet we don't know the safety and long-term effects on \nchildren. This Research Fund would establish the means by which testing \non this and other off-patent drugs could be performed.\n  Our new bill makes other improvements to current law including: \nexpediting the dissemination of information generated by pediatric \nstudies to the public; expediting labeling changes; acknowledging the \nneed to study the neonate, zero to one month in age, population if \nappropriate and at the appropriate point in pediatric studies; applying \nprescription drug user fees to pediatric studies to give FDA the \nresources\n\n[[Page S4425]]\n\nit needs to conduct timely reviews of studies and labeling changes; and \nestablishing an Office of Pediatric Therapeutics within FDA to \ncoordinate activities among review divisions and provide oversight for \nall pediatric activities undertaken by FDA.\n  Finally, I would like to address a concern that has been expressed by \nmany in the press, and rightfully so. No one can ignore the risk \ninvolved in having children participate in clinical trials. Parents \nwith sick children, sadly, have to weigh these risks and make treatment \ndecisions. I want to commend Senator Dodd for his foresight in this \narea of providing research protections for children involved in \nclinical trials. With the increase in pediatric research through this \nlaw and other laws, we needed to ensure that research protections exist \nand are strengthened, if necessary.\n  That is why last year, in the ``Children's Health Act,'' Senator Dodd \nand I proposed language that would ensure that federally funded, \nconducted, and regulated research adheres to scientific and ethical \nreview standards. There is currently a review of these federal \nprotections for children involved in clinical trials to further ensure \nthat the highest standards of scientific and ethical review are in \nplace. The alternative to clinical trials is uncontrolled, unregulated, \nand unreported studies of smaller groups of children. Pediatric experts \nagree that controlled clinical trials are the much-preferred \nalternative.\n  We must make the health of our children a priority. Through our new \nbill we are doing that. We are furthering the success of current law by \nproviding parents and doctors with more information to make better \ninformed decisions when medicating children. Our children deserve no \nless.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important measure.\n                                 F_____\n                                 \n      By Mrs. HUTCHISON (for herself, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Hutchinson, Mr. \n        Burns, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Helms, Mrs. \n        Clinton, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Biden):\n  S. 839. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nincrease the amount of payment for inpatient hospital services under \nthe medicare program and to freeze the reduction in payments to \nhospitals for indirect costs of medical education; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, along with \nSenators Bayh, Hutchinson, and several other distinguished colleagues, \nthe American Hospital Preservation Act.\n  Our hospitals are the very foundation of our health care system, a \nsystem that is considered the best in the world. To ensure this quality \nof care remains at this high level, we cannot ask yet more cuts of our \nfinancially troubled hospitals.\n  Two such cuts currently being faced by our nation's hospitals are a \nreduction in the annual inflation update hospitals receive for their \nMedicare payments, and a reduction in the Medicare adjustment teaching \nhospitals receive to support their medical education programs. Both of \nthese issues are critical to the long-term stability of hospitals, and \nto maintaining the scope and quality of the care they provide.\n  We do have the best health care in the world. Why should we put it at \nrisk? Especially when the savings we have achieved already are far in \nexcess of what was originally estimated. In other words, the cuts that \nwere enacted have more than achieved their goals. There is no more fat \nleft to trim.\n  Last year, through enactment of the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP \nBenefit Improvement and Protection Act, BIPA, we were successful in \ngetting approximately half of the annual market basket update restored \nfor our hospitals. In addition, we delayed further reductions in the \nindirect medical education, IME, adjustment for teaching hospitals. \nThis legislation would build upon that success, and would help to \nensure hospitals' long-term financial stability. In effect, it would \npreserve the ability of American hospitals to continue to provide the \nhighest level of health care to be found anywhere in the world.\n  With respect to the IME provisions of this bill, all of the evidence \npoints to the fact that the financial health of major teaching \nhospitals continues to deteriorate. In fact, with projections that \nMedicare margins could drop to negative 3.8 percent by 2005, it is \nbecoming an increasingly common phenomenon that when a Medicare patient \nwalks in to a hospital, he or she represents a money loser for that \ninstitution. While our hospitals must remain committed to providing \ncare no matter the patients' circumstance, that sort of monetary \nshortfall will logically result in many hospitals closing down. Or, as \nwe have seen happen many times recently, many hospitals will \ndramatically scale back their outpatient and other services for those \nin need.\n  Particularly in the rural areas of our nation, having a hospital \nclose down would mean losing access to life-saving medical services. It \nwould also have a dramatic effect on the community's economy. Hospitals \nare often the core components of the local community. To have the \nhospital close down would mean the loss of jobs and of businesses. It \nwould have a ripple effect on the neighborhood, destroying its sense of \nstability and community.\n  This legislation addresses the unique situation of teaching \nhospitals. These hospitals, which are centers of experimental, \ninnovative and technically sophisticated services as well as routine \ncare and services, tend to incur much higher costs. We must recognize \nthe higher costs these teaching hospitals incur to provide adequate \nlearning experiences and faculty support to medical students. To do \nthis, we must increase the indirect medical education adjustment one \npercentage point to 6.4 percent for FY 2003 and the future.\n  In addition, this legislation will reverse cuts previously enacted by \nCongress regarding the annual market basket updates. These cuts are \nunnecessary and harmful. For a hospital to effectively compete for \nskilled workers, especially in these days of tight labor markets, it is \ncritical to have an adequate overall revenue stream. Medicare's measure \nof inflation, the market basket update, plays a key role in determining \nthe adequacy of these payments from year to year.\n  As hospital costs increase rapidly in every area from labor to \npharmaceuticals to blood and blood products to the costs of compliance \nwith new regulations, the market basket update must keep pace. This \nlegislation eliminates the update reductions mandated earlier.\n  It is critical that we not neglect our health care system and that we \ncontinue to invest in the very foundation of that system, our \nhospitals. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle to ensure that this bill meets that objective yet still \nfits within our overall budgetary constraints.\n  This legislation represents our obligation to not only our most \nvulnerable citizens, but also to all Americans. Our hospitals provide \nthe highest level and quality of care in the world. This bill ensures \nthat they will be able to continue to do so, and I urge my colleagues \nto cosponsor and support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/07/senate-section/article/S4425-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4425]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 378.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity to be back on \nthis extremely important piece of legislation on which many of us, on \nboth sides of the aisle, have worked on these past weeks. With the \nleadership of President Bush, we have made every kind of effort, \nbecause of the importance of education, to try to find common ground.\n  We remember very well the debates and discussions we had a little \nover a year ago when we were at such odds and unable to move ahead with \nthe reauthorization bill. The other side wanted to abolish the \nDepartment of Education. How far we have come. Now we are together with \na unanimous vote out of our Committee to move this reauthorization bill \nforward, although there are those who still have some concerns about \nthe legislation they have spoken to in these past days and will speak \nto as we continue to debate this legislation over the course of this \nweek and I expect coming into next week as well.\n  We all understand this legislation is really about our future. It is \ncalled the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, but it really is a \nrecognition that we have 20 percent of our children in this country \nliving in poverty and about 50 percent of those are eligible for \ncoverage by the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  We are trying to bring some focus and attention to these children in \ntheir early years so they will be able to be a part of the great \nAmerican dream. We recognize if they do not get off to a Head Start or \nEarly Start or Smart Start, and they are not qualified when they go to \nschool, not able to learn, it is extremely difficult, if not \nimpossible, for them to go through the education system and continue to \ndevelop skills in college or afterwards, or in alternative training \nprograms, and be a part of a new economy in the United States and \nthroughout the world.\n\n  All of us understand that in many respects, of all the things we are \ngoing to do this year, this debate will say more about what kind of \ncountry we are going to be in 10 or 15 years than anything else we do. \nThis debate is about the future. This is about our children. This is \nabout the seriousness with which we, at this time in American history, \nare prepared to invest in those children to give them the opportunity \nto be a part of our society.\n  We cannot knock down all the walls of unfairness in our society, but \none thing we know for sure: If a child does not start off with the \nability to learn and is not challenged in those early years of \neducation, it is difficult to believe they will be equipped to play a \nmeaningful role in our society.\n  In many respects this is a defining issue. It is a defining value of \nour country. Do we really believe in equality for our people? All \nAmericans understand the very special role of public education in our \nsociety and what a difference it has made to our greatness as nation. \nWe, in each generation, have to find ways to make sure that playing \nfield is going to be fair and equal and that those children who will be \ncoming up all across this Nation, and their families, can have \nconfidence in our public school system. That ought to be generally \napplicable for children from\n\n[[Page S4434]]\n\nhomes of every income, but we all understand children who come from \neconomically challenged situations are facing additional problems.\n  We have tried to work together on these challenges. We have \nlegislation that reflects the best judgment of those on the other side \nof the aisle as well as this side of the aisle. We are prepared to see \nthis legislation move forward. As we go through this week, we will \nconsider changes on the legislation, but we are prepared to see this \nlegislation move forward. It has important provisions on \naccountability. It has accountability for schools, it has \naccountability for parents, it has accountability for children. It \nprovides some resources to make those services available.\n  But if there is one overwhelming flaw in this legislation--and it is \nan overwhelming flaw--it is that after all is said and done about the \nimportance of this legislation, we are failing to give the life to the \nlegislation which it is capable of providing to so many of the children \nbecause we are not providing the services contemplated in this \nlegislation to all the children who need it. We will not be providing \nthe services to the children, about which those who talk about this \nlegislation too frequently and glibly talk.\n  We have to provide support for needy children. We have to do it by \nproviding resources. You cannot have education on the cheap. You cannot \nhave an education budget that is a tin cup budget. We have to invest in \nour children. That is what this debate is about, investing in our \nchildren.\n  It is important for the country, as we are debating these issues, to \nunderstand exactly what we have done and what we have not done. The \ngood news is that the Senate, in a bipartisan way last Friday, with the \nstrong bipartisan leadership from Senators Harkin and Hagel, agreed to \nensure that the Federal Government is going to meet its \nresponsibilities to local communities and, most important, to disabled \nchildren in our communities. What a help that is going to be for \nmillions of children. Full IDEA funding necessary will be available for \nchildren with disabilities. That is the guarantee that was made more \nthan 25 years and never lived up to. Only a third of full funding \nwas provided. Now we will be able to help every child with a \ndisability.\n\n  In a very positive way in another very important bipartisan effort, \nSenator Dodd and Senator Collins made the compelling case that if we \nare going to provide assistance to needy children under the Title I \nprogram, then we ought to provide it to every needy child.\n  We have been unable to get a similar commitment from the \nadministration, from the President of the United States, on the funding \nof the Title I program. The initiatives provided by the President are \ninadequate to even get to 50 percent of the children, let alone 100 \npercent of the children, even though in the underlying legislation we \neffectively promise a fair chance at proficiency to all children, under \nthe Title I program.\n  That is enormously troublesome. If we do not provide the funding, \nwhich we are strongly committed to on this side of the aisle--and with \nnotable recognition of a number of our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle who have supported those efforts--then, frankly, this \nlegislation may become just a cliche. It will be just a cliche for two-\nthirds of the children who are eligible for Title I, but who do not \nreceive full services.\n  Someone watching this debate over recent times must wonder what \nhappened here in the Senate. If they watched the debate on the budget a \nfew weeks ago, they saw the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin, talk about \nhaving some $250 billion of tax reductions that would go to support \nincreased education funding.\n  That passed overwhelmingly. I think that was a very clear indication \nabout the priorities in the Senate and the priorities across this \ncountry.\n  We are taking less than 10 percent of the tax break, which has a \ngreat percentage going to the wealthiest individuals, and saying, let's \nfund the Early Start Program, the Smart Start Program, and the Head \nStart Program. Head Start is only funded at a 40 to 45 percent level, \nand in some of the poorest areas of this country, only 25 percent of \neligible children can be served because of inadequate funding. These \nare eligible children about which we are talking. Their parents want \nthem to be able to get the Head Start Program. And they are told, no. \nWhy? Because we are making a judgment in this body that the reduction \nin the tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals ought to have a \npreference over children who are in some of the most challenging and \ndifficult circumstances.\n  Under the Harkin amendment, we effectively have full funding for the \nHead Start Program. We would have substantial funding increases in the \nTitle I program. We would provide more help and assistance under the \nPell Grant program for children who are academically gifted and \ntalented, but don't have the resources to afford colleges.\n  The Harkin amendment was a real indication of our Nation's \npriorities. What happened to it? We will see on the budget bill that \ncomes back from the House of Representatives. We can ask ourselves: Did \nthe Republican leadership consider the vote on the floor of the Senate \nof $250 billion for education? Did they include $200 billion? No, they \ndidn't include $200 billion. Did they include $150 billion? No, they \ndidn't include $150 billion. Did they have $100 billion? No. Fifty \nbillion dollars? No. Twenty-five billion dollars? No. Five billion \ndollars? No.\n  Zero, Mr. President; zero.\n  That comes directly from the White House. We wouldn't have that \nunless the White House had given those instructions. Republican \nleadership and the White House--zero for education funding increases.\n  We have had debates about money isn't everything. We have had it said \nthat money is not going to solve all of these problems. We are going to \nhave a modest increase in terms of the budget over future years. Next \nyear it is going to be an increase of 5 percent on the budget.\n  That was interesting to me because we have seen what has been the \nincrease in education over the period of the last 5 years. It has gone \nup 12.8 percent a year in the last 5 years at a time even when we had \nsizable deficits--12.8 percent in the last 5 years.\n  Now we have a new sense and a new administration that says education \nis a top priority important? And what is their increase for the next \nyear? Their figure is 3.6 percent for 2002.\n  How did we get that amount of money? That amounts to $1.8 billion.\n  That is $1.8 billion they didn't have last year. Where did they get \nthe $1.8 billion? It might be of some interest the Republican budget \ncuts job training by $541 million. The job training program is the \nresult of a bipartisan effort that Senator Jeffords was a part of, led \nby Senator Kassebaum, myself, and others, in order to consolidate 126 \njob training programs into 12 different agencies with one-stop \nshopping. It had the broad support from the trade union movement and \nfrom the business community. It is to try to continue skilled \ntraining for workers who need it. No. No. We need $1.8 billion in \neducation. We take $541 million out of job training.\n\n  Early learning opportunities--this is, again, a bipartisan program. \nSenator Jeffords and Senator Stevens were very involved in that; my \ncolleagues, Senators Dodd and Kerry, very much involved in this, with \nperhaps a very small appropriations. That is with the recognition that \nstudy after study says that ages 1 to 3 are enormously important for \nchildren, and the early interventions from the ages of 1 to 3 to give \nsupport to children prior to the time they are even thinking about \ngoing to Head Start. That was all zeroed out in the Republican budget.\n  Pediatric graduate medical education cut. $35 million to train who? \nPediatricians. Who do they care for? Children. Yes. They got a cut. \nThey should have gotten an increase, because that has been one aspect \nof medical training of professionals that has gotten no help until \nrecent years.\n  I applaud the previous administration in recognizing that. I want to \nmake sure we are going to have the best pediatric specialists in the \nworld to take care of our children.\n  We have taken $35 million from the EPA clean water fund; $497 million \nfrom renewable energy; $156 million from the National Science \nFoundation; and $200 million from the National Science Foundation.\n  Talking about math and science, on the one hand, the National Science\n\n[[Page S4435]]\n\nFoundation is supposed to be trying to help develop national policies \nto help our country deal with math and science. We are taking $200 \nmillion out of that. FEMA disaster relief cut $270 million; community \npolicing cut $270 million.\n  They are cutting all of those programs and putting them up for the \nincrease in the education next year.\n  This is not the kind of endorsement for education that I think most \nof the American people were expecting when we heard during the \nPresident's campaign that education is a top priority.\n  Let's look at the out years of the Republican budget. If we pass this \nbudget, this budget has a zero increase in 2003, a zero increase in \n2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010 in the area of education. \nZero.\n  What are we supposed to believe? I was absolutely startled when I saw \nthat. I thought, well, maybe they are not going to give us all the \nmoney we need in order to cover all Title I children. But at least they \nwill do it a little bit--maybe not as fast as I would like to do it, or \nvirtually everyone on this side of the aisle wants to do it. Every \nDemocrat has supported our proposal to provide Title I services to \nevery eligible child within a 5-year period. We are unanimous on that. \nBut, no, the Republican budget provides zero in fiscal year 2003, and \nzero every single year, all the way out for the life of their ten year \nbudget bill.\n  Nothing is in there in terms of the poorest of the poor children--\nzero, nothing; nothing in there for any expansion of the Pell grants. \nNothing is in there in terms of expansion of Head Start. Nothing is in \nthere in terms of children with disabilities. But there is plenty--$1.2 \ntrillion in tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals.\n  How many times do we have to come back to the Senate and say, no, \nthat isn't where the American people are. We are in a bipartisan \nsaying, no. Education is the key. Education should be our top budget \npriority.\n  But around here, you find out that this is what talks. Money may not \nbe the answer to all the problems in education, but it is a clear \nindication of where a nation's priorities are.\n\n  It is as simple as that. You will hear from many friends over here \nthat money doesn't solve problems. You keep adding money they say, and \ntoo often children still will not make progress. Well, money is not \ngoing to solve all of our education problems. But when you follow the \nmoney, you can see where a nation's priorities are, and where they are \nprepared to invest in terms of the future.\n  This is a shocking budget that absolutely fails the children in this \ncountry.\n  I hope this will be defeated on that basis and that basis alone.\n  Many of our colleagues, hopefully, are not going to have it both \nways--vote for increases on the floor of the Senate, and then vote on \nthe budget for irresponsible tax cut for the wealthy. You have my vote \non the Senate floor: That is how I stand on education. Here is my vote. \nAnd you have my vote on the budget. That shows how I stand on taxes.\n  I can remember very well a true story from when I first came to the \nSenate. In my first week in the Senate, I listened to my colleague, \nWillis Robertson, a Senator from Virginia. He gave an impassioned plea \nin favor of an issue. When the time came to vote, he voted in \nopposition to it. I said: Willis, you gave a speech in favor on the \nfloor, and I supported it. He said: In my State on this issue the \npeople are evenly divided. For those who favor it, I send my speech. \nFor those who oppose it, I send my vote. That was 40 years ago. I hope \nwe are not going to see that again. People laugh about it--and they \nshould laugh about it--but it will be a sad thing if that is what \nSenators do on education this year.\n  What are we trying to do on investing? This is what we have been \ntrying to do with children who have disabilities. Under the Republican \nbudget, their proposal will cover 825,000 children this year, and it \nwill be the same number 10 years from now. It will be different \nchildren, but it will be the same total: 825,000 children--no increase.\n  Under the Democratic proposal, we are raising that up to cover the \n5.5 million. We are saying that no child with a disability should be \nleft behind. We want our President to join us. We do not want him on \nthe outside of this debate. We want him to join us. We want him to lead \nthe bipartisan effort in the Senate and the bipartisan effort across \nthe country. We want him out in front on this. But if you are going to \nget out in front, you are going to have to support the kind of \ninvestments about which we have been talking.\n  Low-income children: We have about 10.3 million children who are \neligible for Title I. Under the administration's budget, for the next \nfiscal year there will be 3.7 million covered; and in fiscal year 2011, \nthe same 3.7 million children. There will be no increase whatsoever. We \nincrease it--almost double it--next year under the Dodd-Collins \namendment; and then we phase in and reach the whole 10.3 million \nchildren by fiscal year 2011. We get the greatest bulk of those \nchildren covered within 5 years from now. I think it is the appropriate \nway to do it. I would like to do it even somewhat faster, but we were \nable to have an overwhelming vote, in excess of two-thirds of the \nMembers, for that Dodd-Collins commitment.\n\n  We see how the Republican budget shortchanges children in another \narea: limited-English-proficient children. In this country, we are \nbenefitting in so many different ways from those who come from \ndifferent cultures and different traditions. The children are trying to \nmake their way through our school systems. We find in the Republican \nproposal, 699,000 children are provided help in 2002. The same number \nof children, 699,000, are covered in 2011. In 2002, we ramp it up to \n1.5 million children; and by 2011, serve all 2.6 million limited \nEnglish proficient children.\n  I want to mention one of the important areas we will be voting on \ntomorrow, and that is in relation to professional development. We have \n750,000 teachers teaching poor children who are hard working, decent, \nwonderful people, but do not have all of the background and competency \nin the areas in which they are teaching. They need additional training. \nThis is aside from the continuation of professional development, an \nongoing responsibility.\n  In the legislation, we say in 4 years that half of all the children \nin Title I will have well-qualified teachers, but we do not provide the \nresources for it. So we have pending an amendment that I and others \nhave offered to make sure we are going to be able to reach those \n750,000 teachers.\n  How are we going to expect children to take tests and measure up on \nthe tests when they are not going to have teachers who can teach their \nsubject matter properly? It just does not make a great deal of sense. \nYou have to have a well-qualified teacher.\n  We know there is $137 billion of need out there in terms of school \nrepairs. We do not expect the Federal Government to pick up all of the \ncost, but we ought to be able to at least do our part. The Harkin \namendment, which provides $1.6 billion this year, is a good departure \npoint, but it is not in the underlying bill. I wish it were. If I had \ndrafted it, it would be in the bill. There are others who did not want \nit in the bill, but we are going to see an amendment from the Senator \nfrom Iowa to try to make sure we are going to provide the construction. \nThere is nothing in this Republican budget for school repair. We \nbelieve there should be a modest school construction amendment.\n  After-school opportunities: There are 7 million children between the \nages of 8 and 13 who go home alone every single day. As this body \nknows, if you take out the various charts, you can show the increased \nescalation in terms of violence in society from children getting into \ntrouble and also the increase in contact with alcoholism and antisocial \nbehavior.\n  We know the important role that after-school programs play in \nconnection with schools and educational centers to provide an \natmosphere where children can receive additional kinds of help and \nassistance in the afternoon. The Boys and Girls Clubs are excellent \nexamples such as in my own city of Boston. We know the difference they \nmake.\n  In the Republican proposal, there are only 1.1 million children who \nget assistance in 2002; and in fiscal year 2011, there will still be \nonly 1.1 million children who get assistance. Under our proposal, 1.5 \nmillion children will get assistance in 2002--a very small increase, \nbut we are going in the right direction--and then afterschool programs\n\n[[Page S4436]]\n\nwould be available to virtually all latch-key children.\n  We would be developing the afterschool program and have good \nteachers, good mentoring, and doing something about the school \nconstruction, and having support for the early interventions with \nchildren, good funding for the Head Start Programs, the consolidation \nof the computers, and doing something about the curriculum, and then \nthe accountability, finding out what the children don't know, and \ngiving the help in the supplementary services to those children so they \ncan make progress. We would give help, making these programs available \nto them afterwards; not using tests as punishment, but using them as \nways for educators to understand where these children are falling out \nand falling behind.\n  It is a pretty good check on some of the schools as well to find out \nwhich schools are working and getting that information back to the \nparents so the parents understand what is going on and can tell which \nschools are working. Then they can do some things about it.\n  This is what we are talking about. I am enormously distressed about \nwhat we are looking at in this budget that has been proposed.\n  We want to make it crystal clear that we are going to continue to \nbattle during this authorization for investments in children. I am \nhopeful we can resist this budget when it comes, but if we do not, we \nare going to have the tax program coming in several weeks and we will \nhave an opportunity again to battle to make education a priority in \nthis nation's budget.\n  We know we have people in this body who are prepared to support us. \nWe are putting this Congress, this President, on notice that this fight \nwill not end until we make funding education a top priority. We are \neither going to get the commitment from the Administration that they \nare going to fund education or we are going to be back here when the \nspecifics of the tax program are debated. We are going to come back \nwhen the Appropriations bills come out.\n  I have been around here enough to know how important the budget can \nbe and not be when it comes to the will of the Senate. We are going to \nbe right back here on the appropriations. This is going to be a long, \ncontinuing, ongoing battle and one in which I am absolutely convinced \nwe will be successful. We are just expressing the sense of the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, at this time I would like to offer two amendments and \nask unanimous consent to set them aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 378 To Amendment No. 358\n\n           (Purpose: To provide for class reduction programs)\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY.

Mr. President, these amendments are two very worthwhile \namendments with which this body is familiar, and with the excellent \npresentation we will be hearing and have heard from the Senator from \nWashington about the importance of class size. As a former school board \nmember and first grade teacher, she makes a case that is irrefutable. \nWe are looking forward to at least some support on the other side.\n  I can remember the first year it was accepted, Speaker Newt Gingrich \nwent out and gave a positive statement how Republicans had supported \nthis very important breakthrough in education, smaller class size. \nSubsequently, we haven't been able to get quite the breadth of support \non that side of the aisle. Now that this has been in effect for a \nnumber of years and is working in a number of the States and we are \nseeing important, significant, and positive results, hopefully we will \nhave support for it.\n  Senator Mikulski is our leader in the Senate in terms of the digital \ndivide. We have seen in our society where education has been a divide, \nand we are committed to making sure that this piece of legislation \nisn't going to further that divide. We want to make sure, with this new \nphenomenon and new technology in terms of the Internet and the high \ntechnology, that we are not having another phenomenon that comes into \nour society and impacts our society between the haves and have-nots. \nSenator Mikulski has been the leading voice. These community technology \ncenters have made an enormous difference in reducing that disparity. I \nknow she will speak very eloquently about that shortly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I won't take the time of the Senate at \nthis point to answer the suggestions of my good friend that we have \ndone less on this side than we should for education. I think we have \nall done less than we should for education.\n  I will point out that during the Clinton administration, there was \npractically little or no increase in title I funding. They did have \nother requests for increases, but for the very needy they did little. \nAlso, for professional teachers, they did little. There was the class \nsize proposal to add more teachers. We can debate this back and forth, \nbut we are all guilty of not providing the necessary resources for \neducation.\n  I am hopeful we will go forward and pass the amendment I had, along \nwith Senator Harkin, to fully fund IDEA.\n  Right now, Senator Allen has an amendment and I defer to him.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 380 To Amendment No. 358\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside. I send an amendment to the desk and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Allen], for himself and Mr. \n     Warner, proposes an amendment numbered 380 to amendment No. \n     358.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide a Sense of the Senate Regarding Education \n                        Opportunity Tax Relief)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC.   . SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING EDUCATION OPPORTUNITY \n                   TAX RELIEF.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) Improving the education of our children is an essential \n     and important responsibility facing this country.\n       (2) Strong parental involvement is a cornerstone for \n     academic success; it is parents who know and understand the \n     special, individual needs of their own children.\n       (3) Advanced technology has fueled unprecedented economic \n     growth and positively transformed the way Americans conduct \n     business and communicate with each other.\n       (4) Families will need ready access to the technical tools \n     and skills necessary for their school age children to succeed \n     in the classroom and the increasingly competitive \n     international marketplace.\n       (5) Studies have shown that the presence of a computer in \n     the home has a positive impact on a student's level of \n     academic achievement and performance in school.\n       (6) Tax relief, enabling the purchase of technology and \n     tutorial services for K-12 education purposes, would \n     significantly help defray the cost of education expenses by: \n     empowering families financially and increasing education \n     spending; allowing families to provide their children access \n     to a far greater range of educational opportunities suited to \n     their individual needs, and; bridging the digital divide.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress and the President should--\n       (1) Act expeditiously to pass legislation in the First \n     Session of the 107th Congress that provides tax relief to \n     parents of K-12 students for the cost of their children's \n     education-related expenses, specifically, computers, \n     peripherals and computer-related technology, educational \n     software, Internet access and tutoring services; and\n       (2) That such tax relief would not apply toward the cost of \n     private school tuition.\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, having listened to the impassioned words of \nthe Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, and knowing the great \nleadership that he and Senator Jeffords, chairman of the HELP \nCommittee, have provided on education, it is very good for the American \npeople to recognize how important education is to those of us at the \nFederal level. Education is not just a Federal responsibility; it is \nprimarily a State and local responsibility.\n  The actions that have been taken so far and will be taken in the days \nto come will result in the Federal Government being there to be of help \nand assistance to local schools, to parents, and, most importantly, to \nstudents in getting a good education. Indeed, all of\n\n[[Page S4438]]\n\nus can agree that ensuring that our children receive the best possible \neducation is one of the most important responsibilities to the people \nin our States and all across America.\n  Quality education, why do we care about it? Because a quality \neducation is absolutely necessary for our children and all children \nacross this country to be able to compete, succeed, and lead a \nfulfilling life. It is key for their future success, personally and \nprofessionally. It allows them, with a good education, economic freedom \nand financial security. A good education allows someone greater career \nopportunities and choices and mobility. It also allows them to provide \nfor themselves financially as well as for their family. Education also \nis very important to society and for our American civilization to \ncompete and succeed internationally.\n  I was made chair of the Senate Republican high-tech task force. One \nof our key policy agenda items is in promoting education and \ntechnology. I quote from our policy agenda:\n\n       Without a workforce fully capable in math, science and \n     computing skills, our competitiveness is at risk. Without a \n     consumer base able to utilize the latest technological \n     advances, our economic growth may wane. The task force \n     believes that a top priority in education should be the \n     development of policies that encourage the use of technology.\n\n  I speak as a father. I speak with my previous experience as Governor \nand also as a candidate with certain promises I made to the people of \nVirginia, should I be elected, in the area of education. We talked \nabout the need for more teachers, allowing the localities to determine \nwhat those needs would be as far as funding for teachers, whether they \nuse increased salaries for existing teachers, pay stipends for math and \nscience teachers; whether it is hiring more teachers; that is important \nto reduce class size so children in the early grades get more \nindividualized attention. There is action, activity so far on this \nmeasure and will be in the days to come to improve it.\n  The early reading initiative, which we started in Virginia, is part \nof the package. It is very important to make sure youngsters at the \nearliest grades--kindergarten, first and second--are reading at speed. \nOf all the academic subjects, nothing is more important than reading. \nWe have testing in Virginia, as do many other States. Testing and \nstandards are very important for identification of children who need \nadditional help as well as giving parents a school performance report \ncard.\n  I agree with the outstanding amendments Senator Jeffords put forth \nlast week to make sure the Federal requirement of testing in a couple \nsubjects would not become an unfunded mandate. What we ought to do is \nempower and help local schools, certainly not add unfunded mandates. \nSenator Jeffords' leadership in that regard was essential, and, \nfortunately, it passed overwhelmingly.\n  Another good thing about this measure so far is that it seems the \nFederal Government is trusting localities and States with greater \nflexibility to identify what their specific needs are in that \nparticular school district. That is important.\n\n  Now, in addition to all of this, the President has gotten involved, \nso obviously it has been a priority. The House and Senate have been \ninvolved, and we have made it a priority.\n  As important as our local school boards and State governments and the \nFederal Government are, parents are important. For a good student, you \nwill find that you need good teachers, yes, and they need to be in a \ngood environment. But also key is good parents.\n  I want to take this opportunity to focus on increasing access to \ntechnology for those students in grades kindergarten through 12th \ngrade.\n  We all understand, and I think the Presiding Officer today sure \nunderstands, how technology has fueled the unprecedented growth and \ntransformed the way Americans conduct business and communicate with one \nanother. As the global economy brings in new opportunities and greater \nprosperity, all families will need ready access to the technical and \ntechnological skills and tools necessary for students to succeed in a \nclassroom and also in the digital economy.\n  Together schools, communities, and government have worked to bring \ncomputers to the classrooms and integrate technology into daily \nclassroom curriculums. Classroom connectivity has soared from 14 \npercent in 1996 to 63 percent in 1999. When I was Governor, we finally \nwere able to get the Goals 2000 money and put it into Network Virginia, \nto connect all our colleges, community colleges, and schools. So that \nhas been going on across the country.\n  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act provides a separate \nfunding stream for teacher technology training, which is important. \nThere are tax incentives for companies to donate computers to schools. \nThat is going on in Virginia and across the U.S. However, it is not \nenough that there be a computer present in the classroom or in a \ncommunity center. I think it is great what Intel is doing with the \nGirls and Boys Clubs with their computer club houses. That is really \ngood. But I also would like to see people have computers at home. Only \nthrough consistent access to technology can students develop the \nnecessary technical skills to succeed and compete in the future \nmarketplace and economy. Children must have access to the Internet at \nhome so they can better complete afterschool homework. If you want the \nchildren to be able to have access to information or to do word \nprocessing, all that ought to be done on a computer at home, and they \nshould not have to go to the school or a library or a community center.\n  The homework assignments are done after school and on weekends, and I \nthink also by having the children working on computers at home, that \nincreases their programming and technological skills. It also allows \nthem to discover additional academic opportunities. There are some \ngreat educational software programs in geography, history, math, \nscience, and the language arts, which all go at the pace of the student \nwho is on the computer. E-books are coming around and that is another \nway of having children get interested in reading in a more easy way.\n  All of this, again, is gathered at the pace of the students. Studies \nhave shown that the presence of a computer in the home has a positive \nimpact on a student's level of academic achievement and performance in \nthe school. For example, a study using NAEP data found that eighth \ngraders who use computers frequently at home demonstrated higher levels \nof academic achievement than those who do not. Parents in those \nsituations became more involved with the daily assignments, and it also \nincreases their communication with teachers through the use of e-mail.\n\n  There was a study in a New York project where children actually were \ngiven laptops, personal computers--they weren't just in the classroom \nand the library--and they were allowed to bring the personal computers \nhome. The training was provided in this project in New York. Not only \ndid it increase academic performance, but it had long-term benefits. \nThe results were that the participants were more likely to stay in \nschool, graduate, and go on to college.\n  Earlier this year, with the support of my colleagues, Senators \nWarner, Allard, Hutchinson, Craig, and Hutchison, I introduced the \nEducation Opportunity Tax Credit Act, which would provide financial \nrelief for the purchase of technology and tutorial services for K-12 \neducational purposes. My proposal would provide a $1,000 tax credit per \nyear, up to $2,000 per family, for the cost of their children's \neducation-related expenses--specifically computer peripherals and \ncomputer-related technology, educational software, Internet access, and \ntutoring services. However, the tax credit would not apply toward the \ncost of private school tuition.\n  This proposal would significantly help defray the cost of educational \nexpenses by empowering families financially and thereby increasing \neducational spending, which would mostly be on technology. Even more \nimportant, the education opportunity tax credit would improve the \nquality of educational experiences for students by allowing families to \nprovide their children with access to a far greater range of \neducational opportunities suited to their individual needs. It would \nencourage parental involvement in their children's education. Indeed, \nparents are the ones who know their childrens' needs, know their names, \nand know their specific problem areas, and we\n\n[[Page S4439]]\n\nneed to empower parents. Furthermore, this idea of providing this tax \nrelief for the purchase of educational technology would also help \nbridge the digital divide. It is very important that everyone has an \nequal opportunity--whether it is tax policies, regulatory policies, or \neducational and technological policies--so that everyone can seize the \nopportunities in this digital age and this information technology \neconomy.\n  Mr. President, the amendment I am introducing today would provide for \na sense of the Senate in affirming how important it is that we increase \nopportunities for home access to technology for school-age children. \nWhile I am unable to offer the education opportunity tax credit to S. 1 \nbecause tax provisions cannot generally be added to a program \nauthorization bill, by voting to support this sense-of-the-Senate \namendment, we will be setting the foundation for future progress on \nthis important matter.\n  Generally, I believe we are on the right track, for the most part, on \neducational reform at the Federal level with this bill. There is more \ntrust and decisionmaking at the State and local levels. There are more \nfunds and will be more funds for teachers, early reading initiatives, \nand protecting against unfunded mandates. This is due in no small part \nto Senators Jeffords and Gregg and other Members and the White House \nand leadership from both sides of the aisle.\n  Remember how we get a good student: You need good schools and \nparents.\n  We need to not only thank the leaders in the Senate for the good work \nthey are doing but also make sure that we don't forget the parents. We \nneed to empower parents to provide these technological educational \nschools for their children so their children have the same \nopportunities as all children, and also make sure that our country can \ncompete and succeed. As we move forward on educational reform, I am \nconfident that we will also be able to increase access to education-\nrelated technology for all children in their homes and pass the \neducation opportunity tax credit into law.\n\n  I believe if we work on both sides of the aisle, we would understand \nthat children need to have computers at home, access to the Internet, \nand the world of information that comes from having an individualized \nLibrary of Congress right there at home for our children. I thank the \nChair and I thank the chairman of the committee for allowing me this \ntime to speak on this amendment. I thank Senator Kennedy also for \nyielding some time. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia, who \nhas given us an excellent understanding of what he has done. I think he \nhas done a tremendous job for the State of Virginia. I have looked at \nhis record and have listened to him and realize that he has made great \ncontributions to the State of Virginia, and now he is here to assist \nus. So I praise him for this amendment. I will ask to have it set aside \nfor a later vote, but I commend him for what he has done and I look \nforward to working with him.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be set \naside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier I briefly commented on the \nimportance of having a well-qualified teacher in every classroom. We \nwill be asking the Senate to vote for increased funding for that \ntomorrow.\n  I hope those who are thinking about this amendment will review the \nexcellent TIMSS 1999 eighth grade mathematics benchmarking report. \nThese are findings for the United States and internationally. It is the \nleading authority of what is happening in classrooms in mathematics in \nthe United States.\n  It states clearly on page 7:\n\n       Research shows that higher achievement in mathematics is \n     associated with teachers having a bachelor's and/or master's \n     degree in mathematics. According to their teachers, however, \n     U.S. eighth-grade students were less likely than those in \n     other countries to be taught mathematics by teachers with a \n     major area of study in mathematics.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The Benchmarking Study provides evidence that some schools \n     in the U.S. are among the best in the world, but that a \n     world-class education is not available to all children across \n     the nation. The TIMSS index of home educational resources \n     (based on books in the home, availability of study aids, and \n     parents' education level) shows that students with more home \n     resources have higher mathematics achievement. Futhermore, \n     the Benchmarking jurisdictions with the greatest \n     percentages of students with high levels of home resources \n     were among the top-performing jurisdictions, and those \n     with the lowest achievement were four urban districts that \n     also had the lowest percentages of students with high \n     levels of home resources. These and other TIMSS 1999 \n     Benchmarking results support research indicating that \n     students in urban districts with a high proportion of low-\n     income families and minorities often attend schools with \n     fewer resources than in non-urban districts, including \n     less experienced teachers, fewer appropriate instructional \n     materials, more emphasis on lower-level content, less \n     access to gifted and talented programs, higher \n     absenteeism, more inadequate buildings, and more \n     discipline problems.\n\n  What have we done with our legislation? I mentioned the other day, a \npoint of reference about the excellent book ``What Matters Most: \nTeaching for America's Future,'' the report of the National Commission \non Teaching & America's Future, September of 1996. Hopefully, people \nfollowing these issues in the debate will take a few moments and read \nthrough this compelling report. It is an excellent document. This, \nalong with the hearings we had and the representations from Secretary \nPaige and the administration, gave very good structure for \nstrengthening our Nation's teaching force.\n  We have 750,000 teachers who do not have degrees in the subject \nmatter they are teaching. This is how we try to address that.\n  Part A of BEST will ensure there are more highly qualified teachers \nin the neediest schools because more teachers have access to high-\nquality professional development. We have a strong definition for a \nqualified teacher. All highly qualified teachers are teachers who have \nan academic major in the arts and science or have demonstrated \ncompetence through a high level of performance in core academic \nstandards and are certified or licensed by the State. That is a very \nstrong criteria to be met. We are going to insist on having a high \nstandard and high quality teacher teaching the children.\n  The BEST Act ensures that professional development and mentoring \nactivities are research-based and high quality. Mentoring support for \nteachers is absolutely essential and key. The continued development for \nteachers in terms of professional development is important. We require \nprofessional development activities as an integral part of the broad \nschool-wide and district-wide educational improvement plans. We make \nsure that it is intensive, sustained, and school-based.\n  Those are the elements of effective professional development \nprograms. They have to be intensive. We cannot have just 1 day, 2 days, \na few days at the end of the year or a few days at the beginning of the \nyear. They have to be sustained, intensive, school-based, of high \nquality and sufficient duration to have a positive and lasting impact \non classroom instruction. Too often we have the one-time workshops \nbased on the best research designed to help teachers continue to \nimprove the practice of teaching and developing instructional skills.\n  The BEST Act ensures that professional development activities are \naligned with State content standards, student performance standards \nassessment, and the curriculum and programs are tied to those standards \nat the local level.\n  That is the key. One of most important aspects of school success is \nthe presence of highly qualified, highly competent teachers working in \nthe development of a curriculum, teaching the curriculum, and the \nstudents are then examined on that curriculum, finding out what the \nstudent does not know, providing the supplementary services available.\n  That is as clearly stated in the legislation as we could. This is \nvery important and is one of the most important\n\n[[Page S4440]]\n\nparts of the bill. It guarantees funds for professional development and \nmentoring. To date, we have not been guaranteeing the funds for \nprofessional development.\n  The BEST Act moves to ensure that all teachers in schools with 50 \npercent of poverty or higher are highly qualified in 4 years. I welcome \nthat language. That is putting a challenge to the Congress: Are we \ngoing to provide the resources to make sure we have the highly \nqualified teacher that will teach in these urban areas or rural areas, \nwhere we have the high percentage of needy children?\n\n  We are committing ourselves. If we are going to commit ourselves to \ngetting well-trained teachers, we have to provide the resources. That \nis what this amendment does. It holds all States accountable for \nensuring all teachers are qualified, and if we hold the States \naccountable, we have to provide the resources and require States to \nprovide assistance to teachers in schools. It ensures teachers receive \nprofessional development to help students reach higher standards.\n  Requiring professional development helps all students, including \nthose diverse racial and ethnic students, students with disabilities, \nstudents with limited English proficiency, meet higher standards.\n  The States are required to set the performance goals that include the \nannual increase and the percentage of highly qualified teachers that \nschools with 50 percent of poverty or more are highly qualified within \n4 years. The States have to set their goals and know at the beginning \nof this walk that we are going to walk the walk with them, that we will \nprovide the resources.\n  How do we expect the States to accept this responsibility if we are \nnot going to provide the resources? We expect in their plan that the \nStates are going to have to have accountability as well. States that do \nnot meet this goal in 4 years will lose 15 percent of their \nadministrative funds and risk increased sanctions in the following \nyears.\n  We are asking everyone to be responsible and to be accountable. We \nare asking the States, the schools, and the students to be accountable.\n  The last question is whether we are going to be responsible. The way \nwe are going to be responsible is supporting this amendment which will, \nhopefully, establish the guideposts for sufficient funds for the \ntraining of teachers and professional development.\n  My amendment effectively is a sense of the Senate that the Congress \nshould appropriate the $3 billion authorized in the BEST Act for \nimproving teacher quality, and authorizes a $500 million increase per \nyear for the subsequent 6 years, 2003 to 2008. I hope this amendment \nreceives a strong bipartisan vote in the morning.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n       The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The clerk will call \n     the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 372\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, tomorrow the Senate will vote on the \namendments now pending, including an amendment offered by Senator Craig \nthat will deny increases in funding under the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act if a State fails to make adequate yearly progress as \ndefined by the BEST Act. That is the Education Act on which we are \nworking.\n  This amendment by Senator Craig addresses a very important issue--\naccountability for results--the issue on which we spent the bulk of our \ntime working when crafting S. 1.\n  There is already a mechanism for holding States accountable in S.1. \nKeep that in mind. We already have a provision for that.\n  In title VI, part B, if a State fails to meet its goals for adequate \nprogress in improving student achievement, the Secretary must reduce \nthe funds available to that State in succeeding years.\n  I should add that there are also accountability provisions directly \nrelated to student performance at the school and district levels.\n  It does not make sense to reduce the overall funding to a State, when \nin fact some schools and districts may be doing a good job and others \nare not.\n  S.1 targets sanctions to where the problem exists.\n  In other words, if one school in a district is doing well and another \nis not, we have focused our school improvement activities on the school \nthat is not doing its job to improve achievement.\n  Similarly, if one district in a State is excelling and another is \nnot, raising the achievement of all its students, then under our bill, \nthe poor performing district would be sanctioned.\n  Under this scenario, with these school and district level \naccountability provisions in place, it would not make sense to reduce \nthe funding of all the schools and districts by reducing the grant to \nthe State.\n  Instead, as I mentioned earlier, under S.1, a State not making its \nperformance goals would only be sanctioned based on the funds it is \nallowed to keep at the State level, not to hurt the individual \ndistrict.\n  I can assure the Senate that these funds are very important and \nvaluable to States, and their loss will certainly be something that \nStates will work hard to avoid.\n  The Craig amendment would dramatically expand the sanctions already \nspelled out in the bill and would result in a disproportionate penalty, \nin my view.\n  My colleagues should not be under any illusion that only a few States \nwill fail to make adequate yearly progress. Of the 18 or 19 States we \nhave looked at in an informal survey, nearly three quarters would have \nfailed last year, and the handful that did not fail outright might do \nso with disaggregated data.\n  I appreciate my colleague's interest in driving change at the State \nand local levels, but I think the President's proposals, incorporated \nin the BEST Act, offer a more precise means of doing so in the years \nahead.\n  Adoption of the Craig amendment, by contrast would stop dead in their \ntracks the President's testing and reading initiatives. I hope the \nSenate will resist the Craig amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendment be laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 382 to Amendment No. 358\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk on \nbehalf of Mr. Dodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Kennedy], for Mr. Dodd, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 382 to amendment No. 358.\n\n  The amendment reads as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To remove the 21st century community learning center program \n      from the list of programs covered by performance agreements)\n\n       On page 752, line 7, strike ``F or''.\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/07/senate-section/article/S4440-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4440-S4442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE PROPOSED WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a news article by Benjamin Forgey from the Washington \nPost dated May 5, 2001, about the World War II memorial that is \nproposed to be built on The Mall between the Washington Monument and \nthe Lincoln Memorial.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4441]]\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 5, 2001]\n\n An Overdue Honor for WWII Veterans Once Again Is Unjustly in the Line \n                                of Fire\n\n                          (By Benjamin Forgey)\n\n       Veterans of World War II ought to be fighting mad right \n     about now.\n       Bad luck and a bad case of nerves on the part of a federal \n     agency may delay the World War II Memorial on the Mall--\n     possibly for years. This, after 22 public hearings, four \n     approving congressional laws and six years of give-and-take \n     had produced a fine, ready-to-build design.\n       In an extraordinary vote Thursday, the National Capital \n     Planning Commission put itself in a position to reverse all \n     of its previous approvals of the memorial--of the prominent \n     site between the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial, \n     the design concept that embraces the site and the details of \n     the design.\n       In essence, the commission is proposing to subject the \n     folks who sponsored the memorial and raised more than $100 \n     million to a bureaucratic form of double jeopardy. The site \n     has been dedicated and millions of dollars have been spent to \n     prepare the approved design. In addition to dealing with a \n     pending lawsuit brought by steadfast opponents, the American \n     Battle Monuments Commission, the memorial's official \n     guardian, must now gird itself to go through the contentious \n     process another time.\n       This could be a mere formality, if after hearing a day of \n     pro and con pubic testimony at a special session on June 13 \n     the commission simply votes, in another special session the \n     next day, to reapprove its prior approvals. However, so clear \n     and easy a solution seems highly unlikely. Four of the 12 \n     commission members, including Chairman Richard Friedman, are \n     new since the agency took its last vote on the memorial five \n     months ago. (One of the seats is currently vacant.)\n       More likely, the commission will ask for changes in the \n     design. Even if the alterations are limited, it could take, \n     say, 12 months to get them through the reviewing process \n     again. Law requires approval of any changes not only by the \n     planning commission but also by the Commission of Fine Arts \n     and the secretary of the interior--usually a difficult, time-\n     consuming process.\n       In a year, more than 400,000 aging World War II veterans \n     will die.\n       Then there is the possibility that the commission will \n     reverse itself completely by rejecting the design concept and \n     the site, which was sanctioned by both commissions five years \n     ago after a thorough consideration of alternative locations. \n     If this happens, selecting another site, designing a new \n     memorial and getting the necessary approvals could take five \n     years or more.\n       In five years, more than 2 million World War II veterans \n     will die.\n       If this seems as preposterously unfair to you as it does to \n     me, we are in the same club as Tom Hanks, who says as much on \n     those touching it's-about-time television spots as spokesman \n     for the national memorial. Such delays are unconscionable. \n     The veterans--and, in fact, the entire World War II \n     generation--deserve dignified commemoration while some are \n     still alive to hold their heads high.\n       This is particularly so in view of the time and talent \n     already spent in quest of a fitting location and design for \n     the memorial. I do not mind saying this again: The site could \n     not be better--on the central axis of the Mall at the eastern \n     end of the Reflecting Pool, with the Lincoln Memorial to the \n     west and, to the east, the Washington Monument and the \n     Capitol. Alone among events of the 20th century, World War II \n     deserves commemoration on this symbolic holy ground of the \n     American democracy.\n       The genius of the design by Friedrich St. Florian, the \n     Austrian-born Rhode Island architect who six years ago won \n     the national design competition for the memorial, is how \n     splendidly it fits the contours of this impressive site. \n     Taking its primary cues from circular ends of the existing \n     Rainbow Pool and the cupping rows of elm trees that frame the \n     great vista, the memorial honors its honorific place on the \n     Mall.\n       But it is worth noting that St. Florian's design did not do \n     so at the beginning. In response to the overblown requests of \n     the Battle Monuments Commission--asking for a museum-size \n     undergrown exhibition space, among other things--the first \n     design was impressive, but predictably overblown. It got a \n     rough going-over from both reviewing commissions and, \n     gradually, was whittled down and fitted elegantly into the \n     landscape.\n       All of this patient, productive back-and-forth process may \n     now prove to have been useless. In part, the fact that the \n     commission is even considering reversing itself is due to a \n     mere technicality--or just really bad luck.\n       Three of the board's five previous approvals of various \n     facets of the memorial have been called into question because \n     former chairman Harvey Gantt continued to work after his term \n     officially had expired, awaiting a replacement. This is a \n     common administrative practice and usually is covered \n     explicitly in legislation. Yet somehow, back in the 1970s, \n     that language was dropped when the planning commission's \n     authorizing law was rewritten, and nobody noticed until now.\n       This seems a thin excuse for revisiting even the \n     ``questionable'' votes--covering preliminary and final \n     memorial plans. It offers no pretext at all for reviewing the \n     commission's crucial, positive votes taken before Gantt's \n     term expired--on the design concept (its style, philosophy \n     and general configuration) and the site. But after Thursday's \n     vote, that is where we could be headed.\n       A series of questions come immediately to mind. Was \n     Thursday's vote wise? Was it even necessary? Should not some \n     other body--the Justice Department, Congress--decide on the \n     legality, or lack of it, of the previous chairman's votes \n     before anything else is done? Then, what about all the other \n     issues the commission decided during Gantt's interregnum--for \n     instance, the controversial Washington Convention Center?\n       Of course, something good can result from the new hearings \n     in June, as well as the ``balanced'' panel of architects, \n     urban designers and landscape architects the commission seeks \n     to convene later this month. (May 23 is the tentative date.) \n     There is a lot to be said, after all, for hearing all sides \n     of a story, even if the arguments are the same ones we've \n     been listening to for years.\n       So far, the site and the design have proved strong enough \n     to withstand hostile criticism--and probably this will happen \n     again. The memorial is not misplaced, as its opponents \n     contend, and most fair observers can see this. It does not \n     close off the Mall, as critics have said. Rather, it adds \n     something important to the vista. It is not Nazi \n     architecture--the most hateful of the attacks--but, like much \n     else in Washington, it is part of a 2,000-year-old tradition \n     of classical architecture.\n       It is not a perfect design, to be sure, but changes, if \n     any, should be considered very, very tenderly. As in all very \n     good designs, each part is intimately related to the others. \n     You cannot just rip a hole in the memorial to ``open the \n     Mall,'' for instance, without affecting the delicate, finely \n     wrought balance of the whole.\n       But the special reason to proceed with caution here is the \n     human costs of further delay. Like the movement to build \n     Civil War memorials throughout the North and South in the \n     late 19th and early 20th centuries, the impetus to construct \n     a national World War II memorial gained strength as the \n     wartime generation began to disappear.\n       The Veterans Administration provides these sobering \n     statistics. Of the 16 million American men and women who \n     served in uniform during World War II, about 5 million are \n     alive today. In 2004--the earliest date the Mall memorial \n     could be dedicated if everything proceeded smoothly--3.8 \n     million veterans will be left. For every year after that--\n     well, you do the math.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I recall when Tom Brokaw wrote his book, \n``The Greatest Generation,'' I picked it up in an airport and began \nreading and marveled once again at the dedication those young men, and \nsome young women, in the 1940s, expressed to this country. They \ndedicated their lives to beating the fascism and nazism exhibited by \nAdolf Hitler. They kept the free world free. Many paid for it with the \nultimate sacrifice--their lives.\n  It has been proposed for some long while to build a memorial on The \nMall of the U.S. Capital to those World War II veterans. That World War \nII memorial has been in the planning stages forever, and the National \nCapital Planning Commission is proposing to reverse previous approvals \nof the memorial and once again delay construction of this memorial.\n  The people who sponsored this memorial have raised more than $100 \nmillion from private sources. The site has been dedicated. In addition \nto dealing with the pending lawsuit by opponents, they must now--these \nfolks who have worked on this for so long--gird themselves to go \nthrough the contentious battle one more time.\n  This year, more than 400,000 aging World War II veterans will die. \nSixteen million American men--mostly men--and some women, served in \nuniform during World War II. Of those 16 million, about 5 million are \nnow alive.\n  In 2004, which is the earliest date the World War II memorial could \nbe dedicated if everything proceeded smoothly, about 3.8 million \nveterans of that was will be left. As the article suggests, do the \nmath. We need to move aggressively to see that the lasting contribution \nthese men and women made for their country is recognized by building \nthat World War II memorial.\n  I have told my colleagues previously, of a discussion I had with a \nmember of the European Parliament about 2 years ago, in which we were \ndiscussing some differences between the United States and the \nEuropeans. He stopped me at one point and said, ``Mr. Senator, I want \nyou to understand something about how I feel about your country.'' He \nsaid, ``In 1944, I was 14 years old and standing on a street corner in \nParis, France, when the U.S. Liberation Army marched into Paris, \nFrance, and freed my country from the Nazis.'' He said, ``A young black \nAmerican soldier reached out his hand and gave that 14-year-old boy an \napple. I will go to my grave remembering that moment. We\n\n[[Page S4442]]\n\nhadn't had much fruit under the nazi occupation for a long while. But I \nwill remember that moment that young soldier handed me an apple.'' He \nsaid, ``You should understand what your country means to me, to us, to \nmy country.''\n  I remember, again, the sacrifice that was made by so many Americans \nin World War II, the sacrifice made by what Tom Brokaw calls, \nappropriately, the ``greatest generation.''\n  It seems to me appropriate that we ask those involved in the planning \nof this memorial, who are once again trying to evaluate exactly the \nconditions under which it is built, to allow this to go forward, allow \nthis for the people who have spent the time, planned this memorial, and \nraised the money to make this happen for the World War II veterans. We \nowe our veterans that, and we don't owe them further delay. Let's not \nhave further delay. Let's get the memorial built.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/07/senate-section/article/S4442-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       BETTER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ACT--Continued\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, our education system is in need of \nserious reform. Thirty-five years ago, Congress enacted the first \nElementary and Secondary Education Act. Billions of dollars have been \nspent on Title I, the program that is the cornerstone of the federal \ninvestment in K through 12 education for disadvantaged children.\n  However, only 13 percent of low-income 4th graders score at or above \nthe ``proficient'' level on national reading tests. As the recently \nreleased results of the 2000 National Assessment of Education Progress \nshow, the reading scores of 4th grade students have shown no \nimprovement since 1992.\n  Even worse, no progress has been made in achieving the program's \nfundamental goal, narrowing the achievement gap between low-income and \nupper-income students. It is obvious that the current system has \nserious problems and it is time that we make serious reforms.\n  Some of my colleagues feel that the solution is to throw a huge \namount of money at education. I disagree. Yes, education funding should \nincrease, but continuing to expand the current federal system, which is \ncharacterized by its many duplicative and ineffective programs is not \nthe answer.\n  We should be working together to ensure that education legislation \nestablishes real standards for measuring academic achievement, \nstreamlines federal education programs, promotes local flexibility, \nencourages and protects good teachers, and gives parents of students \nwho are trapped in failing schools the opportunity to seek a better \neducation for their children.\n  It is time to do something different. Although focusing on curriculum \nand teaching methods have fueled many of our past debates it is now \nimportant to shift our focus to the more general and structural aspects \nthat affect learning. We need to allow parents, teachers, and schools \nto decide what is best for their children.\n  I believe that decisions about a child's education should be made by \npeople who actually know the child's name. I do not believe that \nbureaucrats and politicians in Washington should dictate how states and \nlocalities spend education funds. Students in my home state of Alaska \nface unique challenges due to the diverse population, size of the \nstate, and the isolation faced in rural communities. We need greater \nflexibility in order to meet our students needs.\n  The President's education plan demands that states demonstrate \nstudent academic gains in reading, and math, as well as progress in \nreducing the achievement gap between disadvantaged students and their \npeers. We need accountability so that we can be assured that there's \nacademic achievement. All of the educators that I speak to in Alaska \ntell me that they are not afraid of accountability. However, they \nmaintain that they need more flexibility to reach high academic goals.\n  I agree with the President that we should consolidate federal \nelementary and secondary programs, insist upon high standards and \naccountability, and allow states and localities the flexibility they \nneed to educate children.\n  It is time to recognize that we need to do something different. I \ncall on my colleagues to work together to pass legislation that is \n``real'' education reform.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/07/senate-section/article/S4442-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4442-S4445]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n NOMINATION OF JOHN ROBERT BOLTON OF MARYLAND TO BE UNDER SECRETARY OF \n           STATE FOR ARMS CONTROL AND INTERNATIONAL SECURITY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The hour of 4 p.m. having arrived, the Senate \nwill now go into executive session and proceed to the consideration of \nExecutive Calendar No. 39, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of John Robert Bolton of \nMaryland to be Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there shall now be 3 \nhours of debate on the nomination.\n  Under the previous order, there shall also be 60 minutes under the \ncontrol of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, on the John Bolton nomination, I \nunderstand that I am to be recognized for an hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to give the \nfinal 15 minutes of my hour to Senator Wellstone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the issue before the Senate is the \nnomination of the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security. The proposed nominee is Mr. John Bolton. I \ndon't know John Bolton from a cord of wood, and I have no ill will \ntoward him, but I come to the floor opposing this nomination in the \nmost vigorous way possible.\n  We have a circumstance in this world where there exist somewhere in \nthe neighborhood of 30,000 to 40,000 nuclear weapons. They exist in \nrelatively few countries. We have a large stockpile of nuclear weapons, \nRussia has an even larger stockpile of nuclear weapons, and a few other \ncountries are members of the nuclear club. It was demonstrated about a \nyear and a half ago, or so, that both India and Pakistan have nuclear \nweapons. They don't like each other at all. Each tested nuclear weapons \nunderneath the other's chin. One wonders about the wisdom of that. It \ndemonstrated for all of the world the danger of so many nuclear \nweapons, the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  So it is our job, it is incumbent upon us in this country, to be a \nworld leader and to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and to be a \nworld leader in trying to reduce the number of nuclear weapons on this \nEarth. This is our responsibility.\n\n  The area of our Government in which leadership is required is that of \nUnder Secretary of State for Arms Control. That is where one would \nexpect to see leadership with respect to arms reductions, arms control \ntalks, and stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\n  President Bush nominated John Bolton for the job. He is exactly the \nwrong nominee. He is exactly the wrong person to put in this position. \nAgain, I do not know him personally. But I know of his thinking and \nwritings and how he has expressed himself in recent years about these \nsubjects. I am going to use some of these expressions, quotes, and \narticles he has written to demonstrate why I think he should not be \nconfirmed by the Senate.\n  First, he does not have experience in arms control at all. He has \nnever served in an arms control position. He has never been part of \nnegotiating groups involved in arms control talks. He has not even \nwritten very much about the arms control subject. But he has expressed \ndisdain for arms control and for those who promote it.\n  I will relate a couple of those statements. He says:\n\n       America rejects the illusionary protections of \n     unenforceable treaties.\n\n  With respect to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, the CTBT, \nthat we debated in the Senate and defeated, regrettably, nearly 2 years \nago, he says the supporters of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban \nTreaty are ``timid and neo-pacifists.''\n\n[[Page S4443]]\n\n  Let me explain what the test ban treaty is. We do not test nuclear \nweapons in this country. We decided and announced 8 or 9 years ago that \nwe were not going to test nuclear weapons, so we suspended nuclear \ntesting.\n\n  The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty has been signed by about 150 \ncountries, it tries to get all of the countries to commit to the \nposition we have already taken: to prohibit nuclear testing; a treaty \nto stop nuclear testing. This Senate voted against that treaty. It is \nalmost unthinkable. This Senate said no to that treaty.\n  Mr. Bolton says the supporters of that treaty are ``timid and neo-\npacifists.'' He, I guess, disagrees. He, I guess, thinks we should not \nbe involved in a treaty with other countries to stop nuclear testing, \ndespite the fact we have already stopped nuclear testing.\n  What value is it for us to decide we will not be part of a treaty \nthat stops others from doing what we have already decided not to do? It \nmakes no sense to me.\n  Mr. Bolton says international law is not really law:\n\n       Treaties are ``law'' only for U.S. domestic purposes. In \n     their international operation, treaties are simply \n     ``political'' obligations.\n\n  He says:\n\n       While treaties may well be politically or even morally \n     binding, they are not legally obligatory. They are just not \n     ``law'' as we apprehend the term.\n\n  We have been involved in many treaties in this country, most notably \nand most important to me are the arms control treaties we have \nnegotiated with the old Soviet Union and the arms control treaties we \nnow have with Russia. Mr. Bolton's position is they do not really mean \nvery much; they are just political obligations; they do not mean \nanything; they have no force and effect in our law.\n  The arms reduction treaties we have negotiated with the old Soviet \nUnion and now Russia have accomplished a great deal, and someone who \ndiscards the notion of reaching these kinds of agreements with other \ncountries, in my judgment, is not thinking very clearly about what our \nobligation ought to be with respect to stopping the spread of nuclear \nweapons and trying to reduce the number of nuclear weapons on this \nEarth.\n  Mr. Bolton also expresses rather substantial disdain for the United \nNations. He says:\n\n       The Secretariat building in New York has 38 stories. If it \n     lost 10 stories, it wouldn't make a bit of difference.\n\n  He says:\n\n       If I were redoing the Security Council today, I'd have one \n     permanent member because that's the real reflection of the \n     distribution of power in the world [and that member would be] \n     the United States.\n\n  Kind of an elitist attitude.\n  He has expressed disdain for some of our allies for positions they \nhave taken. He has accused Premier Chretien of Canada of ``moral \nposturing.''\n  The Sun, a British newspaper, says Bolton is ``one of Tony Blair's \nstrongest critics.''\n  He says the proposed European defense force is a ``dagger pointed at \nNATO's heart.''\n  He says:\n\n       Europeans can be sure that America's days as a well-bred \n     doormat for EU political and military pretensions are coming \n     to an end.\n\n  Mr. Bolton gloated after the vote on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-\nBan Treaty in the Senate:\n\n       The CTBT is dead.\n\n  Mr. Bolton has been highly critical of the agreed framework under \nwhich North Korea pledged to freeze its nuclear weapons program. He \nsays ``the United States suffers no down side'' if we never normalize \nrelations with North Korea.\n  South Korea and Japan, two friends of our country, certainly do not \nagree with that.\n  His position that we should give diplomatic recognition to Taiwan \ncontradicts several decades of official American policy.\n  He says we have no vital interests in Kosovo or the rest of the \nBalkans. He says:\n\n       The problem with Kosovo now is precisely that we do not \n     have concrete national interests at stake, and we are off on \n     a moral crusade. I think there's more than one moral \n     principle in the world, and one moral principle I think we \n     are ignoring in Kosovo is that the President should commit \n     American forces to battle, and possibly to death, only when \n     there is something that matters to us.\n\n  The genocide that was occurring in that region was stopped by U.S. \nintervention. I was as uncomfortable as anyone in this Chamber when we \ncommitted troops for that purpose. I understand there is risk. The fact \nis the genocide was stopped. The killing was stopped and the tens of \nthousands of people whose lives were saved would not share Mr. Bolton's \nevaluation of our response to the difficulties in Kosovo.\n  This President sends us Mr. Bolton's nomination at a time when he is \nproposing we abandon the ABM Treaty. He did not say it quite that way \nlast week, but his previous statements suggest the ABM Treaty is really \nof no value and that it ought to be abandoned. And make no mistake, \nthis administration is prepared to and on the road to abandoning the \nABM Treaty.\n  Its first priority is to build a national missile defense system, \nwants to abandon the Kyoto treaty, and wants to suspend missile talks \nwith North Korea. It opposes the International Criminal Court and \nInternational Landmine Convention.\n  If one listened to President Bush's presentation about a week ago at \nthe National Defense University, one might wonder why he nominated John \nBolton. He describes national security policy in moderate terms, talks \nof consultation and cooperation, and these are concepts that seem \ntotally alien to all the work I have seen expressed by Mr. Bolton in \nquotes, articles, so on.\n  Last Friday, an article in the Washington Post by the columnist \nCharles Krauthammer reveals, I think, the real agenda President Bush \nand also Mr. Bolton aspire to manage. As Mr. Krauthammer puts it, ``the \nBush Doctrine abolishes arms control.''\n  These quotes from Mr. Krauthammer's article are instructive:\n\n       The new Bush Doctrine holds that, when it comes to \n     designing our nuclear forces, we build to suit.\n\n  In other words, it does not matter what other countries think. It \ndoes not matter what our agreements are. It does not matter what \ncircumstances exist in the rest of the world. It does not matter if \nwhat we do ignites a new arms race. What we do ought to suit ourselves, \nand it does not matter the consequences.\n\n       Nor does the Bush administration fear an ``arms race.'' If \n     the Russians react to our doctrine by wasting billions \n     building nukes that will only make the rubble bounce, let \n     them.\n\n  That is saying let us stop this effort to reduce nuclear weapons. Let \nus build a national missile defense system, and if that ignites a new \narms race and we see Russia and China building new offensive weapons, \nso be it; it does not matter at all.\n  That is, in my judgment, a pretty thoughtless approach. It does \nmatter. Those who want to see the United States be a leader in stopping \nthe spread of nuclear weapons and reducing the number of nuclear \nweapons through arms control agreements do believe it matters what we \ndo and believe it matters how others react.\n  ``If others doesn't like it, too bad.'' This is a fascinating article \nby Mr. Krauthammer evaluating the approach of the administration and \nprobably underlines why Mr. Bolton is the nominee.\n  I don't accuse Mr. Bolton of being of bad faith or ill will. He is \njust wrong on these issues. This country is making a very big mistake \nby putting someone with his viewpoint over at State as Under Secretary \nof State for Arms Control.\n  Now I will talk about the effect of some of these policies. I will \nnot speak at great length about national missile defense, but we have a \nthreat chart from the Department of Defense, and about the least likely \nthreat we face is an ICBM with a nuclear warhead from a rogue nation or \na terrorist. A far more likely threat is a pickup truck with a nuclear \nbomb. That is a far more likely threat.\n  The national missile defense being proposed by the President, even if \nit abrogates and scraps the ABM Treaty, will be kind of a catcher's \nmitt, put in the sky to catch nuclear missiles that might be fired at \nus. However, people should understand they are only talking about \ncatching a few missiles because any robust attack could not be defended \nagainst by this system. It is designed to defend against someone who \nwill send one, two, three, four, or\n\n[[Page S4444]]\n\nfive missiles. But it will not defend against an accidental nuclear \nlaunch by a Russian submarine where they unload all the tubes. It will \nnot defend this country against that. And it puts all our eggs in this \nbasket and ignores the far more likely set of threats.\n  It is far more likely, if we were to be terrorized by a rogue nation \nor terrorist state or terrorist group, they would find a delivery \ndevice as simple as a pickup truck or a rusty car or a small deadly \nvial of chemical or biological agents placed at a metro station \nsomewhere. It is far more likely that would represent the terrorist \nthreat using a weapon of mass destruction against the American people. \nYet we are determined, absolutely determined, to build a system that \nwill probably cost up to $100 billion and be a catcher's mitt only in \ncircumstances where someone would launch a couple of missiles.\n  This country, of course, has thousands of nuclear weapons, and this \ncountry would vaporize any terrorist group or any country that launched \na nuclear attack against this country. That has always been the case. \nIt is called mutually assured destruction.\n  The new group that has taken power says that is old fashioned, that \ndoesn't work, or, maybe it worked but it won't work in the future \nbecause we have new adversaries--presuming the adversaries are willing \nto attack us and then to be vaporized by a nuclear response from this \ncountry.\n  Somehow, it seems to me that taking apart arms control treaties that \nhave resulted in real reductions of nuclear weapons and delivery \nvehicles is a step in the wrong direction. It seems to me not caring \nwhether what we do unilaterally will ignite a new arms race and have \nthe Russians and Chinese building new, massive offensive weapon systems \nis not in this country's best interests. Yet that is where we are \nheaded. It is what this administration talks about, and it seems to me \nto be part and parcel of the type of thing we will see with the John \nBolton nomination.\n  Let me talk for a moment about a former majority leader of the \nSenate, Howard Baker, a Republican leader in the Senate, who has done \nsome interesting work on these issues. A bipartisan task force, led by \nHoward Baker and Lloyd Cutler, working on these issues, said the \nfollowing:\n  One of the first national security initiatives of the new President \n[should] be the formulation of a comprehensive, integrated strategic \nplan, done in cooperation with the Russian Federation, to secure and/or \nneutralize in the next eight to ten years all nuclear weapons-usable \nmaterial located in Russia and to prevent the outflow from Russia of \nscientific expertise that could be used for nuclear or other weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  Baker recently told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that:\n\n       It really boggles my mind that there could be 40,000 \n     nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union, poorly controlled \n     and poorly stored, and that the world isn't in a near state \n     of hysteria about the danger.\n\n  According to the Baker-Cutler panel's report:\n\n       In a worse case scenario, a nuclear engineer graduate with \n     a grapefruit-sized lump of highly enriched uranium or an \n     orange-sized lump of plutonium, together with material \n     otherwise readily available in commercial markets, could \n     fashion a nuclear device that would fit in a van like the one \n     the terrorist Yosif parked in the World Trade Center 1993. \n     The explosive effects of such a device would destroy every \n     building in Wall Street financial area and would level lower \n     Manhattan.\n       The most urgent unmet national security threat to the \n     United States today is the danger that weapons of mass \n     destruction or weapons-usable material in Russia could be \n     stolen and sold to terrorists or hostile nation states and \n     used against American troops or citizens at home.\n       The national security benefits to U.S. citizens from \n     securing and/or neutralizing the equivalent of more than \n     80,000 nuclear weapons and potential nuclear weapons would \n     constitute the highest return on investment in any current \n     U.S. national security and defense program.\n  If we decide, as the President suggests, that we will abrogate the \nAntiballistic Missile Treaty with Russia, Russia would respond by \nsuspending their programs that Baker and Cutler say are so vital, and \nrespond by increasing military cooperation with China, Iran, and \nothers, and suspend plans to further reduce their own nuclear arsenal.\n  Let me talk about what we have been doing that is successful and why \nI am so concerned about this nomination. This chart shows what has \nhappened with long-range missile warheads, ICBMs and SS-20s. We have \nhad strategic arms reduction talks that have resulted in a reduction in \nnuclear warheads and delivery vehicles. The INF and START talks \nresulted in a reduction of 6,000 warheads from long range missiles. \nThose 6,000 warheads represented the equivalent of 175,000 Hiroshimas; \n175,000 equivalents of a Hiroshima bomb have been dismantled. Thousands \nstill exist.\n  The question is, Is it moving in the right direction to begin talks \nand arms reduction treaties and agreements with the Soviets and the \nRussians, now, that reduce nuclear warheads and delivery vehicles? It \nseems to me that makes a great deal of sense.\n  This Congress, and previous Congresses, have funded the Nunn-Lugar \nprogram. We appropriate money in order to have the Russians reduce \ntheir nuclear warheads and their delivery vehicles according to the \nagreements we have with them. Because of Nunn-Lugar nearly 6,000 \nnuclear warheads are gone, 597 ICBMs are gone, 367 missile silos are \ngone, 18 ballistic missile submarines are gone, 81 heavy bombers are \ngone.\n  Here is a picture of a submarine. This is a Typhoon-class Russian \nsubmarine. That submarine is now being dismantled by the Nunn-Lugar \nprogram. Soon it will not exist anymore.\n  In fact, I have kept in my desk for some while a small container of \ncopper. This is ground-up copper. This copper comes from wiring from a \nDelta-class ballistic missile submarine, a Russian submarine.\n  I ask consent to demonstrate the two pieces I have as a result of \nthese arms reduction programs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This wiring is ground-up copper wiring from a Russian \nsubmarine. We didn't sink that submarine. We weren't at war with \nRussia. We didn't destroy it. Through our arms reductions program, that \nsubmarine is dismantled and now doesn't exist. So I now stand in \nWashington, DC, holding up ground-up copper wire from a submarine that \nis now dismantled, a submarine of a former adversary. Does that make \nsense? A submarine with warheads aimed at American cities now no longer \nexists.\n  Or, this is a photograph of a Bear Bomber. This is a Russian heavy \nbomber. This is a piece of a wing strut from a Russian bomber. We \ndidn't shoot down this bomber. I have this piece of wing strut from a \nbomber in Russia because we sawed the wings off. We helped pay for \nsawing the wings off and destroying those bombers. Why did they allow \nthem to be destroyed? Because our arms control agreements with Russia \nrequired the reduction of both nuclear warheads and delivery vehicles: \nmissiles, submarines, and long-range bombers. So I am able to hold up a \npart of a wing strut of a Russian bomber in Washington, DC. We didn't \nhave to shoot it down. All we had to do was help buy some saws to saw \nthe wing off and dismantle that plane piece by piece. That bomber that \ncarried nuclear bombs that threatened our country no longer exists.\n  Is that progress? I think it is.\n  So we have what is called the Nunn-Lugar program that we have funded. \nDespite this success, as I indicated, we have something more than \n30,000 to 40,000 nuclear weapons left in the world, the bulk of them in \nthe United States and in Russia. They have a total yield, it is \nestimated, of somewhere around 6,000 megatons. That is 6 billion tons \nof TNT. That is the equivalent power of 400,000 Hiroshima-type bombs--\n400,000 Hiroshima bombs.\n  The Hiroshima ``Little Boy'' bomb killed about 100,000 people. It was \ncalculated the ``Little Boy'' bomb dropped on Hiroshima produced \ncasualties 6,500 times more efficiently than the ordinary high-\nexplosive bomb.\n  So the question for us is: Is there more to do in arms control, arms \nreduction? Is there more to do in stopping the spread of nuclear \nweapons? Will this country be a leader in those areas?\n  The answer for me, clearly, is yes. Yet today we consider the \nadministration's nomination to be the Under Secretary of State for Arms \nControl, Mr. John Bolton, who has little experience in the area. But \nmore alarming in my judgment, is that the expressions he\n\n[[Page S4445]]\n\nhas made about this subject in recent years suggest that he does not \ncare a whit about arms control.\n  He seems to believe, as this administration does, that arms \nreductions are not part of a strategy that makes much sense for this \ncountry. Treaties, arms control talks, somehow represent a display of \nweakness, apparently, and that, if we could, we should just decide to \ngo our own way, build national missile defense, not care what others do \nin reaction to it, and believe it doesn't matter how many nuclear \nweapons exist in the hands of the Russians, or how many nuclear weapons \nand delivery vehicles the Chinese might desire to consider in the \ncoming years. It just doesn't matter, they say.\n  I think that is a very serious mistake for this country to believe \nthat. In my judgment, it is a very serious policy mistake. I think if \never there is a case of a fox in a chicken coop it is Mr. Bolton's \nnomination to be Under Secretary of State for Arms Control. He is the \nwrong person in the wrong place.\n  Let me conclude as I started. I do not know Mr. Bolton personally, \nand I do not mean by my presentation to suggest he is not a perfectly \ngood man, perhaps someone who is well educated--bright I am certain. I \njust feel very strongly, with respect to the consent requirement of the \nSenate, I want someone in the position of Under Secretary for Arms \nControl who believes in arms control. I would like someone who believes \nin a missionary need for this country to provide world leadership in \nstopping the spread of nuclear weapons. I want someone who has passion \nabout trying to engage with those who have nuclear arms and delivery \nvehicles in treaties and talks and agreements to reduce the number of \nnuclear weapons.\n  I do not suggest we do that from a position of weakness. We clearly \ndo it from a position of strength. But those who suggest what happens \nin the rest of the world is irrelevant and the only thing that is \nrelevant is what happens here are just plain wrong.\n  So I will be voting against Mr. Bolton's nomination. I hope others \nwill do so as well. I hope perhaps with that vote we can send a message \nfrom this Senate to this administration that this is not the direction \nthe American people want. This is not the direction the American people \nexpect in terms of trying to reduce the threat of nuclear war, trying \nto reduce the spread of nuclear weapons, and trying to increase the \nopportunity to reduce the nuclear weapons that exist.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. I make a point of order a quorum \nis not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask consent to speak in morning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have come to the floor repeatedly in \nrecent years on the issue of violent offenders being released from \nprison early and in behalf of the people they have murdered while they \nhave been on early release from incarceration for previous violent \ncrimes.\n  I noticed in the last couple of days, once again we had a case--I \nwanted to certainly give the judges here their due--the case of a \nfellow named Robert Lee Dyer, reported in the papers. He is from \nSuitland, MD, arrested almost a year ago, charged with being a \nprincipal in the first degree in the shooting death of a man trying to \nwithdraw money from an ATM machine. He was arrested with Antwon Reid, \nwho was charged with murder in the first. Reid plead guilty, and is now \nserving a life sentence. Mr. Dyer had two bond hearings to determine \nwhether he would be released on bond. The first hearing was before \nJudge Patrice Lewis. She gave the defense attorney the authority to set \nup a property bond and come back in 1 week to see if it would be \nallowed.\n  At the second bond hearing, Judge Thurmond Rhodes set the bond of \n$75,000. Mr. Robert Lee Dyer was released. So for $75,000, this fellow, \nwho had been involved in a murder crime, allegedly, was released.\n  The State's attorney vehemently opposed releasing him on bond. But \nJudge Thurman Rhodes nonetheless released him. The trial for that was \nscheduled to begin May 21 of this year. On May 2 of this year, this Mr. \nDyer was arrested for killing Jamel Stephon Zimmerman. Dyer was the \nalleged shooter. It is said that there is a very strong case against \nhim. A new bond hearing was scheduled for today at 1:15 in front of \nJudge Robert Heffron.\n  There is something fundamentally wrong when time after time after \ntime people are either released from prison or, in this case, released \non bond when we know they are violent. And yet they are released back \nto the streets to kill again.\n  I have spoken at great length about the case of Bettina Pruckmayer--\nand six or eight other cases--a young woman aspiring to begin a new \nlife in Washington, DC; a young attorney, public spirited, working for \na nonprofit organization, who pulls up to an ATM machine only to meet \nLeon Gonzalez Wright to be stabbed over 30 times and killed. Leon \nGonzalez Wright had committed murder before, was let out early, picked \nup for hard drugs while he was let out on probation, and nobody puts \nhim back in jail. Instead, he was walking the streets to kill Bettina \nPruckmayer.\n  That and six or eight other cases I have described is going on all \nacross this country. It is good time for good behavior, and release \nthem early. In this case, don't keep them in jail. Let them post \n$75,000 where they are on America's streets, and the result is innocent \nmen and women are being murdered.\n  There is something wrong with the criminal justice system. I think \nwhat we ought to do is describe the differences that exist between \nthose who commit violent crimes and those who commit nonviolent crimes. \nWe ought to have people in this country understand that if they commit \na violent crime, they are not going to have good time for good \nbehavior. Whatever the judge says, their sentence is going to be that \nthe jail cell number is going to be their address until the end of \ntheir sentence, and no good time off for good behavior.\n  The average sentence served for murder in this country is just over 8 \nyears. The fact is, people are released early for a range of reasons. \nWe know they are violent and they are back on America's streets.\n  A young woman from my State of North Dakota, who I have spoken about \npreviously, was driving along a quiet road, Highway 2, from Williston, \nND, to Minot, ND, one afternoon after attending a League of Cities \nmeeting in Williston. She stopped at a rest stop, and she was unlucky \nenough that afternoon to be confronted at the rest stop by a violent \nfelon from the State of Washington. He had been let out early and \nshould have been in jail. But he wasn't. He slashed her throat. And \nwhile she lay there bleeding, people thought she would die. Someone \ncame along that road that day, and it turned out they had a cell phone. \nThe woman in the car knew something about nursing and she saved Julie's \nlife.\n  The fact is, that young woman, while her life was saved, is now going \nthrough years and years of therapy to be able to talk normally once \nagain. Her throat was slashed very badly when she was assaulted by this \nfelon. He was chased by the police and he committed suicide some miles \ndown the road. But he should not have been on the roads and highways \nand should not have been threatening Julie Schultz. Yet he was.\n  It is true of Mr. Robert Lee Dyer, except that if Judge Thurman \nRhodes had not let him out on bail he would have been incarcerated. \nInstead, Jamel Stephon Zimmerman is now dead.\n  I hope this criminal justice system, judges, prosecutors, and I hope \nfinally this Senate and the House will find a way to pass legislation \nsaying we are going to distinguish between those who commit nonviolent \ncrimes and those who commit violent crimes.\n  Everyone should understand this. Commit a violent crime, and you are \ngoing to spend your time in jail until the end of your term. You are \nnot going to be released early to commit another violent crime against \nan innocent bystander.\n\n[[Page S4446]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.

I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues for their \ngraciousness. I did want a chance to speak about the nomination of John \nR. Bolton to be Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security Affairs. I thank colleagues for providing me \nthis opportunity. My understanding is that we are going to adjourn \nsoon. I hope I have not inconvenienced everyone.\n  Mr. President, filling this position is a critical responsibility of \nthe new administration. Crafting the Nation's arms control agenda is a \nformidable, serious task that directly affects our national security. \nMoreover, the administration needs to have its arms control team in \nplace as soon as possible. For these reasons, I do not oppose John \nBolton's nomination lightly.\n  As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I am convinced \nthat the position of Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and \nInternational Security Affairs must be filled with an individual who is \ncommitted to advancing the entire Nation's agenda. He or she must carry \nout arms control responsibilities in the spirit of idealism that \ncharacterizes the best tradition of America's public servants.\n  The individual who is confirmed by the Senate must provide deliberate \nand thoughtful advice to the Secretary of State, independent of \npolitical party allegiance or affiliation. He or she must be objective \nin his analysis of exceedingly complex issues. He or she must be \ncommitted to protecting our national security, to reducing the world's \nimmense stockpile of nuclear weapons, and to making the world a safer \nplace for all mankind.\n  After careful consideration, I have concluded that John Bolton is not \nthe right man for Under Secretary for Arms Control and Non-\nproliferation. I believe John Bolton is too conservative and too \npartisan; his views are too extreme for a position of this importance \nand he does not represent the kind of bipartisan cooperation needed to \nadvance the Nation's arms control agenda. Finally, I do not believe \nthat John Bolton possesses the requisite arms control experience to \ncarry out the responsibilities of this job effectively.\n  I want to make clear that I do not question John Bolton's integrity \nor his commitment to public service. I had a chance to meet with him, \nand I do not question this at all. He has a long career in senior \nappointed positions in the administrations of Presidents Reagan and \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush. I respect his willingness to serve our \nNation again. I recognize the prerogative and responsibility of \nPresidents to nominate their foreign policy teams. I have supported a \nmajority of the President's nominations. But, I also insist on \nexercising my constitutional right as a Senator to provide advice and \nconsent to the President's nominations.\n  I have fundamental disagreements with this nominee on a number of \nsubstantive issues. I believe that in this case the gap between the \nviews of the voters I represent in Minnesota and John Bolton's are too \nwide to ignore. There is ample room in a democracy for a wide spectrum \nof political philosophy and belief. I believe in the free exchange of \nideas. Divergent views make our public debate healthier and our Nation \nstronger. My opposition to John Bolton is not merely ideological. I \nbelieve our primary public official responsible for arms control, \nnonproliferation, and security policy must make a convincing case that \nhe or she will advance the Nation's agenda in a constructive and \npositive fashion. To date, John Bolton has come up short in this \nregard.\n  First and most important, I am disturbed by John Bolton's views on \nstrategic nuclear policy.\n  He opposed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a treaty which I \nsupported, voted for, and believe in. Our failure to approve this \ntreaty effectively scuttles it and leaves the United States as the \nspoiler in this international effort to curb nuclear testing. The CTBT \nwas the first modern arms control agreement ever rejected. It was \ndefeated in a period of intense partisan bickering and ideological \npolarization.\n\n  Yet, at the time of CTBT defeat, two of my distinguished colleagues, \nSenator Hagel and Senator Lieberman, a Republican and a Democrat, wrote \nin a New York Times op-ed that:\n\n       Our constituents and our allies have expressed grave \n     concerns about our hasty rejection of the (CBTB) treaty and \n     the impact of that rejection on the treaty's survival. They \n     need to know that we, along with a clear majority in the \n     Senate, have not given up hope of finding common ground in \n     our quest for a sound and secure ban on nuclear testing.\n\n  I share this belief and I am convinced that is important for the \nnation's chief\n\n[[Page S4447]]\n\narms control administrator to be on record as favoring strict curbs to \nnuclear testing.\n  In the days following its defeat, John Bolton announced that the \n``CTBT is dead.'' He characterized proponents of the treaty as \n``misguided'' and ``neo-pacifists.'' These remarks ill serve the \nefforts of many of my Senate colleagues and of thousands of dedicated \nactivists world-wide who are committed to ending the reckless \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons. They are not the kind of remarks that \nspeak well for a member of a new administration.\n  On another key international agreement on which the Under Secretary \nof State for Arms Control must advise the President and Secretary of \nState, John Bolton has not made up his mind. You will recall that on \nMarch 29, John Bolton told members of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee that his views on whether the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty \nis in force or not were not fully formed. He asked for time for the \n``intellectual heavy lifting'' required to understand this issue. I am \nthe first to admit that the issues raised in the ABM treaty are \nextremely complex. But is it right to give the consent of the United \nStates Senate to a nominee who has not fully thought out issues that \nare fundamental to our national security?\n  On the role of international institutions, John Bolton has been both \noutspoken and negative. Again, I do not share his views.\n  He has not supported the critically important role of the United \nNations. I agree with him that the U.N. is not a perfect institution. \nBut, it remains the sole forum in which all nations of the world \ndiscuss international issues. John Bolton has suggested that we would \nbe better off if the U.N. were decapitated and the top 10 stories of \nthe U.N. building in New York removed. This blanket condemnation of an \ninternational body created to promote peacemaking and mutual \nunderstanding is discouraging coming from a former Assistant Secretary \nof State of International Organizations. As a nation, we have a 50-year \ncommitment to the U.N. As a United States Senator, I will continue to \ninsist that we fulfill this commitment.\n  The nominee to this position should be fully dedicated to pursuing \nmultilateral diplomacy. CTBT is, after all, a multilateral treaty. \nIncreasingly, we live in a multipolar world that requires our senior \ndiplomatic officials to be fully aware and sensitive to the concerns of \nall nations, including the non-aligned and developing countries as well \nas first world countries. If our officials do not appreciate this world \nview, they will not be intellectually equipped to provide sound advice \non the conduct of American foreign policy.\n  John Bolton has asserted (in the 1994 Global Structures Convocation) \nthat ``there is no such thing as the United Nations. There is an \ninternational community that occasionally can be led by the only real \npower left in the world and that is the United States when its suits \nour interest and we can get others to go along.'' In today's world, \nthese remarks are inevitably seen by the rest of the world as \narrogant, confrontational, and condescending. They make it more \ndifficult for the U.S. to provide world leadership. I would suggest \nthat President Bush find a more inspiring leader to serve in the new \nAdministration.\n\n  On the issue of trade in conventional arms, I am not convinced that \nJohn Bolton possesses the objectivity to provide advice that is always \nin the best interests of the United States.\n  The Under Secretary of State for Arms Control is a key player \nformulating the Administration's policy on arm sales to politically \nsensitive countries. Foremost of these is Taiwan.\n  John Bolton would undoubtedly be an aggressive supporter of future \nsales to Taiwan. In his past writings, he has explicitly supported \nindependence for Taiwan. At the hearings last month, he appeared to \nback off from this position somewhat. We are left uncertain about what \nhis real views are. For a senior State Department official, this \nposture is unsettling. When John Bolton sits down to advise the \nSecretary of State on relations with Taiwan, which view will Colin \nPowell be getting?\n  It may be instructive to look at this position in the context of John \nBolton's work in behalf of Taiwan. In accordance with disclosure \nrequirements for consideration for this post, John Bolton reported \nreceiving $30,000 from the Taiwanese government for a series of 3 \narticles he wrote from 1994 to 1996. The articles argued in favor of a \nU.N. seat for Taiwan. Twice during this period, Bolton testified before \nthe House Foreign Affairs Committee on the same subject.\n  I am not critical of Mr. Bolton for offering his legal and literary \nservices to the Taiwanese government. That is his private affair. \nHowever, I am concerned that his unorthodox pro-independence views on \nTaiwan plus his acceptance of fees may color his judgment on key issues \nrelating to Taiwan. If not handled in a balanced and deliberate way, \narms sales issues have the potential to be destabilizing for the entire \nEast Asian region.\n  On other issues of international significance, I do not believe John \nBolton's views are in the best interest of the United States.\n  Bolton opposes creation of an International Criminal Court (ICC), \nwhich I have supported. Our failure to support the ICC was one of the \nreasons that the United States was voted off the United Nations Human \nRights Commission on May 3, for the first time since the commission was \nfounded under U.S. leadership in 1947.\n  Bolton supports covert actions to arm and train Iraqi opposition to \noverthrow Saddam Hussein. I have profound reservations about this \napproach to eliminating Saddam. Before we back Iraqi opposition groups \nfinancially and logistically, we need practical assurances that these \ngroups have the support of the Iraqi people, are capable of using our \nresources effectively, and are committed to following through with a \nrealistic campaign.\n  Bolton has written that our approach to the North Korea Agreed \nFramework is ``egregiously wrong.'' This is an initiative that the \nClinton Administration spent years patiently crafting with the North \nKoreans. It has the support of the Japan and the European Union in \naddition to the government of South Korea, which is taking courageous \nsteps to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula. In my judgment, U.S. \ninterests are best served by providing continuity to this approach and \nnot by undercutting the South Korean leadership.\n  Regarding Kosovo, John Bolton has demonstrated little appreciation of \nour national interests in resolving the most violent threat to the \nstability of Europe since the fall of the Berlin Wall. Indeed, Bolton \nwrote that President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair's \njustification for military action is ``singularly, and indeed, proudly \ndevoid of any concrete U.S. or UK interests as we traditionally \nunderstand the term. Indeed, they justified the instigation of \nhostilities as a humanitarian intervention.'' In my opinion, our \nhumanitarian interests are always in our national interests. Senior \nState Department officials should understand this point unequivocally.\n\n  John Bolton's work for the Reagan administration has also drawn fire. \nAt the Department of Justice under Attorney General Meese, Bolton \nearned a reputation for his abrasive and controversial tactics in \ndealing with Congressional requests for information. I understand from \nsome of my colleagues that he was repeatedly unhelpful, slow to \nrespond, and argumentative. He was reportedly involved in the delay and \ncover-up of missing documents on several occasions.\n  As I reviewed my prepared remarks on the nomination of John Bolton, I \ncould not avoid the conclusion that the Administration has proposed a \ncontroversial, highly partisan man to perform a job of utmost \nsensitivity and importance to our national interests. John Bolton's \npresence in the inner circle of the State Department may actually \nundercut the promising start of Secretary Colin Powell, who has \ndemonstrated a deft touch and sound judgement in dealing with the our \nallies and friends around the world. I believe we do the nation no \nservice by confirming the wrong man for this position.\n\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/07/senate-section/article/S4448-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4448]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n[[Page S4448]]\n                ADJOURNMENT UNTIL TOMORROW AT 9:30 A.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
