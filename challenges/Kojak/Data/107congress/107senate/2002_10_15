Reading \nthe news and watching on televison the aftermath of the massive attack \nof terrorism in Bali, further convinces us of our battle against an \nevil, world-wide terrorist movement. Lord, help us to deal with this \ninsidious treachery. At the same time, Pakistan boils with anti-\nAmerican sentiment. And we seem to have made little progress in \nnegotiation with Iraq.\n  All this brings us to a deeper reliance on You. Quiet our turbulent \nhearts; renew our dependence on You. Thank You for the great women and \nmen of this Senate. Strengthen them, give them courage, inspire their \ndiscernment, guide their decisions. With them we fall on the knees of \nour hearts and commit our lives to You. Reign supreme in this chamber \nand in the mind and soul of every Senator.

Madam President, I come to the floor today to talk a \nlittle bit about where we are and, hopefully, about where we are going, \nand, more particularly, some comments about energy, which I think is \none of the real important points that we must talk about.\n  First, let me say that certainly we find ourselves in a difficult \nposition as we close this session. I think we have brought ourselves \ninto that position by not moving more quickly on some of the issues \nthat have been out there and that now we desire to have passed.\n  It is very difficult to resolve some of these issues in the ending \nmoments of a session. Certainly, we are not going to be here much \nlonger. Clearly, we are going to go into a recess before the election. \nParticularly those who are running are very anxious to do that. And, \nindeed, to be fair to voters, people who are running should be out in \nthe country talking about their positions.\n  So it seems to me what we have before us is the chore of putting some \npriorities on the many issues that are out there and making the \ndetermination as to which of those are going to be the issues that we \nemphasize and indeed move to finish. And there are lots of them out \nthere.\n  We can talk about the issue of bankruptcy which, of course, is \nsomething that has been ongoing for a long time. We have not been able \nto come together on the fairness of that. We can talk about reinsurance \nfor construction, particularly for large buildings. That issue is very \nimportant to the economy. It is one we have not been able to resolve, \nmostly because of a liability issue.\n  Certainly, an unemployment extension is something that needs to be \ndealt with, as it expires in the fairly near future. On the other hand, \nthe points of view are quite different in terms of the most effective \nand efficient way to do that.\n  We have Medicare givebacks, as it is called, which is in relation to \ntaking up the slack in hospital costs in provider payments over a \nperiod of time, which, if not corrected, very likely will cause some \nproviders not to deal with Medicare patients. It is very important. I \nhappen to be from a rural State. There are activities related to that \nwhich specifically have to do with rural health care. And we would like \nto do that.\n  And there are other issues. But there are a great many items, of \ncourse, which, when you come to the end of the session, everybody wants \nto take a look at. These are all items that have not been done during \nthe year, and when putting them together it can become a very haphazard \nkind of approach. Frankly, I think the leadership responsibility, and \nthe responsibility for all of us, is to cut through that and to \nestablish some priorities and talk about those things that need to be \ndone. It sounds increasingly as if we will be back in a lame duck \nsession after the election is over to finish some of the items. Most \napparent among them are appropriations bills.\n  We do not have a budget. It is the first time in many years we have \nnot had a budget. A budget is very important, not simply because there \nwould be a budget but because it is a process for holding down \nspending. And if the appropriations bills exceed the budget that has \nbeen agreed to, then you can ask for a point of order, and then have to \nhave more votes to pass it than you do without it. So it is not just \nthe idea of a budget for the sake of a budget; it is a mechanism that \nhelps hold down spending.\n\n  I think we have passed just 1 out of 13 of those appropriations \nbills. Hopefully, in the next 2 days, we will pass another. We must \npass the Defense appropriations bill, in my judgment, because the need \nfor defense dollars certainly has increased over last year. And the \ncontinuing resolution we will pass will simply extend the authority of \nthe other appropriations bills we passed last year at their levels.\n  So we have some items that have to be done. I think we are going to \nbe dealing, of course, with election reform. It is very important. It \nis hardly our biggest priority, in my view, because it does not apply \nto this election. But it will apply in the next election. We have some \ntime in that regard. Nevertheless, it is on the agenda.\n  As I said, we are going to be dealing with the Defense appropriations \nbill. It is a must-do piece of legislation, in my opinion. Certainly, \nthen, in order to continue to have the Government operate, we have to \npass a CR. I suppose maybe there are other items with which we need to \ndeal. In my view, those seem to be the items that are necessary and \nthat we need to do.\n  One of the issues out there that has been difficult--but I think we \nhave worked at it for a very long time--is an energy policy. We have \nnot had an energy policy in this country for a very long time. We need \nan energy policy. We need it particularly now in terms of the turmoil \nin the Middle East. A good deal of our energy is imported from the \nMiddle East. We need an energy policy now because of our economic \ncondition. Energy is certainly a big part of our economy and our \nsecurity. Those are two issues that are most important to all of us. \nAnd to do that well, we need an energy policy.\n  The President asked for an energy policy nearly 2 years ago--a year \nand a half ago. He outlined an energy policy that he sent to us. We \nhave been all this time trying to come up with our own energy policy. \nCertainly, we have a broad energy policy. We have talked about lots of \nthings that go into it. We talked about production. We talked about the \navailability of energy sources.\n  We have gotten ourselves into the position of importing nearly 60 \npercent of our energy. And that situation is very iffy because of the \ncondition we are now facing. So we do have to do some things.\n  We talk about production in the energy bill. We talk about production \nin terms of encouraging the production of oil, production of coal, the \nproduction of gas. Some of the proposals have to do with access to \npublic lands where, such as in my State, for example, 50 percent of the \nState belongs to the Federal Government. And in many of the Western \nStates more than that belongs to the Federal Government.\n  So we have to devise a plan where we can take advantage of those \nresources and, at the same time, of course, take care of the \nenvironment. We can do that. And we have shown we can do that.\n  We are particularly interested in coal as being a source of energy \nthat we pursue more. People are in favor of that. We have to do more \nabout clean air. We have to do some research on coal. We have to do \nwhat is necessary to provide clean-coal energy. More than 55 percent of \nelectricity is now produced from coal. And 95 percent of our fossil \nfuel is coal. So coal is very important to our energy use.\n  In the bill there are a number of items that have to do with \nencouraging the clean use of coal, whether it be in research or whether \nit be incentives to build new plants or upgrade existing plants to make \nthem more clean, including existing plant credits.\n  Oil and gas: Of course oil provides about 40 percent of our Nation's \nenergy. Natural gas is providing more than it did in the past. But, \nnonetheless, we need to continue to work on that.\n  Oil has been a controversial issue, of course. The idea that you open \nup less than 2,000 acres out of millions has seemed not to be \nacceptable by environmentalists. Another opportunity would be, perhaps, \nto go from private land to cross some of the ANWR with a right-of-way. \nI don't know whether that will be acceptable.\n  Nevertheless, I think we have to move forward. And we have to have \nmore geophysical research. We are working on that. We can do something \nabout rental payments. All of these areas of concern encourage \nproduction.\n  Along with this, we have to continue to look at conservation: \nconservation in homes, conservation in the kinds of equipment that we \nhave in our homes. We have to also take a look at automobiles to do \nsomething with CAFE standards to reduce energy use. But there are many \nthings we can do in terms of conservation, and indeed we should.\n\n[[Page S10403]]\n\n  One of the areas in which I have been particularly interested and one \nthat is now under debate--and I don't know where we are in terms of the \ntiming--is the electrical provisions. That is very important. All of \nus, obviously, depend on electricity in our homes and in our \nbusinesses. We have had electricity very reliably for a good long time. \nWe found last year in the California experience some difficulties in \nreliability brought about for various reasons. Nevertheless, it raised \nthe specter of unreliable electric service. So we deal with that in the \nbill, some reliability provisions.\n  We are changing the way we do electricity. In the past, you had an \nelectric company that served an area in terms of its customers and also \ngenerated its own power and did its own distribution. Now we are moving \nto a situation where you have generators that are not in the \ndistribution business and sell their energy where it is needed. It is \nprobably a very efficient way to do things, but it is a change. During \nthe process of that change, there have to be some changes in the rules \nas well--access to transportation and transmission, probably over time \na transmission system that is made up of regional distribution \norganizations off nationwide transmission lines, for example.\n  As there is more market in the sale of electricity, there has to be \ntransparency so we avoid some of the kinds of issues that allegedly \noccurred in California, and we can do that. There are things we need to \ndo there, as well as in conservation, in terms of being able to \nrenovate generation plants to make them more efficient without having \nto go back and redo the whole generator.\n  We are talking about mergers, doing away with some of the old laws \nwith respect to mergers and dealing with energy as it exists now in the \nmore modern phase and many of the things with which we need to deal. I \nhope we are able to do that.\n  One of them is Indian energy. There is a proposition in the bill that \nallows for easier access to Indian lands, should they want to do that, \nwhich is good for them economically as well as providing more energy \nfor the country.\n  I mentioned clean coal. We have been doing a good deal more research \nso that coal can be used that way. We have talked about nuclear power. \nNuclear power certainly is one of the cleaner powers we have, and \nindeed nearly 20 percent of the energy in Illinois, for example, is \nnuclear. So it is an opportunity for us to do many of the things we \nneed to do and can do in a way that is acceptable, particularly to the \nenvironment.\n  Renewables have been one of the real areas of controversy. Renewables \nnow, not including hydro, produce about 1 percent of our energy, our \nelectric energy. So it is very small. But the opportunity to grow, of \ncourse, whether it be wind energy, whether it be Sun energy, whether it \nbe other kinds of renewables, is out there. The question is, Do you \nmandate renewables that cause the consumers to have to pay more at this \ntime or do you give incentives so that we can go forward in that way?\n  I always remember years ago--of course, Wyoming is an energy-oriented \nState. We had a meeting there. I believe the speaker was from Europe, \nbut he made the point--and I think it is an excellent point--that \nthrough time we have never run out of a fuel; we move from one fuel to \nanother as we find new, more efficient fuel. We used to have wood. Now \nwe don't use wood. Then we had coal. Then we had gas. And we \nwill continue to do that as science looks for new ways to provide \nenergy. We need to do that.\n\n  Ethanol has been one of the issues as well: How much requirement is \nincluded in the ethanol and what percentage of it is in gas and so on. \nThose are the kinds of issues we have talked about a great deal.\n  Part of the bill also has to do with the pipeline from Alaska for \nnatural gas so we can have that kind of resource available to us.\n  Many of these things are being considered in the tax title where \nthere will be incentives for the kinds of production we need for the \nkinds of research we need and the things that can happen.\n  So we are down to, frankly, a stressful point in terms of timing. We \nhave worked on this energy policy now for the better part of 2 years. \nWe have worked on it here in the committee for a long time. Finally, \nunfortunately, it was pulled from the committee and put on the floor \nwithout a committee bill. I think we were 4 weeks here on the floor \ntalking about energy. So we spent a good deal of time on it.\n  Obviously, different parts of the country have different points of \nview as to how energy bills ought to be structured and how they impact \ndifferent parts of the country. Some States are more production \noriented; others are more user oriented. And there are some differences \nthere.\n  There is always a conflict about how much authority goes to FERC, the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission, as opposed to the States. That, \nof course, is one of the reasons that many of us are in favor of \ngetting the regional transmission organizations going, so that the \ndecisions that have to be made interstate in these areas can be made \nlargely by the States and they come to an agreement as to how you do \nthat.\n  Also, there are always some difficulties, of course, between the \nmunicipals and co-ops as opposed to investor-owned utilities. It is not \nan easy project, but it is one that is very important to our comfort, \nvery important to our economy, very important to our security, and one \nthat has had a great deal of work on it this year.\n  I guess we will probably know tomorrow whether that committee that \nhas been dealing with trying to bring together the House and the Senate \nwill be able to put forth a bill. We are hopeful that indeed they will. \nOf course, it may lap over into a lame duck session, but that is fine. \nI suppose in the worst instance--at least I think it is the worst \ninstance--if we don't do anything, then we can take this work and put \nit back into next year's efforts. But we do need to be more aware of \ndoing the things in this body that need to be done. And, of course, we \ndon't all agree, but we need to find ways to move forward.\n  We have found ourselves in the last several months without much \nforward movement, without much activity--still haven't done homeland \nsecurity over relatively small differences of view.\n  I am hopeful that as we enter into these literally last few hours \nhere before we have some kind of recess, we can set some priorities \ncollectively, do those things that must be done and not try to do \neverything haphazardly, which will obviously result, if we do too many \nthings to move forward--do what we have to do, go do our elections, \ncome back, and then we will have to take up what is yet undone.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10403-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10403-S10404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ECONOMIC NEWS\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, last Friday the majority leader, \nSenator Daschle, along with the minority leader in the House, \nCongressman Dick Gephardt, presided over an economic summit and \ndiscussed the state of the economy. Since that summit was called, the \nDow Jones average has gone up close to 800 points. I would like to \ncongratulate them for their wisdom in calling such a summit and \nproducing that result. I hope they will have another one and we will \nhave the Dow go up another 800 points.\n  I was not planning to talk about this, but when I was on my way to \nlunch, I checked and discovered that at that time, at least, the Dow \nwas at 8200, whereas it was down in the low 7000s just a week ago.\n  I know this will come as something of a disappointment to those who \nare hoping in the election that the economy will be seen as terribly \nunder water and will do their very best to try to stir up a sense of \nblame for the lousy economy and blame it on one party or the other.\n  I am encouraged by the wisdom of the American people. According to \nthe latest polls, the majority of the American people, who have a view \non the economy and where it is, understand that we are not in a \nrecession anymore. We are, in fact, in a recovery; all of the rhetoric \nis to the contrary here on the floor of the Senate.\n  Secondly, the recession that preceded this recovery was caused \nprimarily by the business cycle and was not caused\n\n[[Page S10404]]\n\nby President Bush's election or any other political event. As I have \nsaid here on the floor before, the business cycle has not been \nrepealed. We would like to think we could repeal the business cycle. \nIndeed, if we knew how, both parties would do it because neither party \nwants to go into an election situation where the economy appears soft. \nSo both parties--if they understood how to repeal the business cycle--\nwould quickly take the steps to do that.\n  As a matter of fact, however, as we look at it throughout our \nhistory, Congress's record--indeed the administration's record--has not \nbeen all that good in terms of dealing with the business cycle. \nUsually, when we get into the business of trying to outguess it, we \nmake things worse rather than better. I remember reading a book by Paul \nJohnson where he was talking about the Great Depression and the great \nefforts being expended by the New Deal. He said the efforts expended by \nthe New Deal administration in the 1930s made the Great Depression last \nlonger and go deeper than would have been the case if they had done \nabsolutely nothing.\n  I commented on that to some Ph.D. economists and said that I \nunderstand that is heresy, and they said: No, quite the contrary, \nSenator. That is basically what has been understood and is being taught \nin the schools of economics around the country--that the intervention \nin an attempt to override the marketplace and the laws of economics, \nhowever well-meaning on the part of the Government, actually makes \nthings worse rather than better.\n  As we look at our last recession, we know now pretty clearly what \ncaused it. It was the bubble of speculation that surrounded the high-\ntech industry, and people got carried away with their conviction that \nthe bull market was never going to turn to a bear; that we were always \ngoing to be going up, up, and up--as Lucy wanted to in the Charlie \nBrown cartoon. Charlie said, ``Life has its ups and downs.'' She said, \n``I want nothing but ups.'' There were plenty of people in the 1990s \nlooking at the market and the economy and saying: We want nothing but \nups.\n  Sometimes that cannot be accomplished. We got out ahead of \nourselves--there was too much capacity. The business cycle kicked in, \nas it always does, and there we were in a recession. The slowdown \nbegan--we now know--in the midyear of 2000. I remember, with some \ninterest, because there was an election going on, there were those who \ncriticized then-Governor Bush, who was saying that we were going into a \nslowdown. They said: No, no, we are not going into a slowdown. You are \ntrying to pretend that it is for political purposes, and isn't it \nterrible for you to be saying there is a slowdown underway when, \nindeed, we are still having ups, ups, and ups.\n  We now know that then-Governor Bush was right; we were going into a \nslowdown in the last half of 2000. It turned into a recession that \nlasted for three quarters--the last three quarters of 2001. Then we \nstarted coming out of it. Well, those numbers don't add up. The \nrecession started in the beginning of 2001. We have now had five \nquarters of growth--admittedly, not as strong as we would like to have. \nAdmittedly, there are sectors of the economy that are still mired in \nrecession. Talk to the people in the hospitality industry. Travel has \nnot come back since September 11 to the degree that it was there \nbefore--particularly business travel. Airplanes are full, but the \nairplanes are not making any money because in order to get them full, \nthe airlines are heavily discounting fares. So that portion of the \neconomy is not doing well.\n\n  Housing has done extremely well. Consumer spending stays up because \nhousehold income has held. The sense of wealth has held because \npeople's houses are worth more. They have lost money in the stock \nmarket, but they have seen equity increases in housing, primarily \nbecause of lower interest rates. I think the lesson is that we can get \ncarried away with our economic analysis. We can look back and say the \neconomy boomed in the nineties because Bill Clinton was elected \nPresident or we can say, no, the economy boomed because Newt Gingrich \nwas the elected Speaker.\n  The fact is, we need more humility as politicians and we need to \nunderstand the economy boomed because the American entrepreneurs and \nbusiness people did a good job. Those of us in Congress and those in \nthe White House contributed to it basically to the extent that we got \nout of the way and let it happen. Now, we need to have some of that \nsame understanding.\n  I would like to pass the terrorism insurance bill. I think that would \ngo a long way toward bringing the commercial real estate sector of the \neconomy back. That sector is hurting, and one of the reasons is that \npeople will not engage in major commercial enterprises if they cannot \nget terrorism insurance. We have been sitting on that bill in this body \nfor close to a year. We passed it. It has gone to conference. The \nconferees have not been allowed to produce a product yet. I hope the \nmajority leader will work with the conferees in allowing them to bring \na conference report to the floor before we adjourn. I think that is one \nthing we can do that would make the recovery more robust than it is.\n  Basically, Madam President, I think we need, as I say, a little \nhumility as politicians, and we need to understand the economy is very \nsound, very strong, and it is coming back--but a little more steady as \nshe goes rather than a sense of panic is what is called for.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the state of our \neconomy. I was heartened to read in this morning's Washington Post that \nthe administration is finally acknowledging our economy is in trouble. \nOf course, it came as the Republican National Committee was writing a \nmemo to send to its campaign, reporting that internal polling shows the \neconomy is the most important issue to voters. Surprise. It seems the \nBush administration is more interested in responding to recent poll \nnumbers than responding to the economic indicators that have been \nstaring them in the face for more than a year.\n  The economic statistics are most troubling. Business investment is \ndown. The annual growth of business investment is 7.6 percent, the \nweakest business investment trend under any administration in the past \n50 years. Consumer confidence is down. Between January of 2001 and \nAugust of 2002, consumer confidence dropped by nearly one-fifth. The \nstock market is down, as everyone knows. Between January 2001 and \nSeptember 2002, stocks listed on the New York stock market exchange and \nthe Nasdaq markets lost $5.2 trillion in market value, a loss of more \nthan 35 percent, or more than $9 billion per day.\n  The 23 percent average annual decline in the S average index under \nthe current administration is the sharpest decline since the Hoover \nadministration. Last month was the worst September performance for the \nDow Jones industrial average since 1937.\n  The Congressional Budget Office said last Friday the Federal \nGovernment 2002 deficit will hit $157 billion. This onslaught of red \nink is truly remarkable. It is being driven by the largest percentage \ndrop in individual tax revenues since 1947. That is over 50 years ago.\n  Let me give the folks a little Yankee economic wisdom. People pay \nless in taxes when their earnings go down. We are now spending Social \nSecurity revenues to balance our budgets for the first time since 1997. \nNinety-four percent of the surpluses projected when President Bush took \noffice have already disappeared. That is a $5.3 trillion drop in just 2 \nyears. If the past is any guide, we can expect higher interest rates in \nthe future as the Government competes with the private sector for \ncapital.\n  With all of this, I was stunned to receive a letter from the \nCongressional Budget Office late Friday which indicates even more \nlayoffs of American\n\n[[Page S10405]]\n\nworkers may be around the corner. These layoffs can be attributed to \nthe lack of commitment from the administration to fully fund our \nFederal highway program. The CBO letter made clear that the continuing \nresolution, which the other body is working on now, will have the \neffect of cutting future spending on highway construction jobs by over \n$4.1 billion and cutting current spending by $1.1 billion.\n  I quote the letter of October 11, 2002, from the Director of CBO \nregarding the amendment being proposed by the other body:\n\n       With the amendment, CBO would reduce its estimate of 2003 \n     obligations and outlays under a full-year continuing \n     resolution by $4.1 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.\n\n  I am convinced that we need more leadership from the White House on \nthe issue of jobs for American families. Our attention is constantly \nbeing diverted by the White House talk of war. Unemployment in \nSeptember stood at 8.1 million Americans. This does not count those who \nhave given up hunting for work. That is 1 million more unemployed as \ncompared to a year ago. Families whose unemployment benefits have long \nsince run out are focused on how they will pay their rent or make their \nmortgage payments or, even worse, where they will get their very next \nmeal.\n\n  Construction jobs are good jobs. Each $1 billion spent on highway \nprojects creates 47,500 full-time jobs. These jobs help the entire \neconomy, not just the transportation sector. The cut in funding \nhighlighted by the CBO letter means nearly 200,000 Americans will not \nfind gainful employment, which they could find if it was better \nhandled.\n  According to the Department of Transportation, our network of \nhighways contributes, on an average, one-quarter of the yearly \nproductive growth rate in the United States.\n  To quote the Department of Transportation:\n\n       This highlights the highway network's importance to \n     maintaining economic growth.\n\n  The White House needs to listen to its own transportation department. \nThe U.S. Department of Transportation says for each $1 billion invested \nin highways, almost 8,000 direct on-site highway construction jobs are \ncreated. For each $1 billion invested, around 20,000 supply industry \njobs are created. For each $1 billion invested, around 15,000 jobs are \nsupported within the general economy as highway construction employees \nspend their wages.\n  I say to the White House, devote at least some attention away from \nIraq and to getting Americans back to work. I urge the White House to \nsupport funding in the continuing resolution which allows us spending \nat the rate of $31.8 billion, equal to last year's level.\n  As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, I will \nwork with the congressional leadership to assure maximum funding \npossible for the reauthorization of the transportation bill.\n  I feel sad today when I look at the economy and think what it could \nbe or should be; yet we are spending all our time on an important \nissue, no question, about the status of Iraq. But I hope this body will \nturn its attention now to economics and the problems we are having and \nthose that will lie ahead if we do not take action now.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10405-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10405-S10408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, last week we completed our debate on \nIraq. It was a difficult debate, but at the end we were able to come \ntogether to speak with a large degree of consensus on an issue of \nnational security. To Democrats, security means more than national \nsecurity and homeland security. It also means economic security, \nretirement security, the security of knowing that if you lose your job, \nyou can find a new one, and if you get sick, you can get health care. \nAnd it means the security of knowing that those goals are not being \nundermined by poor economic leadership and ideologically driven \neconomic leaders.\n  The news, when it comes to America's economic security today, has not \nbeen good. This chart shows one of the many ways with which to \ndetermine the state of the economy. Last week, the Wall Street Journal \nreported that we are experiencing the worst market since the 1930s. \nThis is not just a bear market, it is a grizzly bear market. The broad \nStandard & Poor's 500 Stock Index has now lost nearly half of its \nvalue. Since President Bush took office, Americans have seen the \nmarkets lose $5.7 trillion in value. That is $9.5 billion a day that \nhas come out of the market. This red piece of the pie chart is an \napproximation of what has been lost. About one-third of the entire \nmarket capitalization has been lost in less than 2 years--$5.7 \ntrillion.\n  Here is what that means to a person with $100,000 in a 401(k) \ninvested in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index when President Bush took \noffice. The value of their investment has now decreased by $35,000. \nMany who were invested more aggressively have lost much more. If you \nhad $100,000 in January of 2001, you now have $65,000 in September of \n2002.\n  A lot of Americans who are lucky enough to have a little bit of money \nsaved and invested are seeing their children's college investments and \ntheir own nest eggs disappear. We have recently seen an increase in the \nnumber of 60- to 70-year-olds in the workforce. These people are not \nwondering when they will be able to retire. Now they are wondering if \nthey will be able to retire.\n  This chart shows what has happened in the job market in the last 2 \nyears. The people wondering if they will be able to retire are the \nlucky ones. To even think about retiring, you have to have a job. Since \nPresident Bush took office, unemployment has jumped by 1.5 percent. \nMore than 2 million people have lost their jobs. These are private \nsector jobs. We started in January of 2001 at 111 million jobs actually \nbeing held. We have now dropped from 111 million to 109 million in \nabout 18 months. Many of those who lost their jobs are having trouble \nfinding new work. Nearly 1.5 million people have been unemployed now \nfor over 6 months. These people have not just lost their jobs, they are \nstarting to lose hope.\n  This chart shows what we had at the beginning of the year 2001. About \n648,000 people were unemployed for more than 26 weeks. That number has \nnow jumped from 648,000 to 1,585,000 people. Now they are also losing \ntheir unemployment insurance. Unemployment insurance is supposed to \nprovide temporary help to people who lose their jobs to tide them over \nuntil they find new ones. But now many who lost their jobs in the \nmonths after September 11 are losing their benefits. Now they are \ntrying to find a job in an economy even worse than the one that had \ncaused them to lose their job in the first place.\n  This chart shows what has happened. In 1992, 1.4 million workers had \nexhausted their unemployment benefits. Now, in the year 2002, we expect \nthat number to be exceeded by 800,000--the number of people who will \nexperience the expiration of their unemployment benefits.\n  The market is in steep decline. People are losing jobs. People are \nunable to find jobs. There is a daily drumbeat of negative economic \nnews. There is no question--any one of these charts points out very \nclearly--Americans are hurting.\n  But this administration does not understand their pain because it \ndoes not see a problem. On September 5, president Bush said \nconfidently:\n\n       I am optimistic about our economy. I am optimistic about \n     job growth.\n\n  The next day--the very next day--the Bureau of Labor Statistics \nreported that in the previous month manufacturing lost 68,000 jobs and \nretail businesses lost another 55,000.\n  On September 14, we learned that because homeowners were having such \na hard time paying bills, home foreclosure rates reached their highest \nrate in 30 years.\n  A couple of days later, Lawrence Lindsey, Director of the National \nEconomic Council, said:\n\n       There's a lot of good news out there. We have challenges as \n     well. But given those challenges, I think the economy is \n     doing very, very well.\n\n\n[[Page S10406]]\n\n\n  On September 24, we learned that the poverty rate increased for the \nfirst time in 8 years with 1.3 million more Americans falling into \npoverty. We also learned that median household income fell for the \nfirst time in a decade.\n  The next day, Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill told us:\n\n       The latest indicators are good.\n\n  On September 29, the census reported that the number of Americans \nwithout health insurance rose yet again--this time by 1.4 million \npeople to 41.2 million. Not only are low- and middle-income families \nlosing income because of the skyrocketing price of health care premiums \nand prescription drug costs, they are now losing their health \ninsurance.\n  Two days later, the President said:\n\n       I think the economy is strong. There are some rough spots, \n     but we will deal with it.\n\n  Last Thursday, Secretary O'Neill and Secretary Evans had a joint \npress conference. Secretary O'Neill said:\n\n       We are on a bumpy road to recovery, but the direction is \n     still up.\n\n  Secretary Evans added:\n\n       I am one that is pleased with the recovery that is now \n     underway.\n\n  The next day--the very next day--this is what we saw: Consumer \nconfidence and consumer spending depicted in this chart both falling, \nretail sales taking their worst drop since November of last year, and \nconsumer sentiment dropping to levels last seen in the fall of 1993.\n  This chart shows the consumer expectations and what has happened over \nthe course of the last 6 months. In May, consumer expectations were \nrelatively high at 92.7. Many thought the economy was going fairly well \nand thought it was going to continue to do better. That index dropped \nto 87. It went down to 81 in July, and then down to 80. Now it is all \nthe way down to 72. We have lost almost 25 percent of consumer \nconfidence in just 5 months.\n  ``The direction is up.'' That is what the Bush administration said. \nOptimistic about job growth, the latest indicators look good, the \neconomy is doing very well. Some rough spots? I don't know where these \nguys are living, but it must be somewhere within the neighborhood of \noblivious. When it comes to America's economic problems, this \nadministration is woefully out of touch.\n  A couple of weeks ago, the President said:\n\n       I spend a lot of my time worried about the job security of \n     our fellow citizens.\n\n  Last week, it became even more clear that this administration's focus \nis not the economy. The White House announced that the President will \nbe hitting the campaign trail for 14 straight days before the November \n5 election. In fact, I am told he will be coming to South Dakota--my \nState--at least 2 of those 14 days.\n  I would ask President Bush to do one thing: Cancel the political \ntrips and spend less time trying to save jobs for Republican \npoliticians and more time trying to save the jobs of average Americans.\n  Unfortunately, not only are the President and his advisers out of \ntouch with our economic problem, but they are out of step when it comes \nto solutions. They have seemingly pursued ideological goals at the \nexpense of sound economics, and the American people will pay the price.\n\n  Last year, it became clear that our economy was starting to slow. \nEvery objective economist told us tax cuts could help solve the \nproblem. But they had to be the right kind of tax cuts. They had to \nboost consumption be getting money into the hands of people who would \nspend it--people with moderate incomes. It had to be done now, \naffecting the economy now, and affecting people's incomes now. At the \nsame time, we were told that whatever we did, we should make sure it \ndidn't do any long-term fiscal damage.\n  Here is what the Democrats said: let us pass a bill to provide \nimmediate tax relief for all families. Let us do that now--just as the \neconomists proposed we do it. It included a tax cut check. Unlike the \nplan that passed, it made sure every taxpayer, including those who pay \nonly payroll taxes, would get one. It would have also reduced the 15-\npercent tax rate--the rate paid by all income-tax payers--to 10 \npercent, and it would have done it permanently. It would have been \nfair, fiscally responsible, and stimulative.\n  Instead of passing that responsible plan, the President and his \nadvisers insisted on a plan that had far less immediate tax relief but \nhad a cost that explodes to $250 billion in the year 2011 alone. Smart \ntax relief for everyone was held hostage by the President and his \nadvisers to a massive tax cut for the very few at the very top.\n  Moderate earners got their $300 immediate rebate check, but not until \nmillionaires got a tax cut equal to that $300 rebate check every other \nday. Now, after going from record surpluses to real deficits, we are \nseeing just how bad a decision that was.\n  After September 11 dealt another blow to our already staggering \neconomy, we all agreed that the American economy needed a stimulus. So \nDemocrats and Republicans of the Senate asked the experts, including \nFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and former Treasury Secretary \nRobert Rubin, what are the most effective steps we can take to shore up \nour economy? Here is what they told us: Put money into the hands of \nlow- and middle-income workers. They are the ones who will spend it \nquickly. Make sure that workers who have lost their jobs receive \nunemployment benefits, and cut taxes for businesses, but limit the tax \ncuts to those who actually help create jobs.\n  Finally, they said our plan must be affordable and temporary. After \nall, the baby boomers start retiring in less than a decade, and we \nshouldn't be taking on major long-term spending or revenue obligations \nthat will make it even more difficult to meet our responsibilities to \nSocial Security and Medicaid.\n  That was the advice we received.\n  What did this administration propose? They proposed permanently \neliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax. House Republicans \nwent a step further and proposed making the alternative minimum tax cut \nretroactive. Incredibly, that one provision would have given $250 \nmillion in one check from the U.S. taxpayers to the Enron Corporation. \nThat is right--$250 million from every taxpayer in America to none \nother than the Enron Corporation.\n  That had nothing to do with stimulus. To this day, I am not sure what \nit had to do with. Instead of a temporary business investment \nincentive, they insisted on a 3-year bonus depreciation, which was \npassed. That essentially said to businesses: You don't need to invest \nnow. Wait a couple of years and see how it goes.\n  The Administration and congressional Republicans have refused to \nprovide any aid to hard-hit States which, as a result, are now being \nforced to cut health care and education programs. They had to be \ndragged kicking and screaming to an extension of unemployment insurance \ndespite the fact that former Treasury Secretary Rubin called it ``a \nnear perfect stimulus.''\n  When the markets were shaken by a wave of corporate scandals, it was \nclear we needed real reform in order to boost investor confidence. The \nadministration again said and did the wrong thing. On January 14, 1 \nmonth after Enron declared bankruptcy, 4 days after the Justice \nDepartment confirmed that a criminal investigation of Enron had begun, \nSecretary O'Neill said:\n\n       Companies come and go. It's part of the genius of \n     capitalism.\n\n  After dragging their feet on corporate accountability, this \nadministration reluctantly came to the conclusion it had to support it. \nBut now it is standing idly by as its appointees try to undermine the \ntough reforms that we passed last summer.\n  Last week, it was reported that Harvey Pitt, the former accounting \nindustry lawyer chosen by President Bush to head the SEC, has given the \naccounting industry a veto over who will head the new Accounting \nStandards Board, the centerpiece of the corporate accountability law we \npassed.\n  According to news reports, Chairman Pitt blocked the appointment of \nJohn Biggs, a highly respected reformer, to head that new board at the \ninsistence--at the insistence--of the accounting industry. If this is \ntrue, it means Harvey Pitt intends to let the same accounting industry \ninsiders, who ran Enron and other corporations into the ground, run the \nnew board that is supposed to prevent future Enrons.\n  Now, as our markets plummet and people are losing their savings, \ntheir\n\n[[Page S10407]]\n\njobs, and their confidence, this administration is again proposing the \nwrong remedies. Even now, they are calling to make the tax cut \npermanent. Regardless of how you feel about that as a policy proposal, \neveryone should be able to agree that new tax cuts in the year 2011 \nwill have no immediate effect on our economy. In fact, by piling on \nanother $4 trillion in debt during the next decade, it could hurt our \neconomy in the short term by pushing up long-term interest rates.\n  Last week, House Republicans pushed through the Ways and Means \nCommittee a completely ill-timed increase in the capital loss limit. \nComing at this moment of intense market volatility, it is likely to \ncause wealthier investors to sell their stock, thereby forcing the \nmarket down and forcing down the value of 401(k) and other investment \naccounting even more.\n  When it comes to dealing with our economy, the President, his \nadvisors, and congressional Republicans have put forward two kinds of \nideas: old ideas and bad ideas. They have been wrong at every turn. And \nthis dramatic failure of economic leadership is doing real harm to \nAmerica's businesses and to the economic security of average working \nfamilies.\n  America deserves better leadership, better ideas, and a real debate \nabout economic future in this country. Democrats believe there are five \nareas in which we can take quick action to help our economy in the \nshort term. These are areas where there should be absolutely no \ndisagreement.\n  First, we should extend unemployment insurance. During the first Bush \nadministration, Democrats and Republicans agreed to extend unemployment \ninsurance three times. We were able to agree that extending \nunemployment benefits was the right approach to a Bush recession then. \nWe should be able to agree that it is the right approach to a Bush \nrecession now.\n  Second, we should provide immediate fiscal relief for States. Right \nnow, States are facing severe budget shortfalls, and many are finding \nthemselves forced to cut crucial services, such as education, health \ncare, and transportation.\n  As Paul Krugman wrote in the New York Times, aid to the States will \n``do double duty, preventing harsh cuts in public services, with \nmedical care for the poor the most likely target, at the same time that \nit boosts demand.''\n  Third, we need to increase the minimum wage. The minimum wage has \nlost significant purchasing power since it was last increased in 1996. \nRaising the minimum wage is not only a statement of our strongly held \nbelief that people who work full time should not live in poverty, but \nby putting money in the pockets of people who are most likely to spend \nit, it is a strong stimulus as well.\n\n  Fourth, we need a strong bill to protect pensions. Democrats have a \nplan that allows workers to hold employers accountable and helps \nworkers get their money back if the people responsible for protecting \ntheir investment abuse that trust. It makes it easier for workers to \nsell their company's stock and diversify their holdings, and it gives \nworkers access to independent, unbiased investment advice.\n  We should be able to reach quick agreement and pass a bill that \nincludes these elements.\n  Fifth, we need to make sure that the strong corporate accountability \nbill we designed, defended, and passed is strongly enforced. The \ncenterpiece of this legislation is an effective, reform-oriented \naccounting oversight board. It is time for the administration to demand \nthat a strong leader is chosen in order to make this a strong board.\n  In addition, we should consider some fresh new ideas about how to get \nour economy moving again.\n  Last Friday, Senator Dorgan and others hosted a bipartisan economic \nforum. Unlike the White House economic summit this summer, we heard \nfrom people across the political and ideological spectrum. It was a \nshame the White House decided not only to decline our invitation to \nparticipate but to dismiss the forum as a publicity stunt because there \nwere a number of interesting ideas discussed.\n  For example, one participant raised the possibility of a second \nrebate, one that would go to everyone who pays payroll or income taxes, \nand time-disbursed spending around the holiday season. It was also \nsuggested that we look to improve the investment incentives we enacted \nearlier this year.\n  The problem with allowing businesses 3 years to take advantage of a \ntax break on new equipment purchases is that many have chose to do what \nwe said they would do, they have chosen to wait. Because we want \nbusinesses to invest now, one of the panelists suggested making the \ninvestment incentive more immediate but more generous.\n  Earlier today, Minority Leader Gephardt laid out a series of other \nideas, including a rebate aimed at lower and middle-income Americans, \ninvestments in school construction, antiterrorism, and help for States \nas they struggle with the health care crisis.\n  These are all ideas that deserve a fair hearing. We should have a \nreal discussion about them, and other ideas, to help our economy in the \nshort term. But we also need to focus on the long term.\n  As a result of what the President has signed into law, or is \ncurrently proposing, our projected surplus of $5.6 trillion becomes a \n$400 billion deficit. The baby boomers are getting ready to retire.\n  This administration did not invite Democrats to their economic \nsummit, and they did not want to attend our economic forum. This \nadministration needs to realize we are all in this together, and the \nonly way we will spark our economy in the short term and strengthen it \nin the long term is by doing it together. Whether that conversation is \npart of a real economic summit or part of some other forum, it is a \nconversation that needs to happen.\n  For the last month and more, the country has been completely consumed \nwith the debate about our proper course in Iraq. Because that debate \nwas about issues of war and peace, and America's national security \ninterests, it was altogether appropriate that we should have a \ncompletely focused dialogue. The President asked for that dialogue, and \nhe demanded we have it before the election. We have met his demand. But \nthe American people have their demands as well.\n  People are anxious, not just about their security against an \ninternational threat, but about the security of their jobs, the \nsecurity of their retirement, the security of their health, and the \nstrength of our national economy.\n  By virtually every measure, the President's economic plan has put \nAmerica on the wrong track. He cannot escape responsibility by blaming \nthe previous administration. He has had almost 2 years to generate a \nrecovery. His economic team cannot divert attention with out-of-touch \nhappy talk or appeals to one or two positive economic indicators. \nPeople see their income falling, their jobs disappearing, their \nretirement funds declining, and the cost of health care rising.\n  We have given the American people the debate the President says they \nneed with regard to Iraq. Now the President should give the American \npeople the other debate they are saying they want: a serious debate \nabout their economic future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the majority leader yield for a question?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank the leader for refocusing on the \ncritical issues of economic security at this time. When I am home in \nMichigan, there is no question that while people are concerned about \nnational security, the issues in front of them every day--economic \nsecurity--are at the top of their list.\n  I also appreciated his focus earlier this year on the issue of \nlowering one of the biggest costs for our seniors and small businesses \nand farmers, everyone in the economy, which is the cost of prescription \ndrugs.\n  I am wondering, as you were talking about the President--now going on \na 14-day trip in terms of campaigning--if you might agree that even \njust picking up the phone and asking the House of Representatives to \ntake up the bill that we passed, S. 812, which would create more lower-\ncost drugs through generics and open the border to Canada and do a \nvariety of things that would lower the prices, wouldn't be something we \ncould call upon the President to do? And wouldn't it be true if we were \nsimply to have the House pass\n\n[[Page S10408]]\n\nthat bill we passed this year, the bill that would create more \ncompetition and lower prices, we could help our families and businesses \ntremendously by lowering the prices of prescription drugs, which are \none of the main explosions of cost to our families?\n  Wouldn't you agree that would be an important focus between now and \nwhen we leave?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for \ncalling attention to yet another economic issue that could have \nprofound consequences on the ability the average working family has \ntoday to pay their bills and to keep their standard of living. As she \nand I have traveled the country, and certainly traveled our States, the \nissue of the cost of prescription drugs comes up over and over again.\n  The Senate passed a prescription drug bill that would reduce the cost \nto every single person purchasing drugs today. It sits languishing in \nthe House of Representatives. I hope the President will do as the \nSenator suggests. I hope he will pick up the phone from Air Force One, \nsince he is traveling all over the country, and tell the Speaker: Pass \nthe bill, give us some real opportunity for relief this year. That, to \nme, would be one of the many things he could do to bring about longer \nterm economic security.\n  The House also did real damage earlier this year. No one has looked \nat the bill, but I hope some day somebody will write the real story \nabout the atrocious legislation passed by the House in the name of \nprescription drugs benefits. Basically, as the Senator from Michigan \nknows so well, because she has become such a leader on this issue, the \nHouse of Representatives has turned over prescription drug coverage for \nseniors to HMOs. Given the horrific examples of abuse in our health \nsystem today, in large measure because of abuse by HMOs, can you \nbelieve anybody would say, well, that is enough. We are now going to \nturn over drug coverage for seniors to HMOs, to the private sector, to \npeople who simply are unable to live up to the expectations of all \nseniors, of the American people?\n  Again, the Senator makes a very important point. We have not been \nable to address prescription drugs this year, in part because of their \ndetermination to turn over responsibility for drug coverage under \nMedicare to HMOs and their unwillingness to deal with the generic \nlegislation passed in the Senate by an overwhelming margin last summer.\n  I thank the Senator for asking the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple of comments. \nParliamentary inquiry: Are we going to be in morning business until 3?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10408-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10408-S10409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BALANCING THE RECORD\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I have heard a couple of speeches by our \nDemocrat colleagues that are basically saying the entire fault of the \neconomy is that of President Bush. I just have a little different view \nand wish to share the view somewhat to balance the record.\n  It is kind of interesting; we are an equal branch of Government, the \nlegislative branch. We are an equal branch to that of the executive. \nFor one branch of Government to say, wait a minute, the economy is bad \nand it is all the President's fault, I find kind of interesting. We \nhave equal powers under the Constitution. Our powers are a little \ndifferent. Maybe sometimes the President gets all the credit when \nthings are good and all the fault when things are bad, but that is not \nquite accurate. Congress shares its portion of responsibility, whether \nit be good or bad.\n  We have done a couple things that are good and some things that are \nbad. Maybe I will point out some of those differences.\n  I find it interesting where one branch of Government is faulting the \nother and assuming that is really the solution. That is not the case.\n  When the recession started, I remember the stock market crashing or \nfalling dramatically in March of 2000. I believe President Clinton was \nPresident at that time, and the market continued to fall. It rebounded \na little bit in August of 2000, and then it fell a lot more and has \nbeen falling since. If you look at the precipitous rise in the stock \nmarket, it probably had risen too much too fast, and so it had some \nfalling out to do. It has fallen; I hope it has not fallen too much. \nMaybe now it has bottomed out and started to increase.\n  Actually, the last few days have been very promising. If somebody \njust got into the market last Monday or Tuesday, they have made a \nremarkable rate of return in the last few days alone. I hope maybe the \nmarket has bottomed out. To say that is all President Bush's fault is \nincorrect.\n\n  The Washington Post on October 25 said:\n\n       To blame the weak American economy on Mr. Bush is nonsense.\n\n  That is a direct quote from the Washington Post, which is not exactly \nPresident Bush's biggest cheerleader. But they happen to be right.\n  Let me say, instead of just trying to throw rocks at the Bush \nadministration, we should be looking at Congress. What can we do. I \ndon't know that we can just pass a few bills and make everything rosy \nin the economy. Nor does everything we do have a negative impact. But I \ndo believe we can make a difference.\n  Some of the things we pass can help, and some of the things we don't \npass can either help or hurt. I will mention those.\n  I remember a person all of us respect, Chairman Greenspan. His \nrecommendation, his advice to Congress was to do two things: Show some \nfiscal discipline and also do things that would stimulate trade. And we \ndid pass a bill, trade promotion authority, this year. Due to President \nBush's leadership, we did get it through the House and the Senate. It \nwasn't easy. It wasn't even pretty in some respects. But it passed both \nHouses. It passed the House by one vote; it passed the Senate by more \nthan that after extraneous measures were put on that were not in the \ncommittee. That was not a good way to legislate. There were three bills \ncombined into one. But we eventually did pass trade promotion \nauthority. That was good. That will help the economy.\n  On the second recommendation, Chairman Greenspan said show fiscal \ndiscipline. I give the White House high marks in many regards. I give \nCongress a very low grade. If I was going to grade Congress on fiscal \ndiscipline, the grade would be an F. I am critical. I am on the Budget \nCommittee. I used to be on the Appropriations Committee. But for the \nfirst time since 1974, we didn't pass a budget. And we have shown no \ndiscipline whatsoever. As a matter of fact, for the last two or three \nCongresses, we have shown very little discipline, whether or not we had \na budget. Even when we had a budget in the last 2 or 3 years of the \nClinton administration, we continually waived it.\n  If you are going to waive it by declaring things an emergency, or \nwaive it and say it doesn't count, we basically had no budget. So as a \nresult, we had Federal spending climbing and climbing dramatically. \nTotal outlays increased, in the year we just completed, 2002, the \nfiscal year, by $148 billion. That is the largest percentage growth in \nspending programs in 20 years.\n  Defense grew by 13 percent. I agree with that. We underfunded defense \nfor many years. Unemployment comp grew by a staggering 72 percent. \nMedicaid grew by 13.2 percent, the fastest since 1992. Total outlays \ngrew by 7.9 percent in fiscal year 2002. But if you exclude the \ndecrease for net interest, spending grew by 11 percent last year, about \n3 times the rate of inflation. And then I look at some of the other \nthings Congress did that affect spending. Now, we can control that. We \ncontrol how much money we spend. We had a farm bill that was billions \nof dollars over what was budgeted. The trade adjustment assistance bill \nhad $11 billion of new entitlement spending. We had an emergency \nsupplemental bill that was $4 billion over the President's request. I \ncould go on and on.\n\n  There was $6 billion in drought assistance that--when we passed the \nfarm bill that was so expensive, the proponents said we won't need to \ndo drought assistance every year. Then we came back and, sure enough, \nCongress passes billions of dollars more. So my complaint is against \nCongress because, for the first time, we didn't pass a budget. Then \nbecause we didn't pass a budget, we didn't pass appropriations bills.\n\n[[Page S10409]]\n\n  This is embarrassing. Here we are in the new fiscal year and we have \nnot sent the President any appropriations bills. By the end of this \nweek, I think we will have sent the President two appropriations \nbills--2 out of 13, all of which are supposed to be done by the end of \nSeptember. And here we are in the middle of October. Congress, on \nappropriations bills, deserves an ``F'' this year because we have not \ndone a budget, and Congress deserves an ``F'' because we have not done \none of our constitutional responsibilities, which is to pass \nappropriations bills on time.\n  So I look at the Members of Congress who keep throwing rocks at the \nPresident, saying the economy is in bad shape. Yet what are we doing? \nHave we done our job? No. What else could Congress have done? What \ncould the Senate have done? The House passed an energy bill and we \nspent 7 or 8 weeks on it and it is still stuck in conference. If we \nwould have passed an energy bill that had allowed exploration in ANWR--\nthe Alaska National Wildlife Refuge--as the House did, we could create \nhundreds of thousands of jobs. That is still stuck, so the Congress has \nnot passed an energy bill.\n  We have not passed a reinsurance bill. It passed the House and the \nSenate, but we have not worked out the differences in conference, \nmainly because the Trial Lawyers Association wants to have the extended \nability to sue victims of terrorism. So there are billions of dollars \nin construction projects being held hostage because Congress hasn't \nbeen able to pass antiterrorism insurance.\n  The House passed pension reform months ago. The Senate Finance \nCommittee--of which I am a member--I believe, passed pension reform \nunanimously in committee. We have not passed it on the floor of the \nSenate. I urge the majority leader to call that bill up. If you want to \ntalk about 401(k)s, and we want to protect them, and pension plans, and \nso on, let's pass the bipartisan bill that passed out of the Finance \nCommittee to lend some protection there.\n  We have not moved to make permanent the tax cuts passed last year. I \nkeep hearing people being critical of the tax bill that passed. They \nwant to say that tax bill caused all the deficits. That is totally \nfalse. The real cause, or culprit, wasn't the tax cut; it is the fact \nof the failing economy. The economy is staggering. Income receipts are \ndown, and it is not so much because of the tax cuts but because of the \neconomy. So we need to turn the economy around and allow people to keep \nmore of their own money. Let's make the tax cuts permanent.\n  Some people say, no, let's increase taxes. Let's change the law. I \ndon't think that is the remedy being advocated by many, but I don't \nthink that is a very good solution.\n  Then I heard our colleagues say we didn't pass a prescription drug \nbill. That is not our fault. The majority leader and the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee never even had a markup on prescription drugs in \nthe Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over that issue. They \npulled the bill up on the floor and we debated it for weeks, but we \ndidn't pass a comprehensive bill to add prescription drugs as a benefit \nfor Medicare because we didn't let the Senate work its will. We didn't \nhave it marked up in committee. We didn't allow Members to proceed as \nwe should.\n\n  I mention those few things. We are getting close to election time, so \nthey want to start throwing rocks at the President and criticizing him \nfor the economy, without saying, what have we done? What has the Senate \ndone? I might say we should be thankful for some things that we didn't \ndo and what some of our friends on the Democratic side of the aisle \nwanted to do, or have tried to do, which, if they were successful, \nwould have made the economy a lot worse.\n  I will mention one: ergonomics standards. There was a regulation \npromulgated by the Clinton administration in the last day or two of his \nterm in office called ergonomics standards, which would have cost the \neconomy billions and billions of dollars. I saw one estimate that was \nup to $100 billion. It was going to have the Federal Government set up \na Federal workers compensation system--I started to say ``scheme''--\nthat would have cost billions of dollars to regulate movement in the \nworkplace. It had such ridiculous rules, such as you could not move \nover 50 pounds 20 times a day and all kinds of little rules on how OSHA \nis going to regulate business. Congress wisely stopped that regulation. \nThat was good. Some people still want to pass that. It would have cost \nbillions and billions.\n  Some people say let's pass the Patients' Bill of Rights, which would \nincrease everybody's health care costs. Actually, the Senate passed \nthat a year ago in June. It is interesting to note that the House \nalready passed it a year ago, but we have not even gone to conference \non that bill--maybe for a good reason. That bill would greatly expand \nnot only the right to sue the HMOs but also employers for providing \nhealth care insurance for their employees. The employers could be sued, \nand the net result would be that a lot of employers would drop their \nhealth care. That would hurt the economy, not help it.\n  Some people say let's increase the minimum wage. That is one of the \nproposals many Democrats are pushing now--increase that by $1.50 over \nthe next 14 months. That is almost a 30-percent increase. Oh, that is \ngreat. What if the business could not pay $6.65? What if this is \nsomebody trying to help at a convenience store, and all they can afford \nto pay is $5, maybe $6 an hour? We are just going to say that is too \nbad; we would rather have you unemployed than to have a job like that. \nIf you cannot pay $6.65, you are out of work.\n  CAFE standards: On the energy bill, many Democrat colleagues say \nlet's increase the CAFE standards for automobiles. That is great. We \nare going to make everybody drive a Volkswagen-type automobile. That is \nnot very safe; that is not what consumers want. It would certainly be \ndetrimental, and it would cost thousands of jobs.\n  I mention these to say that there are two sides to the story. We are \na little less than 3 weeks from the election and a lot of colleagues \nare saying: We want to throw rocks at the President, blame the \nPresident for the deficit. So we want to stop making permanent the tax \ncuts the President already passed; and, incidentally, we want to spend \na whole lot more money. So they are against the deficits when it comes \nto taxes, but in favor of them when it comes to spending money. Whether \nyou are talking about Medicare adjustments, drought assistance, \nunemployment compensation--which, in a moment, we will probably be \ndebating--we are going to have a major expansion of unemployment \ncompensation, more than double the Federal program that we have today. \nSome will possibly propose that. It only cost $17 billion. What \ndifference does it make? We don't have a budget anyway. In other words, \nthey don't care about the deficit when it comes to spending--only when \nit comes to the tax side.\n  I say these things because I think it is important to move together \nand improve the economy. I think we can do it if Congress works \ntogether. We can take a lot of the measures the House passed and we can \nhelp the economy. If we would pass an energy bill, a reinsurance bill, \npension reform, and if we would be responsible and pass a budget, pass \nappropriations bills that meet the budget guidelines, I think we could \nhelp the economy. I don't think we help the economy by making a bunch \nof political speeches and blaming everything on President Bush.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator is correct, for certain States that qualify. \nThis is similar to what we did in the early 1990s. The Senator is quite \ncorrect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think I have the floor. I propounded a \nunanimous-consent request for the immediate consideration of the \nmeasure.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is objection.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I regret, for the reasons I will outline \njust shortly, that we continue to have opposition of the Republican \nleadership to extending the unemployment compensation program that can \nmake all the difference in the world for families who are running \nthrough their current unemployment compensation and have to meet their \nmortgage payments, have to pay for the food on their tables, have to \nsupport their children in schools. People are hurting. I can give a \nmore detailed description of what is happening in the country, but I \nregret we continuously have an objection by our colleagues on the other \nside.\n  We know going back to the early 1990s, former President Bush objected \nto the extension of unemployment compensation and then, finally, saw \nthe wisdom of it and indicated he would support the extension of \nunemployment compensation. We had a series of votes with more than 90 \nMembers voting in favor of the extension of unemployment compensation \nfor the very sound reason that these workers have paid in to the fund. \nThe fund is in surplus, it now has some $27 billion. The Senator is \nquite correct that it would cost approximately $17 billion should this \nprogram go into effect now to assist those who have paid in to the \nprogram.\n  The point of unemployment compensation is, unless you have paid in, \nyou do not receive. So these are funds that have already been paid by \nworkers with the purpose in mind that if the economic conditions are \nsuch as at present, that if there is a temporary period where they \ncannot find jobs, this would help those families during those valleys. \nThat was always the thought behind unemployment compensation. The fund \nis in surplus, and still there is an objection to the extension. It \nwill make an enormous difference to close to 2 million families in this \ncountry by the end of the year and 3 million by the early part of \nFebruary.\n  There was one comment my friend from Oklahoma stressed, and that is: \nWhere are the appropriations bills? Congress has not done its work; we \nhave only considered 2 out of the 13 appropriations bills. The last \ntime I read the Constitution, the appropriations bills originated in \nthe House of Representatives, and that happens to be under Republican \nleadership. Do you understand? That is under Republican leadership. So \nwhen the good Senator said Congress is at fault, we know where the \nfault lies in terms of the appropriations bills which he mentioned.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10410-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10410-S10412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE UNFINISHED BUSINESS OF AMERICA'S WORKING FAMILIES\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I congratulate our leader and thank him \nfor an excellent address this afternoon. I also thank my friend and \ncolleague, the Senator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow, who has been such a \nleader on the issue of prescription drugs. The leader was much too \nself-assuming when he failed to take credit for the fact that this was \nthe first time the Senate has ever debated a prescription drug program, \nand it was done so because we had a Democratic leader, Tom Daschle, who \ninsisted we call up this legislation.\n\n  I heard earlier today: We did not have a prescription drug bill \nbecause the Finance Committee could not do one. For 5 of the last 6 \nyears, the Republicans have been in charge of the Senate, and when they \nwere in charge, we never had a prescription drug bill. The American \npeople ought to understand that. Before one cries crocodile tears at \nthe pleading of my friend from Oklahoma, the fact is the Senate never \nconsidered a bill because the Finance Committee could not complete a \nbill, and the Democratic leader brought a bill to the floor of the \nSenate.\n  We passed a good bill, not the bill I would have liked to have seen, \na program that would have been built upon the Medicare system. I \nthought we had guaranteed that in 1965 when we committed to the seniors \nof this country: Play by the rules and pay into the Medicare system, \nand your health care needs are going to be attended to. We did not say \n``with the exception of prescription drugs.''\n  That is what has happened, Mr. President. Every day we fail our \nseniors, we break that commitment and pledge to them. The Republicans \nhad 5 years to report out a bill, and they failed to do so. Thank you, \nTom Daschle, and thank you, Debbie Stabenow, for standing up, and thank \nyou for the bipartisan effort we had to support a program that would \nhave done something about lowering the cost of prescription drugs and, \nas the Senator from Michigan has pointed out, as well as our leader, \nthat is being held hostage by the Republican leadership in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Make no mistake about it, the Democrats happen to be on the side of \nseniors. We were on their side in the early 1960s when we fought for \nMedicare. If our Republican friends are against the Medicare Program, \nwhy don't they just come out and say it? They at least used to have the \ncourage to do so. They do not now. They just say they differ with it or \nthere is some other procedure or failure of some committee meeting. \nThey used to at least have the courage to say they oppose it. They do \nnot say that anymore. They try to give some other excuse. We are \nstrongly committed, as the Senator from Michigan and the Senator from \nSouth Dakota have pointed out.\n  Mr. President, in the time I have remaining, I wish to highlight \nthree very important areas, and these are areas which our leader, the \nSenator from South Dakota, Mr. Daschle, has mentioned, but I want to \nreview them one more time.\n  More than 8 million Americans are competing for just over 3 million \njobs. Maybe the Senator from Oklahoma does not believe we have an \neconomic crisis, but he can travel with me through many of the New \nEngland States, including my State of Massachusetts, where we have the \nhighest unemployment of any of the New England States. Talk to families \nthere who, if they have not lost a job, they know members of a family \nwho have or they know of a neighbor who has, and they have friends down \nthe street who are seeing foreclosures on homes. This is the highest \nrate of foreclosures since the Depression, and we sit around in the \nSenate and say, We do not have an economic crisis?\n  We have double-digit inflation in health care, and we still say: It \nis not\n\n[[Page S10411]]\n\nrobbing the pockets of working families. We see the tuition of our \ngreat universities increasing by more than three times the rate of \ninflation. No, no, that is not really our fault.\n  Why is it all those factors are coming in to place now under a \nRepublican administration? Why? It still has not been answered. We are \nnot just saying why, as the leader, Tom Daschle, has pointed out, we \nare making recommendations and suggestions trying to do something about \nit.\n  I heard this comment about how the Republicans are against minimum \nwage. I know they are. I know they have opposed it. They have opposed \nit since I have been in the Senate, and they opposed it before I came \nto the Senate.\n  This is basically an issue of dignity of men and women who work hard \ncleaning the buildings of this country, working as teachers' aides, \nworking in nursing homes--men and women of dignity. They take the tough \njobs. Perhaps they can be easily dismissed by Members in the Senate, \nbut we take them seriously.\n  It is an issue involving women because the majority of the minimum \nwage recipients are women. It is a women's issue. It is the children \nbecause most of the women have children. How are those children going \nto grow up?\n  Talk about family values. What do we have when there is a family who \nneeds a minimum wage increase and is working two jobs? How much time do \nthey have to spend with their children? We hear a great deal about \nfamily values. The minimum wage is a family value issue, and it is a \nfairness issue.\n  We have raised our salaries four times in the Senate in the last six \nyears. The last pay increase was by $4,900. We have raised our salaries \nfour times since we voted for an increase in the minimum wage. That is \nnot acceptable. Maybe it is acceptable to some. Maybe there are people \nwho can find excuses and say: What about the mom-and-pop store that is \nnot going to be able to pay it?\n  We have dealt with those issues and those challenges. There are \nexclusions for the smaller mom-and-pop stores from the coverage, and \nthere are exclusions for a variety of other entities where we get the \nsame stories.\n  At least the Democrats are prepared to vote for an increase for the \nhard-working, neediest people in this society. As a result of the \neconomic slowdown, there is an increase in the working poor. We want to \ndo something about it. We are not giving excuses. We are fighting for \nthose people. We are fighting to make sure they are going to be \neligible for the unemployment insurance.\n  There are 3.2 million jobs and 8 million Americans unemployed. There \nare more Americans unemployed who are looking for fewer jobs. That is a \nphenomenon entirely different from our recent economic history.\n  Going back to the last serious recession we had in this country, look \nat the number of Americans, 1.4 million, who are out of benefits, and \nnow in 2002 there are 2.2 million out of benefits, which is a \ncontinuation of the earlier point.\n  We have asked for and we have tried to get the extension of \nunemployment compensation that can make some difference, and we are \ngoing to continue to fight to do it. If we can get an increase in the \nminimum wage, we are prepared to do that as well.\n  The other issue we want to address is the issue we have in terms of \npension reforms. We are not just satisfied with the House bill that is \ngoing to permit the various financial institutions to give the workers \ntheir information and make the decisions about how they are going to \ninvest their pensions. Imagine that. Talk about putting the fox in the \nchicken coop. That is what the House bill does.\n  In the last hour, we heard somebody in this Chamber say: Let's pass \nthat House bill. That will solve our problem in terms of the pensions. \nWe are going to let the financial institutions that have a direct \nfinancial interest give the advice to the workers about how to do that.\n  Well, we hope we have learned something. We certainly have learned \nsomething over on this side. But that is basically the Boehner bill. He \nis a good friend. We worked with him on the education bill, but he is \nwrong about this.\n  Why is it important? It is important because we have seen the \nworkers' retirement savings wiped out. There has been over $1 billion \nlost, but the executives have cashed out at $1 billion in gains. Look \nat what has happened to these companies. We are asked why we are \nfighting to get something meaningful done. The heads of these companies \nand corporations, such as the Enrons--Mr. Lay is going to receive a \npension that is worth half a million dollars a year for life, and \nBernie Ebbers of WorldCom will receive $1.5 million a year for life, \nand the list goes on. They have been taken care of, but the workers \nhave not.\n\n  We want to do something meaningful. We want to do something on \nunemployment compensation. We have to do something on minimum wage. We \nhave to do something to protect America's workers in terms of pensions.\n  So even in the final hours that we have, we are going to be serious \nabout dealing with the issue of the economy because in our part of the \ncountry people are hurting. Real families are hurting. Working families \nare hurting.\n  There are many, including myself, since September 11, who say we \nought to put everything on the table in terms of our economy--put on \nthe table future tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals. There are \nthose on the other side of the aisle who do not want to do it. They \nwould rather cut back on the education programs in terms of the future.\n  In the President's own program, he asks for additional kinds of tax \ncuts in his budget this year, even after September 11. Some of us are \nnot sold on that. We believe in a sound economic program. It is not a \nmatter of chance that the last two periods of time when we had the \nlongest periods of economic growth and price stability in this country \nwere under Democratic Presidents.\n  In terms of our economy, there are important differences that we \nbelieve in and that the Republicans believe in. We are asking for \nassistance by the American people on election day to restore a strong \neconomy for this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I love to hear my friend and colleague \nfrom Massachusetts. Sometimes we have a slight difference of opinion on \na few of these issues, and I will try to clarify a couple of them. One \nwhich he has asked unanimous consent to pass is the unemployment \ncompensation extension. Even in the consent request it says for a 13-\nweek extension of unemployment compensation, but the fact is the bill \nis for 26 weeks. Right now, it is a Federal program.\n  Let me back up. States have a 26-week program. The Presiding Officer, \nas a former Governor from Delaware, understands the States have a 26-\nweek program. There is a 13-week temporary Federal unemployment \ncompensation extension we use in times of high unemployment, paid, \nbasically, totally by the Federal Government. The Senator from \nMassachusetts is saying let's make that 13 weeks 26 weeks, not for a \nfew States but all States, and then for some States an additional 7 \nweeks. So, basically, all States would get 52 weeks and some States \nwould get 59 weeks.\n  I want to make sure people understand the facts. I do not mind \ndebating facts, but I think we ought to be factual. The fact is he is \ntrying to double the Federal program, and that is very expensive. A \nsimple extension costs about $6 billion or $7 billion. The bill that \npeople have tried to pass now for the third or fourth time by unanimous \nconsent would cost $17 billion.\n  If my colleagues want to be responsible, I will work with them, but \nwe are not going to pass something like this. This is more of a \npolitical statement so they can say, we are trying to pass unemployment \ncompensation, and they can have Senator Nickles coming out objecting--\nthose Republicans will not allow this to pass.\n  I was critical of the fact that the Senate has not passed \nappropriations bills and critical of the fact that the House has not. \nThe House has not passed enough and neither has the Senate. My \ncolleague from Massachusetts says all of the appropriations bills have \nto originate from the House. That is not what the Constitution says. \nThe Constitution says all ``revenue raising bills.''\n  I have article 1, section 7:\n\n\n[[Page S10412]]\n\n\n       All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House \n     of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with \n     Amendments as on other Bills.\n\n  It is important we be factual. The House has to originate tax bills. \nThe Senate can pass appropriations bills. I have always asserted our \nright. Because of tradition, the House wants to pass them first, and \nthat is fine; that can be the tradition. But nothing should keep the \nSenate from passing appropriations bills first if we so desire. There \nis no point of order against them whatsoever.\n  A point that was made on the Finance Committee--and I was critical of \nthe Senate for bringing up a prescription drug proposal without it \ngoing through the Finance Committee. I did a little homework. Since the \ncreation of Medicare in 1965, 22 of the 23 Medicare expansions passed \nthe Finance Committee--bipartisan, overwhelming. We had a tripartisan \nbill that had a chance to garner bipartisan support on which many of us \nwere requesting a markup in the Finance Committee, before we got to the \nfloor, so we would have a bipartisan approach when it came to the very \nimportant, critical, and expensive extension of prescription drugs to \nMedicare. We were denied that markup. We are going to have the most \nexpensive expansion of Medicare since its inception, and it will be \ndone on the floor of the Senate without input from committee, without \nscoring, without the CBO, without expert input.\n\n  That is a pretty crummy way to legislate. It makes one think the \nlegislation was done more for political purposes than for substantive \nand legislative intent to make something happen.\n  My good friend from Massachusetts discussed minimum wage. Senator \nNickles is opposed. Not all Republicans are. This Republican is opposed \nto increasing the minimum wage from $5.15 to $6.65 in 14 months. That \nis a $1.50 increase in 14 months. A lot of people are paying in the \nneighborhood of $5.15 or $5.50. If they have to pay an extra $1.50 in \nthe next year, many will say, I cannot do that, thank you very much. A \nsmall business in Delaware or Oklahoma--maybe it is a McDonald's--\ncannot always afford to pass the $1.50 on and some employees will lose \na job. Maybe it is pumping gas, sacking groceries, or sweeping floors.\n  My colleague said this is to help increase people's self-esteem and \nintegrity, people who are sweeping the floors. I used to sweep floors. \nI used to have a janitor service. I used to work for minimum wage, and \nso did my wife. It was only about 34 years ago we did that, and the \nminimum wage at that time, if I remember, was a lot less than it is \ntoday. It did not hurt my self-esteem. I wanted to make more money, so \nI started my own business. It was rather successful.\n  My point is, I don't think we improve people's self-esteem alone by \nsaying we will have the Federal Government setting higher standards, \nand if you cannot make it, we would rather you be unemployed. I would \nrather have someone working for $5.50 and climb the economic ladder \nthan put that ladder up so high that they cannot get on and they stay \nunemployed and continue to draw welfare benefits.\n  I hear we want to freeze this Bush tax cut for the ultrawealthy, the \ntax cuts for the millionaires. When President Clinton was elected, the \nmaximum personal income tax rate was 31 percent. He increased that rate \nto 39.6 percent for personal income tax. President Clinton did that \nretroactively in 1993. President Bush, over several years, eventually \ngets that 39.6-percent rate in an incremental phasing down to 35 \npercent. In other words, it is still several percent more than it was \nunder President Clinton. It is 4 percentage points, but percentage-wise \nit is about a 13-percent rate higher than when President Clinton was \nelected.\n  President Reagan lowered the rate to 28 percent. President Bush, the \n41st President, increased it, due to a lot of pressure, from 28 percent \nto 31 percent. President Clinton took it from 31 percent to 39.6. \nPresident Bush, the 43rd President, reduces that rate gradually from \n39.6 percent to 35 percent over several years. My colleagues are \nobjecting to that as tax cuts for the wealthy. But that is not nearly \nas much as the tax increase proposed by the previous administration.\n  It is very important we be factual. The pension bill has been on the \ncalendar since July. Senator Daschle could have brought it up at any \npoint. We have bipartisan support for the Finance Committee bill that \nwas passed in July. The minimum wage has been on the calendar since \nMay. If Senator Daschle wants to bring it up, he can. He is the \nmajority leader. He has that right to bring up the issues. Two or three \nweeks before the election looks as if it is calculated more for \npolitical purposes than for trying to change the law of the land.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report accompanying H.R. \n3295, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendments of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     3295) to require States and localities to meet uniform and \n     nondiscriminatory election technology and administration \n     requirements applicable to Federal elections, to establish \n     grant programs to provide assistance to States and localities \n     to meet those requirements and to improve election technology \n     and the administration of Federal elections, to establish the \n     Election Administration Commission, and for other purposes, \n     having met, have agreed that the House recede from its \n     disagreement to the amendment of the Senate, and agree to the \n     same with an amendment, signed by a majority of the conferees \n     on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The report is printed in the House proceedings of the Record of \nOctober 8, 2002.)\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am very pleased this afternoon to bring to \nthe attention of the Senate the conference report agreement on \nlegislation to reform our Nation's election laws. I anticipate we will \nnot need the full time allocated. I would like to think Members are so \ninterested they would like to come over and share their thoughts with \nus on this subject. But knowing there are no votes today, that is not \nlikely to occur so we will probably use a lot less time than the 2 \nhours required.\n  I note the presence of my friend and colleague, Senator McConnell, \nthe ranking member of the Rules Committee.\n  Before getting to the substance of my remarks, let me begin by \nthanking him and his staff, and the staff of Senator Bond as well, one \nof our conferees, and that of my own two conferees on the Democratic \nside, Senators Durbin and Schumer, and their staffs, not to mention my \nown staff, Kennie Gill and others, for the tremendous work done on the \nSenate side of this effort.\n  It is somewhat ironic. I understand we are going to get this done. It \nis a quiet afternoon after Columbus Day. Members are still back in \ntheir States having spent the weekend with their families before \nreturning tomorrow when we will have some additional votes as we begin \nto wind up this 107th Congress. It is somewhat ironic in a sense that \nwe are in this sort of quiet stillness of this Chamber with only two of \nus here to talk, when you consider what gave rise to this legislation--\nthe fact that there was one of the most tumultuous elections in the \nhistory of\n\n[[Page S10413]]\n\nour country that galvanized the attention, not only of the people of \nthis country but those throughout the world. For more than a month, \nevery single news program, day in and day out, 24 hours a day, was of \neyes peering through hanging chads and people bellowing at each other \nin a voting precinct in Florida, with courtrooms packed, around the \ncorner from here, in the United States Supreme Court.\n  The irony is all of that turmoil provoked us to step up and find out \nwhether our election laws could do with some changing--not that it all \noccurred in Florida or in just the 2000 election--but today, as we \napproach the second anniversary of that election, we find ourselves in \na quiet Chamber with a couple of Members talking about something that \nboth of us believe is a rather historic piece of legislation.\n  When you consider that unlike other matters that come before this \nbody, despite the fact that our colleagues may claim expertise in every \nsubject matter that comes before them, this is truly one in which each \nMember who serves here is an expert because they would not have arrived \nhere had they not been elected. To that extent, we have an appreciation \nof elections beyond the awareness of the average citizen in this \ncountry. So the fact that we--as Democrats and Republicans, in a time \nwhen people question whether or not we can come to terms about some of \nthe major issues of the day, can take a subject matter so rife with \npartisanship as an election, with all of the scars, the wounds, the \nadmonitions, the rhetoric, the demagoguery, use whatever words you \nwant--were able in this Congress to craft legislation that passed the \nother body by a substantial margin, and passed this body 99 to 1, and \nthen the conference report passed the House by a vote of 357-48, and we \nhope a substantial vote will occur here as well, is a tribute to the \nmembership of this body, to the leadership of this body, and the other \nbody as well--that we were able to get this done.\n  If I may say so, I have been here 21 years. I have had proud moments \nwhen I have been involved in other legislative efforts. None exceeds \nthe sense of pride I have over this particular accomplishment. Again, \nno one can ever claim that they were responsible in a legislative \nprocess for the final result. A lot of people can take legitimate \ncredit for helping us achieve what we are asking our colleagues to \nsupport tomorrow when we vote before noon.\n  This agreement, as it said, represents many mouths of effort. That \neffort took place amid a steady stream of news reports that predicted \nthe demise of election reform. While those reports bewailed the lack of \nprogress in conference negotiations, they overlooked the fact that, \ninstead of a lack of progress, conferees were making progress. Working \nquietly during early mornings, late nights, and long weekends, we \ncrafted the conference agreement that is before the Senate this \nafternoon.\n  It is a bipartisan and bicameral agreement. It is one that, I \nbelieve, merits the support of our colleges in the Senate.\n  It is one that has already been approved by the other body by a vote \nof 357 to 48. And it is one that the Administration has said the \nPresident is prepared to sign.\n  Twenty-three months ago, our Nation was thrown into turmoil because \nwe learned a painful reality: that our democracy does not work as well \nas we thought it did, or as it should. More than 100 million citizens \nwent to the polls on election day 2000--November 7. Four to six million \nof them--for a variety of reasons--never had their votes counted. Some \nwere thwarted by faulty machinery. Some were victims of wrongful and \nillegal purges from voter lists. Others fell victim to poorly designed \nballots. But all of them--all--were denied the right to effectively \nexercise their most fundamental right as American citizens: the right \nto vote.\n  Regardless of which candidate one supported, there is no disagreement \nthat election day 2000 was not a proud day for our democracy.\n  It was a day of deep embarrassment for a nation rightly viewed by the \nrest of the world as a beacon light of self-government. But that day \nwas also, in a very real sense, a gift. Had there never been a \ncontested election like the election of 2000, the problems plaguing our \nNation's elections would likely never have been addressed. So it was in \na sense a gift. If you were to find a silver lining in what occurred \nthat day, what we are producing and asking our colleagues to support \nmay be it.\n  The legislation we present to the Senate today goes a long way toward \nfixing those problems and righting those wrongs. It does justice to the \nAmerican voter. It breaks new ground. It is, I believe, the first civil \nrights legislation of the 21st century. It is not a perfect bill. But \nit will make our democracy work better and be stronger.\n  Two hundred and thirteen years ago at the Constitutional Convention \nin Philadelphia, the Framers decreed that the administration of federal \nelections is not the job of just the States, or just the Federal \nGovernment, but the job of both.\n  Until now, that vision of cooperation and partnership has largely \nbeen honored in the breach. The Federal Government has for the most \npart been an observer, not a partner, in the conduct of elections for \nFederal office.\n  Starting now, with this legislation, that pattern comes to an end. \nFor the first time--if you exclude the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in \nwhich the Federal Government told States what not to do--they must not \nlevy poll taxes, must not set literacy tests--the National Government \nsteps up to more fully meet its constitutional duty to uphold the \nsoundness and sancity of the ballot. This is the first time the Federal \nGovernment is saying what we must do together to make our elections \nstronger. With this bill, we move closer to the day when every vote \ncast will be a vote counted.\n  Our bill achieves this progress in three ways: with new rights, new \nresponsibilities, and new resources.\n  First, new rights. The conference agreement establishes new voting \nrights for our citizens. These include:\n  The right--starting in 2004--to cast a provisional ballot. With this \nright, no qualified voter can ever again be turned away from the \npolling place without being able to cast at least a provisional ballot. \nThere are some States that are doing this already and have been for \nyears. Many do not.\n  The right to check and correct one's ballot if the voter made a \nmistake. I know this is a radical idea. In this way, voters need never \nagain leave a polling place haunted by the thought that they voted for \nthe wrong candidate, or nullified their own vote by over-voting.\n  The right of all voters to cast a private and independent ballot. \nToday, millions of disabled Americans face two options on election day, \nboth of them bad: they either vote with the assistance of a stranger, \nor they do not vote at all. In the 2000 elections alone, some 20 \nmillion of them took the second option--because the barriers to the \nballot box were just too daunting.\n  With this legislation, henceforth--beginning in the year 2006--those \ndays will come to an end. Starting with this bill, a disabled voter \nwill have the same right to cast a private and independent ballot as \nany other voter.\n  That provision dealing with providing for accessibility improvements \nin voting systems may not be required to go into effect until 2006. \nObviously, some States may do that before. There is something in this \nbill that says you cannot do that. But at the very least, by the year \n2006.\n  The bill also creates the right to have, at each polling place, \nprinted, posted information, including a sample ballot and a listing of \nvoter rights and responsibilities. In this way, our bill will sharply \nreduce the risk of confusion and error on election day.\n  In addition, our bill requires states to develop ``uniform and \nnondiscriminatory'' standards for counting ballots--because whether or \nnot your ballot will count should never depend on the county or \nprecinct where you happen to live and the economic circumstances there.\n  Second, our bill establishes new responsibilities--for voters, for \nStates, and for the Federal Government.\n  To address concerns about fraud, voters seeking to vote for the first \ntime in a state will be responsible for producing some form of \nidentification. Senator Bond was particularly instrumental in crafting \nthese provisions. We thank him.\n  States will be responsible for producing statewide computerized lists \nof registered voters. Once these lists are up and running, it is our \nhope and expectation that the risk that individuals\n\n[[Page S10414]]\n\nmay be voting multiple times in multiple jurisdictions will be \nminimized if not eliminated altogether.\n  Let me add, by the way, that when it comes to the computerized \nstatewide lists, a voter may not have to register again. If you live in \na State that provides for state-wide registration, or wants to provide \nfor state-wide registration, this requirement will facilitate that so \nthat if you move around in that State from one county to another, or \nfrom one community to the next, a statewide voter registration list \nmeans you don't have to register again. If you move from one community \nand one precinct to the other, with the statewide list, you register \nonce. If you stay in that State, you may be registered forever in that \nState regardless of where you may live or move to under state-wide \nregistration.\n  That is not an insignificant burden we are lifting for many people in \nthis country who move. If they are renters who can't afford homes and \nwho want to participate in the process, every time they move from one \nprecinct to the next, they have to register to vote. That will be over \nwith, under state law providing for state-wide registration once \nprovisions on the statewide voter registration requirements of this \nbill become effective.\n  To ensure that the requirements of the bill are met, States will also \nbe required to establish meaningful enforcement procedures to remedy \nvoters' grievances. And at the federal level, the Department of Justice \nwill be responsible for enforcing the provisions of the act.\n  Third, this legislation would commit unprecedented new resources to \nimproving and upgrading all aspects of our elections. It authorizes \nsome $3.9 billion over the next three years to help states replace and \nrenovate voting equipment, train poll workers, educate voters, upgrade \nvoter lists, and make polling places more accessible for the disabled.\n  I thought it worthwhile to note that since the elections of 2000, \nonly three States--maybe a couple more--have made any effort at all to \nreform and update their election laws and requirements that voters use \nin the various States. It is always costly to do this. Frankly, as the \nPresiding Officer, a former Governor, can attest, when there are budget \nconstraints and a lot of demands are being made, there has not been a \ngreat constituency out there advocating spending money to buy new \nvoting equipment, or new voting machinery, or to train poll workers. \nThere are many other demands on a State budget that have much larger \nconstituencies than those who might say we ought to improve the voting \nsystems of the country. The fact of matter is, despite a public outcry \nabout all of this, there has been very little action over the years--\neven in the wake of the 2000 elections.\n  So it seems clear to us that if we are truly going to command States, \nin a number of provisions, to do things differently, to suggest that \nthey do so without providing the resources would be yet once again an \nunfunded mandate. We know how States feel about Federal requirements \nwhen there are not resources to support meeting those requirements.\n  This legislation provides $3.9 billion--some that will flow \nimmediately, and others subject to development of state plans and \nsubmission of applications. I will not go into all the details this \nafternoon. But the idea is that the Federal Government is going to \nbecome a real partner financially in the conduct of these elections. It \ndoes not mean the conduct of elections is going to be fully supported \nby the Federal Government. Obviously, States, communities, and \nmunicipalities have to allocate resources for every election. But with \nthese changes we are talking about, the costs, by and large, are going \nto be borne by the Federal Government. This is the first time we will \nbecome such an active participate in improving the election systems of \nour country.\n  Lastly, this legislation establishes a new commission--the Election \nAssistance Commission--to assist states and voters. I want to \nacknowledge Senator McConnell's pivotal role in conceiving of this \ncommission. In coming years, it will serve as an important source of \nnew ideas and support for states as they take steps to improve the \ncaliber of their elections.\n  It allows us to have an ongoing relationship with election officials \nat the State and local level day in and day out rather than waiting for \nsome crisis to occur or for some disastrous election result where we \nthen go out and form some ad hoc commission to go back and look at what \nhappened.\n  For the first time, we are going to have a permanent commission that \ndoesn't have rulemaking authority, except to the extent provided under \nsection 9(a) of ``Motor-Voter,'' but sets voluntary standards and \nguidelines--a source of information for people to access, as we will, I \nam sure, in the years to come with technology being what it is, and a \ndemand for efficiencies by the American public to update and to \nsimplify the process to make voting as user friendly as it can possibly \nbe while simultaneously protecting against the abuses in which some may \nwish to engage.\n  We will now have a permanent venue where those ideas can be heard and \nrecommendations can be made so that we will be involved on a continuing \nbasis in a seamless way with the conduct of something as fundamental \nand as important as the elections in this country.\n  New rights, new responsibilities, new resources. And with them, a new \nday for our Nation's democracy.\n  Almost 2 years from the 2000 elections, this legislation will help \nAmerica move beyond the days of hanging chads, butterfly ballots, and \nillegal purges of voters and accusations of voter fraud. It will make \nthe central premise of our democracy--that the people are sovereign--\nring even more truly in the years to come.\n  This legislation has the support of many individuals and \norganizations that have been critical to its success.\n  They include former Presidents Ford and Carter. We thank them for \ntheir work on the National Commission on Federal Election Reform. They \nmet early on and crafted some recommendations and ideas. They held \nhearings around the country. Once again, it is a great tribute to \nPresident Ford and President Carter for their ongoing commitment to \nthis country and for the allocation of time from their schedules to \ndedicate efforts to make recommendations on how we might improve the \nelection process. I thank them.\n  The Congressional Black Caucus--for whom this legislative effort was \nthe number one priority--I thank Eddie Bernice Johnson particularly as \nthe Chair of the Black Caucus; John Conyers, my coauthor of this bill \nfrom the very outset; and every other member of the Black Caucus who \nhas been tremendously helpful in working with us on this legislation \nand lending support to this final product.\n  The National Association of Secretaries of State has been \ntremendously helpful. It is a bipartisan group that deals every day \nwith the election laws in our country. They have to grapple with them. \nIt is critically important. Everything we talked about on which they \nhad some input to let us know whether or not these things will work--\nobviously, many of them have not been tested yet, and time will only \ntell. But because they were involved here, we think the likelihood of \nthings not working as well as one might normally expect will be \nminimized.\n  I particularly thank my secretary of state, Susan Bysewicz of \nConnecticut, who has done a remarkable job in our State, has been \ntremendously creative, and was a source of a lot of good solid \ninformation.\n  Secretary of State Kathy Cox of Georgia--I want to commend Georgia, \nby the way, one of the three States that made significant changes on \ntheir own in the election laws of their own States. They did a \ntremendous job. And Kathy Cox deserves a lot of credit for stepping up \nand doing things early on.\n  I thank Secretary of State Chet Culver of Iowa, the youngest \nsecretary of state in the country and the son of a former colleague of \nours who is doing a fantastic job, for his input. Ninety-two percent of \nthe people of Iowa are registered to vote. It is one of the highest in \nthe country. They have 300,000 new registered voters in the last 3\\1/2\\ \nor 4 years in Iowa. Seventy-two percent of the people of that State \nvoted in the last election. It is really a remarkable result, and a lot \nof it, again, is the result of the creative work of the secretary of \nstate of Iowa.\n\n[[Page S10415]]\n\n  The NAACP has been tremendously helpful; the AFL-CIO; the United Auto \nWorkers; the National Federation of the Blind; the United Cerebral \nPalsy Association; the American Foundation of the Blind; and the \nNational Association of Protection and Advocacy Systems, which \nrepresents persons with disabilities. I thank them for all of their \ntremendous help.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters from these organizations and \nindividuals in support of this legislation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        The National Commission on\n\n\n                                      Federal Election Reform.\n\n                                                  October 4, 2002.\n     Former Presidents Ford and Carter Welcome the Agreement \n         Reached on Election Reform Legislation.\n\n       Today, former Presidents Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter, \n     along with Lloyd Cutler and Bob Michel, co-chairs of the \n     National Commission on Federal Election Reform, welcomed the \n     bipartisan agreement struck by the House and Senate \n     Conference Committee on a bill to reform federal elections.\n       ``The bill represents a delicate balance of shared \n     responsibilities between levels of government,'' Ford and \n     Carter said. ``This comprehensive bill can ensure that \n     America's electoral system will again be a source of national \n     pride and a model to all the world.'' Indeed, all four of the \n     co-chairs share the belief of Congressman John Lewis (D-GA) \n     and others that, if passed by both Houses and signed by \n     President Bush, this legislation can provide the most \n     meaningful improvements in voting safeguards since the civil \n     rights laws of the 1960s.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Washington Bureau,\n\n\n                                                        NAACP,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 8, 2002.\n     Re Conference Report to H.R. 3295, the Help America Vote Act \n       (election reform)\n\n     Members,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The National Association for the Advancement \n     of Colored People (NAACP), our nation's oldest, largest and \n     most widely-recognized grassroots civil rights organization \n     supports the conference report on H.R. 3295, the Help America \n     Vote Act and we urge you to work quickly towards its \n     enactment.\n       Since its inception over 90 years ago the NAACP has fought, \n     and many of our members have died, to ensure that every \n     American is allowed to cast a free and unfettered vote and to \n     have that vote counted. Thus, election reform has been one of \n     our top legislative priorities for the 107th Congress and we \n     have worked very closely with members from both houses to \n     ensure that the final product is as comprehensive and as \n     nondiscriminatory as possible.\n       Thus we are pleased that the final product contains many of \n     the elements that we saw as essential to addressing several \n     of the flaws in our nation's electoral system. Specifically, \n     the NAACP strongly supports the provisions requiring \n     provisional ballots and statewide voter registration lists, \n     as well as those ensuring that each polling place have at \n     least one voting machine that is accessible to the disabled \n     and ensuring that the voting machines allow voters to verify \n     and correct their votes before casting them.\n       The NAACP recognizes that the actual effectiveness of the \n     final version of H.R. 3295 will depend upon how the states \n     and the federal government implement the provisions contained \n     in the new law. Thus, the NAACP intends to remain vigilant \n     and review the progress of this new law at the local and \n     state levels and make sure that no provision, especially the \n     voter identification requirements, are being abused to \n     disenfranchise eligible voters.\n       Again, on behalf of the NAACP and our more than 500,000 \n     members nation-wide, I urge you to support the swift \n     enactment of the conference report on H.R. 3295, the Help \n     America Vote Act. Thank you in advance for your attention to \n     this matter; if you have any questions or comments I hope \n     that you will feel free to contact me at (202) 638-2269.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Hilary O.

It will allow \n     registered individuals to cast provisional ballots even if \n     their names are mistakenly excluded from voter registration \n     lists at their polling places. It will require states to \n     develop centralized, statewide voter registration lists to \n     ensure the accuracy of their voter registration records. It \n     will also require states to provide at least one voting \n     machine per polling place that is accessible to the disabled \n     and ensure that their voting machines allow voters to verify \n     and correct their votes before casting them.\n       Since the actual number of individuals enfranchised or \n     disenfranchised by the conference report on H.R. 3295 will \n     depend on how the states and the federal government implement \n     its provisions, the AFL-CIO will closely monitor the progress \n     or this new law--especially its voter identification \n     requirements. We will also increase our voter education \n     efforts to ensure that individuals know and understand their \n     new rights and responsibilities.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   William Samuel,\n     Director, Department of Legislation.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                Paralyzed Veterans\n\n\n                                                   of America,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 15, 2002.\n     Chairman\n     Christopher J.

The House of \n     Representatives passed the report overwhelmingly, recognizing \n     the fact that our federal government, since the presidential \n     election of 2000, needed to take steps to ensure the public \n     that their votes do indeed count. This bill, the Help America \n     Vote Act of 2002, does that.\n       The bill provides funds to states and local jurisdictions \n     to recruit and train poll workers. It will allow for \n     replacement of antiquated mechanisms, like punch card and \n     lever voting machines, with machines that will allow voters \n     to verify their vote before the ballot is cast, including \n     voters with disabilities.\n       This legislation will charge the Architectural \n     Transportation Barriers Compliance Board known as the Access \n     Board to develop minimum standards of access at polling \n     places and to consult with other organizations for research \n     and improvements to voting technology.\n       This legislation will allow the Secretary of the Health and \n     Human Services to make payments to eligible states and local \n     jurisdictions for the purposes of making polling places \n     accessible: including the paths of travel, entrances, exits, \n     and voting areas of each polling facility. It will ensure \n     sites are accessible to individuals with disabilities \n     including those who are blind or visually impaired, in a \n     manner that provides the same opportunity for access and \n     participation including privacy and independence.\n       In addition the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     shall provide the Protection and Advocacy Systems of each \n     State grant monies to ensure full participation in the \n     electoral process for individuals with disabilities, \n     including registering to vote, education in casting a vote \n     and accessing polling places.\n       Again, PVA congratulates you on this legislation which, \n     when implemented and fully funded, will provide tremendous \n     access for PVA members and all people with disabilities in \n     exercising their constitutional right to vote. PVA stands \n     ready to work with you and your staff on implementation of \n     this legislation which ensures confidence in our citizens and \n     our democracy that indeed every ones vote cast will indeed \n     count.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Douglas K.

Hoyer, Ranking Minority Member,\n     Committee on House Administration, House of Representatives, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Congressman Hoyer: I am writing to \n     express the strong support of the National Federation of the \n     Blind (NFB) for the Help America Vote Act of 2002. Thanks to \n     your efforts and strong bipartisan support, this legislation \n     includes provisions designed to guarantee that all blind \n     persons will have equal access to voting procedures and \n     technology. We particularly endorse the standard set for \n     blind people to be able to vote privately and independently \n     at each polling place throughout the United States.\n       While the 2000 election demonstrated significant problems \n     with our electoral system, consensus regarding the solution \n     proved to be much more difficult to find. Part of that \n     solution will now include installation of up-to-date \n     technology for voting throughout the United States. This \n     means that voting technology will change, and devices \n     purchased now will set the pattern for decades to come.\n       With more than 50,000 members representing every state, the \n     District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, the NFB is the largest \n     organization of blind people in the United States. As such we \n     know about blindness from our own experience. The right to \n     vote and cast a truly secret ballot is one of our highest \n     priorities, and modern technology can now support this goal. \n     For that reason, we strongly support the Help America Vote \n     Act of 2002, and appreciate your efforts to enact this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     James Gashel,\n                                 Director of Governmental Affairs.\n\n[[Page S10416]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                             United Cerebral Palsy\n\n\n                                                 Associations,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 9, 2002.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: United Cerebral Palsy Association and \n     affiliates support the conference report on H.R. 3295, the \n     Help America Vote Act. We also take this opportunity to \n     commend you for the work you did to ensure that all people \n     with disabilities have equal access under this act.\n       This legislation, while not perfect, will go a long way in \n     improving the ability of people with disabilities to exercise \n     their constitutional right and responsibility to vote. The \n     funding allocated for the multiple provisions of H.R. 3295 is \n     critical, and we pledge to work with Congress to ensure that \n     this funding is made available.\n       UCP stands ready to assist states' and local entities as \n     they work toward compliance of this very important \n     legislation. The changes outlined in the bill must be adopted \n     swiftly, correctly and fairly, and it will be incumbent upon \n     us all to help in this process.\n       Finally, UCP applauds you and your colleagues on your \n     dogged determination to pass legislation that will make \n     distinct improvements at the polls and in the lives of voters \n     with disabilities.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Patricia Sandusky,\n     Interim Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Foundation for the Blind, Governmental Relations \n           Group,\n                                  Washington, DC, October 9, 2002.\n     The Hon.

We \n     are pleased that the conference report contains the \n     disability provisions of the Senate bill.\n       Already this year, in some jurisdictions, blind and \n     visually impaired voters have, for the first time, been able \n     to cast a secret and independent ballot. We look forward to \n     the day when all voters with visual impairment will have full \n     and independent access to the electoral process.\n       The mission of the American Foundation for the Blind (AFB) \n     is to enable people who are blind or visually impaired to \n     achieve equality of access and opportunity that will ensure \n     freedom of choice in their lives. AFB led the field of \n     blindness in advocating the enactment of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA). Today, AFB continues its work \n     to protect the rights of blind and visually impaired people \n     to equal access to employment, information, and the programs \n     and services of state and local government.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Paul W.

Mitch McConnell,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Rules and Administration Committee,\n     Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: We are writing to express our support for \n     the bipartisan election reform conference report on H.R. \n     3295. AARP recognizes that significant compromise was \n     required by all parties to produce an agreement that would \n     advance the process of effective and fair election reform. \n     The Senate-House conference report contains a mix of \n     provisions that both strengthen and hinder citizen ability to \n     exercise the legal right to vote and have that vote counted. \n     Despite its shortcomings, however, we believe the overall \n     effect of the compromise agreement will be to reform and \n     enhance the nation's voting system.\n       AARP is pleased that the compromise:\n       Requires states to develop and maintain centralized polling \n     lists;\n       Requires polling sites in each jurisdiction to meet \n     accessibility standards and provide user-friendly voting \n     equipment for persons with disabilities;\n       Makes provisional ballots available to voters whose names \n     may be erroneously absent from registration lists;\n       Permits voters to verify and correct their voting \n     preferences before casting them;\n       Provides Federal funds to encourage state & local reforms; \n     and\n       Provides for training of elections administration staff and \n     polling site workers.\n       Unfortunately, the H.R. 3295 compromise report weakens some \n     existing voting rights and contains certain provisions that \n     AARP believes will increase the chances of a recurrence of \n     the problems that plagued the 2000 Presidential Elections. \n     The report:\n       Imposes voter identification requirements that discourage \n     participation by low income, minority and foreign-born \n     citizens;\n       Encourages purging of voter registration lists without \n     current law assurances to prevent illegal purging of legal \n     voters;\n       Permits the denial of registration if the registrant \n     possesses either a driver's license or social security number \n     but fails to write it on the registration form; and\n       Denies legal recourse for improper election administration, \n     while lacking adequate enforcement provisions to ensure that \n     the ballots of all legal voters are counted.\n       These provisions undermine existing voting protections, and \n     provide technical loopholes that can discourage or intimidate \n     potential legal voters--especially those who are low income, \n     minority and foreign-born.\n       Ultimately, the success of this legislation in affording \n     all eligible citizens the opportunity to vote and have that \n     vote accurately counted depends on implementation by the \n     states. AARP--through the advocacy and voter education \n     efforts of our national and state offices--will work with \n     states, election officials and other civil rights \n     organizations to ensure that election reform implementation \n     is fair and does not discourage citizen voter participation. \n     We appreciate your leadership in bringing about these \n     critically important advances. And, we look forward to \n     working with you to further our most basic right as \n     citizens--the vote. If you have any questions, please feel \n     free to call me or have your staff contact Larry White of our \n     Federal Affairs staff at (202) 434-3800.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Christopher Hansen,\n     Director of Advocacy.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n        National Association of Protection & Advocacy systems,\n\n                                                  October 9, 2002.\n     The Hon. Chris Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: The Protection and Advocacy System (P) \n     and the Client Assistance Programs (CAPs) comprise a \n     federally mandated, nationwide network of disability rights \n     agencies. Each year these agencies provide education, \n     information and referral services to hundreds of thousands of \n     people with disabilities and their families. They also \n     provide individual advocacy and/or legal representation to \n     tens of thousands of people in all the states and \n     territories. The National Association for Protection and \n     Advocacy Systems (NAPAS) is the membership organization for \n     the P network. In that capacity, NAPAS want to offer its \n     support for the passage of ``The Help America Vote Act of \n     2002'' (H.R. 3295).\n       NAPAS believes that the disability provisions in the bill \n     go far to ensure that people with all types of disabilities--\n     physical, mental, cognitive, or sensory--will have much \n     improved opportunities to exercise their right to vote. Not \n     only does this bill offer individuals with disabilities \n     better access to voting places and voting machines, but it \n     also will help provide election workers and others with the \n     skills to ensure that the voting place is a welcome \n     environment for people with disabilities. NAPAS is very \n     pleased that P network will play an active role in helping \n     implement the disability provisions in this bill.\n       NAPAS is well aware that there are still some concerns with \n     certain provisions of the bill. We hope that these concerns \n     can be worked out, if not immediately, then as the bill is \n     implemented. It would be extremely unfortunate if people \n     continued to face barriers to casting their ballot after this \n     bill is signed into law.\n       Finally, We want to thank the bill's sponsors, Senators \n     Dodd (D-CT) and McConnel (R-KY) and Representatives Ney (R-\n     OH) and Hoyer (D-MD) for their hard work and perseverance. We \n     look forward to working with each of them to ensure the swift \n     and effective implementation of this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Bernadette Franks-Ongoy,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From News Common Cause, Oct. 8, 2002]\n\n        Common Cause President Praises Election Reform Agreement\n\n       Statement by Scott Harshbarger, president and chief \n     executive officer of Common Cause, on the conference \n     agreement on the election reform bill:\n       ``The Help America Vote Act of 2002 is, as Senator \n     Christopher Dodd (D-CT) has said, the first major piece of \n     civil rights legislation in the 21st century.

Billions of dollars \n     will be spent across the country to improve election systems.\n       ``This bill, while not perfect, will make those systems \n     better.

The bill is a landmark piece of bipartisan \n     legislation, and we want to express our sincere thanks for \n     your leadership during the conference negotiations. We also \n     commend your Senate colleagues: Senators Chris Dodd, Mitch \n     McConnell and Kit Bond.\n       The nation's secretaries of state, particularly those who \n     serve as chief state election officials, consider this bill \n     an opportunity to reinvigorate the election reform process. \n     The ``Help America Vote Act'' serves as a federal response \n     that stretches across party lines and provides a substantial \n     infusion of federal money to help purchase new voting \n     equipment and improve the legal, administrative and \n     educational aspects of elections. In fact, our association \n     endorsed the original draft of H.R. 3295 in November 2001.\n       Specifically, the National Association of Secretaries of \n     State (NASS) is confident that passage of the final version \n     of H.R. 3295 will authorize significant funding to help \n     states achieve the following reforms:\n       Upgrades to, or replacement of, voting equipment and \n     related technology;\n       Creation of statewide voter registration databases to \n     manage and update voter registration rolls;\n       Improvement of poll worker training programs and new \n     resources to recruit more poll workers throughout the states;\n       Increases in the quality and scope of voter education \n     programs in the states and localities;\n       Improvement of ballot procedures, whereby voters would be \n     allowed to review ballots and correct errors before casting \n     their votes;\n       Improved access for voters with physical disabilities, who \n     will be allowed to vote privately and independently for the \n     first time in many states and localities;\n       Creation of provisional ballots for voters who are not \n     listed on registration rolls, but claim to be registered and \n     qualified to vote.\n       We want to make sure the states will get the funding levels \n     they've been promised, and that Congress will provide \n     adequate time to enact the most substantial reforms. Please \n     be assured that the nation's secretaries of state are ready \n     to move forward once Congress passes H.R. 3295 and the \n     President signs it.\n       If we can be of further assistance to you, your staff \n     members, or your colleagues in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, please contact our office.\n           Best regards,\n\n                                                 Dan Gwadosky,\n\n                                                   NASS President,\n     Maine Secretary of State.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               National Conference\n\n\n                                        of State Legislatures,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 7, 2002.\n     Hon. Robert Byrd,\n     Chairman, Senate Appropriations Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Bill Young,\n     Chairman, House Appropriations Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairmen Byrd and Young: On behalf of the nation's \n     state legislators, we urge you to make reform of our nation's \n     election processes a reality by providing sufficient funding \n     to implement H.R. 3295. The conference agreement announced \n     today will provide an effective means for states and counties \n     to update their election processes without federalizing \n     election administration. NCSL worked closely with the \n     conferees in the development of this legislation and is \n     satisfied that it keeps election administration at the state \n     and local level, limits the role of the U.S. Justice \n     Department to enforcement, does not create a federal private \n     right of action, and establishes an advisory commission that \n     will include two state legislators to assist with \n     implementation. NCSL commends the conferees for their work on \n     this landmark legislation and is committed to implementing \n     the provisions of H.R. 3295 to ensure every voter's right to \n     a fair and accurate election.\n       To ensure proper implementation and avoid imposing \n     expensive unfunded mandates on the states, it is critical \n     that the federal government immediately deliver sufficient \n     funding for states to implement the requirements of this \n     bill. Neither of the existing versions of appropriations \n     legislation provides sufficient funding for election reform. \n     We urge you to fully fund H.R. 3295 at the authorized level \n     of $2.16 billion for FY 2003.\n       The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that it may \n     cost states up to $3.19 billion in one-time costs to begin \n     implementing the provisions of this legislation. In this \n     current fiscal environment, it will be extraordinarily \n     difficult for states to implement the minimum standards in \n     the bill without immediate federal financial support. States \n     are already facing budget shortfalls for FY 2003 of \n     approximately $58 billion. Thirteen states have reported \n     budget gaps in excess of 10 percent of their general fund \n     budgets. To satisfy their balanced budget requirements, \n     states are being forced to draw down their reserves, cut \n     budgets, and even raise taxes.\n       We look forward to working with you to keep the commitment \n     of the states and the federal government to implementing H.R. \n     3295. If we can be of assistance in this or any other matter, \n     please contact Susan Parnas Frederick (202-624-3566; \n     susan.frederick@ncsl.org) or Alysoun McLaughlin (202-624-\n     8691; alysoun.mclaughlin@ncsl.org) in NCSL's state-federal \n     relations office in Washington, D.C.\n           Sincerely,\n     Senator Angela Z.

Stephens,\n       Utah, President-elect, NCSL.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                  of State Election Directors,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 10, 2002.\n     Hon. Bob Ney,\n     Hon. Steny Hoyer,\n     House Administration Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressmen Ney and Hoyer: The National Association \n     State Election Directors (NASED) congratulates you on the \n     successful completion of the final conference report on H.R. \n     3295. This initiative will significantly affect the manner in \n     which elections are conducted in the United States. On \n     balance, H.R. 3295 represents improvements to the \n     administration of elections. As administrators of elections \n     in each state we express our appreciation to you and your \n     staff for providing us access to the process and reaching out \n     to seek our views and positions on how to efficiently and \n     effectively administer elections.\n       As with all election legislation, H.R. 3295 is a compromise \n     package, which places new challenges and opportunities before \n     state and local election officials. We stand ready to \n     implement H.R. 3295 once it is passed by Congress and signed \n     into law by the President. Implementation of this bill will \n     be impossible without the full $3.9 billion appropriation \n     that is authorized. The success of this bold congressional \n     initiative rests in large measure upon the appropriation of \n     sufficient funds to bring the bill's objectives to reality.\n       We found the bipartisan approach to this legislation \n     refreshing and beneficial. Thank you again for including \n     NASED in the congressional consideration the bill.\n       If we can be of further assistance, please contact our \n     office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Brook Thompson,\n     President, NASED.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             National Association of Counties,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 9, 2002.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Rules and Administration, U.S. Senate, \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Rules and \n         Administration, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Senator McConnell: We would like to \n     congratulate you and thank you for your leadership, \n     perseverance and hard work in reaching agreement in the \n     House-Senate conference on the ``Help American Vote Act of \n     2002.'' We believe the final bill is a balanced approach to \n     reforming election laws and practices and to providing \n     resources to help counties and states in improving and \n     upgrading voting equipment. The National Association of \n     Counties supports H.R. 3295 as it was approved by the House-\n     Senate conference Committee.\n       We are very concerned about Congress providing the funds to \n     implement the new law. While there is much confusion at this \n     time about the appropriation process for FY2003, we strongly \n     urge the leadership of the House and Senate and President \n     Bush to support inclusion of $2.16 billion in a continuing \n     resolution. This is the amount authorized for FY2003 by the \n     ``Help American Vote Act.'' We believe that funding and \n     improving voting practices in the United States is an \n     important as our efforts to strengthen homeland security.\n       Thank you again for your continuing efforts to fund and \n     implement this new law.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Larry E. Naake,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I also would like to mention the tremendous \nassistance provided by the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the \nLeague of Women Voters, and People for the American Way.\n  Before I turn to my colleagues who wish to be heard, I would be \nremiss if I\n\n[[Page S10418]]\n\ndid not publicly express my gratitude to my fellow conferees. I already \nmentioned Senator McConnell, Senator Bond, Senator Durbin, and Senator \nSchumer. I thank their staffs as well.\n  I want to take a moment as well to thank an individual I had never \nreally met before--I may have met him before, but I did not certainly \nknow him--and that is the chairman of the House Administration \nCommittee, Bob Ney, from the State of Ohio, who serves in a tough job \nas chairman of that committee. He has been in the Congress, I think, \nabout 8 or 10 years.\n  He worked very hard on this legislation. And I developed a great deal \nof respect and affection for Bob Ney. We are of different parties and, \nobviously, different States, not serving together in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  But Bob Ney and his staff were tenacious, hard working, and \ndetermined to get a bill. I commend them for that. We were not sure we \nwere going to be able to get it done in the end, as it appeared at \nseveral points this may not work. And because Bob Ney felt strongly \nthat we had an obligation to try, we are here today with this product \non which they had a successful vote in the other body. So I commend Bob \nNey for his tremendous efforts and that of his staff.\n  Steny Hoyer is the ranking Democrat on the House Administration \nCommittee. I have known Steny for years. Unlike Bob Ney, Steny and I \nhave been good friends for a long time. Steny Hoyer has been as \ncommitted to election reform issues as anyone, as well as his \ncommitment to the disabled.\n  He was one of the prime architects of legislation affecting the \ndisabled. So while we talked about that a lot in this body during the \nconsideration of our bill, we certainly need to extend credit to Steny \nHoyer for his commitment to those issues as well.\n  So the team of Bob Ney and Steny Hoyer, putting together the product \nthey did, deserves a great deal of credit and recognition for what we \nhope will be the adoption of this conference report tomorrow and the \nsigning by the President of this, we think, historic piece of \nlegislation.\n  On more occasions than I can recall, the three of us--Steny Hoyer, \nBob Ney, and myself--along with staffs, spent a lot of late nights. I \nam looking around the Chamber at faces who were with me in those rooms \nin the wee hours of the morning, and long weekends, going back and \nforth. And I appreciate all of their efforts. We had some tough \nmoments, but in any good piece of legislation there will be tension. \nAnd if people are committed to try to work things out, you can produce \nresults such as we have in this legislation. So without their \npersistence and the patience of all involved, we would not be here. And \nI thank them.\n  Last but far from least, I thank John Conyers, the dean of the \nCongressional Back Caucus, for his stalwart support. The day we \nintroduced a bill, that is not unlike what we are asking our colleagues \nto support here, I stood in a room with two people, in front of a bank \nof cameras, as we laid out this particular idea. And the two \nindividuals with me in that room were John Conyers and John Sweeney of \nthe AFL-CIO. And I thank both of them.\n  But John Conyers has been tireless. He has never given up on this. He \nknew that compromises would have to be struck, and he insisted we reach \nthose compromises even though he would prefer, in some instances, that \nprovisions of the bill not be included. But a great legislator, a good \nlegislator, understands that when people gather for a conference, \nunfortunately, they arrive with their opinions, and you are not going \nto be able to get your own way all the time. So John Conyers was \ntremendously helpful. I began this journey with him a long time ago. \nAnd I could not end these remarks without extending my deep sense of \nappreciation to him and to his staff for their tremendous help.\n\n  In closing, I would like to add only this: Of all the many important \nissues considered by this Senate in this Congress, I do not think any--\nothers may argue this--but I do not think any are going to exceed this \none in significance. I know we have had important debates on Iraq and \nother such questions, but I think what Mitch McConnell, Kit Bond, and \nmy other conferees, Senator Durbin, Senator Schumer, and others who \nwere involved in this--what we have achieved certainly ranks in the top \nechelons of accomplishments, I would say the best thing we have done in \nthis Congress. We have not achieved a lot in this Congress, but I think \nthis is one of the most significant things.\n  I think this is the kind of legislation you can talk to your \ngrandchildren about or they will read about and say that even if we did \nnot do anything else in this Congress, this is a significant \naccomplishment for the American people.\n  Thomas Paine, as I have quoted him over and over again over the last \nyear and a half or so of this discussion, said 207 years ago:\n\n       The right to vote . . . is the primary right by which other \n     rights are protected. To take away this right is to reduce a \n     man to slavery, for slavery consists in being subject to the \n     will of another, and he that has not a vote . . . is in this \n     case.\n\n  So, Mr. President, I thank again my colleagues; for the bedrock \nprinciple in our Republic is simply this: the consent of the governed. \nWe are a nation where the people rule, and they rule not with a bullet \nbut with a ballot. That sacred, central premise of our Republic is \ngiven new power by this conference agreement. It can make America a \nmore free and democratic Nation. That kind of opportunity comes our way \nonly rarely, at most maybe once in a generation, on average. It is an \nopportunity that has emerged out of adverse circumstances--a close and \ncontroversial election for the Presidency of the United States.\n  By seizing that opportunity and passing this conference agreement, we \nin this body can transform a national moment of adversity into the \npromise of a future with the right to vote that will have new resonance \nfor every citizen of America. I urge adoption of this conference \nreport.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, first, let me say to my good friend \nfrom Connecticut, this is, indeed, something to celebrate on a \nbipartisan basis in a Congress that could use a celebration. This may \nhave been the most unproductive and unsuccessful session of the Senate \nin my 18 years here: no energy bill; no terrorism insurance bill and--\nuntil tomorrow, at least--no appropriations bills; no budget; no \nhomeland security bill; only 44 percent of President Bush's U.S. \ncircuit court nominees confirmed.\n  A couple of items we did pass were--at least in this Senator's \njudgment--not very good: a flawed campaign finance reform bill and a \nbloated farm bill.\n  We could use a celebration. And the Senator from Connecticut and I \nwould like to encourage all of our Senators to feel good about the \npiece of legislation that will be adopted tomorrow.\n  This is, indeed, a significant accomplishment, an important piece of \nlegislation. Even if we had a very productive Congress, and a Senate \nthat was passing landmark legislation on virtually a weekly basis--even \nif that had been the case this year--this legislation would have stood \nout as something important for the Nation and something well worth \ndoing.\n  So, Mr. President, I rise today with a tremendous amount of pride and \nenthusiasm about this landmark legislation. Although the Senate, as I \njust suggested, has been mired in partisanship and virtually calcified \nover various pieces of legislation, and the confirmation of judges, the \nHouse-Senate conference committee on election reform has achieved an \nhistoric bipartisan, bicameral consensus.\n  Nearly 2 years ago, this Nation had a painful lesson on the \ncomplexities and complications State and local election officials face \nin conducting elections. In response, legislators on both sides of the \nHill introduced legislation to address the problems exposed in the 2000 \nelection. The various pieces of legislation ran the gamut in approach \nand emphasis, but all were unified in their goal of improving our \nNation's election systems.\n  In December of 2000, Senator Torricelli and I introduced the first of \nwhat was to become four bipartisan compromise bills that I have \nsponsored or cosponsored. From the beginning, I have been committed to \nproviding not\n\n[[Page S10419]]\n\nonly financial assistance but also informational assistance to States \nand localities.\n  The best way to achieve both of these goals is by establishing an \nindependent, bipartisan election commission. The commission will be a \npermanent repository for the best, unbiased, and objective election \nadministration information for States and communities across America.\n  And that is really important because what happens--I used to be a \nlocal official early in my political career--is that you are confronted \nwith vendors selling various kinds of election equipment, and there is \nreally no way to make an objective analysis of what your needs are. On \nthe other hand, this new commission will be a repository for expertise \nand unbiased advice to States and localities across America about what \nkind of equipment might best suit their situation.\n  This concept has been one of the cornerstones of each of the bills \nthat I have sponsored. It was recommended by the Ford-Carter \nCommission, supported by the President, and has been perfected in this \nconference agreement. The commission will not micromanage the election \nprocess, but will instead serve as a tremendous resource for those \nacross America who conduct elections.\n\n  This conference report will help make all elections more accurate, \nmore accessible, and more honest, while respecting the primacy of \nStates and localities in the administration of elections. For the first \ntime ever, the Federal Government will invest significant resources to \nimprove the process, roughly $3.9 billion. Every State will receive \nfunds under this legislation, and the smaller States are guaranteed a \nshare of the pot. The funds will be used by the States in a manner they \ndetermine best suits their needs, rather than the Federal Government \nprescribing a one-size-fits-all system. Whether it is by replacing a \npunchcard or a lever voting system or educating and training poll \nworkers, States are provided the flexibility to address their specific \nneeds.\n  The mantra of this legislation, coined by the distinguished senior \nSenator from Missouri, Kit Bond, has been to ``make it easier to vote \nand harder to cheat.'' We have achieved that balance in this conference \nagreement by setting standards for States to meet, standards which the \nFederal Government will pay 95 percent of the cost to implement. Voting \nsystems will allow voters to verify their ballots and allow voters a \nsecond chance, if they make a mistake, while maintaining the sanctity \nof a private ballot.\n  Voting will become more accessible to people with disabilities, an \nissue admirably and vigorously championed by Senator Dodd. Provisional \nballots will be provided to all Americans who show up at polling sites \nonly to learn their names are not on the poll books. Such a voter's \neligibility will be verified, however, prior to the counting of the \nballot to ensure that those who are legally entitled to vote are able \nto do so and do so only once; again, making it easier to vote and \nharder to cheat.\n  To protect the integrity of every election, this conference report \nmakes significant advancements in rooting out vote fraud. Congress has \nacted properly to curtail fraudulent voting and reduce duplicate \nregistrations, both interstate--found to be more than 720,000 \nnationwide--and intrastate. The provisions of this bill are carefully \ndrafted to address this impediment to fair and honest elections, and we \nprovided the States with the means and the resources to address this \nproblem.\n  First, States will establish secure, computerized Statewide voter \nregistration databases that contain the name and information of each \nregistered voter. The accuracy of the voter registration list is \nparamount to a fair and accurate election. The motor voter bill of 1993 \nhas done grievous harm to the integrity of the system by junking up the \nvoter rolls and making it extremely difficult to systematically ensure \nthat only eligible voters are registered.\n  Second, every new registrant will be required to provide their \ndriver's license number, if they have been issued one, or the last four \ndigits of their Social Security number. If they have neither, the State \nwill assign them a unique identifier. This information will be matched \nwith the department of motor vehicles which will in turn match their \ndata with the Social Security Administration. States which use the full \nnine-digit Social Security number for voter registration are given the \noption to avail themselves of this important new provision. Contrary to \nthe assertions of some, the only thing this provision impedes is vote \nfraud.\n  Third, first-time voters who register by mail will have to confirm \ntheir identity at some point in the process by photo identification or \nother permissible identification. This provision was championed by \nSenator Bond, and its importance was once again highlighted just this \npast week in South Dakota where there is an ongoing joint Federal and \nState investigation of fraudulent voter registrations.\n\n  According to press reports in South Dakota, people are registering \nweeks after they have died, and one eager voter even completed 150 \nvoter registration cards. Is that an enthusiastic voter or what?\n  The South Dakota Attorney General succinctly summed up the problem:\n\n       It's pretty easy to register under a false name, have the \n     registration confirmation sent back to your home, then send \n     in by mail an absentee ballot request, get it and vote under \n     the false name, send it back and get it counted.\n\n  Under this legislation, that is not going to be possible any longer. \nThat is a step in the right direction for our democracy.\n  These three provisions will ensure that dogs such as Ritzy Mekler, \nHolly Briscoe, and other stars of ``Animal Planet'' will no longer be \nable to register and vote. These provisions will ensure that our dearly \ndeparted will finally achieve everlasting peace and will not be \ntroubled with exercising their franchise every 2 years. And \nimportantly, the provisions will ensure that voter rolls will be \ncleansed and protected against fraudulent and duplicate registrations.\n  This conference report also provides remedial safeguards for every \nAmerican's franchise. The Department of Justice will continue its \ntraditional role of enforcing Federal law. In addition, each State will \ndesign and establish a grievance procedure available to any voter who \nbelieves a violation of law has occurred. States are best equipped to \npromptly address the concerns of its voters, and I compliment Senator \nDodd for his foresight on this issue.\n  This legislation also makes significant improvements to protect the \nvotes of those who have committed themselves to protecting all \nAmericans, and that is our men and women in uniform.\n  I have touched upon just a few of the highlights of this historic \npiece of legislation. After nearly 2 years of discussions, \nnegotiations, introductions and reintroductions of election reform \nbills, we now stand ready to vote on the most important piece of \nlegislation before Congress in many years.\n  I thank, again, Senator Dodd for his steadfast leadership. He \ncommitted 110 percent of himself to this issue and worked tirelessly to \nbring us to this day. I also thank Senator Bond for all of his work to \nprotect the integrity of the election process. I also congratulate my \ncolleagues on the other side of the Hill for their significant \nachievement: Congressman Bob Ney of Ohio, chairman of the conference, \ndid a superb job; and our good friend Steny Hoyer, ranking member, who \nwas outstanding as well.\n  And to the staff people involved in this, my own staff on the Rules \nCommittee: Tam Somerville; I particularly commend Brian Lewis, who was \nthere from beginning to end in this process--as far as I am concerned, \nthis will be known as the Brian Lewis bill around my office--and his \nable right hand, Leon Sequeira, and Chris Moore and Hugh Farrish, all \nof the Rules Committee staff.\n  For Senator Bond, Julie Dammann and Jack Bartling of Senator Bond's \nstaff were superb. And for Senator Dodd, Kennie Gill, Shawn Maher, \nRonnie Gillespie, we enjoyed working with them, and they, too, should \nfeel about good about this. From Congressman Ney's staff, Paul \nVinovich, Chet Kalis, Roman Buhler, Pat Leahy--they have a staffer \nnamed Pat Leahy, how about that--and Matt Petersen. And from \nCongressman Hoyer's staff, Bob Cable, Keith Abouchar and Len Shambon.\n  This is indeed a happy day, not just for Senator Bond and myself, but \nfor\n\n[[Page S10420]]\n\nall Members of the Congress. This is a remarkable achievement we can \nall feel good about. We look forward to seeing it pass tomorrow by an \noverwhelming margin. I am sure the President at some point will want to \nsign this with appropriate flourish down at the White House.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Connecticut and yield the floor.\n\n\n                             weekend voting\n\n Mr. KOHL. I thank the distinguished chairman of the Rules \nCommittee for clarifying a provision in the bill. As the Senator knows, \nI am the sponsor of legislation moving Federal elections from the first \nTuesday in November to the first weekend in November. It is my hope \nthat moving Federal elections to the weekend will increase voter \nturnout by giving all voters ample opportunity to get to the polls \nwithout creating a national holiday. My proposal would also have the \npolls open the same hours across the continental United States, \naddressing the challenge of keeping results on one side of the country, \nor even a state, from influencing voting in places where polls are \nstill open.\n  The Senate version of the election reform legislation before us \nincluded a provision sponsored by Senator Hollings and myself which \ndirected the Election Administration Commission to study the viability \nof changing the day for congressional and presidential elections from \nthe first Tuesday in November to a holiday or the weekend, with the \npossibility of looking at the first weekend in November. Unfortunately, \nduring the conference on this bill, the studies section was refined to \ndirect the Election Administration Commission to study the \n``feasibility and advisability of conducting elections for Federal \noffice on different days, at different places, and during different \nhours, including the advisability of establishing a uniform poll \nclosing time'' with a legal public holiday mentioned as one option but \nno mention of weekend voting. Is it correct that there was no specific \nintent to leave out weekend voting as an option?\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from Wisconsin is correct. The conferees \nintended that the new Election Administration Commission consider all \noptions for election day, including the Senator's interesting proposal \nto move elections to the weekend. There was also no intent to limit the \nElection Administration Commission to considering just one day as an \nelection day. It is my hope that the commission will examine all \noptions, including the possibility of holding elections over two days \nas suggested in Senator Kohl's proposal.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for this \nclarification. I hope that the Election Administration Commission will \nseriously consider moving federal elections to the weekend. I will \ncontinue to advocate for weekend voting as a means of increasing voter \nturnout and addressing the need for uniform poll closing times in \nfederal elections.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to my colleague from \nOregon, Senator Wyden.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, let me join in the extraordinarily \nimportant comments that have been made by Senator Dodd and Senator \nMcConnell. This has been a huge and arduous task that had to be \nbipartisan. The fact is, you can't get anything done that really is \nimportant without it being bipartisan.\n  I take a moment to thank Senator Dodd. He has been extraordinarily \npatient with me and with all of the Members of this body who come from \nStates that have pioneered innovative approaches.\n  It is fair to say right now with millions of Americans essentially \nbeing early voters, there have been estimates that something along the \nlines of 15 percent of the American people are going to vote early.\n  The legislation that Senator Dodd and Senator McConnell brings to us \ntoday protects the wave of the future--this early voting--whether it be \nby absentee ballot or the pioneering vote-by-mail system.\n  What this legislation does is protect the early voters--the person we \nare seeing more and more of in the American political process--by, in \neffect, taking steps to discourage fraud at the front end when people \nregister, and then making sure that people don't face unnecessary \nbarriers and hassles when they actually participate in the fall of \neven-numbered years. So I commend Senators Dodd and McConnell for their \nwork in this area.\n  Suffice it to say, at various stages in the discussion, I wasn't sure \nthat we were going to make it. Look at how the debate began when this \nbill first came to the floor of the Senate. It seemed to me and others \nthat millions of Americans would have been turned away from the polls \nbecause they didn't have with them a valid photo identification or a \ncopy of a utility bill. It would have disenfranchised millions of \nAmericans. I and others made that point to Chairman Dodd and Senator \nMcConnell, and we began a very lengthy set of negotiations that \ninvolved Senators Dodd, McConnell, Bond, Cantwell, Schumer, and I. \nTogether we were able to work out an agreement with respect to the \nphoto identification provision. It protects fully the vote-by-mail \nsystem. In fact, it protects all Americans who want to vote early, as I \nhave mentioned. It is outlined in section 303 of the conference report.\n  I thought I would take a minute to describe how this provision would \nwork. Beginning in January 2004, anyone who registers to vote for the \nfirst time, let's say in Oregon, has the choice of registering by \nproviding a driver's license number, the last four digits of their \nSocial Security number, a copy of a current utility bill, bank \nstatement, government document, or a valid photo identification. When \nthey cast their ballot by mail, Oregon's State elections officials will \nverify the voter's eligibility consistent with State law by signature \nverification. Under our Oregon election law, an elections official \ndetermines voter eligibility by matching the signature on the \nregistration with the signature on the mail-in ballot. Oregon's \nsignature match system would not change.\n  My primary concern throughout this discussion has, of course, been to \nsupport our pioneering vote-by-mail system, which I think is the wave \nof the future. But as we have seen in recent days it is not just Oregon \nbut a variety of other States are going to see millions of people \nsaying they want to take the time, essentially through the fall when \npeople are considering the candidates, to look at the statements put \nout and reflect on them in a way that is convenient for them.\n  We said at the beginning of this discussion that we wanted to \ndiscourage fraud and encourage voters. I think that is what the Dodd-\nMcConnell legislation does. I am particularly pleased that it does so \nin a way that protects Oregon's pioneering system and all of those \naround this country who are going to be voting by mail.\n  Senator McConnell just mentioned that this is, in his view, just \nabout as important as it gets for the Senate. I will reaffirm that \nstatement. After all of the problems that we have seen in Florida, \nafter you look at all of the challenges in terms of getting young \npeople excited about politics and excited about the democratic process, \nwhat this legislation does is it reaches out and says: We understand \nthose concerns. We understand that the American people feel more \nstrongly about this subject than just about anything else because it is \nwhat we are about. It is about our values, our principles; it is what \nthe Senate is all about. So I am very pleased that Senators Dodd and \nMcConnell had the patience to work with some of us who, I am sure, were \nfairly prickly and difficult along the way. I don't know how many hours \nwe had in negotiations just looking at the arcane details of some of \nthe vote-by-mail States. But Senator Dodd said we are just not going to \ngive up. We understand that you are doing something very exciting in \nthe Pacific Northwest, and we encourage it.\n\n  In effect, what Senator Dodd has done is not just protect the Oregon \nsystem but allowed this country to build on something that I think is \nthe wave of the future; that is, people voting essentially throughout \nthe fall. We have seen--as reported recently in various States as they \ninnovate with different kinds of systems--a variety of approaches that \nare being tried. My own sense is that it won't be very long before \npeople start voting online in this country.\n\n[[Page S10421]]\n\n  So what Senator Dodd has done is made it clear that he is going to \nstand with all of us in the Senate who want to discourage fraud, and we \nare going to do it at the right time and in the right way, which is \nessentially at the front end when people come to sign up for the \nelectoral process. But then, after we can ascertain they are who they \nsay they are, they are not going to face innumerable hassles and \nbarriers when they actually show up to vote.\n  So my thanks to Senator Dodd and his staff, Carole Grunberg, who is \nhere. She has championed for us the Oregon vote-by-mail system. But \nwith Senator Dodd in the Chamber, I want him to know how much I \nappreciate what he is doing. It means a tremendous amount to my \nconstituents and also to this country and to the future of American \nvoting.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before my colleague leaves the floor, I \nthank him and his staff as well for their tremendous contribution. One \nof the things we did in this bill--I say to my friend from Oregon that \nhe is in large part responsible for this, I probably should give him \nmore credit for this--we set Federal standards and rights that never \nhave existed before in all Federal elections across the country, and we \nhave enumerated the rights in this bill.\n  One of the things I fought very hard to preserve is that what \nconstitutes a valid registration of a voter and what constitutes a \nvalid vote is left up to the States. We don't federalize registration \nand we don't federalize how votes get counted. We have left that to the \nStates. It would be overreaching to go that far.\n  I must say some of the most creative ideas on how to make this basic \nfranchise accessible to the maximum number of people, the most creative \nideas are occurring in our States across the country. There are \ndifferences in places, and States ought to have the flexibility of \ndeciding what system works best for them.\n  I will tell my colleague, I have learned of some fascinating \nhistorical stories. Going back, people have said: Where in the \nConstitution does it say you have to be a citizen to vote? Well, it is \nthe 14th and 15th amendments. The 14th amendment describes what a \ncitizen is, and the 15th amendment says all citizens have the right to \nvote.\n  There was a time--and the Presiding Officer may find this \ninteresting--when we discovered as part of our research that in the \nlatter part of the 19th century, in certain areas of the upper Midwest, \nin efforts to attract immigrant populations to settle in some of the \nvast farmlands there, they actually said: We will allow you to vote in \nFederal elections--which they did. I cannot find the lawsuit that \nstopped it. I think it may have been by tradition, but it provided that \nthe person who signed up made a promise that they would someday become \na citizen. That was the condition that you had to fill out.\n  There are actually some jurisdictions in this country, by the way, \nnot in Federal elections but local elections, where noncitizens, by \nmunicipal law, are allowed to vote.\n  The State of Oregon is, I think, on the cutting edge. I agree with my \ncolleague on this. Maybe because I have a head of gray hair, but I like \nthe idea of a community gathering at a polling place. There is a sense \nof community spirit about showing up.\n  In my town of East Haddam, CT--it is a small place with only a few \nthousand people and where I have lived for the last two decades--we all \ngather in the old townhall, literally around the potbellied stove. The \nfolks I have known for the last two decades run the polling operations \nthere. We like it that way. I am not suggesting there is a younger \ngeneration coming along who do not like the way they do it in Oregon--I \nsuspect they might, and I suspect there will be States allowing people, \nin the not-too-distant future, to vote by Internet.\n  I thank him for bringing forward the Oregon and, we should add, the \nWashington experience, because they are similar experiences, to this \ndebate. The fact we managed to accommodate the unique voting \ncircumstances in their States gave rise to the idea there actually may \nbe other States that may want to move in this direction. In fact, the \nprovisions authored by my colleague and included in the conference \nreport can be used by every state, and not just by Oregon and \nWashington. We thank Senator Wyden for his contribution and for making \nthis a stronger and a better bill, and one that does maintain its \nsensitivity to the unique requirements and needs of people across this \nvast country of ours. I thank the distinguished Senator from Oregon for \nhis contribution.\n  I note as well--it is somewhat an irony--I recall vividly the day \nSenator McConnell and I had announced we had reached an agreement, at \nleast on the Senate version of this bill, our colleague who is now \npresiding over the Senate was presiding over the Senate that very day. \nHe would not have known on that day a year and a half ago he would be \npresiding today as well. I thank him.\n  Mr. President, I wish to note because there are so many wonderful \nstaff people and they do not get the credit they deserve--we get to \nstand here and give the speeches and our names go on the bills. There \nare literally dozens of people who work incredible hours to produce the \nkind of legislation we are endorsing today.\n  I mentioned already the Members on the House side, my colleagues, Bob \nNey and Steny Hoyer, the principal House advocates. There was a long \nlist of conferees, by the way, in the House. A number of committees of \njurisdiction touched on matters in this bill, from the Ways and Means \nCommittee to the Armed Services Committee--I will forget some--a lot of \ncommittees. So there were a lot more conferees from the other body on \nthe conference committee. I thank them.\n  I extend my special appreciation for the invaluable expertise and \ncontributions in negotiating this bill to final passage to Paul \nVinovich, one of the principal staff people for Bob Ney, and Chet \nKalis, who is a wonderful individual. Both of these men are remarkable \npeople and did a fantastic job, not just for Bob Ney and the Republican \nside, but they always had the sense they wanted to get a bill done, and \nthat is a big difference when you are in a conference. If you are \nlooking across the table at people and if the negotiating is to stop \nsomething or to make something happen, what a difference it is when you \ntalk to people who give you the sense they want something to happen. I \nthank them.\n\n  I thank Roman Buhler, a tough negotiator; Matthew Petersen; and Pat \nLeahy.\n  From the office of Steny Hoyer: Bill Cable--I have known Bill for all \nmy years in Congress. When I served in the other body, Bill Cable was a \nterrific staff person then. He has a wonderful institutional memory \nabout the Congress of the United States. Steny Hoyer is truly fortunate \nto have Bill Cable with him. I thank him for the long hours he put in \non this legislation.\n  Keith Abouchar and Lenny Shambon were wonderful. They are \nknowledgeable people and have been very helpful on this. They \nunderstand the laws, and have a wonderful expertise in motor voter \nregistration and how these proposals work.\n  I further thank John Conyers. I mentioned already my coauthor of this \nlegislation initially, but I want to also thank his staff. I thank \nPerry Apelbaum, Ted Kalo, and Michone Johnson, who were just wonderful \nand tireless in their efforts. I thank them for their tremendous work. \nAlong with John, they were a great source of information and guidance \nduring some very delicate moments on how we ought to proceed.\n  Tom Daschle, our leader in the Senate, has been tremendously helpful \nthrough all of this. He asked me how long the original bill would take \non the floor of the Senate when it came up. We had gotten through this, \nworked out the agreement, and there were a lot of demands for time on \nthe floor. He looked at me and said: How long do you think it will take \nto debate the election reform bill?\n  I said: Mr. Leader, I think we can do it in 2 days.\n  Mr. President, if you look around, you can see the smiles on the \nfaces of some of the floor staff. I think we were on the floor 9 days, \nhad 46 amendments, and there were a hundred more, at least, proposed. I \ntook some very healthy ribbing from the majority leader and others on \nthe staff when they would look at me day after day\n\n[[Page S10422]]\n\nand say: How long did you say this bill would take? It took a lot \nlonger than we anticipated.\n  I thank Andrea LaRue, Jennifer Duck, Michelle Ballantyne, Mark \nChildress, and Mark Patterson from the majority leader's staff for \ntheir patience and assistance.\n  With regard to Senator McConnell's staff, we spent a lot of time with \nSenator McConnell's staff. We spent more time with Senator McConnell's \nstaff than with Senator McConnell, and he would be the first to say \nthat. Tam Somerville, Brian Lewis, and Leon Sequeira are also very fine \nand hard-working staff members. Brian Lewis--poor Brian got saddled \nwith more responsibilities. With all of this coming together, committee \nstaff had to deal with campaign finance reform and election reform all \nat once. There were demands on their time, pulling them in two \ndifferent directions, as we were trying to get this bill completed in \nthe Senate so we could get to conference because we knew we had a long \nconference ahead of us. I express my gratitude to Brian. He is \nknowledgeable, worked hard, and made a significant contribution. I \nappreciate it very much.\n  Senator Schumer's staff: Polly Trottenberg, Christine Parker, Cindy \nBauerly, and Sharon Levin were very helpful. I thank them.\n  Senator Bond: Julie Dammann and Jack Bartling. We had some real go-\nrounds with Senator Bond's staff on some of the provisions in this \nbill. I thank both of them for a lot of effort. Jack Bartling spent a \nlot of time during the Senate consideration, going back months and \nmonths ago, sitting up late nights in my conference room and going \nthrough what we wanted to do and how it might work. I occasionally \nwould run into Jack off the Hill. Even in off hours in restaurants, we \nwould end up being seated next to each other unintentionally by the \nmaitre d'. We spent all day working on this legislation, and when I \nwent out for an evening with my wife and child, who ended up sitting \nnext to me but Jack Bartling, and here we go again carrying on \nconversations. I thank Jack.\n\n  I thank Jennifer Leach and Sara Wills on Senator Torricelli's staff. \nSenator Bob Torricelli offered some of the earliest versions of \nelection reform. Early on he thought we ought to do something about \nelection reform and worked with Senator McConnell and others to craft \nlegislation. He agreed to work with us on our bill when we developed \nit. I thank Senator Torricelli for working very hard on campaign \nelection reform.\n  Senator McCain's staff: Ken LaSala. I offer a special appreciation \nfor his invaluable expertise and contributions in negotiating and \nbringing this bill to final passage.\n  Senator Durbin's staff: Bill Weber was tremendously helpful to us. I \nthank him.\n  I thank Beth Stein and Caroline Fredrickson from Senator Cantwell's \nstaff. I mentioned Oregon, Senator Wyden and his State, and the Senator \nfrom the State of Washington, Ms. Cantwell, had similar circumstances \nand were concerned about how the provisions of this bill would work in \na State where a significant number of the people vote by mail. They \nwanted to be sure we were not doing anything here that was going to \nprohibit them from conducting their elections in the way they have done \nsuccessfully for some time.\n  I mentioned Senator Wyden. I thank Carol Grunberg for her work as \nwell.\n  The floor staff, again, were tremendously patient with this Member. I \ntied up the cloakroom for hours one Friday trying to get holds lifted \non this bill.\n  The floor staff was tremendously helpful. Marty Paone, Lula Davis, \nGary Myrick, members of the cloakroom staff, were tremendously \nsupportive.\n  I apologize for going through all of this and mentioning these names. \nI could just submit them for the Record, but I want to say their names \nbecause just putting their names in the Record does not do justice to \nthe amount of time and effort people have put in. So I beg the \nindulgence of the Chair and others as I go through this.\n  This may sound mundane or boring to those who are watching it, but I \nam someone who believes very strongly we ought to give more recognition \nto the people whose names never appear much around this place and yet \nwho make incredible contributions to a product like this.\n  I want to thank the Office of Legislative Counsel. Let me explain \nwhat legislative counsel does. These are the people who actually write \nthese bills. We tell them what we are thinking, these grand ideas of \nours. A Senator has a grand idea. The staff tries to put language \naround the grand idea and then they go to legislative counsel, who then \nhas to write it in a legalistic way so it can actually mean something \nbecause words have specific meaning.\n  So the legislative counsel's office was instrumental--we asked them \nto work around the clock on a few instances. Literally, they were up \nall night producing language because we were running up against the \nclock to get this bill done. So to Jim Scott and Jim Fransen of the \nOffice of Senate Legislative Counsel, and Noah Wofsy, from the House \nlegislative counsel, I want to express my deep sense of gratitude to \nthem for their work. They sat down very objectively. Noah Wolfsy is on \nthe House side under the Republican leadership in the House. Jim Scott \nand Jim Fransen are in the Senate under the Democratic leadership of \nthe Senate, but neither side was partisan in any way. I can honestly \nsay if I sat them in a room and asked them for their views on how this \nought to be written, I would never know from which party they had been \nchosen to do the job. They are that objective and that professional in \nhow they do it.\n  Sometimes I wish America could watch this when they talk about laws. \nThey could then see people such as these who are so dedicated and see \nto it that we can get it right. They did not bring political baggage to \nthat discussion and debate.\n  I mentioned some history earlier about the upper Midwest and these \nother places. The Congressional Research Service, CRS, was the \norganization that provided me with some historical framework and \nbackground in the conduct of elections and also provided side-by-side \nversions of bills along the way. And we thank them: Kevin Coleman, who \nis an analyst in the American National Government; Eric Fischer, senior \nspecialist in Science and Technology; L. Paige Whitaker, legislative \nattorney at the Congressional Research Service; David Huckabee, who is \na specialist in American National Government; and Judith Fraizer, who \nis an information research specialist. They did a great job, and we are \nvery grateful to them as well.\n  I wish to thank my own staff. Obviously, in my own heart and mind \nthey come first, as one might expect, but my mother raised me to be \npolite so I mentioned other people first. I am particularly grateful to \nmy own staff who worked very hard on this. Through my bellowing and \nbarking, and doing all the things we do and wondering why we could not \nreach agreements earlier--I hope I was not too impatient with them--I \nwant to thank Shawn Maher, who is my legislative director. He was \ntremendously patient and did a great job. Kennie Gill, who is the staff \ndirector and chief counsel of the Rules Committee, is just one of the \nmost knowledgeable people about this institution I have ever met in my \n27 years in Congress. I have met Members who have great respect for the \ninstitution, its history, its traditions, what these buildings mean, \nand what membership means in the other body or this body. I have never \nmet anybody, Member or non-Member, who has as much reverence for this \ninstitution as Kennie Gill, and I thank her.\n\n  Ronnie Gillespie, who is a terrific individual as well, is our \ncounsel on the Rules Committee. She did a terrific job and I am very \ngrateful to her, as well as my own staff, Sheryl Cohen, Marvin Fast, \nAlex Swartsel and Tom Lenard. Sheryl Cohen is my staff director, chief \nof staff of my office, and has to manage all of these things going \naround. She does a wonderful job, and I am very grateful to her. From \nthe Rules Committee, Carole Blessington, Beth Meagher, Hasan Mansori, \nand Sue Wright also deserve some very special recognition. Chris Shunk, \nJennifer Cusick, and Sam Young are non-designated staff on the Rules \nCommittee staff, who kept the vouchers going during this time and they \ndo wonderful work. There are some former members who were part of this \neffort who had to leave for various reasons before the completion of \nthis bill, but the fact they are not here does not mean they should not \nbe recognized. Stacy Beck,\n\n[[Page S10423]]\n\nCandace Chin, and Laura Roubicek are three people I want to thank.\n  That is 60 individuals I have mentioned. There may be others I have \nmissed. If I have missed them, I apologize, but I want them to know \nthat all of us, regardless of political persuasion or ideology, thank \nthem, and millions of Americans ought to as well because we never would \nhave achieved this conference report, been able to write this bill, had \nit not been for these 60 individuals and many more like them.\n  I have not mentioned the individuals on the outside that worked on \nthis, the NAACP, the National Association of Secretaries of State, the \nAFL-CIO, the various disability groups. There are literally hundreds of \npeople who are involved in this journey over the last year and a half \nto produce this conference report. I know normally we do not take as \nmuch time to talk about all of this, but I think Senator McConnell and \nI--and not because it is a pride of authorship, but we think we have \ndone something very historically significant. We are changing America. \nWe are changing the way America is going to be choosing its leadership. \nWe want everyone to participate in this country. It is a source of \nsignificant embarrassment to me that there are individuals who cannot \nparticipate.\n  I served in the Peace Corps in Latin America back in the 1960s. So I \nam asked periodically to go and observe elections, particularly in \nLatin America, because I know the language and have knowledge of the \narea. I cannot say how moving it is to watch some of these desperately \npoor countries where the people who lack any formal education, or have \nvery little of it, will literally stand in line all day, walk miles \nthrough blistering and difficult weather, intimidation, fear of \nliterally being killed if they show up, and they vote. They look to us \nas a beacon of what it means as a free people to be able to choose who \nrepresents us, from the most insignificant office on the municipal or \ntown level to the Presidency of the United States. The idea that each \nand every one of us can be a part of making those choices, and the fact \nthat only 50 percent of our eligible population does so, ought to be a \nsource of collective shame. While this bill is not going to eradicate \nall of that, when we consider how hard some people fight to be free, \nhow blessed we are as a people and how little is asked of us to \nparticipate in the process which has historically distinguished us as a \npeople, our sincere hope today, as we vote tomorrow on this bill, is we \nhave made it easier for people to meet that obligation and made it more \ndifficult for those who would like to scam it in some way. But the most \nimportant thing this legislation does is to make it easier for people \nto make that choice.\n\n  So all of those who have been involved in this have my profound sense \nof gratitude, and I am very confident that sense of gratitude is going \nto be expressed by millions of people for years to come because of what \nwe have done in the wake of a tragedy in the year 2000, on November 7. \nWe have responded to it with this legislation. Not in every sense, but \non some of the core questions, this Congress has stepped up to the \nplate and responded to those issues. The leadership and Members of the \nother body, as well as the leadership here, can rightfully claim a \nproud moment when this bill passes the Senate tomorrow and President \nBush signs this legislation as the permanent law of our land.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10423-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10423-S10424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        BUSINESS OF THE CONGRESS\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, my friend from Kentucky, in the opening of \nhis remarks, talked about this Congress not being terribly successful. \nI would take some issue with that. This Senate has been successful, as \nI look down the list I have of more than three pages of legislation \ngoing back to the use of force resolution after September 11, responses \nto terrorist attacks, the Patriot Act, the airport security, Defense \nauthorizations, homeland defense, antiterrorism bills, terrorism \ninsurance--we are still working on the conference--access to affordable \npharmaceuticals, prescription drugs, reimportation, patients' bill of \nrights. Again, conference reports have not been reached, but this \nSenate has had extensive debates where all sides have been heard on \nthese matters.\n  I mentioned in the election reform bill more than 40 amendments were \nconsidered on the floor. With all due respect to the other body these \ndays, it is not uncommon for legislation to be considered where only \none or two amendments may be offered. It is regrettable we have not \nbeen able to reach agreement between the other body and this body on \nsome of these matters, but the Senate over this last Congress has \nresponded to incredible and unprecedented difficulties in this \ngeneration. In the wake of September 11, the anthrax attack, and the \ntremendous pressures that put on this institution, I am as disappointed \nas anyone that we do not have a prescription drug benefit, that we \ndon't have a Patients' Bill of Rights, that we don't have a minimum \nwage, that we are not responding to the unemployment requests.\n\n  That is not because this Senate has not wanted to step up, time after \ntime. I am proud to be a Daschle Democrat. I hear people suggesting \nthat as a moniker of derision. Many think Tom Daschle has done a \nremarkable job in being the majority leader. It is disappointing we \nhave not been able to do on the other matters what we were able to get \ndone on the election reform, but that is not the fault of the majority \nleader.\n  I am proud of the election reform bill. I am proud of a lot of other \nthings done in this Senate over the last number of months before we \nadjourn. I am disappointed we were not able to reach agreement on some \nof the other matters. The fault of that lies elsewhere.\n  I wanted to not let the afternoon close without this Senator \nexpressing his strong feelings about some of the other matters that the \nAmerican public desperately need. I did not engage in the debate \nearlier today about the economic conditions of our country, but it is \nwhat people are asking about as I go throughout my State, and other \nparts of the country. People are very worried about where we are headed \neconomically. They are worried about the quality of education. They are \nworried about whether jobs will be there. They want to hear us engaging \nin ideas that will advance how we can improve the quality of education, \nextend health care benefits to people. They want to get a sense we are \non their side. They know we cannot do it all ourselves. It takes \ncooperation between private and other governmental sectors, but they \nwant to know we care as much about what they struggle with to make ends \nmeet, to provide for families and provide for their future.\n  I think it is regrettable we will spend the last remaining days with \npeople flying around the country attending fundraising events when we \ncould be working on some of the economic problems afflicting people in \nthis country. We see the deficits mounting again after the great hope \nthe surpluses were going to provide, surpluses from the previous \nadministration. It is sad we have come to this in our country. We ought \nto get our priorities straight and get back on the economic issues. The \nAmerican people expect nothing less.\n  If we wonder why people do not participate as often as we would like \nin the election process, some has to do with people being too lazy. An \nawful lot has to do with people wondering whether the things they worry \nmost about are even being considered by the people they elect to public \noffice. People do not think of themselves as Democrats or Republicans \nevery day. They think of themselves as being citizens of the country: \nParents, children, neighbors, coworkers. That is how they define \nthemselves. They want to know their elected representatives, regardless \nof party, are keeping their interests in mind.\n  This is a republic. They do not get the chance to vote. If 280 \nmillion Americans could be packed in the Chambers, the agenda would \nchange. It would be about health care, it would be about prescription \ndrugs, about a minimum wage, and improving the quality of elementary \nand secondary education. If they could stand here collectively, that is \nwhat they would ask us to do--to be leaders on those questions, to \nbecome forces in visions for improving the quality of life for people \nin the country.\n  That is what Senator Daschle has tried to do over the past 2 years in \nthe wake and midst of all the other problems we face. I commend him for \nit, Harry Reid, Byron Dorgan, and other\n\n[[Page S10424]]\n\nMembers of the leadership here. I understand as well it is not easy for \nTrent Lott and Don Nickles, the leadership on the other side.\n  My hope is when we come back here in January we get about the \nbusiness of grappling with the underlying questions. We spent a lot of \ntime on Iraq and the other questions. The American people want to know \nwhy we cannot spend a few days talking about the issues they worry most \nabout. When they get up in the morning and they go to bed at night, \nthey worry and they sit around talking about how they will lick these \nissues. They would like to know we would spend at least as much time on \nthose questions as some of the other issues.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I rise today to support the hard work of \nthe conferees on the election reform conference report. I did not \nhesitate to vote against S. 565 because it unfairly disadvantaged rural \nStates and did not fix the most grievous flaws with the current system. \nI am pleased to report that significant improvements have been made \nfrom the original bill, and I support this attempt to give greater \nintegrity to the electoral process.\n  We can now ensure that the ballots from our servicemen and women \noverseas are properly handled. Their ballots cannot be refused based on \nearly submission, and each will bear a postmark in order to avoid \nrecent election debacles from occurring again.\n  All States will receive a minimum grant award, with the potential to \napply for additional funds, an improvement over the Senate-passed \nversion, which would have disadvantaged rural States with a solely \ncompetitive grant program. Most importantly, this report identifies \nremedies for election fraud. States may purge any individuals who do \nnot vote in two consecutive Federal elections and are unresponsive to \nfollow-up by State officials. We must clean up our voter rolls, and \nthis provision gives States the vehicle to do so, should they choose to \nuse it. This is by no means a perfect report, but I am sufficiently \nconvinced that we have taken great strides to better our voting \nprocess.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10424-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10424]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, one year ago today, a letter containing \nabout two grams of anthrax was opened in my office. My staff, Senator \nFeingold's staff, and the law enforcement and medical personnel who \nresponded to the incident were suddenly thrown into a world of \nfrightening uncertainty.\n  Twenty-eight people tested positive for exposure to multiple lethal \ndoses of anthrax, and about 45 others were presumed to be significantly \nexposed.\n  They endured 100 to 120 days of antibiotics and the fear and anxiety \nthat accompany the largest bioterrorist attack on U.S. soil. All the \nwhile, they continued to come to work and do their jobs--jobs that \nincluded trying to protect the rest of America from a similar fate.\n  Of course, the effects of this attacks were felt well beyond my \noffice. Hundreds of others from the immediate area were placed on \npreventive antibiotics. House and Senate office buildings were closed \nfor several days, and the Hart building was closed for 3 months.\n  Every member and employee of the Senate was affected, and I must say \nit was an inspiration to see how well our community pulled together to \nensure that the Senate continued to address the business of the \ncountry.\n  In retrospect, we were very lucky. We knew exactly when and where \npeople had been exposed, which gave us an advantage that others did not \nhave--the opportunity to provide those who were exposed with immediate \npreventive care. And while there were some terrifying times, no one in \nthe Senate community died as a result of their exposure to anthrax.\n  Sadly, others were not so lucky. Robert Stevens and Ernesto Blanco \nhad no idea they had been exposed to anthrax when they fell ill. \nOctober 5 is the anniversary that Ernesto Blanco remembers; October 5 \nis the day his co-worker, Robert Stevens, died.\n  Next week America's postal workers will mark two more tragic \nanniversaries: October 21 is the day Thomas L. Morris, Jr. died of \ninhalation anthrax, and his colleague Joseph P. Curseen, Jr. succumbed \nthe following day.\n  Because it was not yet understood that the deadly bacteria could \nescape through envelopes, Mary Morris, Celeste Curseen, and their \nfamilies and friends have endured a terribly painful year.\n  Thomas Morris, Joseph Curseen, and all of America's postal workers \ncontinued to work even when they knew they could risk for exposure to \nanthrax or other biological or chemical agents. Postal workers accept \nthose and other risks every day, and for their courage and dedication, \nthey deserve a nation's gratitude.\n  Those who knew and loved Kathy Nguyen and Ottillie Lundgren have \ntheir own anniversaries approaching: October 31 and November 17. \nExactly how these women were exposed remains a sad mystery.\n  Still others, including Ernesto Blanco, LeRoy Richmond, and Naomi \nWallace, survived the disease. But many of them are suffering from \ndebilitating often painful long-term health effects. They have no \nanniversary to mark the end of their ordeal, for it is ongoing.\n  All of these people, like the first responders and Senate employees \nexposed to anthrax, were innocent victims.\n  My staff and I feel a special kinship with the families of those who \ndied and with those who continue to struggle with their health. On \ntheir behalf, and on behalf of the entire Senate, I extend our deepest \nsympathy to those to who lost friends and loved ones and our very best \nwishes for a full recovery to those who survived the disease.\n  What else shall we offer these families? They need more than our \nsympathy. They--and all Americans--need our absolute resolve to ensure \nthat our country does everything it reasonably can to prevent and \naddress the bioterrorist threat, so that others do not suffer what they \nhave suffered. As tragic as the anthrax attacks of last fall were, they \ncould have been much worse, and we must prepare ourselves for and \ndefend against the possibility of far greater threats.\n  We must be vigilant in our effort to identify and neutralize \nterrorist cells. We must develop better ways to detect chemical and \nbiological agents in the air, water, and food supplies. We must develop \nbetter vaccines. We must develop better treatments for those who are \nexposed to deadly viruses, bacteria, and agents. And we must develop \nbetter coordination between the various public health, intelligence and \nother government entities responsible for addressing the bioterrorist \nthreat.\n  The victims and their families also need and deserve to know that the \nperpetrator or perpetrators of these terrible crimes will be brought to \njustice. We are all frustrated by the fact that the person or persons \nresponsible are still out there, capable of striking again. This is a \ncomplex case, and I know the FBI has focused many resources on it. I am \nhopeful they will soon be in a position to bring the case to a \nsuccessful close.\n  One year ago today, an anthrax-laden letter was opened in my office.\n\n[[Page S10425]]\n\n  Let us mark this anniversary--and all the sad anniversaries since \nSeptember 11--with a renewed sense of community, a renewed \ndetermination to protect each other, and a renewed resolve to preserve \nAmerica's strength and spirit.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I would like to speak in morning business for \nas long as I might consume to discuss some legislation Senator Schumer \nand I have introduced and to discuss my intention to seek to have that \nlegislation added to the conference of the intelligence authorization \nbill which, hopefully, will come before this body for our deliberation \nand acceptance by the end of this week--again, hopefully.\n  This legislation not only will reauthorize the intelligence community \nactivities that are funded by the Congress, but also, perhaps, will \ninclude an agreement on an outside commission that will later be \nestablished to look into the events prior to September 11.\n  So there are some important elements to this bill. One of the items I \nwould like to add to it also deals with the subject of terrorism, the \nSchumer-Kyl bill--that I will describe in just a moment--which is a \nvery small provision in the so-called FISA law that would be \nappropriately added in this conference as an additional way we can help \nwin the war on terror.\n  Let me begin by discussing just a little bit what this legislation is \nand why it is necessary, and then I will discuss a little bit further \nhow we would like to have it considered.\n  The bill number is S. 2568, called the Schumer-Kyl bill. It would add \nthree words to the FISA legislation under which we are now able to \ngather information that is useful in conducting our war on terror.\n  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, is a law which \nprovides a special way of gathering this evidence against terrorists, \nand its origins are back in the 1970s. But it deals with a different \nsituation today in terrorism than it did back then.\n  Let me just go back in time. The idea was if you were working for a \nforeign government, we ought to have a little better ability to \ninvestigate you than through the probable cause requirements of the 4th \namendment that we would ordinarily apply in a title III court \nsituation. So the FISA law was established to say if you have evidence \nsomeone is working for a foreign government or an international \nterrorist organization, then you can involve the FISA Court, the \nspecial court, to ask that court for a warrant to do a wiretap or to \nsearch a home or to search a computer, or whatever the case might be.\n  Back in the 1970s, when this was first started, it was a fairly \nstraightforward proposition. If you thought, for example, you might be \ndealing with a foreign spy, somebody working for the then-Soviet Union, \nyou could go to the FISA Court and get a warrant for the information \nyou were seeking, and it was a little easier to obtain than through a \nregular court.\n  Secondly, the information was all classified, secret; it did not have \nto be shared with anyone else, and these judges were cleared to receive \nthat information. So we were able to keep these kinds of investigations \nclassified, and obviously that was a key element to be able to \nprosecute these counterterrorism types of cases. But back then the \nclassical FISA target would be either a Soviet agent or perhaps one of \nthe sort of hierarchical terrorist organizations such as the Bader-\nMeinhof gang in West Germany or the Red Army faction or a group of that \nsort. Today, as you know, the situation is very different.\n\n  We have in the world today amorphous terrorist groups that have \nspread throughout the entire world that are very loosely affiliated, \nsometimes not affiliated at all. It is not even clear frequently \nwhether individual people are directly connected to the terrorist group \nor actually members of the terrorist group. And when we speak of \n``members of,'' I am not even sure anybody can define a member of a \nterrorist organization. You do not pay dues and have a card that \nidentifies you as a member of al-Qaida or Hamas or Hezbollah or the \nIslamic Jihad or any of these other organizations.\n  Now, it is true within the group there, you would have to be accepted \nas someone they could trust, but I do not necessarily think they look \nat the people with whom they work as members of the organization.\n  So we wrote a statute back in the 1970s for a different type of enemy \nthan the enemy we face today. What we are finding is sometimes it is \nvery difficult to connect up a particular terrorist either with a \nforeign country or with a particular terrorist organization. We know \nthere are state sponsors of terrorism, and I suppose if we had evidence \nsomebody here in the United States was planning to commit an act of \nterror, and they were employed by the Government of, let's say, Iran, \nwe could probably get a FISA warrant because we could connect them \npretty easily to a foreign country that has been known to conduct state \nterrorism. But it is a lot more difficult when you have somebody such \nas Zacarias Moussaoui, for example, the alleged 20th hijacker. His is \nan actual case in point used by many to demonstrate the fact that our \nlaw enforcement agencies did not act quickly enough in order to obtain \na FISA warrant against him. The reason they did not is precisely \nbecause of the difficulty of connecting him to a foreign country or a \nparticular international terrorist organization, which is what the FISA \nstatute requires.\n  Now, bear in mind one of the rationales for being able to accelerate \nand short circuit the procedures here with a FISA warrant, as opposed \nto a regular title III type warrant, is you are dealing with a foreign \ncountry. You are not dealing with an American citizen. You are dealing \nwith a threat from without or an international terrorist organization. \nSo that is the theory.\n  But in the case of someone such as Zacarias Moussaoui, even though he \nwas a foreign person--not a United States citizen--we could not connect \nhim with Algeria or France or any of the other countries of the world. \nWe thought his activities looked very suspicious and that they could be \nterrorist-type planning, but not connected to a particular country. Nor \nwas it possible to connect him to al-Qaida. We did not have information \nconnecting him to al-Qaida. We had some information that in an around-\nabout way connected him to terrorists in a particular place but not an \ninternational terrorist organization.\n  So here you had a situation where he was talking to some terrorists, \nhe looked to be interested in engaging in activity that could result in \nterrorism here in the United States, but the two requirements to get a \nwarrant--either that he was involved in state-sponsored terror with a \nparticular country or a particular international terror organization--\ncould not be proved. And as a result, either legitimately or not \nlegitimately, the FBI did not authorize a warrant to search his \ncomputer, notwithstanding the fact there were some in our law \nenforcement community who wished to do that. And, of course, his \ncomputer was not searched until after September 11.\n  What the Schumer-Kyl bill does is to correct this one little \ndeficiency in the statute to bring it up to date, literally from the \ntime it was created back in the cold war days, to today's environment \nin which you have amorphous terrorist groups floating around with \nindividuals freely associating amongst them, or perhaps even not at all \nwith them but engaged in terror.\n  What it does is to correct this problem with the statute by adding \njust three words--``or foreign person''--to the targets of the warrant. \nSo an individual would be the subject of a warrant if you could show \nyou had probable cause to believe the individual was engaged in or \nplanning to engage in an act of terrorism and either was doing so on \nbehalf of another country, an international terrorist organization, or \nthe person himself is a foreign person.\n  So you have the connection of two things. You have a potential act of \nterror and a foreign person. And that is\n\n[[Page S10426]]\n\nbasically the same rationale that exists with respect to the rationale \nfor the original FISA law and warrants authorized thereunder.\n  By adding to the definition of ``foreign power,'' a ``foreign \nperson,'' ``a foreign person,'' you include the kind of case Moussaoui \npresented to us where we knew we wanted to look into his affairs. We \ncould not do so under FISA because we couldn't connect him to a foreign \npower or terrorist organization, and yet as the facts definitely \nindicated, it was somebody we should have been able to, whose computer \nwe should have been able to search prior to September 11.\n  Let me be a little more specific about this case because there are \nthose who will wonder whether or not maybe we are opening the FISA \nstatute up to potential abuse of American citizens--the answer to that \nis no--by our definition, or that guests of the United States, foreign \npersons who were here on, let's say, a nonimmigrant visa, such as \nMoussaoui--that maybe their rights would be violated. I want to make it \nclear that that would not be the case.\n  We are familiar with the FBI special agent from Minneapolis, Coleen \nRowley, who wrote the famous memo relating to Zacarias Moussaoui. She \ntestified before the Intelligence and Judiciary Committees that she \nbelieved this kind of additional authority not only was warranted but \nwas necessary for people like her in the field offices to do their work \nand she did not believe that would raise any additional questions; that \nit was an essential part of the tools the individuals in her position \nwould need.\n  Director Mueller of the FBI, as well, indicated in testimony that he \nbelieved the current limited foreign power definition would have made \nit difficult for the FBI to secure a FISA warrant against any of the \nSeptember 11 hijackers. And in fact he noted to the committee:\n\n       Prior to September 11, of the 19 or 20 hijackers, we had \n     very little information as to any one of the individuals \n     being associated with a particular terrorist group.\n\n  So what this amendment does is deal with two situations. The first is \nwhere you literally have the lone wolf, a terrorist acting on his or \nher own behalf unconnected to an international terrorist organization \nor foreign power but who is a foreign person in this country planning \nto commit an act of terrorism against Americans. That is exactly what \nthe FISA warrants are supposed to be getting at or are supposed to \nenable us to collect information on. Yet under the current statute that \nwould not be possible. This solves the lone wolf problem.\n  It also solves the Moussaoui problem, which is the case of an \nindividual who you think is associated with terrorists but you cannot \nprove that, but you definitely have the probable cause to think there \nis an act of terror being planned and, therefore, you seek the warrant. \nIt would be authorized under the foreign persons provision we are \nadding, and you then could connect the individual to an international \nterrorist organization or foreign power. That is what eventually \noccurred with respect to Moussaoui.\n  The point is, we are no longer just looking at the FISA warrant to \nprosecute someone for a crime that has been committed. The entire \neffort of the Congress, the intelligence community, and the \nadministration after September 11 was to add a mission as a superior \nmission to the law enforcement after-the-fact-prosecution-of-crime \nmission of the FBI, and that new mission was to try to prevent or \npreempt crimes from occurring in the first instance. So the FBI has \nbeen reorganized to go out and seek information on potential terrorists \nand be able to prevent the terrorist attack before it occurs.\n\n  If it occurs, they can still do the second function, which is to \nprosecute after the fact. But the first object of the game is to \nprevent it from happening in the first place. That is the way they have \nbeen reorganized.\n  What they are now going to try to do is, using statutes such as the \nFISA statute, to uncover information with respect to people about to \ncommit acts of terror and stop it from occurring. But without the \nchange in the Schumer-Kyl bill, we are leaving one great big loophole \navailable to the terrorists. That is the terrorist who is either acting \non his own or the terrorist who, while acting on behalf of an \ninternational terrorist organization or state, has not yet clearly \nsignalled that to our law enforcement officials to the point that we \ncan succeed in getting a FISA warrant.\n  Our change will enable us to get the warrant and then tie the \nindividual to the international terrorist organization or foreign \nstate, if that, in fact, is the state of information.\n  Let me go on with respect to the Moussaoui case to illustrate how \nthis would work. The agent from the Minneapolis FBI office described to \nthe Judiciary and Intelligence Committees how that office opened the \ninvestigation of Moussaoui on August 15, 2001. The dates are very \nimportant. This was a month before the attack on the World Trade Center \nand the Pentagon. The Minneapolis agents arrested Moussaoui on \nimmigration charges at that time and applied for a FISA warrant to \nsearch his belongings.\n  But as the FBI's deputy general counsel stated before the two \ncommittees, although Moussaoui was found to have some association with \nChechen terrorists, the evidence was inadequate to show that he served \nas an agent of that group or that he had any links whatsoever to al-\nQaida.\n  So as the FBI deputy general counsel confirmed, it was the strength \nof Moussaoui's connection to the Chechens, not a misunderstanding of \nwhether they constituted a recognized foreign power for FISA purposes, \nas the Washington Post originally suggested, that ultimately prevented \nthe issuance of a warrant. As a result, for 3 weeks prior to the \nSeptember 11 attack, the FBI was unable to search Moussaoui's computer \nor his papers.\n  After the trade center and Pentagon attacks, and largely because of \nthem, the FBI received a criminal warrant to search Moussaoui. Among \nother things, the information in his effects linked him to two of the \nactual hijackers and to a high-level organizer of the attacks recently \narrested in Pakistan.\n  Nobody can say whether this information necessarily would have \nallowed us to stop the September 11 conspiracy. But everyone would \nagree that access to this information would have been very helpful and \ncould have enabled us to do more than we did. Once they had evidence \nthat he was involved in international terrorism, the full FISA tools \nwould have been available to them, regardless of whether they could be \nlinked to a particular group. But instead, the outdated and unnecessary \nrequirement in the statute to link him to a specific international \ngroup prevented the FBI agents from pursuing what turned out to be the \nvery best lead they had prior to the September 11 attacks.\n  We have looked into this. We have had several people testify before \nour committee on behalf of the administration in support of this three-\nword change to the FISA statute. Yet it has been very difficult for us \nto get action.\n  It is true that the legislation has not been marked up in the \nJudiciary Committee, but, frankly, the chairman has not afforded us \nthat opportunity. Notwithstanding the fact that we have had testimony \nin several different hearings of two different committees, we have not \nbeen able to get the bill as a freestanding bill to the floor for \nconsideration by the Senate.\n\n  There is an opportunity for us to attach it as an amendment. As I \nsaid, the best opportunity is the authorization bill of the \nintelligence community. This is the perfect opportunity for us to do \nso.\n  There will be those who will say the bill has not gone through the \nregular order of the committees and, therefore, it should not be \nincluded on the authorization bill of the intelligence community.\n  The response to that is twofold: First of all, at this stage in the \nsession, in these last few days, we will see hundreds of bills come \nthrough here, hotlined--the phrase we use--bills that will be put at \nthe desk. Members will be asked whether they have any objection to \nthese bills. If there are no objections, they will pass by unanimous \nconsent bills that never saw a markup in committee. Some legislation \nwill be brought over from the House of Representatives that was not \neven considered in a hearing in a Senate committee. That is the way at \nthe end of the session a lot of legislation is dealt with. There would \nbe no reason for\n\n[[Page S10427]]\n\nsomething such as this not to be dealt with in the same way.\n  The second reason I submit is, we are in a war. Certainly we should \nnot put form above substance in these circumstances. If we all agree \nthat it makes sense to do what the FBI and the Justice Department and \nthe intelligence community are asking for--to add three words to the \nFISA statute so that we don't have another case like the Moussaoui \ncase, so that we are able to look at the effects of someone who we \nbelieve is engaged in terrorism against Americans or is planning to be \nengaged in it, even though we can't connect them yet to a specific \nterrorist organization--if we believe that that is a good thing, then \nwe should find the very first legislative vehicle we can to attach this \namendment in order to effect that change.\n  Time is very short. We will have to get it over to the House of \nRepresentatives, which will have to act in the same truncated fashion \nin order to send the bill to the President. We can do that if it is \npart of the intelligence authorization conference report because both \nbodies can approve the legislation at the same time and have it sent to \nthe President and signed in a matter of days. So this is the best \nopportunity for us to do that--unless we are going to put form over \nsubstance.\n  Let me make this sober point. A lot of our colleagues have pointed \nfingers at different people in the intelligence community. They have \ncriticized procedures and policies of the intelligence community, and \nby that I mean our law enforcement community has been criticized, even \nby name.\n  It has been said there was a massive intelligence failure prior to \nSeptember 11. I am part of a joint investigative committee looking into \nthe events from an Senate Intelligence Committee standpoint--events \nprior to September 11--as a member of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  Almost every one of us has spoken at one time or another about what \nwe believe were defects in the way our law enforcement and intelligence \ncommunity approached events prior to September 11. There has been \nenough information uncovered by now to know that things could have been \ndone better. A lot of different people could have done better than they \ndid.\n  Could we have prevented September 11? Nobody has gone that far. We \ncould have come a lot closer. The Zacarias Moussaoui case is a good \nexample of it. Today, we are in a situation where the Moussaoui kind of \ncase could easily be replicated tomorrow. It could be the situation \nthat is underway right now. It could be that someone such as this plans \nan attack and, God forbid, even carries out an attack, and later people \nare going to ask the question: What could we have done about that?\n  If we don't find a way to make this change now, in the last very few \ndays of this legislative session, we are going to be passing up an \nopportunity to save American lives. We would not be able to look at \nourselves in the mirror if something similar to this happened again and \nwe had failed to make this change. It is certainly not a preposterous \nthought that it could happen. It has already happened.\n  Our law enforcement community and intelligence community have told us \nthis is a problem in today's environment. It is no longer the cold war, \nwhere you were just dealing with the Soviet Union or the Red Brigade. \nYou are dealing now with people who have very loose affiliations--if \nany at all--but they are still terrorists. Our law didn't contemplate \nthat when it was written. So now we have to fix the law.\n  There is no reason not to make this change. Violate American civil \nrights? No. By its definition, it only applies to foreign persons. It \ncannot possibly violate the constitutional rights of any American--by \nits definition, it cannot.\n  Are we concerned about the constitutional rights of a non-American?\n  Now, non-Americans do have certain rights in this country, but they \ndo not have the right of the fourth amendment search and seizure \nprohibitions in the context of a statute such as the FISA statute, \nwhich has been upheld as constitutional.\n  So as long as there is the foreign nexus there, and you are not \ntalking about a U.S. citizen, again, it is impossible to be violating \nsomebody's rights. The warrant request still has to be made to a judge. \nThe judge still has to sign off on it. You still have to have the \nevidence backing up your belief that the individual is planning to or \nis in the act of engaging in an act of terror. So this isn't just some \ntwo-bit street criminal you are talking about. It has to be somebody on \nwhom you have some evidence with respect to terrorism. It has to be a \nforeign person. If that person is in the United States, and if the \nterrorist act is focused on Americans, then you should have the right \nunder the FISA statute to look further.\n\n  That is all this statute does. It enables you to go to a judge and \nsay: Judge, will you please issue a warrant so that we can open up this \nguy's computer and see whether he really is engaged in an act of \nterrorism against American citizens?\n  That is what we are talking about, and it is all we are talking \nabout. I just ask any Member of this body who disagrees with me to \nplease come down here, if not tonight, then tomorrow or the next day or \napproach me in the hallway or call my office and tell me why they would \nnot support us.\n  What I don't want to happen is that there is some anonymous \nobjection--a so-called hold--put on the bill, so that I have to try to \ntrack down who it is who anonymously objects to what we are trying to \ndo. This is too important for the sake of America's security.\n  By the way, I have no idea that any one of my colleagues necessarily \nobjects to what I am trying to accomplish. But what I am saying is that \nwe don't have time now to fool around with this and go through the \ndelays that sometimes accompany the consideration of legislation toward \nthe end of a session. I need to know who, if anyone, really does have \nan objection so I can meet with that individual and try to assure her \nor him that there is no problem with this piece of legislation.\n  It has been vetted by the administration. The administration supports \nit. It has the support of those who have testified before our \ncommittees. The Office of Legal Counsel has confirmed that the \namendment is well within the Constitution. I will quote that in a \nmoment.\n  So if there is any objection, we need to know what it is. We intend \nto include it in the Intelligence Committee authorization bill, and, \nobviously, that is a bill that must pass the Senate and the House. We \ndon't want it to be held up because of somebody's concern about our \nparticular amendment.\n  With regard to this question of constitutionality, I direct your \nattention to a July 31, 2002, letter presenting the views of the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice on S. 2586. It announces the Department's support \nfor the bill and provides ``a detailed analysis of the relevant fourth \namendment case law in support of the Department's conclusion that the \nbill would satisfy constitutional requirements.''\n  So there is no reason for anyone to object to the bill on \nconstitutional grounds, and, obviously, I can see no other grounds on \nwhich anyone would raise any questions. The Department of Justice, in \nparticular, emphasized that ``anybody monitored pursuant to the bill \nwould be someone who, at the very least, is involved in terrorist acts \nthat transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they \nare accomplished, the persons they appear intended to coerce or \nintimidate, or the locale in which the perpetrators operate or seek \nasylum''--50 U.S.C., section 1801(c)(3).\n  As a result, the Department says:\n\n       A FISA warrant would still be limited to collecting forward \n     intelligence for the international responsibilities of the \n     United States and the duties of the Federal Government to the \n     States in matters involving foreign terrorists.\n\n  That is the test supplied by U.S. v. Duggan, a Second Circuit case, \n1984, which presents the relevant test. Therefore:\n\n       The same interests and considerations that support the \n     constitutionality of FISA as it now stands would provide the \n     constitutional justification for S. 2568.\n\n  Mr. President, I think there is no question of constitutionality, \nthere is no question of need, and there is no question about the timing \nrequirement that we act now. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support \nthe Schumer-Kyl legislation to enable us to include it as part of the \nauthorization bill for our Intelligence Committee. If there is any \nquestion about whether or not their support would be there, bring that \nto\n\n[[Page S10428]]\n\nmy attention at the earliest moment so that we won't have an issue.\n  I have assured Senator Graham of Florida, chairman of the Select \nCommittee on Intelligence, of my commitment to ensure that the \nauthorization bill is passed and not to allow anything to interfere \nwith that. At the same time, it seems to me our proposal here is so \nrequired, so commonsense, so timely, that it is appropriate to include \nit in the legislation and that the burden should be on someone who \nobjects to demonstrate to us why they object, if in fact they do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks two documents: One is a Dear Colleague letter \ndated September 26, 2002, that was sent by Senator Schumer and I to our \ncolleagues that describes in some detail S. 2586; and the other \ndocument is a statement for the Record of Marion E. ``Spike'' Bowman, \nDeputy General Counsel, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, in \ntestimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, July 31, \n2002.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, let me note a little bit what the second \ndocument is, and then I will conclude. What the Deputy General Counsel \nof the FBI testified before our committee was how terrorism has changed \nfrom the time the FISA statute was first enacted to what we see today. \nLet me quote a little bit from his statement:\n\n       When FISA was enacted, terrorism was very different from \n     what we see today. In the 1970s, terrorism more often \n     targeted individuals, often carefully selected. This was the \n     usual pattern of the Japanese Red Army, the Red Brigades and \n     similar organizations listed by name in the legislative \n     history of FISA. Today we see terrorism far more lethal and \n     far more indiscriminate than could have been imagined in \n     1978. It takes only the events of September 11, 2001, to \n     fully comprehend the difference of a couple of decades. But \n     there is another difference as well. Where we once saw \n     terrorism formed solely around organized groups, today we \n     often see individuals willing to commit indiscriminate acts \n     of terror. It may be that these individuals are affiliated \n     with groups we do not see, but it may be that they are simply \n     radicals who desire to bring about destruction.\n\n  Mr. President, he goes on then to relate that to the legislation that \nSenator Schumer and I introduced. Let me quote a little more. What he \nsays is:\n\n       . . . we are increasingly seeing terrorist suspects who \n     appear to operate at a distance from these organizations. In \n     perhaps an oversimplification, but illustrative nevertheless, \n     what we see today are (1) agents of foreign powers in the \n     traditional sense who are associated with some organization \n     or discernible group (2) individuals who appear to have \n     connections with multiple terrorist organizations but who do \n     not appear to owe allegiance to any one of them, but rather \n     owe allegiance to the International Jihad movement----\n\n  Parenthetically, Mr. President, which is not a terrorist \norganization----\n       and (3) individuals who appear to be personally oriented \n     toward terrorism but with whom there is no known connection \n     to a foreign power.\n\n  Let me skip in the interest of time. Agent Bowman goes on to say:\n\n       During the decade-long Soviet/Afghan conflict, anywhere \n     from 10,000 to 25,000 Muslim fighters representing some \n     forty-three countries put aside substantial cultural \n     differences to fight alongside each other in Afghanistan. The \n     force drawing them together was the Islamic concept of \n     ``umma'' or Muslim community. In this concept, nationalism is \n     secondary to the Muslim community as a whole. As a result, \n     Muslims from disparate cultures trained together, formed \n     relationships, sometimes assembled in groups that otherwise \n     would have been at odds with one another and acquired common \n     ideologies. . . .\n       Following the withdrawal of the Soviet forces \n     in Afghanistan, many of these fighters returned to their \n     homelands, but they returned with new skills and dangerous \n     ideas. They now had newly-acquired terrorist training as \n     guerrilla warfare was the only way they could combat the \n     more advanced Soviet forces.\n\n  These are the forces that after the Soviets were defeated in \nAfghanistan became a force that coalesced around, among others, Osama \nbin Laden, but not all of them associated specifically with Bin Laden. \nI quote further:\n\n       Information from a variety of sources repeatedly carries \n     the theme from Islamic radicals that expresses the opinion \n     that we just don't get it. Terrorists world-wide speak of \n     jihad and wonder why the western world is focused on groups \n     rather than on concepts that make them a community.\n\n  This is the way we have organized our statutes. What he is telling us \nis we are not seeing it the way our enemies see it. They do not \norganize in groups. They do not have membership cards that say they are \na member of al-Qaida. They have coalesced around an idea, not a group.\n  The agent concludes this way:\n\n       The lesson to be taken from this is that al-Qaida is far \n     less a large organization than a facilitator, sometimes \n     orchestrator of Islamic militants around the globe. These \n     militants are linked by ideas and goals, not by \n     organizational structure.\n\n  He concludes by saying:\n\n       The United States and its allies, to include law \n     enforcement and intelligence components world-wide have had \n     an impact on the terrorists, but they are adapting to \n     changing circumstances. Speaking solely from an operational \n     perspective, investigation of these individuals who have no \n     clear connection to organized terrorism, or tenuous ties to \n     multiple organizations, is becoming increasingly difficult.\n       The current FISA statute has served the nation well, but \n     the International Jihad Movement demonstrates the need to \n     consider whether a different formulation is needed to address \n     the contemporary terrorist problem.\n\n  That is the end of that quotation, Mr. President. Of course, he and \nothers representing the Department of Justice went on to specifically \nendorse the Schumer-Kyl legislation to bring our current FISA statute \nup to date to conform to this new challenge about which Agent Bowan \ntestified. That is the change we are trying to make.\n  To wrap this up, there are three words we would add to the FISA \nstatute: ``or foreign person,'' so that if you can prove the terrorist \nis either a terrorist for an international terrorist organization or is \na terrorist for another state, a country, or is acting for himself ``or \nforeign person'' are the words we use--in other words, he is a \nterrorist and a foreign person--any one of those three circumstances \nenable you to go to the judge and say: Here is our evidence that this \nindividual is planning to engage in terrorism against people in the \nUnited States. Will you give us a warrant to search his computer, to \nsearch his personal effects, his home, or to put a wiretap on his \ntelephone, whatever the case might be? The judge will then make a \ndecision under the law, whether it is authorized or not.\n  If the court authorizes the issuance of the warrant, we can then look \nfurther to determine what this individual is seeking to do. We may find \nout it is an innocent situation or we may find out that the individual \nis just acting on his own but is a radical terrorist meaning to do harm \nto Americans or we may find, as in the case of Zacarias Moussaoui, that \nit turns out he is engaged as part of an international conspiracy with \na specific organization, in this case al-Qaida, but we do not know that \nand cannot prove it going in. That is why the change we seek is so \ncritical.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to support the inclusion of this amendment as \npart of the authorization bill for the intelligence community, and if \nthere is any problem that anybody sees, to bring it to our attention so \nwe can deal with that prior to that bill coming to the floor because we \ndo not want to slow that bill down or stop it from being considered \nfavorably on the Senate floor.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support our amendment. It is \nfor the good of the country, for our national security, and I say this \nin conclusion: If we fail to do this and it was our fault that someone \nutilized our legal system to plan an act of terror against Americans, \nand Americans are killed or injured as a result of our failure, then we \nwould have nobody but ourselves to blame.\n  I am going to try as hard as I can to get this done, but anyone who \nstands in the way is going to have to stand accountable if, God forbid, \nsomething should happen and we are unable to get this accomplished \nbefore we close our session.\n  I urge my colleagues to please support Senator Schumer and me in \nensuring we can get this important amendment accomplished before we \nadjourn for the year.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 26, 2002.\n       Dear Colleague: We have introduced S. 2586--the Schumer/Kyl \n     ``Moussaoui exception'' bill--as an amendment to the Homeland \n     Security bill. S. 2586 would amend the\n\n[[Page S10429]]\n\n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to reach any \n     foreign visitor to the United States who is believed to be \n     involved in international terrorism, regardless of whether \n     that person is known to be an agent of a foreign government \n     or terror group. The bill is designed to make it easier for \n     the FBI to monitor suspected lone-wolf terrorists such as \n     alleged 20th hijacker Zaccarias Moussaoui.\n       The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence held a hearing \n     on S. 2586 on July 31, 2002. The Department of Justice has \n     endorsed the bill in a Statement of Administration Policy, \n     which we have attached for your review. Below is our \n     explanation of the workings of the bill and an examination of \n     those facts that we believe show that this change is \n     necessary. We hope that you will join us in supporting this \n     important legislation.\n       The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act requires that in \n     order for a warrant to issue under that law, a court must \n     find probable cause to believe that the target of the warrant \n     is either an agent of, or is himself, a ``foreign power''--a \n     term that is currently defined to only include foreign \n     governments or international terrorist organizations. \n     Requiring a link to governments or established organizations \n     may have made sense when FISA was enacted in 1978; in that \n     year, the prototypical FISA target was a Soviet spy or a \n     member of one of the hierarchical, military-style terror \n     groups of that era, such as West Germany's Baader-Meinhof \n     gang or the Red Army Faction. Today, however, the United \n     States faces a much different threat. We are principally \n     confronted not by a specific group or government, but by a \n     movement. This movement--of Islamist extremists--does not \n     maintain a fixed structure or membership list, and its \n     adherents do not always advertise their affiliation with this \n     cause.\n       S. 2586 will help the United States to meet this threat by \n     expanding FISA's definition of ``foreign power.'' In addition \n     to governments and organized groups, that term, under the \n     bill, would also include ``any person, other than a United \n     States person, or group that is engaged in international \n     terrorism or activities in preparation therefor.'' With this \n     change, U.S. intelligence agents would be able to secure a \n     FISA warrant to monitor a foreign visitor to the United \n     States who is involved in international terrorism--even if \n     his links to foreign government or known terror groups remain \n     obscure.\n       The role of the foreign-power requirement in obstructing \n     pre-September 11 investigations of Zaccarias Moussaoui was \n     confirmed in dramatic testimony before the House and Senate \n     Intelligence Committees on Tuesday of this week. An agent \n     from the Minneapolis FBI office described to the Committees \n     how that office opened an investigation of Moussaoui on \n     August 15, 2001. Minneapolis agents arrested Moussaoui on \n     immigration charges and applied for a FISA warrant to search \n     his belongings. But as the FBI's Deputy General Counsel \n     stated on Tuesday before the Committees, although Moussaoui \n     was found to have some associations with Chechen terrorists, \n     the evidence was inadequate to show that he served as an \n     agent of that group--or that he had any links to Al Qaeda. \n     (Thus, as the FBI's Deputy General Counsel has confirmed, it \n     was the strength of Moussaoui's connection to the Chechens--\n     not a ``misunderstanding'' of whether the Chechens constitute \n     a ``recognized'' foreign power for FISA purposes, as \n     yesterday's Washington Post story suggested--that ultimately \n     prevented the issuance of a warrant.) As a result, for three \n     weeks prior to the September 11 attacks, the FBI was unable \n     to search Moussaoui's computer or his papers.\n       After the Trade Center and Pentagon attacks--and largely \n     because of them--the FBI received a criminal warrant to \n     search Moussaoui. Among other things, the information in his \n     effects linked Moussaoui to two of the actual hijackers, and \n     to a high-level organizer of the attacks who was recently \n     arrested in Pakistan.\n       No one can say whether this information would have allowed \n     the FBI to stop the September 11 conspiracy. But all must \n     agree that the FBI should have access to this information. \n     Once U.S. agents had evidence that Moussaoui was involved in \n     international terrorism, the full tools of FISA should have \n     been available to them--regardless of whether Moussaoui could \n     be linked to a particular group. Instead, this outdated and \n     unnecessary requirement blocked U.S. intelligence agents from \n     pursuing their best lead on the eve of the September 11 \n     attacks. Indeed, according to FBI Director Mueller, the \n     current standard probably would have prevented the FBI from \n     using FISA against any of the September 11 hijackers. As the \n     Director noted in his testimony before the Judiciary \n     Committee earlier this year, ``prior to September 11, [of] \n     the 19 or 20 hijackers, * * * we had very little information \n     as to any one of the individuals being associated with * * * \n     * a particular terrorist group.''\n       Several congressional Committees have now conducted \n     investigations and held hearings examining why our \n     intelligence services failed to prevent the September \n     attacks. Those hearings and investigations uncovered a \n     substantial defect in the current law--a defect that may have \n     prevented the United States from stopping that conspiracy, \n     and is likely to hinder future investigations. Simply put, \n     our laws are no longer suited to the type of threat that we \n     face. It is now incumbent on Congress to act on what it has \n     learned.\n       We hope that you will join us in supporting our ``Moussaoui \n     fix'' amendment to the Homeland Security bill, should a roll \n     call vote on that amendment be required.\n       If you have any questions, please contact Jim Flood in \n     Senator Schumer's office at 4-7425 or Joe Matal in Senator \n     Kyl's office at 4-6791.\n           Sincerely,\n     Charles Schumer.\n     Jon Kyl.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 31, 2002.\n     Hon. Bob Graham,\n     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,\n     Vice-Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Mr. Vice Chairman: The letter \n     presents the views of the Justice Department on S. 2586, a \n     bill ``[t]o exclude United States persons from the definition \n     of `foreign power' under the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 relating to international \n     terrorism.'' The bill would extend the coverage of the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (``FISA'') to \n     individuals who engage in international terrorism or \n     activities in preparation therefor without a showing of \n     membership in or affiliation with an international terrorist \n     group. The bill would limit this type of coverage to non-\n     United States persons. The Department of Justice supports S. \n     2586.\n       We note that the proposed title of the bill is potentially \n     misleading. The current title is ``To exclude United States \n     persons from the definition of `foreign power' under the \n     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 relating to \n     international terrorism.'' A better title, in keeping with \n     the function of the bill, would be something along the \n     following lines: ``To expand the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act of 1978 (`FISA') to reach individuals other \n     than United States persons who engage in international \n     terrorism without affiliation with an international terrorist \n     group.''\n       Additionally, we understand that a question has arisen as \n     to whether S. 2586 would satisfy constitutional requirements. \n     We believe that it would.\n       FISA allows a specially designated court to issue an order \n     approving an electronic surveillance or physical search, \n     where a significant purpose of the surveillance or search is \n     ``to obtain foreign intelligence information.'' Id \n     Sec. Sec. 1804(a)(7)(B), 1805(a). Given this purpose, the \n     court makes a determination about probable cause that differs \n     in some respects from the determination ordinarily underlying \n     a search warrant. The court need not find that there is \n     probable cause to believe that the surveillance or search, in \n     fact, will lead to foreign intelligence information, let \n     alone evidence of a crime, and in many instances need not \n     find probable cause to believe that the target has committed \n     a criminal act. The court instead determines, in the case of \n     electronic surveillance, whether there is probable cause to \n     believe that ``the target of the electronic surveillance is a \n     foreign power or an agent of a foreign power,'' id. \n     Sec. 1805(a)(3)(A), and that each of the places at which the \n     surveillance is directed ``is being used, or about to be \n     used, by a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power,'' \n     id. Sec. 1805(a)(3)(B). The court makes parallel \n     determinations in the case of a physical search. Id. \n     Sec. 1824(a)(3) (A), (B).\n       The terms ``foreign power'' and ``agent of a foreign \n     power'' are defined at some length, id. Sec. 1801(a), (b), \n     and specific parts of the definitions are especially \n     applicable to surveillances or searches aimed at collecting \n     intelligence about terrorism. As currently defined, ``foreign \n     power'' includes ``a group engaged in international terrorism \n     or activities in preparation therefor,'' id. Sec. 1801(a)(4) \n     (emphasis added), and an ``agent of a foreign power'' \n     includes any person who ``knowingly engages in sabotage or \n     international terrorism or activities that are in preparation \n     therefor, for or on behalf of a foreign power,'' id. \n     Sec. 1801(b)(2)(C). ``International terrorism'' is defined to \n     mean activities that\n       (1) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life \n     that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United \n     States or of any State, or that would be a criminal violation \n     if committed within the justification of the United States or \n     any State;\n       (2) appear to be intended--\n       (A) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population;\n       (B) to influence the policy of a government by intimidation \n     or coercion; or\n       (C) to affect the conduct of a government by assassination \n     or kidnapping; and\n       (3) occur totally outside the United States, or transcend \n     national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are \n     accomplished, the persons they appear intended to coerce or \n     intimidate, or the locale in which their perpetrators operate \n     or seek asylum.\n       Id. Sec. 1801(c).\n       S. 2586 would expand the definition of ``foreign power'' to \n     reach persons who are involved in activities defined as \n     ``international terrorism,'' even if these persons cannot be \n     shown to be agents of a ``group'' engaged in international \n     terrorism. To achieve this expansion, the bill would add the \n     following italicized words to the current definition of \n     ``foreign power'': ``any person other than a United States \n     person who is, or a group that is, engaged in international \n     terrorism or activities in preparation therefor.''\n       The courts repeatedly have upheld the constitutionality, \n     under the Fourth Amendment, of the FISA provisions that \n     permit\n\n[[Page S10430]]\n\n     issuance of an order based on probable cause to believe that \n     the target of a surveillance or search is a foreign power or \n     agent of a foreign power. The question posed by S. 2586 would \n     be whether the reasoning of those cases precludes expansion \n     of the term ``foreign power'' to include individual \n     international terrorists who are unconnected to a terrorist \n     group.\n       The Second Circuit's decision in United States v. Duggan, \n     743 F. 2d 59 (2d Cir. 1984), sets out the fullest explanation \n     of the ``governmental concerns'' that had led to the \n     enactment of the procedures in FISA. To identify these \n     concerns, the court first quoted from the Supreme Court's \n     decision in United States v. United States District Court, \n     407 U.S. 297, 308 (1972) (``Keith''), which addressed \n     ``domestic national security surveillance'' rather than \n     surveillance of foreign powers and their agents, but which \n     specified the particular difficulties in gathering ``security \n     intelligence'' that might justify departures from the usual \n     standards for warrants: ``[Such intelligence gathering] is \n     often long range and involves the interrelation of various \n     sources and types of information. The exact targets of such \n     surveillance may be more difficult to identify than in \n     surveillance operations against many types of crime specified \n     in Title III [dealing with electronic surveillance in \n     ordinary criminal cases]. Often, too, the emphasis of \n     domestic intelligence gathering is on the prevention of \n     unlawful activity or the enhancement of the government's \n     preparedness for some possible future crisis or emergency. \n     Thus the focus of domestic surveillance may be less precise \n     than that directed against more conventional types of \n     crime.'' Duggan, 743 F.2d at 72 (quoting Keith, 407 U.S. at \n     322). The Second Circuit then quoted a portion of the Senate \n     Committee Report on FISA. ``[The] reasonableness [of FISA \n     procedures] depends, in part, upon an assessment of the \n     difficulties of investigating activities planned, directed, \n     and supported from abroad by foreign intelligence services \n     and foreign-based terrorist groups. . . Other factors include \n     the international responsibilities of the United States, the \n     duties of the Federal Government to the States in matters \n     involving foreign terrorism, and the need to maintain the \n     secrecy of lawful counterintelligence sources and methods.'' \n     Id. at 73 (quoting S. Rep. No. 95-701, at 14-15, reprinted in \n     1978 (U.S.C.C.A.N. 3973, 3983) (``Senate Report''). The court \n     concluded:\n       ``Against this background, [FISA] requires that the FISA \n     Judge find probable cause to believe that the target is a \n     foreign power or an agent of a foreign power, and that the \n     place at which the surveillance is to be directed is being \n     used or is about to be used by a foreign power or an agent of \n     a foreign power; and it requires him to find that the \n     application meets the requirements of [FISA]. These \n     requirements make it reasonable to dispense with a \n     requirement that the FISA Judge find probable cause to \n     believe that surveillance will in fact lead to the gathering \n     of foreign intelligence information.''\n       Id. at 73. The court added that, a fortiori, it \n     ``reject[ed] defendants' argument that a FISA order may not \n     be issued consisted with the requirements of the Fourth \n     Amendment unless there is a showing of probable cause to \n     believe the target has committed a crime.'' Id. at n.5. See \n     also, e.g., United States v. Pelton, 835 F.2d 1067, 1075 (4th \n     Cir. 1987); United States v. Cavanagh, 807 F.2d 787, 790-91 \n     (9th Cir. 1987) (per then-Circuit Judge Kennedy); United \n     States v. Nicholson, 955 F. Supp. 588, 590-91 (E.D. Va. \n     1997).\n       We can conceive of a possible argument for distinguishing, \n     under the Fourth Amendment, the proposed definition of \n     ``foreign power'' from the definition approved by the courts \n     as the basis for a determination of probable cause under FISA \n     as now written. According to this argument, because the \n     proposed definition would require no tie to a terrorist \n     group, it would improperly allow the use of FISA where an \n     ordinary probable cause determination would be feasible and \n     appropriate--where a court could look at the activities of a \n     single individual without having to assess ``the \n     interrelation of various sources and types of information,'' \n     see Keith, 407 U.S. at 322, or relationships with foreign-\n     based groups, see Duggan, 743 F.2d at 73; where there need to \n     be no inexactitude in the target or focus of the \n     surveillance, see Keith, 407 U.S. at 322; and where the \n     international activities of the United States are less likely \n     to be implicated, see Duggan, 743 F.2d at 73. However, we \n     believe that this argument would not be well-founded.\n       The expanded definition shall would be limited to \n     collecting foreign intelligence for the ``international \n     responsibilities of the United States, [and] the duties of \n     the Federal Government to the States in matters involving \n     foreign terrorism.'' Id. at 73 (quoting Senate Report at 14). \n     The individuals covered by S. 2586 would not be United States \n     persons, and the ``international terrorism'' in which they \n     would be involved would continue to ``occur totally outside \n     the United States, to transcend national boundaries in terms \n     of the means by which they are accomplished, the persons they \n     appear intended to coerce or intimidate, or the locale in \n     which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum.'' 50 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1801(c)(3). These circumstances would implicate the \n     ``difficulties of investigating activities planned, directed, \n     and supported from abroad,'' just as current law implicates \n     such difficulties in the case of foreign intelligence \n     services and foreign-based terrorist groups. Duggan, 743 F.2d \n     at 73 (quoting Senate Report at 14). To overcome those \n     difficulties, a foreign intelligence investigation ``often \n     [will be] long range and involved[] the interrelation of \n     various sources and types of information.'' Id. at 72 \n     (quoting Keith, 407 U.S. at 322). This information frequently \n     will require special handling, as under the procedures of the \n     FISA court, because of ``the need to maintain the secrecy of \n     lawful counterintelligence sources and methods.'' Id. at 73 \n     (quoting Keith, 407 U.S. at 322). Furthermore, because in \n     foreign intelligence investigations under the expanded \n     definition ``[o]ften . . . the emphasis . . . [will be] on \n     the prevention of unlawful activity or the enhancement of the \n     government's preparedness for some possible future crisis or \n     emergency,'' the ``focus of . . . surveillance may be less \n     precise than that directed against more conventional types of \n     crime.'' Id. at 73 (quoting Keith, 407 U.S. at 322). \n     Therefore, the same interests and considerations that support \n     the constitutionality of FISA as it now stands would provide \n     the constitutional justification for the S. 2586.\n       Indeed, S. 2586 would add only a modest increment to the \n     existing coverage of the statute. As the House Committee \n     Report on FISA suggested, a ``group' of terrorist covered by \n     current law might be as small as two or three persons. H.R. \n     Rep. No. 95-1283, at pt. 1, 74 and n. 38 (1978). The interest \n     that the courts have found to justify the procedures of FISA \n     are not likely to differ appreciably as between a case \n     involving such a group of two or three persons and a case \n     involving a single terrorist.\n       The events of the past few months point to one other \n     consideration on which courts have not relied previously in \n     upholding FISA procedures--the extraordinary level of harm \n     that an international terrorist can do to our Nation. The \n     touchstone for the constitutionality of searches under the \n     Fourth Amendment is whether they are ``reasonable.'' As the \n     Supreme Court has discussed in the context of ``special needs \n     cases,'' whether a search is reasonable depends on whether \n     the government's interests outweigh any intrusion into \n     individual privacy interests. In light of the efforts of \n     international terrorists to obtain weapons of mass \n     destruction, it does not seem debatable that we could suffer \n     terrible injury at the hands of a terrorist whose ties to an \n     identified ``group'' remained obscure. Even in the criminal \n     context, the Court has recognized the need for flexibility is \n     cases of terrorism. See Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, \n     44 (2000) (``the Fourth Amendment would almost certainly \n     permit an appropriately tailored roadblock set up to thwart \n     an imminent terrorist attack''). Congress could legitimately \n     judge that even a single international terrorist, who intends \n     ``to intimidate or coerce a civilian population'' or ``to \n     influence the policy of a government by intimidation or \n     coercion'' or ``to affect the conduct of a government by \n     assassination or kidnapping,'' 50 U.S.C. Sec. 1801(c)(2), \n     acts with the power of a full terrorist group or foreign \n     nation and should be treated as a ``foreign power'' subject \n     to the procedures of FISA rather than those applicable to \n     warrants in criminal cases.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to present our views. Please \n     do not hesitate to call upon us if we may be additional \n     assistance. The Office of Management and Budget has advised \n     us that from the perspective of the Administration's program, \n     there is no objection to submission of this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Daniel J. Bryant,\n     Assistant Attorney General.\n                                  ____\n\n\n Statement for the Record of Marion E. (Spike) Bowman, Deputy General \n  Counsel, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Before the Senate Select \n                Committee on Intelligence, July 31, 2002\n\n       Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, thank you for \n     inviting me here today to testify on the legislative \n     proposals concerning the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance \n     Act (FISA). Holding this hearing demonstrates your collective \n     and individual commitment to improving the security of our \n     Nation. The Federal Bureau of Investigation greatly \n     appreciates your leadership, and that of your colleagues in \n     other committees on this very important topic.\n       The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was written more \n     than two decades ago. When adopted, the Act brought a degree \n     of closure to fifty years of discussion concerning \n     constitutional limits on the President's power to order \n     electronic surveillance for national security purposes. A \n     subsequent amendment brought physical search under the Act. \n     In keeping with our standards of public governance, the \n     proposals for the Act were publicly debated over a \n     substantial period of time, compromises were reached and a \n     statute eventually adopted. In the final analysis the \n     standards governing when and how foreign intelligence \n     surveillance or search would be conducted was a political one \n     because it involved weighting of important public policy \n     concerns surrounding both personal liberty and national \n     security. That is how it should be.\n       In the intervening years FISA has proved its worth on \n     countless occasions in preventing the occurrence or the \n     continuation of harm to the national security. It has been a \n     very effective tool and time has proved that this cooperative \n     effort of the three branches of government can serve to \n     protect the public without eroding civil liberties. Indeed, \n     the legislative history shows that Congress intended that the \n     Executive Branch\n\n[[Page S10431]]\n\n     keep a focus on civil liberties by giving great care and \n     scrutiny every application before it is presented to a judge. \n     We believe that intent has been fulfilled. The fact that an \n     Article III judge is the final arbiter of compliance serves \n     to give additional confidence to the public that the intent \n     of the statute is fulfilled.\n       When FISA was enacted, terrorism was very different from \n     what we see today. In the 1970s, terrorism more often \n     targeted individuals, often carefully selected. This was the \n     usual pattern of the Japanese Red Army, the Red Brigades and \n     similar organizations listed by name in the legislative \n     history of FISA. Today we see terrorism as far more lethal \n     and far more indiscriminate than could have been imagined in \n     1978. It takes only the events of September 11, 2001 to fully \n     comprehend the difference of a couple of decades. But there \n     is another difference as well. Where we once saw terrorism \n     formed solely around organized groups, today we often see \n     individuals willing to commit indiscriminate acts of terror. \n     It may be that these individuals are affiliated with groups \n     we do not see, but it may be that they are simply radicals \n     who desire to bring about destruction. That brings us to the \n     legislation being considered today.\n       The FBI uses investigative tools to try to prevent acts of \n     terrorism wherever we can, but particularly to prevent \n     terrorism directed at Americans or American interests. Most \n     of our investigations occur within the United States and, for \n     the most part, focus on individuals. Historically, terrorism \n     subjects of FBI investigation have been associated with \n     terrorist organizations. As a result, FBI has usually been \n     able to associate an individual with a terrorist organization \n     pled, for FISA purposes, as a foreign power. To a substantial \n     extent, that remains true today. However, we are increasingly \n     seeing terrorist suspects who appear to operate at a distance \n     from these organizations. In perhaps an oversimplification, \n     but illustrative nevertheless, what we see today are (1) \n     agents of foreign powers in the traditional sense who are \n     associated with some organization or discernible group, (2) \n     individuals who appear to have connections with multiple \n     terrorist organizations but who do not appear to owe \n     allegiance to any one of them, but rather owe allegiance to \n     the international Jihad movement and (3) individuals who \n     appear to be personally oriented toward terrorism but with \n     whom there is no known connection to a foreign power.\n       This phenomenon, which we have seen to be growing for the \n     past two or three years, appears to stem from a social \n     movement that began at some imprecise time, but certainly \n     more than a decade ago. It is a global phenomenon which the \n     FBI refers to as the International Jihad Movement. By way of \n     background we believe we can see the contemporary development \n     of this movement, and its focus on terrorism, rooted in the \n     Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.\n\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n       During the decade-long Soviet/Afghan conflict, anywhere \n     from 10,000 to 25,000 Muslim fighters representing some \n     forty-three countries put aside substantial cultural \n     differences to fight alongside each other in Afghanistan. The \n     force drawing them together was the Islamic concept of \n     ``umma'' or Muslim community. In this concept, nationalism is \n     secondary to the Muslim community as a whole. As a result, \n     Muslims from disparate cultures trained together, formed \n     relationships, sometimes assembled in groups that otherwise \n     would have been at odds with one another and acquired common \n     ideologies. They were also influenced by radical spiritual \n     and temporal leaders, one of whom has gained prominence on a \n     global scale--Usama Bin Liden.\n       Following the withdrawal of the Soviet forces from \n     Afghanistan, many of these fighters returned to their \n     homelands, but they returned with new skills and dangerous \n     ideas. They now had newly-acquired terrorist training as \n     guerrilla warfare was the only way they could combat the more \n     advanced Soviet forces. They also returned with new concepts \n     of community that had little to do with nationalism. Those \n     concepts of community fed naturally into opposition to the \n     adoption, and toleration, of western culture. As a result, \n     many of the Arab-Afghan returnees united, or reunited, with \n     indigenous radical Islamic groups they had left behind when \n     they went to Afghanistan. These Arab-Afghan mujahedin, \n     equipped with extensive weapons and explosives training, \n     infused radicals and already established terrorist groups, \n     resulting in the creation of significantly better trained and \n     more highly motivated cells dedicated to jihad.\n       Feeding the radical element was the social fact that this \n     occurred in nations where there was widespread poverty and \n     unemployment. The success of the Arab intervention in \n     Afghanistan was readily apparent, so when the Arab-Afghan \n     returnees came home they discovered populations of young \n     Muslims who increasingly were ready and even eager to view \n     radical Islam as the only viable means of improving \n     conditions in their countries. Seizing on widespread \n     dissatisfaction with regimes that were brimming with un-\n     Islamic ways, regimes that hosted foreign business and \n     foreign military, many young Muslim males became eager to \n     adopt the successful terrorist-related activities that had \n     been successfully used in Afghanistan in the name of \n     Islam. It was only a matter of time before these young \n     Muslin males began to seek out the military and explosives \n     training that the Arab-Afghan returnees possessed.\n\n\n                            usama bin laden\n\n       Usama bin Laden gained prominence during the Afghan war in \n     large measure for his logistical support to the resistance. \n     He financed recruitment, transportation and training of Arab \n     nations who volunteered to fight alongside the Afghan \n     mujahedin. The Afghan war was clearly a defining experience \n     in his life. In a May, 1996 interview with Time Magazine, UBL \n     stated: ``in our religion there is a special place in the \n     hereafter for those who participate in jihad. One day in \n     Afghanistan was like 1,000 days in an ordinary mosque.''\n       Although bin Laden was merely one leader among many during \n     the Soviet-Afghan conflict, he was a wealthy Saudi who fought \n     alongside the mujahedin. In consequence, his statute with the \n     fighters was high during the war and he continued to rise in \n     prominence such that, by 1998, he was able to announce a \n     ``fatwa'' (religious ruling) that would be respected by far-\n     flung Islamic radicals. In short, he stated that it is the \n     duty of all Muslims to kill Americans: ``in compliance with \n     God's order, we issue the following fatwa to all Muslims: the \n     ruling to kill the Americans and their allies, including \n     civilians and military, is the individual duty for every \n     Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible \n     to do it.''\n       Bin Laden was not alone in issuing this fatwa. It was \n     signed as well by a coalition of leading Islamic militants to \n     include Ayman Al-Zawahiri (at the time the leader of the \n     Egyptian Islamic Jihad), Abu Yasr Rifa'i Ahmad Taha (Islamic \n     Group leader) and Sheikh Fazl Ur Rahman (Harakat Ul Ansar \n     leader). The fawa was issued under the name of the \n     International Islamic Front for Jihad on the Jews and \n     Christians. This fawa was significant as it was the first \n     public call for attacks on Americans, both civilian and \n     military, and because it reflected a unified position among \n     recognized leaders in the radical Sunni Islamic community. In \n     essence, the fatwa reflected the globalization of radical \n     Islam.\n       There is a terrorist network of extremists that has been \n     evolving in the murky terrain of Southwest Asia that uses its \n     extremist views of Islam to justify terrorism. His \n     organization, al Qaeda is but one example of this network.\n\n\n                                al qaeda\n\n       Although Al-Qaeda functions independent of other terrorist \n     organizations, it also functions through some of the \n     terrorist organizations that operate under its umbrella or \n     with its support, including: the Al-Jihad, the Al-Gamma Al-\n     Islamiyya (Islamic Group--led by Sheik Omar Abdel Rahman and \n     later by Ahmed Refai Taha, a/k/a ``Abu Yasser al Masri,''), \n     Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and a number of jihad groups in other \n     countries, including the Sudan, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Yemen, \n     Somalia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bosnia, \n     Croatia, Albania, Algeria, Tunisia, Lebanon, the Philippines, \n     Tajikistan, Azerbaijan, the Kashmiri region of India, and the \n     Chechen region of Russia. Al-Qaeda also maintained cells and \n     personnel in a number of countries to facilitate its \n     activities, including in Kenya, Tanzania, the United Kingdom, \n     Canada, and the United States. By banding together, Al-Qaeda \n     proposed to work together against the perceived common \n     enemies in the West--particularly the United States which Al-\n     Qaeda regards as an ``infidel'' state which provides \n     essential support for other ``infidel'' governments. Al-Qaeda \n     responded to the presence of United States armed forces in \n     the Gulf and the arrest, conviction and imprisonment in the \n     United States of persons belonging to Al-Qaeda by issuing \n     fatwas indicating that attacks against U.S. interests, \n     domestic and foreign, civilian and military, were both proper \n     and necessary. Those fatwas resulted in attacks against U.S. \n     nationals in locations around the world including Somalia, \n     Kenya, Tanzania, Yemen, and now in the United States. Since \n     1993, thousands of people have died in those attacks.\n\n\n                           the training camps\n\n       With the globalization of radical Islam now well begun, the \n     next task was gain adherents and promote international jihad. \n     A major tool selected for this purpose was the promotion of \n     terrorism training camps that had long been established in \n     Afghanistan. It is important to note, that while terrorist \n     adherents to what we have come to know as al Qaeda trained in \n     the camps, many others did as well. For example, according to \n     the convicted terrorist Ahmed Ressam, representatives of the \n     Algerian Armed Islamic Group (GIA) and its off-shoot the \n     Salafi Groups for Call and Combat (GSPC), HAMAS, Hizballah, \n     the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ) and various other terrorists \n     trained at the camps.\n       Ressam also reports that cells were formed, dependent, in \n     part, on the timing of the arrival of the trainees, rather \n     than on any cohesive or pre-existing organizational \n     structure. As part of the training, cleric and other \n     authority figures advised the cells of the targets that are \n     deemed valid and proper. The training they received included \n     placing bombs in airports, attacks against U.S. military \n     installations, U.S. warships, embassies and business \n     interests of the United States and Israel. Specifically \n     included were hotels holding conferences of VIPs, military \n     barracks, petroleum targets and information/technology \n     centers. As part of the training, scenarios were developed \n     that included all of these targets.\n\n[[Page S10432]]\n\n       Ressam, who a not a member of al Qaeda, has stated that the \n     cells were independent, but were given lists of the types of \n     targets that were approved and were initiated into the \n     doctrine of the international Jihad. Ressam explicitly noted \n     that his own terrorism attack did not have bin Laden's \n     blessing or his money, but he believed it would have been \n     given had he asked for it. He did state that bin Laden urged \n     more operations within the United States.\n\n\n                        The International Jihad\n\n       We believe the suicide hijackers of September 11, 2001 \n     acted in support of the 1998 fatwa which, in turn describes \n     what we believe is the international jihad. During 1997 UBL \n     described the ``international jihad'' as follows:\n       ``The influence of the Afghan jihad on the Islamic world \n     was so great and it necessitates that people should rise \n     above many of their differences and unite their efforts \n     against their enemy. Today, the nation is interacting well by \n     uniting their efforts through jihad against the U.S. which \n     has in collaboration with the Israeli government led the \n     ferocious campaign against the Islamic world in occupying the \n     holy sites of the Muslims. . . . [A]ny act of aggression \n     against any of this land of a span of the hand measure makes \n     it a duty for Muslims to send a sufficient number of their \n     sons to fight off that aggression.''\n       In May of 1988, UBL gave an interview in which he stated \n     ``God willing, you will see our work on the news. . . .'' The \n     following August the East African embassy bombings occurred. \n     That was bin Laden speaking, but it should be remembered that \n     the call to harm America is not limited to al Qaeda. Shortly \n     after September 11 Mullah Omar said ``the plan [to destroy \n     America] is going ahead and God willing it is being \n     implemented. . . .'' Sheikh Ikrama Sabri, a Palestinian \n     Mufti, said in a radio sermon in 1997, ``Oh Allah, destroy \n     America, her agents, and her allies! Cast them into their own \n     traps, and cover the White House with black! '' Ali \n     Khameine'i, in 1998, said ``The American regime is the enemy \n     of [Iran's] Islamic government and our revolution.'' There \n     are many other examples, but the lesson to be drawn is that \n     al Qaeda is but one faction of a larger and very amorphous \n     radical anti-western network that uses al Qaeda members as \n     well as others sympathetic to al Qaeda's ideas or that share \n     common hatreds.\n       Information from a variety of sources repeatedly carries \n     the theme from Islamic radicals that expresses the opinion \n     that we just don't get it. Terrorists world-wide speak of \n     jihad and wonder why the western world is focused on groups \n     rather than on the concepts that make them a community. One \n     place to look at the phenomenon of the ``international \n     jihad'' is the web. Like many other groups, Muslim extremists \n     have found the Internet to be a convenient tool for spreading \n     propaganda and helpful hints for their followers around the \n     world. Web sites calling for jihad, or holy war, against the \n     West are not uncommon.\n       One of the larger jihad-related Internet offers primers \n     including ``How Can I Train Myself for Jihad.'' Traffic on \n     this site, which is available in more than a dozen languages, \n     increased 10-fold following the attacks, according to a \n     spokesman for the site.\n       The lesson to be taken from this is that al Qaeda is far \n     less a large organization than a facilitator, sometimes \n     orchestrator, of Islamic militants around the globe. These \n     militants are linked by ideas and goals, not be \n     organizational structure. The intent is establishment of a \n     state, or states ruled by Islamic law and free of western \n     influence. Bin Laden's contribution to the Islamic jihad is a \n     creature of the modern world. He has spawned a global network \n     of individuals with common, radical ideas, kept alive through \n     modern communications and sustained through forged documents \n     and money laundering activities on a global scale. While some \n     may consider extremist Islam to be in retreat at the moment, \n     its roots run deep and exceedingly wide. Those roots take \n     many forms, one of which is the focus of this hearing.\n       In the final analysis, the International Jihad movement is \n     comprised of dedicated individuals committed to establishing \n     the umma through terrorist means. Many of these are persons \n     who attended university together, trained in the camps \n     together, traveled together. Al Qaeda and the international \n     terrorists remain focused on the United States as their \n     primary target. The United States and its allies, to include \n     law enforcement and intelligence components worldwide have \n     had an impact on the terrorists, but they are adapting to \n     changing circumstances. Speaking solely from an operational \n     perspective, investigation of these individuals who have no \n     clear connection to organized terrorism, or tenuous ties to \n     multiple organizations, is becoming increasingly difficult.\n       The current FISA statute has served the nation well, but \n     the International Jihad Movement demonstrates the need to \n     consider whether a different formulation is needed to address \n     the contemporary terrorism problem. While I cannot discuss \n     specific cases in a public hearing, the FBI has encountered \n     individuals who cannot be sufficiently linked to a terrorist \n     group or organization as required by FISA. The FBI greatly \n     appreciates the Committee's consideration of this issue and \n     looks forward to working with the Committee to find the best \n     approach for appropriate investigation of such individuals.\n\n  Mr. KYL.

Joy was born in Springfield, MA, and graduated from the \nUniversity of Massachusetts. After two years of civilian service in the \nUnited States Air Force, Mrs. Joy began her career with the United \nStates Department of Justice. Beginning as a Staff Assistant, she \nsuccessfully worked through the ranks and is presently a program \nmanager responsible for reviewing judicial appointments in the Office \nof Policy Development. she has made great strides to ensure United \nStates judges are fairly appointed to the bench, and I am honored to \nhave had the opportunity to work so closely with here.\n  The Department of Justice is a better organization because of Mrs. \nJoy's hard work, and she can take great pride in all she has \naccomplished during her tenure. She is to be commended for her \nintegrity, dedication, and fairness in reviewing judicial appointments. \nMrs. Joy has been an outstanding model of excellence to the numerous \nmen and women she has worked with during her thirty five years with the \nDepartment of Justice, and I am certain she will continue to set a fine \nexample for others to follow as she continues her career. She is an \nexcellent asset to the American justice system, and I applaud her for \nthe positive impact she had made.\n  It has been a privilege to have worked with such an outstanding lady. \nAgain, I want to thank Mrs. Joy for all of her tireless efforts and for \nthe friendship she has provided me during our many years of working \ntogether. I wish Mrs. Joy and her three lovely children the best of \nluck in all future endeavors, and may the years to come bring good \nhealth and happiness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10432-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10432-S10433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MASSACHUSETTS MEMORIAL SERVICE\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to join all of you, the \nfamilies of loved ones from across our Commonwealth who lost their \nlives last September 11.\n  We come to this birthplace of liberty to remember, to give honor, and \nto express our resolve.\n  All around us in this historic place are the images of famous leaders \nwho brought life and nationhood to the ideals that were attacked a year \nago, on a day whose dawn had seemed almost uniquely American in its \nsunny optimism.\n  Etched on the wall around this stage are the names of heroes who gave \ntheir lives for our country on September 11, 2001. The list is \nheartbreaking, and it goes on and on. These heroes were famous in a \ndifferent way, famous to their friends for their fabled jumpshot in a \nneighborhood park, or prized in their firms for a brilliance tempered \nby laughter, or celebrated by their young children as super-heroes, \nable to launch them into the air with an easy toss, and always there to \ncatch them. They expected to pass the ball again, to make another trade \nor tell another joke, to come home that night and read a bedtime story.\n  Then they were gone, in the darkness at mid-morning which succeeded \nthat sunny dawn. We mourn them for the years that were too few and the \nhopes that were unfulfilled. We praise them for the way they lived, and \nin so many cases for the bravery in the way they\n\n[[Page S10433]]\n\ndied. And we as a country, as a community, as friends and neighbors and \nfamily, hold them in our hearts.\n  I spoke with a member of almost every family in Massachusetts who \nlost a loved one on the planes, or at Ground Zero in New York, or at \nthe Pentagon. To those left behind, I say on this sad day: I know \nsomething of what you feel. To lose someone you love, and to lose them \nso suddenly, so unexpectedly, so terribly, to see them torn out of the \nfabric of life, is almost more than one can bear.\n  And then, although we know the passage of a year cannot heal that \nmemory, we move on, because we have to, because they would want us to, \nand because there is still light left in the world, including the love \nthey left us.\n  In a different time of grief, my brother Robert Kennedy quoted the \nancient poet Aeschylus: ``In our sleep, pain, which cannot forget, \nfalls drop by drop upon the heart until, in our own despair, against \nour will, comes wisdom through the awful grace of God.''\n  May God, this year and every year and every day, grant that grace to \nyou the families.\n  And for all of us, there is something else that comes from last \nSeptember 11. From the pain that day have come both wisdom and will.\n  We have learned anew the wisdom that as Americans, we are many, but \nwe are also one.\n  On Flight 93, there was a unity of purpose and a fierce pride. \nPassengers who had never met before became a band of brothers and \nsisters, sacrificing their lives so that others might live. Many other \nindividual acts of courage saved more lives than we can know or count \nat Ground Zero and the Pentagon.\n  People all across the country and of all ages asked what they could \ndo, from giving their blood, to clearing rubble at the World Trade \nCenter, to giving their dollars, to lending a shoulder to their \nneighbor to cry on. In countless ways, we came together, and founded a \nnew American spirit of service to others.\n  The terrorists taught us a lesson different from the one they \nexpected. They acted with hate, but we reached out to comfort and \nsupport one another with love. No one asked whether the rescuer leading \nthem down the packed stairwell of the World Trade Center was rich or \npoor, Anglo or African-American or Hispanic, gay or straight. We gained \na new determination as Americans to reject discrimination in all its \nhateful forms.\n  Out of the pain that day, Americans understood more powerfully than \nperhaps ever before the pledge of ``liberty and justice for all.''\n\n     To help those in need;\n     To give hope;\n     To share what we have;\n     To see suffering and try to heal it--\n\n  That is our lesson from this tragedy, and it is wisdom that must \nguide us over time. The new American spirit of service can and must \nbecome a new era of commitment to the ideals of compassion, equality, \nopportunity, and concern for one another. We as a society seek to save \na life when a terrorist strikes, and we as a society must do as much \nwhen the terror or a dread disease strikes, or the terror of poverty \nsteals opportunity.\n  May that legacy of 9/11, that legacy of love and compassion and \ncaring, become our enduring tribute to all those who were lost.\n  Out of that day also came a new sense of national resolve and will. \nWe are at war today, with a terrorism that has plagued too many places \nfor too many years, and that has finally struck at the heart of \nAmerica.\n  This is a conflict we did not seek, but must win, not alone for \nourselves, but for the cause of freedom, tolerance and human rights \naround the world.\n  The ideas and ideals created long ago in this great hall have shaped \nthe dreams of countless millions yearning to be free.\n  Now, as the greatest power on earth, we have a responsibility. Our \ngifts of strength and wealth and values can decide that the future will \nbelong to the forces of hope and onto of hate.\n  This brighter future depends on victory against terrorism. It demands \nthat we then continue in a long, tireless endeavor to make the world \nnot only safer for us, but better for all. In our determination to \ndefeat those who have attacked our people and our principles, we truly \nare ``one nation under God, indivisible.''\n  How true that was, how deeply we felt it, a year ago today. Together \nthat day, we hurt and feared and hoped and prayed. And together now, we \nwill prevail.\n  God bless all who were lost and all who lost them. God give us \nstrength, and the wisdom to use it well. God bless America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10433-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR FRED THOMPSON\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Tennessee \nSenator Fred Thompson, a stalwart conservative with a long and colorful \ncareer in both the private and public sectors. Senator Thompson has \nalways been a vocal and active proponent of reducing the role of the \nfederal government, lowering the tax burden on Americans and allowing \nindividuals the freedom to make their own choices. His remarkable rise \nto a position of influence among his fellow lawmakers is a testament to \nthe passion of his beliefs. Senator Thompson has been a valuable member \nof the Senate, and his presence will be missed when he retires at the \nend of the 107th Congress. I would like to take this opportunity to \ncommend my fellow Southern colleague for his dedicated work on behalf \nof the people of Tennessee and wish him the best of luck as he leaves \nthe Senate.\n  Born in my home state of Alabama, Senator Thompson grew up in \nLawrenceburg, TN. He worked his way through undergraduate school at \nMemphis State University and then law school at Vanderbilt. Two years \nlater, he was named an Assistant United States Attorney in Nashville, \nwhere his outstanding record brought him to the attention of then \nSenator Howard Baker, who tapped him to be the minority counsel to the \nSenate Watergate Committee. Following two years on the Committee, \nSenator Thompson continued his high profile law career when he was \nappointed by incoming Governor Lamar Alexander to investigate outgoing \nGovernor Ray Blanton. Senator Thompson added to his growing reputation \nby uncovering a cash for clemency scheme that ultimately sent Governor \nBlanton to jail. Over the next several years, Senator Thompson \ncontinued to practice law in Nashville and in Washington. He also \ncontinued his work with Congress, working as Special Counsel to the \nSenate Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  With an open election looming to fill the last two years of former \nSen. Al Gore's term in 1994, Senator Thompson decided to enter the \nrace. He championed his Tennessee roots, conservative values and desire \nto reform the Federal Government. His message resonated with the \nvoters, who overwhelmingly supported him in the general election in \n1994. In 1996, Senator Thompson was elected to a full term in the \nSenate, receiving more votes than any previous candidate for any office \nin Tennessee history.\n  Since joining the Senate, Senator Thompson has tirelessly worked to \npromote his conservative values. A fierce critic of federal \nbureaucracy, he has introduced legislation and held hearings aimed at \nproducing a smaller, more efficient, and more accountable government. \nThrough his work on the Finance Committee, he has focused his energy on \nreducing taxes, reforming the tax code and restoring Social Security \nand Medicare programs to long-term solvency. Admirably, he has always \nremained thoroughly independent and committed to his beliefs.\n  I have truly enjoyed working with Senator Thompson here in the \nSenate. He is a tremendous asset to the people of Tennessee and \nvaluable member of the Republican party. I thank him for his many years \nof service and wish him the best in all future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10433-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10433-S10434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SOMALIA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I wish to express my strong \nsupport for the efforts underway to establish clear systems for \neffective regulation and monitoring of Somali remittance companies. \nRight now, the United Nations Development Program is working to build \nthe capacity of the Somali financial sector and to bring Somalis \ntogether with key stakeholders in the international banking community \nso that clear expectations, shared high\n\n[[Page S10434]]\n\nstandards, and meaningful enforcement mechanisms can be established. \nSomali remittance companies can survive, and can contribute the \ndevelopment of the Somali people, only if this effort is successful. I \napplaud this undertaking, and believe that the United States should \nprovide assistance where appropriate.\n  As the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee's \nSubcommittee on African Affairs, I held a hearing on U.S. policy \noptions in Somalia earlier this year. In the wake of the attacks on \nSeptember 11, I wanted to explore the issue of weak states, where \nmanifestations of lawlessness such as piracy, illicit air transport \nnetworks, and traffic in arms and gemstones and people, can make the \nregion attractive to terrorists and international criminals. The United \nStates can no longer pretend that we have no stake in the fate of \ncountries in distress--the Afghanistans and Somalias of our world, and \nthe United States can no longer pretend that we can insulate ourselves \nfrom the difficult problems confronting those countries. We cannot \nignore them, we cannot simply condemn them. We must work to strengthen \nstate capacity and curtail opportunities for terrorists and other \ninternational criminals.\n  It is my intention to introduce legislation at the beginning of the \n108th Congress aimed at focusing more coordinated and consistent \nattention on Somalia. The U.S. must work harder at providing an \nalternative to the extremist influences in Somalia by vigorously \npursuing small-scale health and education initiatives. And we must help \nSomalia's surprisingly vigorous private sector, to begin building \nregulated, legitimate financial institutions in Somalia, which will be \nessential to any economic recovery in the country in the future. \nOtherwise, we leave it to illegitimate, shadowy forces to step into the \nbreach.\n  One has only to meet a few of the many dynamic and committed Somalis \nwho are working every day to build a better future for their countrymen \nto conclude that Somalia is not hopeless. But helping to rebuild \ncapacity in Somalia will certainly not be easy. These efforts are \nimportant, and they deserve our attention and our support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10434-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred in February \n2000 in Tucson, AZ. A gay man was beaten outside a bar. The assailant, \nFranchot Opela, 27, called the victim, Fabian Padilla, 23, a ``faggot'' \nand then beat Padilla to the ground with both fists. Padilla was \ntreated for severe eye and head injuries resulting from the attack.\n  I believe that Government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10434-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SUPPORT OF S. 1739\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today in support of legislation \nintroduced by Senator Cleland, S. 1739, which seeks to improve security \non motorcoaches and over-the-road buses nationwide. I became a \ncosponsor of S. 1739 in the wake of a September 30 attack in which two \npeople were killed and more than two dozen others injured after a \nGreyhound bus skidded off a California highway. The bus driver had been \nstabbed in the throat by a passenger.\n  While it quickly became known that the incident had no links to \nterrorism, it served as a stark reminder that a significant part of \nAmerica's transportation network remains vulnerable to attack. Every \nyear, motorcoaches and over-the-road buses carried an estimated 800 \nmillion passengers to 4,000 communities nationwide, far in excess of \nthe passenger load carried by the airlines or Amtrak.\n  I believe that it is vitally important that we address bus security \nconcerns highlighted by the recent attack. A critical component in our \nfight against terrorism is protecting the security of our \ntransportation system, including buses. We have to assume that any \nfacet of our transportation system remains a target for violence. \nTerrorists in Israel have targeted buses with deadly effectiveness. So \nwe have to take steps, like S. 1739, which will move us toward a more \nsecure system across every mode of transportation and across our \ntransportation infrastructure.\n  S. 1739 provides funding to the motorcoach industry to enhance \nsecurity at a time when improved security is increasingly necessary but \nwhen the industry is least able to make new investments. Other forms of \ncommercial passenger transportation including Amtrak, the airline and \ntransit agencies have all received sizeable funding commitments from \nCongress for security upgrades, and the motorcoach industry should not \nbe ignored when it comes to safety.\n  Specifically, this bipartisan legislation provides $400 million in \ngrants to be made by the Secretary of the Treasury for over-the-road \nbus transportation security. The grants must be used for specified \nsystem-wide security upgrades, including the reimbursement of security-\nrelated costs incurred since September 11, 2001. The grants will allow \nbus operators to protect drivers, implement passenger screening \nprograms, and construct or modify facilities. Grants could also be used \nto train employees in terrorist threat assessments, hire and train \nsecurity officers, and install video surveillance and emergency \ncommunication equipment.\n  Many of these upgrades have already been undertaken by the industry \nsince September 11. This bill will supplement and reimburse the \nindustry for these efforts.\n  Since 9/11, Members of Congress have shown broad bipartisan support \nfor addressing the issue of bus security. In April, S. 1739 was \nunanimously approved by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and \nTransportation, of which Senator Cleland and I are members. In May, a \ncompanion measure passed the House Transportation and Infrastructure \nCommittee, also unanimously, and is pending on the House floor. Also, \nthis summer Congress provided $15 million for that purpose in the \nFiscal Year 2002 Supplemental Appropriation bill.\n  Given the fact that the intercity bus system is a crucial link in \nAmerica's transportation system, I believe that Congress must act to \nsecure that system against further attacks, and I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to join me in a show of support for this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10434-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10434-S10435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CIVIL LIBERTIES IN HONG KONG\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I'd like to take a few minutes this \nmorning to call attention to recent disturbing trends with regard to \ndemocracy and civil liberties in Hong Kong.\n  As you know, Hong Kong recently marked 5 years under the sovereignty \nof the People's Republic of China. When the territory reverted from \nBritish to Chinese control in 1997, China's communist rulers in Beijing \npromised to respect its autonomy for a period of 50 years under the so-\ncalled ``One Country, Two Systems'' formula. They also agreed Hong Kong \nwould move toward direct elections by 2007.\n  At the same time, however, Article 23 of the so-called Basic Law that \nbecame Hong Kong's new constitution required that the territory adopt \nlegislation prohibitting ``treason, secession, sedition or subversion'' \nagainst the Chinese Government in Beijing, as well as ``theft of state \nsecrets.''\n  The Hong Kong Bar Association, among others, did not believe new \nlegislation was necessary, since existing Hong Kong laws were \nsufficient to deal with legitimate national security concerns. But \nBeijing felt otherwise.\n  When Chinese President Jiang Zemin and Vice Premier Qian Qichen \ntraveled to Hong Kong in July to commemorate the fifth anniversary of \nthe handover, they reportedly made clear to Tung Chee-Hwa, their hand-\npicked chief executive, that they wanted an anti-subversion statute \nadopted without further delay.\n\n[[Page S10435]]\n\n  Three weeks ago, Tung's administration obliged, unveiling a plan for \nnew legislation to implement Article 23. Tung called the plan ``both \nliberal and reasonable.'' But it contains a number of provisions that \ncould potentially seriously undermine civil liberties in Hong Kong.\n  For example, Tung's plan makes it an offense to organize or support \nthe activities of organizations deemed by Beijing to threaten national \nsecurity. It allows the police to enter and search private residences \nwithout a warrant to investigate suspected treason, sedition and \nsubversion. It creates a new offense of ``secession,'' presumably for \nadvocating independence for Tibet or Taiwan. Citizens would be legally \nobliged to report on alleged ``subversive'' activities of friends, \nneighbors and colleagues. Meanwhile, Journalists could face criminal \npenalites simply for reporting information about relations between Hong \nKong and Beijing.\n  Perhaps the most disturbing element of this legislative proposal is \nthat it represents a further intrusion of Beijing's anti-democratic \nlegal concepts and practices into Hong Kong. Definitions of offenses \nare vague, giving the government broad discretion to decide whom it \nwants to prosecute, or silence through the threat of prosecution. \nAlthough Tung says he will uphold human rights and civil liberties as \nthe ``pillars of Hong Kong's success,'' his Secretary of Security, \nRegina Ip, admits that, under the proposed legislation, she would \nessentially defer to Beijing to determine which organizations to \nprohibit. Falun Gong leaps to mind. The Dalai Lama's followers might \nalso take heed.\n  Journalists and scholars have good reason to be concerned if the new \nlegislation similarly incorporates Beijing's extremely broad definition \nof what constitutes a ``state secret.'' Rabiya Kadir, a Muslim \nbusinesswoman once feted by Beijing as a ``model minority,'' is \ncurrently serving an eight-year sentence under Beijing's state secrets \nlaw for mailing newspaper clippings to her husband in the United \nStates. More recently, a prominent AIDS activist, Wan Yanhai, was \ndetained for a month by the Beijing Bureau of State Security for \nleaking ``state secrets.'' His alleged offense was revealing that \nhundreds of thousands of Chinese people might have been infected with \nHIV through unsafe blood transfusions, information the authorities \ndidn't think people needed to have.\n  Regina Ip, who has been acting as Tung's point person for the new \nanti-subversion law, has attempted to reassure the plan's critics by \nsaying Hong Kong's highly regarded independent courts will be \nresponsible for interpreting and applying the new law. However, it was \nher government that undermined the integrity of those courts three \nyears ago when it appealed a high-court decision on immigration that it \ndidn't like to the National People's Congress Standing Committee in \nBeijing, as is its prerogative under the Basic Law. Beijing overturned \nHong Kong's Final Court of Appeal in that case, setting a dangerous \nprecedent in the eyes of Hong Kong's pro-democracy community.\n  Ultimately then, as a columnist recently pointed out in the Financial \nTimes, the bulwark against erosion of civil liberties in Hong Kong may \nnot be the territory's excellent judiciary but its executive, and that \nis not a comforting thought given the track record of Hong Kong's \nexecutive over the past five years. Tung Chee-Hwa has tightened \ncontrols on public demonstrations. His government turned away more than \n100 people who sought to travel to Hong Kong to demonstrate at July's \nfifth anniversary ceremonies, so as not to embarrass his VIP guests \nfrom Beijing. After winning a second five-year term in March in a \nprocess in which exactly 800 people participated, he introduced a new \nsystem allowing him to fill his cabinet with hand-picked political \nappointees without the advice or consent of Hong Kong's legislature. \nThere is no indication yet of any plans to make the process more \ndemocratic in 2007.\n  More recently, when democracy advocates suggested that the Government \nmake a detailed version of its proposed anti-subversion legislation \navailable for public comment before the bill is formally introduced in \nthe Legislative Council, Regina Ip replied as follows:\n\n       Will taxi drivers, Chinese restaurant waiters, service \n     staff at McDonald's hold a copy of the bill to debate with me \n     article by article?\n\n  Ms. Ip's remarks reveal contempt for the right of the general public \nto be consulted about matters that concern it. Unfortunately, this \nattitude is not uncommon among the economic elite that runs Hong Kong. \nThe Chamber of Commerce representative on the Legislative Council has \nopenly remarked that popularly elected representatives would spend \nmoney irresponsibly if given power. Another well-known tycoon is fond \nof saying ``no representation without taxation,'' turning the motto of \nthe founders of our American democracy on its head. In other words, \nHong Kong's is a government of the wealthy, by the wealthy and for the \nwealthy.\n  Of course, Hong Kong did not enjoy democracy under British rule, \neither. The business of Hong Kong has always been business. The \ndifference now is that the territory's capitalist elite has decided \nthat currying favor with the communist dictators in Beijing is good for \nbusiness. If some civil liberties need to be sacrificed in the process, \nthey appear willing to accept the bargain.\n  Many observers perceive this attitude being reflected in a growing \ntendency toward self-censorship within Hong Kong's major media. For \nexample, two years ago the South China Morning Post, which aspires to \nenter the Mainland Chinese market, replaced its veteran, hard-hitting \nChina editor, Willy Lam, with the former editor of the Beijing-\ncontroled China Daily. Then, in April of this year, the paper's veteran \nBeijing bureau chief, Jasper Becker, was fired for insubordination \nafter complaining that the paper's China coverage was being ``watered \ndown.'' I should add, however, that to its credit, the Post has been \nstrongly critical of the government's recent legislative proposal.\n  Hong Kong today remains a vibrant and cosmopolitan city whose \ncitizens enjoy a degree of civil and economic liberties far surpassing \nthat of most other countries. But whereas the trend in much of the \nworld is toward greater democracy, in Hong Kong things appear to be \nheaded in the other direction.\n  China's President Jiang Zemin will visit the United States later this \nmonth. President Bush may want to raise the issue of autonomy and civil \nliberties in Hong Kong with him. That would be entirely appropriate. \nBut, I think that we as a society can send a far more powerful message \nto the people who rule Hong Kong in a language they will understand. \nThose individuals fully appreciate that their future depends on their \nability to perpetuate Hong Kong's status as a global financial center. \nGeography is no longer sufficient to maintain that status. Rather, what \nmakes Hong Kong Hong Kong, what makes thousands of talented people from \nthroughout the world eager to live and work there, is its spirit, its \nvitality, its spontanaeity, its brashness, its ``anything goes'' \nattitude and its creativity. In the eyes of many, those qualities make \nHong Kong one of the most exciting places on Earth.\n  Hong Kong's current rulers are set on a path that risks killing the \ngoose that laid that golden egg. That's a message they need to hear not \nonly from foreign politicians but from the international business \ncommunity, the techno cognoscenti, the investors and the economic and \ncultural globe-trotters, voting with their feet and their pocketbooks. \nI encourage all such people who care about Hong Kong and about freedom \nto tell the Hong Kong authorities that, if Hong Kong sacrifices those \nthings that make it unique and worth living in, we may as well set up \nshop in Shanghai.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10435-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10435-S10436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NOTICE OF STUDY ON LOCAL ALL-DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to alert my colleagues to a \nrecently released study that shows great promise for all \nkindergartners, based on achievement gains in Montgomery County, MD. On \nOctober 1st, the Washington Post published key findings from a 2-year \nstudy of Montgomery County's intensive all-day kindergarten program. \nFor the past 2 years, Montgomery County has lengthened the school day, \ndecreased class sizes, and implemented a revised curriculum in its 17 \nhighest-poverty schools.\n\n[[Page S10436]]\n\n  The article highlights the rise in reading achievement for all \nstudents involved in the program, with low-income students making the \nmost progress. In these 17 schools, 51 percent of the most \ndisadvantaged children met reading benchmarks at the end of first grade \nwhile only 45 percent of poor children in the rest of the county did. \nStudents made gains of over 50 percentage points in all ethnic groups, \nalso narrowing the achievement gap by as much as 11 percent on some \nmeasures. Superintendent Weast attributes the program's success to \nadditional training for teachers and principals.\n  We must address the needs of our youngest students before our lack of \nattention compounds the disadvantages that many of them already bring \nto school. If children do not read fluently by the end of third grade, \nwe know that many of them never will. We should do all we can to \nsupport further success. The results in Montgomery County show that we \ncan make a difference to children's lives.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article entitled ``All-Day \nKindergarten Posts Big Gains in Montgomery'' be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Oct. 1, 2002]\n\n           All-Day Kindergarten Posts Big Gains in Montgomery\n\n                  (By a Washington Post Staff Writer)\n\n       An intensive and expensive all-day kindergarten program in \n     Montgomery County has produced significant gains for poor \n     children and helped them begin to catch up with higher-\n     performing peers, a new study to be released today shows.\n       In tracking the reading progress made by 16,000 youngsters \n     over two years in kindergarten and first grade, the report \n     found that not only did achievement rise for all students \n     involved in the program in high-poverty schools, but low-\n     income students showed bigger gains.\n       Further, the report found that both poor and middle-class \n     students in high-poverty schools--contrary to expectation--\n     either matched or outperformed their peers in schools \n     elsewhere in the county, many of whom were in half-day \n     kindergarten programs.\n       The most significant exception was for children who do not \n     speak English, a finding that has prompted Superintendent \n     Jerry D. Weast to pledge intensive phonics instruction at \n     schools with the most children living in poverty. ``We are \n     getting some emerging success,'' said a cautious Weast. \n     ``We're learning that you can attack poverty, that you don't \n     have to have low expectations just because a child is poor.''\n       The findings come at a time when the General Assembly has \n     mandated full-day kindergarten for all Maryland schools as \n     part of a new state aid formula. Montgomery's ``kindergarten \n     initiative'' combines the longer day with smaller class \n     sizes, a revised curriculum and additional teacher training.\n       Weast, who has won both praise and criticism for \n     implementing the program first in the county's high-poverty \n     schools, said the report vindicated his strategy and could \n     prove a model for schools across the nation dealing with a \n     vexing achievement gap that divides students along racial and \n     poverty lines.\n       Indeed, the report found that the gap between higher-\n     scoring white and Asian students and their African American \n     and Latino peers had narrowed by as much as 11 points on some \n     measures.\n       Other county and national studies have found that the \n     achievement gap that largely divides middle-class and poor or \n     non-English-speaking students is apparent on the first day of \n     kindergarten and generally widens through the years, with one \n     group of students on track for rigorous, college-prep courses \n     and others for lower-level or remedial course work.\n       The Montgomery study found that the kindergarten initiative \n     appears to be working well for children who live in poverty. \n     In the 17 highest-poverty schools, 51 percent of the children \n     considered poor enough to qualify for a federal lunch subsidy \n     met reading benchmarks by the end of first grade, and only 45 \n     percent of poor children elsewhere in the county did.\n       Despite the progress, officials said the gap still exists. \n     Nearly 70 percent of the middle-class students in those \n     schools met the same benchmark--about the same levels as \n     their peers in other county schools.\n       The most troubling finding, Weast said, was for the limited \n     English speakers, whose reading scores actually dipped \n     slightly over the two years. And some of their scores on a \n     test last spring of oral language, hearing and associating \n     sounds with letters were lower by half than their English-\n     speaking classmates.\n       Weast today will announce plans to introduce intensive \n     phonics instruction in 18 schools that receive federal Title \n     I funding for low-income students, the first such instruction \n     ever in Montgomery County.\n       ``It won't be drill and kill,'' Weast said, referring to \n     often-maligned, repetitive basic skills programs. ``But it \n     makes a lot of sense for kids who are hearing a different \n     language at home and hear the intonations and sounds of words \n     differently. They need to be able to unlock words so they can \n     pronounce them and then read them.''\n       The kindergarten initiative began in 17 of the poorest \n     schools in the fall of 2000. Seventeen more schools with \n     large numbers of poor students were added in the fall of \n     2001. The report found impressive gains in both groups. This \n     year, 22 schools have been added.\n       Research has found that if a kindergartner meets \n     foundational benchmarks--such as recognizing letters and the \n     sounds they represent and identifying simple words--they will \n     be on track to read text by the end of first grade and able \n     to read fluently by the end of third. Scientists have found \n     that if children do not read fluently by then, many never \n     will.\n       ``We believe that is the key to academic rigor as they go \n     up the grades,'' Weast said. ``Reading.''\n       Beyond touting results for poor children--a national \n     dilemma that provided much of the impetus behind the federal \n     No Child Left Behind law that took effect July 1--Weast said \n     his report addresses middle-class parents' worries that their \n     children will suffer academically at higher-poverty schools. \n     The report found that such children scored on par with \n     middle- and upper-middle-class students throughout the \n     county.\n       ``The nice thing about the changes we made is, you don't \n     have to leave those schools now,'' Weast said, referring to \n     middle-class flight that has affected some schools in the \n     county's more diverse eastern side. ``This ought to give \n     comfort to those parents to stay with us.''\n       School officials said some of the progress made over the \n     two years may have a lot to do with the ``practice effect,'' \n     the fact that teachers and principals are becoming used to \n     the new curriculum and training. Still, the results over time \n     are key, and officials plan to follow these 16,000 students \n     for several years.\n       Studies have found that gains made by children in Head \n     Start, the federal program designed to help impoverished 4-\n     year-olds, evaporate by the time the students are in third or \n     fourth grade: They perform similarly to children who never \n     had the benefit of such a program.\n       School officials in Montgomery say they want to change that \n     with the kindergarten initiative and have followed up with \n     smaller class sizes and a new, more focused curriculum this \n     year for grades 1 and 2.\n       The report has already garnered interest from the national \n     education community.\n       Michael Cohen, a former assistant secretary of education in \n     the Clinton administration who has worked with large school \n     districts throughout the country, said he was impressed not \n     only that the studies were detailed and sophisticated, but \n     that Weast was willing to make changes because of them.\n       ``That has not been a common practice in education around \n     the country,'' he said. ``So it's important to note, and note \n     when it's being done well.''\n       Michael Ben-Avie, a researcher with the Yale Child \n     Development Center, evaluated early drafts of the report and \n     praised Montgomery leaders for their ``willingness to undergo \n     major change and for their willingness to really address the \n     needs for our most vulnerable students.'' He found that the \n     fact that the kindergarten initiative was a systematic \n     overhaul and not a series of ad hoc pieces was what made it a \n     powerful reform.\n       ``They have been willing to take a sober-eyed view of the \n     data and not try to cover it up, which happens a great \n     deal,'' he said. ``This is remarkable. And the results show \n     they're well on their way.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10436-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10436-S10437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             GAO REPORT: FEMA'S HAZARD MITIGATION PROGRAMS\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Federal Government's \ncommitment to disaster mitigation and helping communities minimize the \nimpact of natural and man-made hazards. Currently, the Senate is locked \nin a debate on how to help State and local officials prevent, prepare \nfor, and respond to acts of terrorism. Homeland security will benefit \nfrom the Federal Emergency Management Agency's, FEMA, years of \nexperience because disaster mitigation and terrorism preparedness have \nthe same goal, helping people prepare for the worst.\n  FEMA's two multi-hazard mitigation programs, the post-disaster Hazard \nMitigation Grant Program, HMGP, and the pre-disaster Project Impact \nprogram, are aimed at helping States and communities identify and \naddress natural hazard risks they deem most significant.\n  In March 2001 the administration proposed the elimination of all pre-\ndisaster mitigation funding because Project Impact was ``ineffective.'' \nAfter learning that there had been no formal review of the \neffectiveness of this or any multi-hazard mitigation program, I \nrequested that GAO review FEMA's disaster mitigation efforts. I am \nhappy to announce the release of this comprehensive and timely report.\n\n[[Page S10437]]\n\n  The parameters of this study have changed in the past year. In the \naftermath of the September 11 terrorist attacks, and the subsequent and \nprudent focus on homeland security, the Nation began noticing the \nrelationship of pre-disaster mitigation programs to proposed new \npreparedness efforts for homeland security. I asked GAO to expand its \nstudy to include an assessment of how the increased emphasis on \npreventing and preparing for terrorism events is affecting natural \nhazard mitigation.\n  In March 2002 the administration proposed to change fundamentally \nFEMA's disaster mitigation strategy again by eliminating the HMGP. \nCurrently, HMGP funding is issued to States after a presidentially \ndeclared disaster as a percentage of total Federal assistance, a \nprocess deemed ineffective and not cost-efficient by the \nadministration. The administration instead is seeking to fund all \nmitigation through an expanded Project Impact-like program on a \nnationally competitive grant basis. The administration believes that \nsuch a program will ensure that mitigation funding remains stable from \nyear to year and that the most cost-beneficial projects receive \nfunding. At that time, I asked GAO to include this latest proposal.\n  GAO interviewed hazard mitigation officials from 24 states to get \ntheir perspectives on current FEMA programs and the administration's \nproposals. The States range from large population States, such as \nFlorida and Illinois, to smaller States, such as Nebraska and Utah. GAO \npurposely selected both small and large States, containing urban and \nrural communities, that have received both small and large amounts of \nmitigation funding. Despite geographic differences, emergency \nmanagement officials view FEMA's mitigation programs as successful and \neffective.\n  Emergency management officials described how, in addition to \ntraditional ``brick and mortar'' programs, such as retrofitting \nbuildings and relocating properties, mitigation effects can be \nintangible. Mitigation includes outreach activities, such as increasing \npublic awareness and support for mitigation, building public-private \npartnerships to pool mitigation resources, and ever-important planning \nand risk assessment.\n  We must listen to these officials, the end-users of mitigation \nprograms, when determining program success or failure. These dedicated \nmen and women have many concerns over the administration's proposal. \nThey worry that FEMA will lose the window of opportunity that exists \nafter a disaster strikes if HMGP funds are not included in Federal \nassistance. This is when public and community interest in mitigating \nagainst future disasters is highest. They worry that a competitive \ngrant system might exclude some States entirely from mitigation \nfunding.\n  GAO also interviewed FEMA officials. FEMA headquarters and regional \noffice personnel identified several challenges in implementing a \nnational competitive grant program. Chief among them is establishing a \nprocess for comparing the costs and benefits of projects. Emergency \nmanagers around the country share FEMA's concerns that the outreach and \nplanning activities they feel are so important will be curtailed \nbecause of the difficulty associated with assigning cost-benefit to \nsuch programs. This issue will have ramifications in homeland security \nwhen the new Department of Homeland Security is told to determine the \ncost-benefit of terrorism preparedness efforts.\n  I was heartened to learn that FEMA is working to ensure and \nstrengthen natural hazard mitigation, response, and recovery efforts \nwhile attending to homeland security needs. FEMA officials are \nidentifying and correcting redundancies in reporting, planning, \ntraining, and other activities across mitigation and preparedness \nprograms. FEMA mitigation experts are working to identify terrorism \nmitigation activities that are also ``all hazard'' and address natural \nhazard mitigation priorities.\n  The Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000, passed by Congress 2 years ago, \nemphasized involvement by all States, funding for planning activities, \nand increased post-disaster mitigation funding for States willing to \nundertake enhanced mitigation efforts. FEMA has taken our directive to \nheart and is implementing multi-hazard mitigation programs in \ncoordination and cooperation with State and local officials. While a \nfocus on obtaining the most cost-effective program is well intended, I \nshare the concerns of the emergency management community and FEMA \npersonnel that assigning a dollar amount to the benefit of doing \nmitigation, or the cost of not doing it, is a difficult and ill-defined \ntask. I share their doubts that consolidating the HMGP and Project \nImpact programs will make disaster mitigation more effective or \nsuccessful.\n  After reviewing the GAO report, FEMA Director Joseph Allbaugh wrote \nto GAO, `` I appreciate your support of my strongly held belief that \nfunding and support of both pre- and post-disaster mitigation programs \nare critical to FEMA's success in leading the nation to reduce disaster \nlosses.'' I agree with Director Allbaugh. We must continue to to \nsupport pre-disaster mitigation as an investment for the future. I \ncommend GAO on their insightful report, and I thank JayEtta Hecker and \nher team at GAO for their work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10437-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10437-S10438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        HISPANIC HERITAGE MONTH\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, each year between September 15 and October \n15, we celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. This tradition began in 1968 \nwhen Congress set aside a week to celebrate Hispanic culture, \nachievements, and contributions to American culture and society. In \n1988, Congress expanded the week to a month-long commemoration.\n  Gil Coronado, founder and chairman of Heroes and Heritage: Saluting a \nLegacy of Hispanic Patriotism and Pride, was one of the driving forces \nbehind the creation of Hispanic Heritage Month. Mr. Coronado enlisted \nwith the Air Force when he was just 16. He served for 30 years in \nVietnam, Panama, Germany, and Spain before he retired as a colonel. \nDuring his stellar career, he received over 35 awards, including the \nLegion of Merit and the Bronze Star. Like Colonel Coronado, countless \nnumbers of Hispanic Americans have answered the call, defending our \nliberty and freedoms as members of our Armed Forces and in other \ncapacities. Twelve Hispanic Americans were among the firefighters \nkilled on September 11 as they tried to rescue their fellow Americans \ntrapped in the World Trade Center's two towers.\n  Hispanic contributions to America date back nearly 500 years to \nEaster, March 27, 1513 when Juan Ponce de Leon sighted land, which he \nclaimed for Spain and named ``La Florida,'' meaning ``Land of \nFlowers.'' De Leon and his fellow explorers such as Alvarez de Pinela \nand Cabeza de Vaca traversed most of what we now call America's \nsunbelt. Hernando de Soto was the first European to discover the \nMississippi River, an event depicted in one of the great historical \ncanvases which hang in the Rotunda of the Capitol Building. St. \nAugustine, FL, was founded in 1565, 42 years before the English colony \nat Jamestown, VA, and 55 years before the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth \nRock in Massachusetts. St. Augustine is the oldest permanent European \nsettlement on the North American continent. In 1787, St. Augustine had \nthe first free, integrated public school.\n  America's diverse and vibrant Hispanic population has made enormous \ncontributions to our Nation, its culture, and its economy. Former \nSenator Dennis Chavez, union organizers Antonia Pantoja and Caesar \nChavez, entertainers Gloria Estefan and Jennifer Lopez, actor Martin \nSheen, and baseball players Alex Rodriguez and Sammy Sosa are just a \nfew of the Hispanics Americans who have done so much to enrich all \nAmericans' lives.\n  My hometown, Detroit, has benefited greatly from Hispanic immigrants \npursuing the American Dream. Southwest Detroit, known affectionately as \nMexicantown by its residents, is the fastest growing part of the city. \nHispanics from Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, Cuba, and other \nCaribbean nations have opened businesses, bought homes, and turned a \nonce neglected urban neighborhood into a thriving community and one of \nthe city's centers. Maria Elena Rodriguez, president of the Mexicantown \nCommunity Development Corporation, has been one of the primary \ncatalysts of the turnaround.\n\n[[Page S10438]]\n\n  Hispanic contributions to Michigan's businesses abound. The Kellogg \nCompany, founded and headquartered in Battle Creek, is the world's \nleading cereal producer. It has millions of customers in over 160 \ncountries. At present, the chief executive officer is Carlos Gutierrez, \nwho started at Kellogg's as a sales representative in Mexico City over \n25 years ago.\n  Other prominent Hispanics with ties to Michigan include Antonia \nNovello, who started her medical career at the University of Michigan. \nIn 1990, she became the first woman U.S. Surgeon General, and the first \nHispanic American to hold the post.\n  Grammy-winning musician Jose Feliciano, a native of Puerto Rico, made \nhis professional debut at the Retort Coffee House in Detroit in 1963. \nHe is, perhaps, most famous for his Latin-soul version of the Doors' \nhit, ``Light My Fire,'' a blues-rock rendition of the ``Star-Spangled \nBanner'' performed at a 1968 World Series game between Detroit and St. \nLouis, and the Christmas classic, ``Feliz Navidad.''\n  Rebecca Arenas received the ``Caesar Chavez Civil Rights Achievement \nAward'' in 2000 for her work to improve the lives of Hispanics \ngenerally, and migrant workers in particular. Rebecca's parents brought \nher to Michigan from Crystal City, TX, when she was 5. They were \nmigrant workers who chose Michigan because they believed Rebecca would \nget a better education. Rebecca has passed this commitment to education \non to her children, all seven of whom have received a postsecondary \neducation. Rebecca has worked tirelessly to increase Hispanics' access \nto education and health care and to boost their voter registration.\n  Hispanic Americans constitute the fastest growing segment of our \npopulation. Right now, one in eight Americans is Hispanic--about 32 \nmillion Americans. By 2050, one in four Americans will be Hispanic. \nHispanic Americans are the fastest growing small business owners \nnationwide. Hispanic Americans will purchase $580 billion in goods and \nservices this year. By 2007, that purchasing power will increase by 315 \npercent to $926 billion.\n  Cities such as Los Angeles, San Antonio, New York, and Miami \ntraditionally have been centers of Hispanic influence. Increasingly, \nhowever, Hispanics and Hispanic Americans are moving to other parts of \nthe country, such as Arkansas, Georgia, and North Carolina. This shift \nin migration will spread Hispanic culture and influence throughout the \ncountry.\n  As we celebrate and commemorate Hispanic Heritage Month, we must also \nacknowledge the challenges facing the community--and the country--that \nlie ahead. Too many Hispanic American youth are incarcerated. Hispanic \nAmericans have a lower rate of educational achievement than the \nnational average. A higher than average number of Hispanic Americans \nlive in poverty.\n  Congress can and must help Hispanic Americans by pursuing fair and \nmeaningful immigration reforms; supporting Hispanic education programs, \nincreasing access to higher education, helping the economy to create \ngood jobs at decent wages, and restoring benefits to legal immigrants \nunder the Medicaid and State Children's Health Insurance Program--\nSCHIP.\n  So, Hispanic Heritage Month is a time to celebrate what has been \naccomplished and recognize what still needs to be done. I congratulate \nHispanic Americans in Michigan and across America for their wonderful \ncontributions to our country. And I pledge my efforts to ensuring that \nmore Hispanic Americans have access to the great opportunities our \ncountry has to offer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10438-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FEMA FIRE ACT GRANT PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I wish to offer a few remarks in support \nof the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, commonly known as FIRE \nAct grants. The FIRE Act grant program was established in fiscal year \n2001, due in large part to the efforts of my distinguished colleague \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Dodd.\n  Since its inception, the program has assisted firefighters across the \nNation. I am especially pleased that this program has been a shining \nexample of an effective partnership between local and Federal \nGovernments. It provides Federal assistance to meet local objectives \nwithout imposing mandates or interfering with local prerogatives, and \nit provides Federal dollars directly to the fire departments. It also \naddresses critical needs, awarding grants for training, wellness and \nfitness programs, vehicles, firefighting equipment, personal protective \nequipment, and fire prevention.\n  FIRE Act grants have had a positive and very tangible impact on \ncommunities throughout the country, including in my home State of \nWisconsin. In fiscal year 2002, as of October 1, 2002 my State received \n$2.445 million in grants awarded to 41 departments.\n  These grants help firefighters to do their job better, make our \nneighborhoods safer, and, very importantly, give residents peace of \nmind. Increasing the training and equipment available to firefighters \nfosters an environment of enhanced safety between firefighters and the \ncommunities they serve. Keeping our communities safe has been and \nshould continue to be a top priority for all of us. As the tragic \nevents of September 11 have shown our Nation, local firefighters play a \nvital role to protect and secure our communities. We should give them \nthe support they need.\n  As I travel through Wisconsin and talk to local firefighters and \nemergency response personnel, I hear the same refrain, time after time: \nthe FIRE Act grant program is vital to their work and has enabled them \nto get needed equipment and training that they would otherwise be \nunable to afford.\n  We have taken up funding for the FIRE Act grant program in this body \nnumerous times since its inception. In the wake of the terrorist \nattacks in New York and Washington, D.C. on September 11, 2001, the \nCongress amended the fiscal year 2002 Department of Defense \nAuthorization Act to provide increased authorization levels to allow up \nto $900 million per year to be allocated for the FIRE Act grant \nprogram. The program was also expanded to allow grant applicants to \napply for equipment and training funds to help firefighters respond to \nterrorist attacks or attacks using weapons of mass destruction. \nAdditionally, Congress, through both the fiscal year 2002 VA-HUD-\nIndependent Agencies Appropriations bill and the Homeland Security \npackage in the fiscal year 2002 Department of Defense Appropriations \nAct, appropriated $360 million to the FIRE Act grant program.\n  As we finalize our appropriations bills this year we should continue \nto allocate resources to this important program. Keeping our \ncommunities safe has been and should continue to be a top priority for \nall of us. As the tragic events of September 11 have shown our Nation, \nlocal firefighters play a vital role to protect and secure our \ncommunities. We should give them the support they need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10438-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10438-S10439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         THE NATIONAL INTEGRATED BALLISTICS INFORMATION NETWORK\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I wish to bring the National Integrated \nBallistics Information Network or NIBIN to the attention of my \ncolleagues. NIBIN is an interconnected, computer-assisted ballistics \nimaging system that allows forensic firearms examiners to obtain \ncomputerized images of the unique marking made on bullets and casings \nwhen a gun is fired. Through NIBIN, investigators can rapidly compare \nthese markings with images in the database of Federal, State, and local \nlaw enforcement laboratories. Law enforcement officials can then link \nevidence from multiple crime scenes, identify patterns of criminal \nactivity, and possibly lead investigators to the arrest of suspects.\n  As an investigative instrument, ballistics imaging complements crime \ngun tracing. Crime gun tracing consists of tracking the history of a \ngun used to commit a crime. By tracing crime guns, the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms helps State and local law enforcement \nagencies solve firearms-related crime by identifying suppliers of \nmultiple-crime guns, and gun trafficking patterns. According to an ATF \nreport, since March 2000, the NIBIN in coordination with crime gun \ntracing efforts has produced more than 8,800 ballistics matches, \nlinking over 17,600 crime scenes. Some of these matches would not have \nbeen made without the use of a computer-assisted ballistics imaging \nsystem.\n\n[[Page S10439]]\n\n  I believe that the NIBIN should be expanded, and that is why I have \ncosponsored the Ballistics, Law Assistance, and Safety Technology Act \nor BLAST which would require licensed firearms manufacturers to test \nfire firearms, prepare ballistics images of fired bullets and casings \nof new firearms. Expanding NIBIN to include these ballistics images \nwould increase ATF's crime gun tracing capabilities. ATF agents could \nquickly identify firearms even when criminals had obliterated the \nserial number by using the ballistics images of cartridge cases and \nbullets recovered at crime scenes. In fact, they could identify the \nfirearm used in the crime without actually recovering that firearm. \nThis bill contains strict provisions stating that ballistics \ninformation of individual guns may not be used for prosecutorial \npurposes unless law enforcement officials have a reasonable belief that \na crime has been committed and that ballistics information would assist \nin the investigation of that crime.\n  I believe this is sensible legislation that will strengthen law \nenforcement's ability to effectively track down criminals and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10439-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ADDITIONAL STATEMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO STEVE JORDAN\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding public servant and marine scientist, Steve Jordan. Steve is \nretiring after a distinguished 28-year career with the Maryland \nDepartment of Natural Resources, in higher educational institutions in \nMaryland and with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. I want to extend my \npersonal congratulations and thanks for his many years of service and \ncontributions to improving our research and management capabilities in \nthe Chesapeake Bay and one of the Bay's premier research laboratories, \nthe Oxford Cooperative Lab.\n  Steve has dedicated nearly three decades of his life to solving some \nof the key living marine resource problems of the Chesapeake Bay, the \ndiseases that have devastated the Bay's oyster populations, the loss of \ncritical habitat, and the impacts of pollutants and low dissolved \noxygen on the Bay's finfish and shellfish populations. A graduate of \nThe American University, Steve worked his way through a master's degree \nin Biology at Morehead State College in Kentucky and a Ph.D. in marine, \nestuarine and environmental science from the University of Maryland. He \nwas selected as a Sea Grant Fellow with the University of Maryland and \nHorn Point Environmental Laboratory and served as a faculty research \nassociate with the University of Maryland Eastern Shore before being \nnamed to head up the Maryland Department of Natural Resources' Habitat \nImpacts Program which managed several aspects of Maryland's \nparticipation in the Chesapeake Bay Program.\n  I came to know Steve 10 years ago when he was appointed director of \nthe Oxford Cooperative Laboratory in Oxford, MD. For those who are not \nfamiliar with the Oxford Lab, it is a unique partnership between the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Maryland \nDepartment of Natural Resources. Located on a tidal tributary of the \nChesapeake Bay, the lab has long been considered one of the preeminent \ncenters in the Nation for its work in diagnosing all aspects of \ndiseases, infectious and non-infectious, which affect living marine \nresources. At the time that Steve joined the facility, the laboratory \nwas 33 years old and in great need of capital improvements. The poor \nphysical condition of the facility was contributing significantly to \nlow employee morale and a high staff attrition rate. Thanks to Steve's \ncreative leadership, a major renovation and expansion of the laboratory \nwas completed, leveraging a $750,000 Federal appropriation into a $2 \nmillion project through the use of DNR construction crews. The project \nnot only served as a model for interagency cooperation, but provided \nsubstantial savings to the taxpayers as well. Steve also added new \nresearch programs, modern equipment, and helped bring about a renewed \nworkplace atmosphere.\n  In addition to his management responsibilities and achievements, \nSteve has continued to conduct research that is vital to improving our \nunderstanding of the Bay's living marine resources. He has published or \ncontributed to numerous studies and symposia on oyster diseases, \nlesions in fish, and other critical problems. He has chaired or \nparticipated in many work groups examining key living resource research \nneeds and management strategies and is a member or leader of half a \ndozen professional associations including the American Fisheries \nSociety, National Shellfisheries Association, Atlantic Estuarine \nResearch Society, and National Association of Marine Laboratories. In \nrecognition of his outstanding service, Steve has received numerous \nawards and commendations, including certificates of appreciation from \nboth the Chesapeake Bay Program and the Maryland Department of Natural \nResources and an excellence award from Maryland Governor Schaefer for \nthe Chesapeake Executive Council.\n  The efforts of Steve Jordan throughout the past 28 years have earned \nhim the respect and admiration of everyone with whom he has worked. The \nChesapeake Bay restoration effort has been enhanced due to his labors \nand the Cooperative Oxford Laboratory has been renewed. I want to \nextend my personal congratulations and thanks for his many years of \nhard work and dedication and wish him the best in his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10439-2", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10439-S10440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PADUCAH GASEOUS DIFFUSION PLANT\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant and all its workers, past and \npresent, on the occasion of the facility's upcoming 50th anniversary, \nwhich will be celebrated by the Paducah community on October 24th.\n  The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant is currently the only operating \nuranium enrichment facility in the United States. Production of \nenriched uranium began in Paducah in 1952, and the plant has operated \ncontinuously since that time. Until 1964, the plant's output was almost \nentirely for the purposes of national defense as it produced \nfissionable material for our country's nuclear arsenal. The Paducah \nworkers during that period played a vital role in securing our freedom \nand helped America prevail in the cold war. Unfortunately, the Federal \nGovernment didn't always do right by the workers, who were often \nexposed to hazardous conditions and materials which would later sicken \nand even kill some. Even today, we are still working to correct this \nshameful injustice.\n  After 1964, Paducah production began shifting to enriched uranium for \ncommercial nuclear reactors; helping to provide the benefits of cleanly \ngenerated electric power to millions of people. After 1973, Paducah no \nlonger enriched uranium for military purposes. However, the plant \ncontinues to help create a more secure world as the U.S. recipient for \nnuclear materials from the former Soviet arsenal. Under the Megatons to \nMegawatts program, nuclear weapons are dismantled in Russia and the \nnuclear material is shipped to Paducah where it is repackaged and \nshipped worldwide for civilian electric power production.\n  Over the last half century, a number of companies have operated the \nPaducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant. Carbide and Carbon Chemicals Company, \n(later Union Carbide) was the original operator of the plant. Successor \noperators included Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Lockheed Martin \nEnergy Systems, and finally United States Enrichment Corporation, which \ntook over direct operation of the plant in 1999, and continues as the \noperator today. Today 1,500 workers are employed at the Paducah Gaseous \nDiffusion Plant. What is remarkable is that despite the past sins of \nthe Federal Government, these employees remain dedicated to their jobs \nand the important work they perform every day. It is a testament to \nthose individuals in particular and this region in general.\n  In addition to the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant itself, an entire \ncomplex of supporting plants were built to support enrichment \nactivities at Paducah. Two electric generating plants were constructed \nto supply the large power demands of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion \nPlant. These were the TVA\n\n[[Page S10440]]\n\nShawnee Steam Plant in western McCracken County, Kentucky, and the EEI \nplant in Joppa, Illinois. Additionally, a uranium hexaflouride plant \nwas constructed in Metropolis, IL. Together, these four facilities \ncomprise the economic and industrial heart of the region.\n  In recent years, we have learned that there were often risks \nassociated with work at Paducah, particularly during the earlier years \nof its operation. Some workers were exposed to cancer-causing chemicals \nand radiological hazards. Many of these workers have now benefited from \nthe Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program, which I \nam proud to have helped bring into existence. Working alongside the \nunion representing the workers, I have also fought to make sure that \nmedical screening is available to all workers so that they may be \ntested and treated for any problems they incur as a result of working \nat the plant. We have also embarked upon the task of cleaning up some \nof the legacy waste materials left on the site. The Department of \nEnergy's recently announced DUF6 conversion plant will be a huge step \nin this direction, as it will clean up thousands of cylinders of \ndepleted uranium hexaflouride which have been stored on the site for \ndecades. The conversion plant additionally will add new jobs to the \nPaducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant complex.\n  While significant challenges lie ahead for America's domestic uranium \nenrichment industry, it is appropriate to pause on this occasion to \ncommemorate the Golden Anniversary of the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion \nPlant, and the dedicated service of all the employees over the last \nhalf century. The workers at Paducah today continue the fine tradition \nof service, commitment, and productivity. I am sure they are up to any \nfuture challenge to be met in keeping a viable domestic uranium \nenrichment capability.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10440-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO SCARLOTTE DEUPREE\n\n Mr. SHELBY.

Mr. President, today I honor and bring to the \nSenate's attention the exceptional judicial career and service of Myron \nD. Crocker, U.S. District Court Judge for the Eastern District of \nCalifornia.\n  A graduate of California State University at Fresno and the \nUniversity of California's Boalt Hall School of Law, he was appointed \nto the Federal bench by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1959. Judge \nCrocker continued to carry an active caseload after taking senior \nstatus in 1981. He is retiring after 43 years of dedicated service as a \nfederal judge.\n  Judge Crocker served under 10 presidents, Eisenhower, Kennedy, \nJohnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton and George W. Bush. \nOur current, President George W. Bush, was just 13 years old when Judge \nCrocker was named to the bench.\n  He is believed to have served longer than any other sitting Federal \njudge in the Nation. He has presided over many high profile cases in \nthe Fresno area and during his travels throughout the United States as \na visiting judge.\n  Judge Crocker is well respected throughout the legal community. He \nhas served California and the United States with great distinction. I \nam pleased to pay tribute to him today and I encourage my colleagues to \njoin me in wishing Judge Crocker and his family the very best as he \ncelebrates his retirement from the Eastern District.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10440-3", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10440-S10441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2001, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on October 5, 2001, during the recess of \nthe Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the House has passed the following bill, without \namendment:\n\n       S. 2558.

A bill to compensate agricultural producers in the State of \nNew Mexico that suffered crop losses as a result of use of a herbicide \nby the Bureau of Land Management; to the Committee on Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that I \ndo believe should not be necessary, and I hope ultimately will not be \nneeded. Unfortunately, the failure of the Federal Government to own up \nto its responsibility has left a small group of farmers in Southern New \nMexico with no other option.\n  As I understand it, last July the Bureau of Land Management and the \nNatural Resources Conservation Service applied herbicide, Tebuthiuron, \non a ranch in Southern Eddy County to help control woody brush. The \nbrush control was part of an EQIP project under NRCS.\n  I have no reason to doubt the application was consistent with label \nrequirements and normal practice. Unfortunately, as frequently happens \nin New Mexico in July, a heavy rainstorm struck the area and the \npellets of herbicide were apparently washed into the Black River. The \nriver is the source of irrigation water for a number of farmers in the \nvicinity of the town of Malaga.\n  Unaware of the contamination in the water, farmers irrigated their \nfields in the normal way. Almost immediately, damage to cotton, hay and \nother crops was observed. The Eddy County Extension Office of the \nCooperative Extension Service at New Mexico State University was asked \nto investigate the damage to the crops.\n  Mr. Woods E. Houghton of the Eddy County Office conducted a thorough \nreview of the evidence and in a report dated August 20, 2002, concluded \nthat Tebuthiuron was the likely cause of the crop damage. The report \nnoted levels of Tebuthiuron of over 2 parts per million in some \nsamples. Later tests by the State Chemistry Laboratory found levels \nover 5 pm. I ask unanimous consent that the August 20th Cooperative \nExtension Service report be printed in the Record at the conclusion of \nmy remarks, exhibit 1.\n  All the evidence seems to point to the government's application of \nTebuthiuron as the most likely source of the poisoning of the crops in \nMalaga. Last month, I asked the heads of BLM and NRCS to look into the \nsituation and to advise me what recourse is available to the farmers \nwho have lost their crops. Unfortunately, the agencies have not assumed \nany responsibility for the contamination. Moreover, normal crop \ninsurance doesn't cover damage caused by chemicals.\n  What are the farmers of Malaga, NM, to do? Through no fault of their \nown, they have lost their crops, and the Federal Government is not \nwilling to take responsibility. For example, Mr. Oscar Vasquez and his \nfamily have lost 130 acres of cotton, 20 acres of hay and 1 acre of \nfull-grown pecan trees. As Mr. Vasquez points out, his losses may \npersist for several years. He has asked for my assistance in securing \ncompensation for his losses. I ask unanimous consent that a letter to \nme by Mr. Vasquez be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nremarks, exhibit 2. It appears that as many as nine farmers have \nsuffered direct losses from the contamination of their crops and an \nadditional thirteen farmers suffered losses when they couldn't irrigate \nbecause of the contamination in the water.\n  I have urged the heads of BLM and NRCS in the strongest terms \npossible to do what they can to assist the farmers of Malaga. \nUnfortunately, nobody wants to take responsibility. The Federal \nGovernment's response so far is to suggest the farmers sue the \ngovernment, but that's a long, drawn-out process. It is also an \nunacceptable response if the Federal Government is found to be \nresponsible.\n  The farmers of Malaga need help paying their bills now. These are not \nrich people, but hard working family farmers. Many have farmed the same \nland for many, many years. I ask unanimous consent that a recent \narticle from the Carlsbad Current Argus describing the impact this \nevent is having on a number of the farmers of Malaga be printed in the \nRecord at the end of my remarks, exhibit 3.\n  At this point I don't see any other option than to ask that Congress \nprovide some relief to the farmers of Malaga that have suffered losses \nbecause of this unfortunate situation. I note that last year Congress \nprovided financial compensation to farmers in Idaho that suffered crop \nlosses in a very similar situation and where BLM and NRCS refused to \nprovide compensation. When a federal program was clearly the source of \nthe contamination in the water, I do believe the government has a \nresponsibility to come to the assistance of the people who have \nsuffered losses.\n  It is my hope that the agencies involved will step forward, \nacknowledge their responsibility, and do what is right and necessary to \ncompensate the farmers. Unfortunately, it now appears the agencies are \nnot inclined to do the right thing. Instead, they tell us the affected \nfarmers are free to file a tort claim; we all know what a costly and \ntime-consuming process any legal action can be. However, the farmers \nneed help right now. While it is not the best way, I do believe \nCongressional action may be the only way of getting these farmers the \nfinancial help they need in a timely manner.\n  The bill I am introducing today simply authorizes the Secretary of \nAgriculture, in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, to use \nfunds of the Commodity Credit Corporation to compensate the farmers for \ntheir losses. We are still working with the Cooperative Extension \nService at New Mexico State University to determine the total amount of \nthe losses, but in light of the small area affected, I fully expect the \nsums needed to be very modest, indeed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter supporting this \nlegislation from Frank DuBois, New Mexico's Secretary of Agriculture, \nexhibit 4, and a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill and additional material was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3111\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Houghton county agent.\n       31 July 2002 Woods E. Houghton visited Oscar Vasquez farm, \n     and concluded something in the water caused problems. Woods \n     took soil and plant samples. Samples sent to Dr. Bob Flynn \n     for Ecreading. Dr. Goldberg and Dr. McWilliams for diagnosis \n     of disease or nutrition disorders if they occurred. Surface \n     water bureau notified NM ED department Dr. Jim Davis. \n     Suspected possible illegal disposal of produced water which \n     is high in saline. High salt consternation could cause \n     similar damage.\n       7 Aug 2002 Woods Houghton and Jim Ballard of Eddy County \n     Sheriff Office, flew over and photographed. Talked with Oscar \n     again. Recalled BLM treated a number of acres above on the \n     black river with Spike (Tebuthiuron) 8 July 2002. Confirmed \n     this with Mr. Mike Ramirez BLM. Reported possible off target \n     effects to Ms. Margery Lewis NMDA and Mr. Russell Knight \n     NMDA. Conferred with Mr. Tom Davis CID.\n       8 Aug 2002 Dr. Flynn reported that the unhealthy plants had \n     a lower Ec value then the healthy plant soil samples. The \n     problem most likely not salt or produced water.\n       16 Aug 2002 Received from Dr. Goldberg diagnosis record, \n     which indicated that no plant pathogenic microorganisms were \n     isolated from the sample submitted.\n       Symptoms: Plant Yellowing at top and then turned clororotic \n     followed by necrosis between veins and on leaf edges with DG-\n     206. On ACLA 1517-99 started from bottom to top but same \n     symptoms. Fruit drop starts first. Plants die from top down. \n     Some plants appear to recover set new flowers and attempting \n     new growth. Most 90% or more die back almost completely. \n     Symptoms atypical of Spike but consistent with chlorophyll \n     inhibitors. Also the root hairs are dead and brittle do not \n     stay attached to plant when pulled up.\n       Other Information: On contact with BLM and NRCS equip \n     project on three mile draw area was treated with Tebuthiuron \n     (Spike 20p) on 8 July 02. Approximately 2,300 acres were \n     treated some at 0.5AI and some at 0.75 AI per acre. This draw \n     drains in to the black river above the diversion. The \n     diversion diverts water to the farms, which are reporting \n     damage. M Air Service was the applicator. Laboratory \n     results from Analytical Pesticide Technology Laboratories \n     Wyamissing Pa. Reported results of soil 0.187 ppm, cotton 1 \n     1.66ppm, cotton 2 2.03ppm, Elm collected at diversion \n     0.196ppm, Cottonwood collected at diversion 0.329ppm. These \n     samples were collected by Mr. Tom Davis and submitted by \n     Carisbad Irrigation District for analysis. Samples were also \n     taken by Mr. Russell Knight and Mr. Woods Houghton on 09 Aug. \n     02. The hydrograph of blackriver at USGS gauging station \n     above the diversion but below three-mile draw show the water \n     flow on the 17 July at less then 4 CFS, on 18-19 July it \n     peaked at greater the 100 CFS. This area experienced high \n     intensity short duration storm in this time frame. There are \n     older treatment areas in the vicinity as well.\n       Conclusion: Tebuthiuron Herbicide contamination of black \n     river prior to irrigation has resulted in cotton crop losses. \n     That flash flooding may have contributed to off target \n     movement of products containing Tebuthiuron.\n\n                                            Woods E.

I own 145 acres, and share \n     crop 175 acres from my neighbors, Mr. Damon Bond, Mrs. \n     Catalina Carrasco, and Mr. Pedro Duarte.\n       On July 20, 2002, I began watering my cotton with Black \n     River water as I would normally, and continued for 8 days. On \n     July 27, 2002, I began to see wilting effects on the cotton \n     fields I started watering first. I contacted Mr. Woods \n     Houghton, our Eddy County Extension agent. He came and saw \n     the damage on my cotton, it took us till August 7, 2002, to \n     conclude that my cotton had received the damage thru the \n     contaminated irrigation water. We also concluded that the BLM \n     had applied herbicide called Tebuthiuron (Spike) to \n     approximately 2400 acres on Three Mile Draw which is on the \n     Gene & Kathy Hood Ranch, above the Black River Irrigation \n     Diversion Dam.\n       The BLM and the NRCS (National Resource Conservation \n     Services), applied this chemical to control brush on the Hood \n     Ranch. The chemical was applied by airplane in pellet form on \n     July 8, 9, & 12. The Hood Ranch received a 2\\1/2\\\" rain in 45 \n     minutes on the 18th & 19th of July washing the chemical in \n     the Black River. I began to irrigate my cotton on July 20, \n     2002. My cotton crop has since sustained severe damage, with \n     the chemical terminating the crop before maturity, therefore \n     my crop is totally ruined.\n       I have contacted my cotton buyer and he does not want to \n     buy my cotton crop this year. I have sold him 23 consecutive \n     cotton crops in the past. What am I to do with this damaged \n     crop? Do I harvest it? If I do, who will buy it? Or do I \n     destroy it, or graze it? I need answers to all these \n     questions.\n       New Mexico Agriculture Department has not assumed the \n     responsibility to let me know what to do. The BLM has not \n     assumed the responsibility either. What are my Landlords \n     going to do for income this year. Mr. & Mrs. Damon Bond are \n     86 years old, Mrs. Catalina Carrasco is 68 years old, and a \n     widow, Mr. Pedro Duarte is a little better off, he is 47 \n     years old and has a job. I am 53 years old with the last of 5 \n     children attending NMSU. My wife and I do not hire any help \n     on the Farm, we do all the tractor and manual labor work \n     ourselves\n       We would appreciate an answer to all our problems, \n     preferably our income problem. The long term damage of these \n     chemical effect is 5 years, or longer. Thank you for your \n     cooperation.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                     Oscar Vasquez\n       P.S.

But these days, the \n     couple gets little pleasure in gazing out through the large \n     dining room window facing their farm fields.\n       Where normally they would see healthy stands of cotton, all \n     they see now are rows of small, leafless cotton stalks with \n     stringy cotton bolls.\n       The couple farms about 320 acres--145 acres are owned by \n     them and the 175 remaining acres they sharecrop for three \n     other families who depend on the income from their shares.\n       Disaster struck Malaga farmers in late July when they \n     watered their fields from the Black River diversion dam, \n     unaware the water had been contaminated with the herbicide, \n     tebuthiuron.\n       Later they discovered the Bureau of Land Management applied \n     the herbicide on the ground just above the diversion dam to \n     control woody vegetation on range and ranchland.\n       The chemical was applied in conjunction with a federal cost \n     share program through the Natural Resource Conservation \n     Service, an agency of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The \n     rancher and the federal agency share the cost of applying the \n     chemical on private ranch land.\n       ``This crop is our income. It's our living. We are losing \n     money, and the bills are coming in,';' Oscar Vasquez said. \n     ``I can survive this year, but there are other farmers who \n     won't. They will be wiped out financially. I have two \n     cousins, Tony and Mike Vasquez, who also have crop damage. \n     They are in their sixties and the income loss will be \n     devastating for them.''\n       Oscar Vasquez, 53, said he has always tried to meet his \n     commitments and financial obligations and is proud that he \n     and his wife have put five children and a daughter-in-law \n     through college.\n       ``My wife and I put them through college, and our youngest \n     is ready to graduate. They all went into engineering and \n     graduated from New Mexico State University. We worked hard on \n     the farm to make the income to put them through college. It's \n     expensive to put kids through college, but we managed. I feel \n     it is a privilege to send my kids to school. The next few \n     months are going to be tight in meeting our son's college \n     expenses. This couldn't have come at a worse time. He's close \n     to finishing.\n       ``We will make it through this year financially, but I \n     don't know what is going to happen next year,'' he said. ``We \n     don't know how long the soil will stay contaminated. I have a \n     payment coming due on a mechanical baler, and there are costs \n     associated with planting cotton that I will have to cover \n     without the income from the crops. I usually grow hay and \n     cotton. But because water was scarce this year, I chose to \n     grow cotton and put all the water on it. Now I don't have \n     anything.''\n       In another farmhouse about a mile down the road, Dick \n     Calderon worries how he is going to take care of his wife, \n     twin 4-year-old daughters, a 6-year-old son and his elderly \n     parents living next door, as well as meeting all his \n     financial obligations.\n       Over half of his cotton crop is dying from water \n     contamination, and his alfalfa died due to lack of water.\n       His Federal farm loans are coming due, as are his tractor \n     and equipment loans.\n       Damon and Marie Bond, both 86, rely on income from the farm \n     that the Vasquezes\n\n[[Page S10446]]\n\n     sharecrop for them. This year they will have to live on less. \n     Their cotton crop is also damaged.\n       The Vasquezes, Calderon and the Bondses are among 11 \n     families that have fallen victim to the agriculture disaster.\n       They say they are frustrated they feel the state Department \n     of Agriculture--the lead agency in the investigation of the \n     crop kill--has not given them answers or direction on what \n     they should do with their contaminated crops. Even worse, \n     they said, no one has stepped up to the plate to take \n     responsibility.\n       ``I began watering my cotton with Black River water as I \n     would normally and continued for eight days,'' Vasquez said. \n     ``On July 27, I began to see wilting effects on the cottom \n     fields that I started watering first.''\n       Alarmed, Vasquez contacted the county extension agent to \n     identify the cause.\n       ``I contacted Woods Houghton, and he worked with me to \n     determine what caused the damage,'' Vasquez said. ``He's been \n     the only one who has tried to help us and do right by us.''\n       Houghton's detective work, poring over books and data for \n     many hours, revealed the cotton crop showed classic signs of \n     chemical damage. More sleuthing on his part showed \n     tebuthiuron was the cause.\n       After further investigation, farmers learned the chemical \n     had been applied in the early part of July. On July 18 and \n     19, more than 2 inches of rain fell on the Black River area \n     in a 45-minute period, and the chemical washed into the \n     river.\n       Within days of Vasquez's report of crop losses, other \n     farmers who irrigated shortly after the rain began reporting \n     crop losses that ranged from cotton--the most susceptible to \n     tebuthiuron-to alfalfa and pecan and cottonwood trees.\n       Calderon said the fear is ever present that the family farm \n     could be lost.\n       ``We are going into the third month, and we have not got \n     any answers yet,'' Calderon said. ``The financial stress for \n     me is pretty high right now. I planted 45 acres of cotton, \n     and I've lost over half. I also lost my hay too. I had to \n     stop watering because the water was contaminated. It's dried \n     up, and farming has come to a dead stop for a lot of us. We \n     need some answers. We don't know what to do with what we have \n     in the ground.''\n       Vasquez said no one wants to buy the contaminated cotton. \n     Harvesting it would be financial suicide, he said.\n       ``The cotton market is down, which is bad enough, and then \n     this,'' he said. ``We get about $50 per bale, but when you \n     add up the cost to harvest one bale, it adds up to $135. No \n     one wants to buy damaged cotton, so why would we go to the \n     cost of harvesting it at $135 per bale.''\n       He said the state Department of Agriculture has agreed to \n     one thing: Seed from the contaminated cotton cannot be fed to \n     livestock.\n       ``We sell the seed to the dairies in Roswell,'' Vasquez \n     said. ``They use it to feed the cows. So there is another \n     amrket loss for us.''\n       Vasquez's cousin, Mike Vasquez, said he has lost 25 acres \n     of cotton, and the loss of income will be devastating.\n       ``I have disaster insurance, but I've been told it does not \n     cover manmade disasters,'' he said. `I didn't cause this \n     disaster. The federal government did. I may be poor, but I'm \n     not stupid. Why would I damage my crop that is my livelihood? \n     I'm not that dumb to put down a herbicide in our monsoon \n     season. The BLM, which is the federal government, did that \n     and look what it has brought us (farmers) financial ruin.\n       ``We don't know what this stuff has done to the soil and we \n     don't know for how long the soil will be contaminated. It \n     could be several years. But no one is stepping up to take \n     blame for what has happened. The cotton is still in the \n     gound, and we don't know what to do with it.\n       Mike Vasquez, who retired after 30 years with the city of \n     Carlsbad's water department, said farming supplements his \n     modest retirement income from the city, and he has had many \n     recent sleepless nights worrying how he is going to pay his \n     farm loans.\n       ``The worry is making me physically sick,'' he said. ``We \n     need some answers, and nobody is giving them to us. We also \n     need some financial relief. There has to be someone out there \n     that can give us the answers we need.''\n       Marie Bond, 86, who lives near Oscar and Gloria Vasquez, \n     said the loss of income this year is a blow, but she and her \n     husband will just have to tighten their belts and make do \n     with less.\n       ``Anything that happens to Oscar happens to us,'' she said. \n     ``My husband and I have weathered some rough times in our \n     lives and, although the income from the farm is important, we \n     will make, it. It's a lot harder on Oscar because he has the \n     expenses that have to be paid and there is no money coming in \n     right now,'' she said.\n       ``This is something that should not have happened. It could \n     have been avoided. It's just terrible.''\n\n                                        Department of Agriculture,\n\n\n                                          State of New Mexico,\n\n                                  Las Cruces, NM, October 3, 2002.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Bingaman: We have received complaints from 22 \n     farmers in the Carlsbad region indicating they have crop \n     damage which appears to be from alleged movement of a \n     herbicide from an area treated by the Bureau of Land \n     Management (BLM) and the Natural Resource Conservation \n     Service (NRCS). We are currently investigating the complaints \n     to determine if there were violations of state or federal \n     law. I seek your assistance in providing financial support \n     for the individuals whose crops were damaged.\n       On August 7, 2002, the New Mexico Department of Agriculture \n     (NMDA) received its first complaint regarding crop damage due \n     to alleged movement from an area treated with Tebuthriuron \n     (Spike) in the Three-Mile Draw area. Preliminary \n     investigation indicates the BLM and the NRCS treated \n     approximately 2,400 acres of rangeland. We also found \n     evidence of significant precipitation which occurred after \n     application in the approximate treated area.\n       NMDA has taken samples from the complainants' fields as \n     part of the investigation. Some of the samples analyzed thus \n     far have tested positive for Tebuthiuron. We will continue to \n     analyze the remaining samples and will provide you with the \n     results when they are complete.\n       It is my understanding that some of the complainants have \n     crop insurance; however, chemical related damages are not \n     covered. The affected individuals will suffer a severe \n     financial hardship if assistance is not provided. It is also \n     clear these individuals have suffered losses through no fault \n     of their own. Many are small farmers and may not survive \n     without direct financial assistance.\n       In 2001 Congress authorized the expenditure of not more \n     than $5 million from the Commodity Credit Corporation to pay \n     claims of crop damage that resulted from the BLM's use of \n     herbicides during the 2001 calendar year in the state of \n     Idaho Enclosed is a copy of Section 757 of Public Law 107-76, \n     which provides the funding. Similar consideration should be \n     given to the affected New Mexico farmers. Our investigation \n     is not complete at this time, but I believe it is very \n     important to bring this matter to your attention since the \n     relevant appropriation bills have not been passed by \n     Congress.\n       If you have any questions, please contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Frank A. DuBois.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCAIN:\n  S. 3112. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a deferral of tax on gain from the sale of telecommunications \nbusinesses in specific circumstances or a tax credit and other \nincentives to promote diversity of ownership in telecommunications \nbusinesses; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing The \nTelecommunications Ownership Diversity Act of 2002. This legislation is \ndesigned to ensure that new entrants and small businesses will have the \nchance to participate in today's telecommunications marketplace.\n  At a time when the telecommunications industry is economically \ndepressed, this bill promotes the entry of new competitors and small \nbusinesses into the field by providing carefully limited changes to the \ntax law. Too often today, new entrants and small businesses lose out on \nopportunities to purchase telecom assets because they don't offer \nsellers the same tax treatment as their larger competitors. \nSpecifically, a small purchaser's cash offer triggers tax liability, \nwhile a larger purchaser's cash offer triggers tax liability, while a \nlarger purchaser's stock offer may be accepted effectively tax-free. \nWhen an entity chooses to sell a telecom business, our tax laws should \nnot make one bidder more attractive than another.\n  This legislation would give sellers of telecommunications businesses \na tax deferral when their assets are bought for cash by small business \ntelecom companies. It would also encourage the entry of new players and \nthe growth of existing small businesses by enabling the seller of a \ntelecom business to claim a tax deferral on capital gains if it invests \nthe proceeds of any sale of its business in purchasing an interest in \nan eligible small telecom business.\n  While large companies continue to merge into even larger companies, \nsmall businesses have faced substantial barriers in trying to become \nlong-term players in the telecommunications market. These barriers can \nbe even more formidable for members of minority groups and for women, \nfor whom it has historically been more difficult to obtain necessary \ncapital. Since new entry and the ability to grow existing businesses \nare key components of competition, and since competition is usually the \nmost successful way to achieve the goals of better service and lower \nprices, restricting small business' ownership opportunities does not \nserve consumers' interests.\n\n[[Page S10447]]\n\n  It's easy to forget that telecommunications industry transactions are \nroutinely valued in the billions. Even radio, which has traditionally \nbeen a comparatively easier telecom segment to enter, has been priced \nout of range of most would-be entrants. In addition to these monetary \nbarriers, the tax code makes cash sales less attractive to sellers than \nstock-swaps. So new entrants and smaller incumbents, which typically \nmust finance telecom acquisitions with cash rather than stock, are \nless-preferred purchasers than large incumbents. As a result, telecom \nbusiness sellers have little incentive to sell their businesses to new \nentrants and small incumbents.\n  But what should Congress do? Clamp down on merger activity? Insist \nthat hopelessly-outdated ownership restrictions set by the Federal \nCommunications Commission be retained? Rush to concoct new telecom \nownership ``opportunities'' from government programs or regulations \nthat, in the real world, present small business with only one real \nopportunity, the opportunity to fail? None of these proposals would \nsucceed because all of them, like the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \nignore marketplace realities instead of working with them.\n  One answer is to level the playing field and give established telecom \nindustry players the same economic incentives to deal with new entrants \nand small businesses as they currently have with respect to larger \ncompanies. And that's what this legislation would do.\n  Specifically, the bill would amend the Internal Revenue Code by \nadding a new Section 1071 entitled ``Nonrecognition of gain on certain \nsales of telecommunications business.'' This new section of the tax \ncode would allow a telecom business seller to elect to have capital \ngains deferred under the existing Section 1033 rules for any \n``qualified telecommunications sale.'' The aggregate amount of any gain \ndeferred under the qualified sale would be limited to $250 million per \ntransaction, and less than $84 million per taxable year.\n  A qualified telecommunications sale would be defined in two ways. The \nfirst type of qualified sale would be sales to an ``eligible \npurchaser'' of either the assets of a telecom business or the stock \nthat makes up a controlling interest in a corporation with \nsubstantially all of its assets in one or more telecom businesses. \nEligible purchasers would include economically and socially \ndisadvantaged businesses that qualify under a carefully drawn three-\npart test. The second type of qualified sale would be the sale of any \ntelecom business to any purchaser, as long as the seller reinvests the \nproceeds in equity interests in eligible small telecom businesses.\n  To account for the variety of telecommunications services available \ntoday, the legislation would broadly define telecommunications \nbusinesses eligible for capital gains tax deferral to include not only \nradio, broadcast TV, DBS, and cable TV, but also wireline and wireless \ntelephone service providers and resellers.\n  Some may be concerned that this legislation could potentially allow \nentities seeking to ``game the system'' to set up eligible purchasers \nto take advantage of the bill's provisions. In order to eliminate the \npotential for abuse, the bill would require the eligible purchaser to \nhold any property acquired for three years, during which time it could \nonly so sold to an unrelated eligible purchaser. Moreover, the bill \nwould require the General Accounting Office to thoroughly audit and \nreport on the administration and effect of the law every two years.\n  By sharing with smaller companies a portion of the investment \nbenefits our tax laws give to the major telecom companies we have a \nchance to make sure that, at the end of the day, we won't regret what \n``might have been'' for small business. By enabling individuals and \nsmall businesses to use industry restructurings as opportunities for \nexpansion, we will keep faith with those who have been, and remain, \nenduringly valuable contributors to our free-market system.\n  Over the next several months, I look forward to working with \ninterested organizations to further improve this legislation. In \nparticular, I welcome comments on how to further refine the concepts of \n``qualified telecommunications business'' and ``eligible purchaser'' to \nensure that this legislation can meet its goals in the most fair and \neffective manner.\n  Revolutionary developments in the telecommunications industry have \nbeen made by gifted individuals with small companies and unlimited \nvision. In this sense, the telecommunciaitons industry is a true \nmicrocosm of the American free-market system. New entrants and small \nbusinesses should have a fair chance to participate across the broad \nspectrum of industries that will make up the telecommunications \nindustry in the Information Age. This legislation will help them do \nthat.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3112\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Telecommunications Ownership \n     Diversification Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Current trends in the telecommunications industry show \n     that there is increasing convergence among various media, \n     including broadcasting, cable television, and Internet-based \n     businesses, that provide news, information, and \n     entertainment.\n       (2) This convergence will continue, and therefore, \n     diversifying the ownership of telecommunications facilities \n     remains a pre-eminent public interest concern that should be \n     reflected in both telecommunications and tax policy.\n       (3) A market-based, voluntary system of investment \n     incentives is a very effective, lawful, and economically \n     sound means of facilitating entry and diversification of \n     ownership in the telecommunications industry.\n       (4) Opportunities for new entrants to participate and grow \n     in the telecommunications industry have substantially \n     decreased since the end of the Federal Communications \n     Commission's tax certificate policy in 1995, particularly in \n     light of the increase in tax-free like-kind exchanges, \n     despite the most robust period of transfers of radio and \n     television stations in history. During this time, businesses \n     owned or controlled by socially disadvantaged individuals, \n     including, but not limited to, members of minority groups and \n     women, have continued to be under represented as owners of \n     telecommunications facilities.\n       (5) Businesses owned or controlled by socially \n     disadvantaged individuals are and historically have been \n     economically disadvantaged in the telecommunications \n     industry. For these businesses, access to and cost of capital \n     are and have been substantial obstacles to new entry and \n     growth. Consequently, diversification of ownership in the \n     telecommunications industry has been limited.\n       (6) Telecommunications facilities owned by new entrants may \n     not be attractive to investors because their start-up costs \n     are often high, their revenue streams are uncertain, and \n     their profit margins are unknown.\n       (7) It is consistent with the public interest and with the \n     pro-competition policies of the Telecommunications Act of \n     1996 to provide incentives that will facilitate investments \n     in, and acquisition of telecommunications facilities by, \n     socially and economically disadvantaged businesses, thereby \n     diversifying the ownership of telecommunications facilities.\n       (8) Increased participation by socially and economically \n     disadvantaged businesses in the ownership of \n     telecommunications facilities will enhance competition in the \n     telecommunications industry. Permitting sellers of \n     telecommunications facilities to defer taxation of gains from \n     transactions involving socially and economically \n     disadvantaged businesses, and resulting from investments in \n     designated capital funds that provide capital for such \n     entities, will further the development of a competitive and \n     diverse United States telecommunications industry without \n     governmental intrusion in private investment decisions.\n       (9) The public interest would not be served by attempts to \n     diversify the ownership of telecommunications; businesses \n     through any approach that would involve the use of mandated \n     set-asides or quotas.\n       (10) Today, the telecommunications industry is struggling \n     to survive one of its most troubling times. Therefore, \n     facilitating voluntary, pro-competitive transactions that \n     will promote ownership of telecommunications facilities by \n     economically and socially disadvantaged businesses will aid \n     in providing the investment and capital that is crucial to \n     this sector.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to facilitate \n     voluntary, pro-competitive transactions that will promote \n     ownership of telecommunications facilities by economically \n     and socially disadvantaged businesses.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 341\n\n       Whereas Thanksgiving Day celebrates the spirit of selfless \n     giving and an appreciation for family and friends;\n       Whereas the spirit of Thanksgiving Day is a virtue upon \n     which our Nation was founded;\n       Whereas 33,000,000 Americans, including 13,000,000 \n     children, continue to live in households that do not have an \n     adequate supply of food;\n       Whereas almost 3,000,000 of those children experience \n     hunger; and\n       Whereas selfless sacrifice breeds a genuine spirit of \n     Thanksgiving, both affirming and restoring fundamental \n     principles in our society: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate\n       (1) designates Thursday, November 21, 2002, as ``Feed \n     America Thursday''; and\n       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation \n     calling upon the people of the United States to sacrifice 2 \n     meals on Thursday, November 21, 2002, and to donate the money \n     that they would have spent on food to a religious or \n     charitable organization of their choice for the purpose of \n     feeding the hungry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 153--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE CONGRESS \n  THAT THERE SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED AN ANNUAL NATIONAL VISITING NURSE \n                           ASSOCIATIONS WEEK\n\n  Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Feingold) submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 153\n\n       Whereas visiting nurse associations are nonprofit home \n     health agencies that, for over 120 years, have been united in \n     their mission to provide cost-effective and compassionate \n     home and community-based health care to individuals, \n     regardless of the individuals' condition or ability to pay \n     for services;\n       Whereas there are approximately 500 visiting nurse \n     associations, which employ more than 90,000 clinicians, \n     provide health care to more than 4,000,000 people each year, \n     and provide a critical safety net in communities by \n     developing a network of community support services that \n     enable individuals to live independently at home;\n       Whereas visiting nurse associations have historically \n     served as primary public health care providers in their \n     communities, and are today one of the largest providers of \n     mass immunizations in the medicare program (delivering over \n     2,500,000 influenza immunizations annually);\n       Whereas visiting nurse associations are often the home \n     health providers of last resort, serving the most chronic of \n     conditions (such as congestive heart failure, chronic \n     obstructive pulmonary disease, AIDS, and quadriplegia) and \n     individuals with the least ability to pay for services (more \n     than 50 percent of all medicaid home health admissions are by \n     visiting nurse associations);\n       Whereas any visiting nurse association budget surplus is \n     reinvested in supporting the association's mission through \n     services, including charity care, adult day care centers, \n     wellness clinics, Meals-on-Wheels, and immunization programs;\n       Whereas visiting nurse associations and other nonprofit \n     home health agencies care for the highest percentage of \n     terminally ill and bedridden patients;\n       Whereas thousands of visiting nurse association volunteers \n     across the Nation devote time serving as individual agency \n     board members, raising funds, visiting patients in their \n     homes, assisting in wellness clinics, and delivering meals to \n     patients; and\n       Whereas the establishment of an annual National Visiting \n     Nurse Associations Week for the second full week of every \n     February would increase public awareness of the charity-based \n     missions of visiting nurse associations and of their ability \n     to meet the needs of chronically ill and disabled individuals \n     who prefer to live at home rather than in a nursing home, and \n     would spotlight preventive health clinics, adult day care \n     programs, and other customized wellness programs that meet \n     local community need: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that there \n     should be established an annual National Visiting Nurse \n     Associations Week.\n  Mr. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nWisconsin, Senator Russ Feingold, in introducing a bill to establish an \nannual National Visiting Nurse Associations Week in honor of this army \nof health care heroes who are dedicated to service in the ultimate \ncaring profession.\n  The Visiting Nurse Associations, VNAs, of today are founded on the \nprinciple that the sick, the disabled and the elderly benefit most from \nhealth care when it is offered in their own homes. Home care is an \nincreasingly important part of our health care system today. The kinds \nof highly skilled, and often technically complex, services that the \nVNAs provide have enabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable \npatients to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where they \nwant to be, in the comfort and security of their own homes.\n  Visiting Nurse Associations are non-profit home health agencies that \nprovide cost-effective and compassionate home and community-based \nhealth care to individuals, regardless of their condition or ability to \npay for services. VNAs literally created the profession and practice of \nhome health care more than one hundred years ago, at a time when there \nwere no hospitals in many communities and patients were cared for at \nhome by families who did the best they could. VNAs made a critical \ndifference to these families, bringing professional skills into the \nhome to care for the patient and support the family. They made a \ncritical difference in the late 19th century, and are making a critical \ndifference now as we embark upon the 21st.\n  VNAs were pioneers in the public health movement, and, in the late \n1800s, VNA responsiveness meant milk banks, combating infectious \ndiseases, and providing care for the poor during massive influenza \nepidemics. Today, that same responsiveness means caring for the \ndependent elderly, the chronically disabled, the terminally ill, and \nproviding high-tech services previously provided in hospitals, such as \nventilator care, blood transfusions, pain management and home \nchemotherapy.\n  Health care has gone full circle. Patients are spending less time in \nthe hospital. More and more procedures are being done on an outpatient \nbasis, and recovery and care for patients with chronic diseases and \nconditions has increasingly been taking place in the home. Moreover, \nthe number of Americans who are chronically ill or disabled in some way \ncontinues to grow each year. Once again, VNAs are making a critical \ndifference, providing comprehensive home health services and caring \nsupport to patients and their families across the country.\n  Through these exceptional organizations, 90,000 clinicians dedicate \ntheir lives to bringing health care into the homes of over four million \nAmericans every year. VNAs are truly the heart of home care in this \ncountry today, and it is time for Congress to recognize the\n\n[[Page S10451]]\n\nvital services that visiting nurses provide to their patients and their \nfamilies. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Feingold and me in \ncosponsoring this resolution establishing an annual National Visiting \nNurse Associations' Week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10451-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4879.

Mr. President, as Chairman of the Committee on \nVeterans Affairs, I urge my colleagues to pass H.R. 3253, the proposed \n``Department of Veterans Affairs Emergency Preparedness Act,'' as it \nwill be modified by a manager's amendment.\n  The pending measure represents a compromise agreement on an omnibus \nbill that would ensure that VA can capably fulfill its obligations to \nveterans, the military, and the entire Nation during disasters. H.R. \n3253 would not only preserve veterans services during national \nemergencies, but would take advantage of VA's expertise in the medical \nconsequences of weapons of mass destruction to protect all Americans.\n  This legislation would establish four medical emergency preparedness \nresearch centers within the VA health care system. Although my \ncolleagues may not be surprised to learn about VA's research expertise \nin the long-term health consequences of biological, chemical, and \nradiological exposures, fewer may be aware of VA's unparalleled \nclinical management research program. The centers authorized by H.R. \n3253 would allow VA's experts to develop practices for managing or \npreventing mass casualties resulting from the use of terrorist weapons, \nand to do so within our evolving National strategy for homeland \nsecurity research.\n  H.R. 3253, as amended, would also authorize a new Assistant \nSecretary, requested by the administration, to coordinate VA's internal \nand interagency operations, security, preparedness, and law enforcement \nactivities. This measure would also clarify the Secretary's \npreparedness duties, which would include ensuring that VA's 105,000 \nhealthcare professionals--and the additional 81,000 providers trained \nin VA facilities each year--receive the education and training that \nthey need to protect themselves and their patients during disasters.\n  Finally, this measure would recognize the role that VA--the largest \nintegrated healthcare system in the Nation already plays during \ndisasters. In 1982, Public Law 97-174 assigned a new duty to VA: \nserving as the contingency medical system to the Department of Defense \nduring conflicts and emergencies, which Congress assumed would mean \ncaring for wounded troops as they returned home from war. In 1982, no \none anticipated that VA might be called upon to care for active duty \nmilitary casualties during a domestic disaster.\n  H.R. 3253 as amended acknowledges that we no longer have the luxury \nof ignoring that possibility, and authorizes VA to extend care to \nactive duty military casualties injured while fulfilling their duties \nduring a conflict or disaster on American soil as well as abroad.\n  The legislation would also acknowledge VA's role in protecting public \nhealth during emergencies. As part of the Federal Response Plan for \ndisasters and a cornerstone of the National Disaster Medical System, VA \ncaregivers have aided overwhelmed communities during every major \ndomestic disaster of the last two decades. After the Oklahoma City \nattack, after Hurricanes Andrew and Floyd, during Houston's disastrous \nfloods, and in New York City\n\n[[Page S10476]]\n\non September 11 of last year, VA medical professionals stepped up to \ncare for victims--not only veterans, but anyone in need.\n  VA medical centers are more than just the backbone of the Federal \nclinical infrastructure, they are integral parts of communities, and \nthose communities turn to them during crises. The compromise agreement \nhighlights this mission, authorizing VA to provide medical care to \nthose affected by or responding to declared disasters, or following \nactivation of the National Disaster Medical System. I wish to stress to \nmy colleagues that this reflects VA's already enormous contribution to \npublic safety, a mission that VA will carry out in the future as part \nof the Nation's homeland security strategy.\n  Following last year's attacks, Congress sought new tools and new \nstrategies to protect the American people from the suddenly evident \nthreat posed by terrorists wielding weapons of mass destruction. We \nlearned--at the price of five lives lost and months of fear, confusion, \nand the disruption of the Senate that our public health resources and \nour scientific expertise could be overwhelmed by a biological assault \naimed at a handful of public figures.\n  We must do more than bemoan the slow starvation of our public health \ncare system, the chronic underfunding of the laboratories that detect \noutbreaks, and the managed care principles that have stripped away our \nhospitals' surge capacity. We must use the resources at hand as \nefficiently as possible to ready ourselves for whatever disasters may \ncome.\n  In conclusion, I want to thank Senator Specter and his staff Bill \nTuerk, Bill Cahill, and David Goetz for diligently working with me and \nmy staff Kim Lipsky and Julie Fischer to craft this legislation. I \nwould also like to thank my colleagues on the House Committee on \nVeterans Affairs, particularly Chairman Christopher Smith and his staff \nPat Ryan, Kingston Smith, Jeannie McNally, Peter Dickinson, Kathleen \nGreve, and John Bradley and Ranking Member Lane Evans and his staff, \nMichael Durishin and Susan Edgerton, for their essential contributions \nto this legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support these preparedness improvements for \nveterans and VA. This bipartisan measure represents a vital step in \nensuring VA's preparedness, with a potentially enormous pay-off in \npublic safety.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate concur in the \nHouse amendment with a further amendment, which is at the desk, that \nthe amendment be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4883) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10476-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10476-S10479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JOBS FOR VETERANS ACT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask unanimous consent that the Veterans Affairs \nCommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 4015, and \nthe Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4015) to amend title 38, of the United States \n     Code, to revise and improve employment, training and \n     placement services furnished to veterans, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I am pleased the Senate supports H.R. 4015, the \nproposed ``Jobs for Veterans Act,'' as modified by a Manager's \nAmendment which reflects a final compromise developed by the House and \nSenate Veterans' Affairs Committees. This legislation would improve the \nemployment, training and placement services furnished to the men and \nwomen who have served our Nation.\n  At the conclusion of World War II, Congress made job placement for \nveterans a national priority. Legislation passed then created special \nemployment services for returning troops, establishing hiring \npriorities for veterans in federal employment and giving them early \nnotice of jobs in the private sector.\n  Later, Congress provided grants to states to hire experts with \nexperience in placing veterans into civilian jobs. These experts, \ncalled Local Veterans' Employment Representatives and Disabled Veterans \nOutreach Program Specialists, serve veterans through state employment \nservice offices and one-stop centers. Currently, the funding to hire \nthese specialists is provided by a rigid formula that affords states \nlittle flexibility in allocating personnel for veterans' employment \nservices.\n  The Jobs for Veterans Act would change this formula, and would remove \nrestrictions on how states can employ these experts in veterans' \nemployment. I expect that these changes will enable the Department of \nLabor to rise above the criticism the veterans employment programs have \nrecently drawn. These necessary changes would allow states to tailor \ntheir employment services to better serve our Nation's veterans.\n  Mr. President, the ``Jobs for Veterans Act'' would additionally \nrestore priority of service to veterans, and spouses of certain \nveterans, for employment, training and placement and extend it to any \njob training program administered by the Department of Labor. \nAdditionally, the Secretary of Labor would be authorized to set \npriorities among eligible veterans and spouses by taking into account \ntheir special needs.\n  H.R. 4015 would also modify the threshold that determines when \nFederal contractors and subcontractors must take affirmative action to \nemploy--and to advance in employment--qualified veterans, including \nimmediately listing employment openings for such contracts. This \nmodified threshhold keeps pace with inflation, and provides the Office \nof Contract Compliance with a manageable amount of contracts to oversee \nand assure that contractors are meeting their obligations.\n  This legislation would also provide special financial and \nnonfinancial incentives to state employees to encourage them to develop \nimproved and modern employment services for veterans. The awards would \nbe administered through the states, based on criteria established by \nthe Secretary of Labor in consultation with the states.\n  In some states, certain economic obstacles may create serious \nchallenges to finding appropriate job placements for veterans. The \n``Jobs for Veterans Act'' would allow the Secretary of Labor to give \ntechnical assistance to states that might need help in finding \nsolutions, and would mandate that the state develop and implement a \ncorrective plan to be approved by the Secretary.\n  As we ask the young men and women of this Nation to prepare \nthemselves to take up arms in its defense, we must ensure that we will \nbe able to help them find productive careers upon their return as we \ndid for the previous generations that defended our freedoms. I am \npleased colleagues have joined in supporting this bill on behalf of \nthose who have served, and those who will serve in the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the accompanying joint \nexplanatory statement be printed in the Record following this \nstatement.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Summary of H.R. 4015, as Amended by a Manager's Amendment\n\n\n                         jobs for veterans act\n\n       Revises and improves employment, training and placement \n     services furnished to veterans.\n       Provides priority of service (over non-veterans) to \n     veterans and spouses of certain veterans in job training \n     programs funded by the Department of Labor.\n       Revises the current formula for funding veterans employment \n     service providers in State employment offices, and removes \n     restrictions on how they are used by the State. This is to \n     give States greater flexibility in how they provide \n     employment, training and placement services to veterans.\n       Modifies the threshold for when Federal contractors and \n     subcontractors must take affirmative action to employ and \n     advance in employment qualified veterans, including \n     immediately listing employment openings for such contracts.\n       Promotes employment and job advancement opportunities \n     within the Federal government for disabled veterans, veterans \n     who served in a military operation for which a service medal \n     was awarded, and recently separated veterans by removing an \n     eligibility restriction that allowed only Vietnam veterans to \n     participate in these opportunities.\n\n[[Page S10477]]\n\n       Establishes financial and non-financial incentive awards \n     for state employees who furnish quality employment, training \n     and placement services to veterans.\n       Requires the Department of Labor to set performance \n     standards for states and when those standards are not met for \n     a corrective action plan be submitted to the Secretary for \n     approval.

H.R. 4015, as amended, passed the House of \n     Representatives on May 21, 2002. There is no comparable \n     Senate bill.\n       The House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs have \n     prepared the following explanation of H.R. 4015, as amended, \n     (``Compromise Agreement''). Clerical corrections, conforming \n     changes, and minor drafting, technical, and clarifying \n     changes are not noted in this document.\n\n\n priority of service for veterans in department of labor job training \n                                programs\n\n     Current law\n       Section 4212 of title 38, United States Code, requires that \n     for certain Federal contracts of $25,000 or more, contractors \n     and subcontractors take affirmative action to employ and \n     advance in employment ``special disabled veterans'' (veterans \n     with serious employment handicaps or disability ratings of 30 \n     percent or higher), Vietnam-era veterans, recently-separated \n     veterans, and other veterans who are ``preference eligible.'' \n     Preference eligible veterans generally are veterans who have \n     served during wartime or in a campaign or expedition for \n     which a campaign badge has been authorized.\n       Under section 4214 of title 38, United States Code, the \n     Office of Personnel Management administers the Veterans \n     Readjustment Appointment (``VRA'') authority program to \n     promote employment and job advancement opportunities within \n     the Federal government for disabled veterans, certain \n     veterans of the Vietnam era, and veterans of the post-Vietnam \n     era who are qualified for such employment and advancement. In \n     general: (1) such appointments may be made up to and \n     including the GS-11 level or its equivalent; (2) a veteran \n     shall be eligible for such an appointment without regard to \n     the veteran's number of years of education; (3) a veteran who \n     receives VA disability compensation shall be given preference \n     for a VRA appointment over other veterans; (4) upon receipt \n     of a VRA appointment, a veteran may receive training or \n     education if the veteran has less than 15 years of education; \n     and (5) upon successful completion of the prescribed \n     probation period, a veteran may acquire competitive status. \n     Except for a veteran who has a service-connected disability \n     rated at 30 percent or more, a veteran of the Vietnam era may \n     receive a VRA appointment only during the period ending 10 \n     years after the date of the veteran's last separation from \n     active duty or December 31, 1995, whichever is later.\n     House bill\n       Section 2 of H.R. 4015 would create a new section 4215 \n     within chapter 42 of title 38, United States Code, to provide \n     priority of service (over non-veterans) to veterans and \n     spouses of certain veterans for the receipt of employment, \n     training, and placement services in any qualified job \n     training program directly funded, in whole or in part, by the \n     Department of Labor, notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law. The Secretary of Labor would be authorized to establish \n     priorities among such covered persons to take into account \n     the needs of disabled veterans and such other factors as the \n     Secretary determines appropriate.\n       With respect to Federal contracts and subcontracts in the \n     amount of $100,000 or more, section 2 would provide that a \n     contractor and any subcontractor take affirmative action to \n     employ and advance in employment qualified veterans. This \n     would include immediate listing of employment openings for \n     such contracts through the appropriate employment delivery \n     system.\n       Section 2 would also change the Veterans Readjustment \n     Appointment (``VRA'') to the ``Veterans Recruitment \n     Appointment'' authority and change eligibility for these \n     appointments from Vietnam era and post-Vietnam era veterans \n     to qualified covered veterans (see below) within the 10-year \n     period that begins on the date of the veteran's last \n     discharge, the 10-year period would not apply to a veteran \n     with a service-connected disability of 30 percent or more.\n       Finally, section 2 would make eligible as ``covered \n     veterans'' for Federal contracts and subcontracts and the \n     Veterans Recruitment Appointment authority: disabled \n     veterans; veterans who served on active duty during a war or \n     in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has \n     been authorized; veterans who, while serving on active duty \n     in the Armed Forces, participated in a United States military \n     operation for which an Armed Forces service medal was \n     awarded; or veterans discharged or released from military \n     service within the past three years.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 2 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language with amendments.\n       The agreement would delete the 10-year eligibility period \n     for a VRA appointment, in light of the broader Veterans \n     Recruitment (not ``Readjustment'') Appointment authority \n     embodied in the Compromise Agreement.\n       The Committees note that the definition of the term \n     ``covered person'' for priority of service in Department of \n     Labor veterans job training programs includes both veterans \n     and certain spouses and surviving spouses of deceased \n     veterans. Specifically, the provision would include a \n     surviving spouse of a veteran who died as a result of a \n     service-connected disability, including the surviving spouse \n     of a veteran who died in the active military, naval or air \n     service, and the surviving spouse of a veteran who was \n     totally disabled at the time of death. The provision would \n     also apply to spouses of active duty servicemembers who \n     have for a period of at least 90 days been missing in \n     action, captured by a hostile force or forcibly detained \n     or interned in line of duty by a foreign government and \n     the spouses of veterans who are totally disabled due to a \n     service-connected disability.\n\n\n financial and non-financial performance incentive awards for quality \n         veterans employment, training, and placement services\n\n     Current law\n       No provision.\n     House bill\n       Section 3 of H.R. 4015 would create a new section 4112 \n     within chapter 41 of title 38, United States Code, to require \n     the Secretary to carry out a program of performance incentive \n     awards to States to encourage improvement and modernization \n     of employment, training and placement services to veterans. \n     The Secretary would provide greater amounts to States that \n     furnish the highest quality of services, but also would \n     provide awards to States that have made significant \n     improvements in services. States could use such awards to \n     States that have made significant improvements in services. \n     States could use such awards to hire additional State \n     veterans' employment and training staff for such other \n     purposes relating to these services that the Secretary may \n     approve. Awards would be obligated by the State during the \n     program year in which the award was received and the \n     subsequent program year.\n       Section 3 also would authorize additional funds to be \n     appropriated for the Secretary to carry out the program of \n     performance incentive awards in the following amounts: $10 \n     million for the program year beginning in fiscal year 2004; \n     $25 million for the program year beginning in fiscal year \n     2005; $50 million for the program year beginning in fiscal \n     year 2006; $75 million for the program year beginning in \n     fiscal year 2007; and $100 million for the program year \n     beginning in fiscal year 2008.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 3 of the Compromise Agreement would establish a \n     system of financial and non-financial incentive awards to be \n     administered by the States, based on criteria established by \n     the Secretary in consultation with the States. Disabled \n     Veterans Outreach Program Specialists (``DVOP''), Local \n     Veterans Employment Representatives (``LVER''), Workforce \n     Investment Act (``WIA''), and Wagner-Peyser staffs would be \n     eligible for each award. Beginning in program years during or \n     after fiscal year 2004, the Secretary would be required to \n     identify and assign one percent of the annual grant to each \n     State for the State to use as a performance incentive \n     financial award (see section 4). Under this section, each \n     State would be required to describe how it would administer \n     this award in its annual grant application to the Secretary \n     (see section 4). States would also administer the non-\n     financial performance incentive award program based on \n     criteria established by the Secretary.\n       The Committees intend that the Secretary's criteria be \n     broad in order to give States maximum flexibility in the \n     manner chosen to recognize employees for excellence in \n     service delivery to veterans or improvements thereto. The \n     Committees also intend that States use Salary and Expense \n     (S) funds to pay for such items as employee recognition \n     plaques and other modest forms of recognition, as part of the \n     non-financial performance incentive awards program.\n\n\n  refinement of job training and placement functions of the department\n\n     Current law\n       Chapter 41 of title 38, United States Code, establishes \n     policies governing the administration of veterans' employment \n     and training services by the States, as funded by Department \n     of Labor funds.\n       Section 4101 of title 38, United States Code, defines terms \n     used in the chapter, such as ``disabled veteran,'' ``eligible \n     person,'' and ``local employment service office.''\n       In section 4102, Congress declares as its intent and \n     purpose that there shall be an effective: (1) job and \n     training counseling service program; (2) employment placement \n     service program; and (3) job training placement service \n     program for eligible veterans and eligible persons.\n       Section 4102A specifies the job duties of the Assistant \n     Secretary of Labor for Veterans'\n\n[[Page S10478]]\n\n     Employment and Training (``ASVET'') and Regional \n     Administrators for Veterans' Employment and Training \n     (``RAVET''). The RAVET is required to be a veteran. The \n     Deputy Assistant Secretary for Veterans Employment and \n     Training (``DASVET'') is also required to be a veteran. The \n     ASVET need not be a veteran.\n       Section 4103 prescribes in detail the 15 job duties of \n     Directors (``DVET'') and Assistant Directors (``ADVET'') of \n     Veterans' Employment and Training. It also requires that the \n     Secretary of Labor assign to each State one ADVET for every \n     250,000 veterans and eligible persons in the State veteran's \n     population.\n       Section 4103A prescribes the appointment of one DVOP for \n     every 7,400 veterans who are between the ages of 20 and 64 \n     residing in each State. This section also requires that each \n     DVOP be a veteran and specifies that preference be given to \n     qualified disabled veterans in filling these positions. It \n     prescribes where a DVOP is to be stationed in furnishing \n     services and the specific functions that DVOPs perform.\n       Section 4104 requires that in any fiscal year funding be \n     available to the States to employ 1,600 full-time LVERs. This \n     section prescribes that funding furnished to the States for \n     LVERs shall be assigned in each States on January 1, 1987, \n     plus one additional LVER per State. This section also \n     specifies in detail the manner in which the 1,600 LVERs shall \n     be allocated to the States, and the manner in which the \n     States shall assign LVERs to local employment service offices \n     based on the number of veterans and eligible persons \n     who register for assistance. This section also requires \n     that in appointing LVERs, preference shall be given to \n     qualified eligible veterans or eligible persons. \n     Preference is accorded first to qualified eligible \n     veterans, and then to qualified eligible persons. Lastly, \n     this section prescribes the specific functions that LVERs \n     shall perform.\n       Section 4104A requires that each State employment agency \n     develop and apply DVOP and LVER programs. It requires the \n     Secretary to furnish prototype standards to the States. This \n     section also requires DVETs and ADVETs to furnish appropriate \n     assistance to States in developing and implementing such \n     standards.\n       Section 4106 requires the Secretary to estimate the funds \n     necessary for the proper and efficient administration of \n     chapters 41, 42, and 43 of title 38, United States Code. This \n     section authorizes such sums as may be necessary for \n     administration of chapter 41 services, including the National \n     Veterans' Employment and Training Services Institute \n     (``NVETSI'').\n       In general, section 4107 of title 38, United States Code, \n     requires the Secretary of Labor to establish and carry out \n     various administrative controls to ensure veterans and \n     eligible persons receive job placement, job training, or some \n     other form of assistance such as individual job development \n     or employment counseling services. This section also requires \n     the Secretary to submit to the Committees on Veterans' \n     Affairs of the House and Senate not later than February 1 of \n     each year, a report on the success during the previous \n     program year of the Department of Labor (``DOL'') and State \n     employment service agencies in furnishing veterans' \n     employment and training services.\n       Section 4109 requires that the Secretary make available \n     such funds as may be necessary to operate a NVETSI for \n     training DVOP, LVER, DVET, ADVET, and RAVET personnel.\n     House bill\n       Section 4 of H.R. 4015 would amend sections 4102A, 4103, \n     4103A, 4104, and 4109 of title 38, United States Code.\n       Section 4 of H.R. 4015 would amend current law section \n     4102A, of title 38, United States Code. The ASVET would be \n     required to be a veteran. It also would impose new \n     qualifications for the position of DASVET. In doing so, it \n     would make this position a career federal civil service \n     position. The individual appointed to this position would be \n     required to have at least five years of continuous Federal \n     service in the executive branch immediately preceding \n     appointment as Deputy Assistant Secretary, and to be a \n     veteran.\n       This section would set forth conditions for receipt of \n     funding by States to include a requirement that a State \n     submit an application for a grant or contract describing the \n     manner in which the State would furnish employment, training, \n     and placement services. A service delivery plan would include \n     a description of the DVOP and LVER duties assigned by the \n     State and other matters.\n       Section 4 would revise the methods by which the Secretary \n     furnishes funds to a State. It would require the Secretary to \n     make funds available for a fiscal year to each State in \n     proportion to the number of veterans seeking employment using \n     such criteria as the Secretary may establish in regulations. \n     Under this section, the proportion of funding would reflect \n     the ratio of the total number of veterans residing in the \n     State who are seeking employment to the total number of \n     veterans seeking employment in all States.\n       Section 4 also would require:\n       1. A state to annually submit to the Secretary of Labor an \n     application for a grant or contract that includes a plan \n     describing the manner in which the State would furnish \n     employment, training, and placement services, with a \n     description of DVOP and LVER duties assigned by the State. \n     The plan would also be required to describe the manner in \n     which DVOPs and LVERs would be integrated into the employment \n     service delivery systems in the State, the veteran population \n     to be served, and additional information the Secretary might \n     require;\n       2. The Secretary to make available to each State based on \n     an application approved by the Secretary, an amount of \n     funding in proportion to the number of veterans seeking \n     employment using such criteria as the Secretary might \n     establish in regulation, including civilian labor force and \n     unemployment data;\n       3. The Secretary to phase-in such annual funding over the \n     three fiscal year-periods that begin on October 1, 2002;\n       4. The Secretary to establish minimum funding levels and \n     hold-harmless criteria in administering funding to the \n     States;\n       5. The State to develop and implement a corrective action \n     plan to be submitted to the Secretary when a State has an \n     entered-employment rate that the Secretary determines is \n     deficient for the proceeding year;\n       6. The Secretary to establish by regulation a uniform \n     national threshold entered-employment rate for a program year \n     by which determinations of deficiency might be made. The \n     Secretary would be required to take into account applicable \n     annual unemployment data for the State and consider other \n     factors, such as prevailing economic conditions, that affect \n     performance of individuals providing employment, training, \n     and placement services in the State;\n       7. The State to notify the Secretary on an annual basis of, \n     and provide a supporting rationale for, each non-veteran who \n     is employed as a DVOP and LVER for a period in excess of six \n     months;\n       8. The Secretary to assign to each region a representative \n     of the Veterans' Employment and Training Service (``VETS'') \n     to serve as RAVET. The RAVET would be required to be a \n     veteran; and\n       9. The ASVET to establish and implement a comprehensive \n     accountability system to measure the performance of delivery \n     systems in a State. The accountability system would be \n     required to be (1) consistent with State performance measures \n     applicable under section 136(b) of the Workforce Investment \n     Act of 1998, and (2) appropriately weighted to provide \n     special consideration for veterans requiring intensive \n     services and for veterans who enroll in readjustment \n     counseling services furnished by the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs.\n       Supervisory Personnel. Section 4 would also amend current \n     section 4103 of title 38, United States Code, to authorize \n     the Secretary to assign as supervisory personnel such \n     representatives of VETS as the Secretary determines \n     appropriate. It would also replace the specific requirements \n     for appointment of ADVET with a more flexible authority to \n     appoint supervisory personnel.\n       Disabled Veterans Outreach Program Specialist. This section \n     would amend current section 4103A of title 38, United States \n     Code, to require, subject to approval by the Secretary, that \n     States employ a sufficient number of full or parttime DVOPs \n     to carry out intensive services to meet the employment needs \n     of special disabled veterans, other disabled veterans and \n     other eligible veterans. It would require to the maximum \n     extent practicable, that such employees be qualified \n     veterans. Preference would be given to qualified disabled \n     veterans.\n       Local Veterans Employment Specialists. Section 4 would \n     amend current law section 4104 of title 38, United States \n     Code, by requiring, subject to approval by the Secretary, \n     that a State employ such full and part-time LVERs as the \n     State determines appropriate and efficient to carry out \n     employment, training, and placement services. It would \n     require, to the maximum extent practicable, that such \n     employees be qualified veterans.\n       This section would require that each LVER be \n     administratively responsible to the manager of the employment \n     service delivery system. Under this section, the LVER would \n     provide reports, not less frequently than quarterly, to the \n     manager of such office and to the DVET for the State \n     regarding compliance with Federal law and regulations with \n     respect to special services and priorities for eligible \n     veterans and eligible persons.\n       National Veterans' Employment and Training Services \n     Institute. Additionally, section 4 would amend current \n     section 4109 of title 38, United States Code, to clarify the \n     authority of the NVETSI to enter into contracts or agreements \n     with departments or agencies of the United States or of a \n     State, or with other organizations, to carry out training in \n     providing veterans' employment, training, and placement \n     services. Further, it would require that each annual budget \n     submission include a separate listing of the amount of \n     funding proposed for NVETSI.\n       Finally, section 4 would require that the Secretary, within \n     18 months of enactment, enhance the delivery of services by \n     providing ``one-stop'' services and assistance to covered \n     persons by way of the Internet and by other electronic means.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 4 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language with amendments.\n       Under this section, the individual appointed as DASVET \n     would be required to have at least five years of service in a \n     management position as a Federal civil service employee or \n     comparable service in a management position in the Armed \n     Forces preceding appointment as DASVET.\n       The annual grant application plan submitted by the States \n     would have an additional requirement to describe the manner \n     in\n\n[[Page S10479]]\n\n     which the respective States would administer the performance \n     incentives established in section 3. The Committees note that \n     other aspects of the State plan and grant application \n     requirements contained in the House-passed bill, such as \n     describing DVOP and LVER duties, are retained.\n       The Compromise Agreement clarifies that State corrective \n     action plans would be submitted to the Secretary for \n     approval, and if approved, would be expeditiously \n     implemented. If the Secretary disapproves a corrective action \n     plan, the Secretary would be required to take such steps as \n     would be necessary for the State to implement corrective \n     actions.\n       The Secretary would also be required to identify and assign \n     one percent of the funding grant to each State to establish \n     financial performance incentive awards. Further, the \n     Secretary would have on-going authority to furnish technical \n     assistance to any State that the Secretary determines has, or \n     may have, a deficient entered-employment rate, including \n     assistance in developing a corrective action plan.\n       The Committees intend that the Secretary should offer \n     technical assistance in an anticipatory way, so as to avoid \n     deficient performance.\n       The Compromise Agreement would require that the DVET be a \n     bona fide resident of the State for two years to qualify for \n     such a position.\n       Lastly, the Compromise Agreement does not require that the \n     ASVET, DASVET, RVET, DVET, or ADVET be veterans. The \n     Committees encourage the appointment of veterans to these \n     positions but do not believe a statutory requirement is \n     necessary.\n       The amendments made by subsection (a) revising department \n     level senior officials and functions, and subsection (b) \n     revising statutorily-defined duties of DVOP and LVERs, would \n     take effect on the date of enactment of this Act, and apply \n     to program and fiscal years under chapter 41 of title 38, \n     United States Code, beginning on or after such date.\n\n\n additional improvements in veterans' EMPLOYMENT AND training SERVICES\n\n     Current law\n       Sections 4102, 4106(a), 4107(a), 4107(c)(1), and section \n     4109(a) of title 38, United States Code, refer to terms such \n     as ``job and job training counseling service program'' \n     ``proper counseling,'' ``employment counseling services,'' \n     ``the number counseled,'' and ``counseling,'' respectively, \n     in describing services available to veterans and eligible \n     persons under this chapter.\n       Section 4101(7) of title 38, United States Code, defines \n     the term ``local employment service office'' as a service \n     delivery point which has an intrinsic management structure \n     and at which employment services are offered in accordance \n     with the Wagner-Peyser Act.\n       Section 4107(c)(1) of title 38, United States Code, defines \n     ``veterans of the Vietnam era'' as a group which the \n     Secretary must address with respect to various employment and \n     training services in the annual report to the Committees on \n     Veterans' Affairs. Section 4107(c)(2) requires submission in \n     the report of data on the ``job placement rate'' for veterans \n     and eligible persons.\n     House bill\n       Section 5 of H.R. 4015 would substitute the words \n     ``intensive services'' for the word ``counseling'' throughout \n     chapter 41 of title 38, United States Code, so as to make the \n     chapter consistent with section 134(d)(3) of the Workforce \n     Investment Act of 1998, Public Law 105-220. This section \n     would also add programs carried out by the VETS to ease \n     transition of servicemembers to civilian careers as a new \n     program the Secretary would administer.\n       This section of the bill would make a definitional change \n     so as to replace ``local employment service office'' and its \n     current-law definition with ``employment service delivery \n     system.'' The latter term would be redefined as a service \n     delivery system at which or through which labor exchange \n     services, including employment, training and placement \n     services, are offered in accordance with the Wagner-Peyser \n     Act.\n       This section also would replace ``job placement rate'' with \n     ``the rate of entered employment (as determined in a manner \n     consistent with State performance measures applicable under \n     section 136(b) of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998).'' \n     Further, with respect to the Secretary's annual report, it \n     would replace ``veterans of the Vietnam era'' and ``eligible \n     persons registered for assistance'' with ``eligible persons, \n     recently separated veterans (as defined in section 4211(6) of \n     title 38), and servicemembers transitioning to civilian \n     careers who are registered for assistance.''\n       Lastly, section 5 would add two additional requirements to \n     the Secretary's annual report submitted to the Committees on \n     Veterans' Affairs of the House and Senate. First, the report \n     must include information on the operation during the \n     preceding program year of the program of performance \n     incentive awards for quality employment services under \n     section 4112 of this title, including an analysis of the \n     amount of incentives distributed to each State and the \n     rationale for such distribution. Second, a report would be \n     required on the ``performance of States and organizations and \n     entities carrying out employment, training, and placement \n     services under this chapter, as measured by revised \n     performance criteria. In the case of a State that the \n     Secretary determines has not met the minimum standard of \n     performance established by the Secretary, the Secretary would \n     be required to include an analysis of the extent and reasons \n     for the State's failure to meet that minimum standard, \n     together with the State's plan for corrective action during \n     the succeeding year.''\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 5 of the Compromise Agreement follows the House \n     language with an amendment. The Secretary's annual report to \n     the Committees on Veterans' Affairs of the House and Senate \n     would be required to include information on the operation \n     during the preceding program year of performance incentive \n     awards for quality employment services administered through \n     the States. The report would not require an analysis of the \n     amount of incentives distributed to each State and the \n     rationale for such distribution because each State's DVOP/\n     LVER grant would identify and assign one percent of the grant \n     for use by State for the financial incentive awards.\n\n\n    COMMITTEE TO RAISE EMPLOYER AWARENESS OF SKILLS OF VETERANS AND \n                      BENEFITS OF HIRING VETERANS\n\n     Current law\n       No provision.\n     House bill\n       Section 6 of H.R. 4015 would authorize $3 million to be \n     appropriated to the Secretary of Labor from the Employment \n     Security Administration account in the Unemployment Trust \n     Fund for each of fiscal years 2003 through 2005 to establish \n     within the Department of Labor the President's National Hire \n     Veterans Committee. The Committee would furnish information \n     to employers with respect to the training and skills of \n     veterans and disabled veterans, and with respect to the \n     advantages afforded employers by hiring veterans. The \n     Secretary of Labor would provide staff and administrative \n     support to the Committee to assist it in carrying out its \n     duties under this section. Upon request of the Committee, the \n     head of any Federal department or agency would be authorized \n     to detail staff on a non-reimbursable basis. The Committee \n     would also have the authority to contract with government and \n     private agencies to furnish information to employers. The \n     Committee would terminate on December 31, 2005.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 6 of the Compromise Agreement contains the House \n     language.\n\n\n      sense of congress commending veterans and military service \n                             organizations\n\n     Current law\n       No provision.\n     House bill\n       Section 7 of the H.R. 4015 would express the sense of \n     Congress commending veterans and military service \n     organizations, and encouraging them to provide job placement \n     assistance to veterans who are job-ready by making personal \n     computers available to them with access to electronic job \n     placement services and programs.\n     Compromise agreement\n       The Compromise Agreement does not include this section.\n\n\n             report on implementation of employment reforms\n\n     Current law\n       No provision.\n     House bill\n       Section 8 of H.R. 4015 would authorize $1 million for the \n     Secretary of Labor to enter into a contract with an \n     appropriate organization or entity to conduct an 18-month \n     study to quantify the economic benefit to the United States \n     attributable to the provision of employment and training \n     services provided under chapter 41 of title 38, United States \n     Code, in helping veterans to attain long-term, sustained \n     employment.\n     Compromise agreement\n       Section 7 of the Compromise Agreement would direct the \n     Comptroller General of the United States to conduct a study \n     on the implementation by the Secretary of Labor of the \n     provisions of this title during the program years that begin \n     during fiscal years 2003 and 2004. The study would include an \n     assessment of the effect of this title on employment, \n     training, and placement services furnished to veterans. Not \n     later than six months after the conclusion of the program \n     year that begins during fiscal year 2004, the Comptroller \n     General would submit to Congress a report on the conducted \n     study. Under this section, the report would include \n     recommendations for legislation or administrative action.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the HELP \ncommittee be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 3801, the \nEducation Sciences Reform Act of 2002, and that the Senate proceed to \nits immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3801) to provide for improvement of Federal \n     education research, statistics, evaluation, information, and \n     dissemination, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this bipartisan agreement on \nthe reauthorization of the Office of Education Research. The new \nInstitute of Education Sciences created by this legislation will \nimprove the capacity of the Department to conduct high quality research \nto improve educational opportunities for all students.\n  We know that research can make a difference in teaching and learning \nby providing high quality technical assistance and professional \ndevelopment, reliable data, and wide dissemination of research and best \npractices.\n  We all agree that education research has to be high quality. It also \nneeds to be directly related to the needs of the professionals in the \nfield. Schools, teachers, principals and child care providers all must \nhave access to the best practices in education if our schools are to be \nthe best they can be.\n  States, schools and teachers have to face the challenge of preparing \nstudents for assessments and dealing with schools that fail to make \nadequate progress. Regional technical assistance providers can help \nthem meet this challenge. Our bill reauthorizes the regional education \nlaboratories, and provides a smooth transition from the current system \nof technical assistance providers to a new, streamlined system of \ncomprehensive centers. We know that our teachers need this support and \nwe intend to provide it.\n  The Federal Government has a distinguished history of investment in \neducation research. What began many years ago as data collection has \nevolved into a current approach that collects, analyzes and \ndisseminates important information. It enables researchers to bring \ntheir analyses to the people who need this information and can use it \nbest. Our bill also maintains the autonomy of the National Center on \nStatistics, and makes sure that the National Assessment of Education \nProgress stays out of the political arena.\n  Our goals are to raise the quality of research conducted at the new \nInstitute, to link its research with other research, and to make it \navailable to the teachers who use it.\n  We want to be able to look to this Institute when we have education \nquestions in the same way that we look to the NIH when we have medical \nquestions. This bill provides a sound foundation to do so.\n  I commend the Committee staff who worked long and hard and \neffectively on this bill: Alex Nock, Denise Forte, Doug Mesecar, Bob \nSweet and Sally Lovejoy of the House Committee; Lloyd Horwich with \nSenator Dodd, Elyse Wasch and Kathleen Fitzgerald with Senator Reed, \nBethany Little with Senator Murray, Carmel Martin with Senator \nBingaman, Rebecca Litt with Senator Mikulski, Eric Fatemi with Senator \nHarkin, David Sewell with Senator Edwards, Jill Morningstar with \nSenator Wellstone, Katherine Brown with Senator Clinton and Sherry \nKaiman with Senator Jeffords, Tracy Locklin with Senator Gregg, Amanda \nFarris with Senator Enzi, Kristin Bannerman with Senator DeWine, \nJennifer Swenson with Senator Roberts, Andrea Becker with Senator Frist \nand Jane Oates and Emma Vadehra of my own staff. I thank Amy Gaynor of \nLegislative Counsel and the floor staff for working with us to complete \nthe process.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first let me say that I believe that this \nSubstitute Amendment to H.R. 3801, The Education Sciences Reform Act of \n2002, represents a significant step toward achieving our common goal of \nimproving the quality of education research. I thank Assistant \nSecretary Whitehurst and his staff for the assistance they provided in \ncrafting this legislation. I am especially gratified to see this bill \ncome together in the same spirit of bipartisanship in which we crafted \nthe No Child Left Behind Act.\n  Though significant Federal involvement in education research dates \nback to the 1950's, we are still without a strong body of high quality \neducation research to guide education policymaking. Yet the need for \nsound, rigorous education research that is free of political bias and \nuseful to educators has never been more important. With passage of the \nbipartisan No Child Left Behind Act, we have made it our mission as a \nNation to make sure every student is well-educated. By renewing our \nefforts to master the science of how children learn best, this bill \nwill help tremendously in achieving that mission.\n  Specifically, the bill:\n  No. 1, reconstitutes the Office of Education Research and Improvement \nas the ``Institute of Education Sciences'' to provide a more rational, \nstreamlined infrastructure for the Department of Education's research, \ndevelopment, statistics, evaluation, and dissemination functions;\n  No. 2, establishes more rigorous research standards, which all \nInstitute-funded education research will have to meet. Education fads \nthat masquerade as science will no longer be acceptable;\n  No. 3, establishes Research and Development Centers to cover such \nimportant topics as standards, assessment and accountability, improving \nlow achieving schools, innovation in education reform, rural education, \nteacher quality, and postsecondary education;\n  No. 4, contributes to the creation of a ``culture of science'' within \nthe new Institute by giving the Director the hiring flexibility \nnecessary to attract and retain the best researchers, evaluators, and \nstatisticians to the Institute;\n  No. 5, makes technical assistance to schools, school districts, and \nstates more efficient and user-friendly, particularly the assistance \nneeded in order to effectively implement the No Child Left Behind Act. \nThe current patchwork of regional technical assistance entities will be \nreplaced by a single set of technical assistance providers;\n  No. 6, increases the independence of the research and evaluation \nfunctions of the Department, while preserving the independence and \nquality of the current National Center for Education Statistics;\n  No. 7, further insulates the National Assessment of Educational \nProgress from political interference by giving the independent National \nAssessment Governing Board the authority to release NAEP results to the \npublic; and\n  No 8, requires that grants and contracts with regional education \nlaboratories, national research and development centers, and technical \nassistance providers are awarded on the basis of open competition.\n  It is my hope that the significant reforms made by this legislation \nwill mark the beginning of a new era in the field of education \nresearch--an era in which policymaking will be based on sound science, \nto the benefit of our Nation's students.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I support the Education Sciences Reform Act \nof 2002.\n  This legislation reauthorizes and renames the current Office of \nEducational Research and Improvement at the Department of Education, \nnow to be called the Institute of Education Sciences. The bill will \nincrease the quality of educational research and statistics, improve \ndissemination, technical assistance, educational product development, \nevaluation, and other research efforts, and minimize the effect of \npolitics on education research.\n  As States begin to implement the No Child Left Behind Act, the need \nfor a responsive, relevant, high quality, and rigorous education \nknowledge enterprise is greater than ever.\n  Mr. President, I am particularly pleased about the bill's provisions \nto retain and strengthen the regional educational laboratories. The \nregional educational laboratories, like the Northeast and Islands \nRegional Educational Laboratory at Brown University, conduct applied \nresearch, develop educational products and materials, provide technical \nassistance, and disseminate information in order to improve teaching, \nincrease student achievement, and promote effective\n\n[[Page S10481]]\n\nschool reform. The Education Sciences Reform Act enhances the regional \neducational laboratories work to put research into practice and focuses \ntheir efforts on helping states and districts meet their specific \neducational needs.\n  I thank Chairman Kennedy, Senator Gregg, Senator Enzi, and members of \nthe House Education and the Workforce Committee for working closely \nwith me on many aspects of this legislation. This is important \nlegislation, and I am pleased to support it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I understand Senators Kennedy, Gregg, and others have a \nsubstitute amendment at the desk, and I ask the amendment be considered \nand agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; \nthat the bill, as amended, be read three times, passed, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements related \nthereto be printed in the Record, without intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 4885) was agreed to.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  The bill (H.R. 3801), as amended, was read the third time and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/10/15/senate-section/article/S10481-1", "month": "10", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10481]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 16, 2002\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE.
