Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership giving me and \nothers an opportunity to talk about an issue which is of central \nimportance and consequence to families across this country. Families \nare thinking about education. Families are thinking about the coming \ndays in May and early June when their children will be graduating. They \nare also thinking about the indebtedness they will face when their \nchildren graduate. Others are looking forward to the fall as their \nchildren are\n\n[[Page S4340]]\n\naccepted to schools and colleges across the country.\n  Families are very concerned about what is happening in the public \nschools across this Nation. Some 55 million of our children are going \nto public schools. As we know, over the period of the remaining part of \nthis century, that population is virtually going to double. It will be \nvirtually 98 million. It will be an enormous challenge to ensure we \ncontinue to lead the world as the premier economic and democratic power \nif we do not provide for the education of our young people. Education \nis a key component of democracy and is key to defending our vital \ninterests.\n  I remind this Senate where we are in terms of education funding. \nMoney is not the answer to everything, but it is a pretty clear \nindication of what our Nation's priorities are. Last year we worked out \nstrong bipartisan legislation with the President of the United States, \nRepublicans, my friend Senator Gregg, Congressman Boehner, Congressman \nGeorge Miller, and myself, the members of our Education Committee, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike. I can see them all in my mind, their \nstrong advocacy in terms of the children of this Nation. One of the \ngreat pleasures of serving in the Senate is working with our colleagues \non education and investing in education as a priority for our country. \nBut, today we are faced with an education budget proposed by the \nPresident that does not make the promise of the ``No Child Left Behind \nAct'' a reality.\n\n  We are talking about a budget of some $2.3 trillion. In that budget, \nless than 2 cents out of every dollar is focused on education. Parents \nare surprised to hear that. Many Members believe we ought to reflect \nour priorities and their priorities in education by providing greater \ninvestment. It is appropriate I mention that because this last year we \nhad a major restructuring, a reform. We put much greater requirements \non our children, a greater expectation in terms of accountability. We \nare insisting that the parents be involved. We provide supplemental \nresources for children falling behind. We ensure any evaluation of \nchildren is based upon a good, well-thought-out curriculum and based \nupon State standards.\n  All of the recommendations that have been made over the period of \nrecent years have demonstrated positive results. The real issue now is \nwhether we are going to fund that program or whether we are going to \nclaim that we did something for the American people not back it up.\n  I draw the attention of our colleagues to the statement of the \nPresident of the United States this last week in the Midwest where he \nwas talking about the achievements of the No Child Left Behind. In his \nspeech, on page 3, he said:\n\n       We have responsibilities throughout our society. We have \n     responsibilities. The Federal Government has \n     responsibilities. Generally, that responsibility is to write \n     a healthy check. We did so in 2002 budget--$22 billion for \n     secondary and elementary schools, it's an increase of 25 \n     percent. We have increased the money by 35 percent for \n     teacher recruitment, teacher retention, teacher pay.\n\n  That was done with the strong urging and the insistence of the \nDemocrats.\n  Now we have the administration on its own, and let us see what they \nare doing with education. Prior to last year, the Bush proposal for \n2002 was an increase of 3.5 percent. What I have just referred to was \nthe congressional ``final'' of fiscal year 2002 which was the 20-\npercent increase to which the President referred. After that marvelous \nadmonition about all the things we are doing and the Federal \nresponsibilities, we can ask ourselves, I wonder what they will do for \nthe next fiscal year.\n  Right out here is your answer. It is a 2.8-percent increase. It is \nbasically an abdication of responsibility to the children of this \ncountry.\n  Under the President's program, named ``No Child Left Behind,'' we saw \nin 2002, 6.3 million children who were not covered by Title I and were \nnot being helped. Children who are qualified for this program. They are \nnot being helped. What happens under the President's own program? In \n2003, the number of students not being served by Title I grows by \n250,000. It is not going down. The number is going up the number of \nchildren who are not being served. That is in contrast to our \ncommitment in that legislation that shows a decline in the total number \nof children who would not be served so that by FY 07 we will have cut \nthat number in half--from 6.3 million children to 2.9 million. We \nshould fully fund Title I so that no child is left behind. We have, in \nCongress, taken a step in that direction. But what does the President \npropose? A step in the opposite direction. More Title I children left \nbehind.\n  What is the reason to say all these children are going to be left out \nor left behind? All you have to do is look at the President's budget \nfor the out years and see it is effectively zero in each of those \nfollowing years.\n  Let's take a few of the essential elements of the No Child Left \nBehind Act. Teacher training--is there a family in this country who \ndoes not understand that you have to have a well-qualified teacher in \nevery classroom? That is one of the prime elements of this legislation. \nWe increase the funding for recruitment, retention, and professional \ndevelopment. Those elements are included in that legislation in a \nvariety of different ways, including mentoring--to have experienced \nteachers mentor younger teachers, with a variety of different \noutreaches to get the best of America to work in the classrooms. This \nis what was committed to last year.\n  Look at what is in the President's budget for fiscal year 2003--a \nzero increase in this fund to meet our responsibility for teachers.\n  What was a second important element? There are many, and I will just \nmention some. What is the second important element? The second \nimportant element is after-school learning opportunities. Why is that \nimportant? It is pretty obvious. Parents understand that after-school \nprograms can provide a variety of services. Many now are providing the \nacademic help for children, either tied into schools or tied into \nvoluntary organizations, and many, as in my own city of Boston, are \ntied into universities to assist the children in those programs. That \nis to make sure the supplementary services that are included in this \nlegislation are going to be available to these children, either in \nschool or, if it is not possible there, to do it in the after-school \nprograms. These after-school programs are enormously important.\n  I will not take the time today, but I will later on, to show, where \nchildren have had the opportunity for after-school programs, how that \nhas enhanced their academic accomplishment.\n  What does the administration have? Basically no increase whatsoever--\nzero--for the after-school programs.\n  I will draw the attention of our colleagues to after-school programs \nin terms of demand. There are a great number of applications from local \nschool districts across this country that would qualify if the \nresources were there for after-school programs, but remain unfunded. We \nare only able to fund a very small portion. Mr. President, 2,783 \napplicants applied for federal after-school funds, and only 308 could \nbe funded.\n  There are enormous opportunities. If we are going to talk the talk, \nwe ought to walk the walk, and walking the walk means investing in \nthese children, investing in after-school programs and making sure they \nare going to have good teachers.\n  Let's look at what is happening to many of the children coming into \nour schools for whom English is a second language. The challenges for \nthose children are extraordinary. But there are a number of very \nexciting efforts, programs that are enhancing both the English and the \nnative language of these children. We can get into that, and will at \nanother time, but let me just give a couple of statistics.\n  Today, as we are here, there are 180,000 children in Los Angeles \nCounty who do not have desks because there is not adequate funding. In \nLos Angeles County, they have cut back 17 days of school for many \nstudents because they do not have the resources. And we are cutting \nback in our participation, to reach out to these children who are \nqualified for help? Can somebody explain that? And they say it is a \nnational priority? That just does not even pass the laugh test.\n  This chart: ``Bush Budget Undermines School Safety.'' This is about \nsafe and drug-free schools. Anyone who travels to any high school \nacross this\n\n[[Page S4341]]\n\ncountry will find the parents and teachers, others, will talk about \nthese matters I mentioned: A well-qualified teacher, after-school \nprograms, books--they talk about their libraries. And they talk about \nthe safe and drug-free schools. They talk about safety in the schools. \nThey talk about substance abuse in the schools. They talk about trying \nto make sure that you are going to have a safe atmosphere, where \nchildren can learn, inside the schools.\n  That is a key element. And it is a key element of our legislation. \nBut certainly not for this administration. This administration has cut \nback on any little marginal increase. Not only are we getting flat \nfunding on a number of education priorities, we are actually seeing a \ndecline in funding for safe and drug-free schools. That is after that \nprogram had been carefully worked out by two of our colleagues, Senator \nDeWine and Senator Dodd, who spent a great deal of time having special \nhearings on that program. This program was broadly endorsed across the \ncountry, and here we have the issue about having safe and drug-free \nschools as a key element to make sure our schools are going to measure \nup, and we have the administration effectively cutting funding for this \nprogram.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  When it comes to the issue of education, it is clear that this \nPresident has not done his homework.\n  Will the Senator from Massachusetts recount for this Senator, for the \nrecord, what happened in the debate and deliberation over No Child Left \nBehind? Is it not true that both parties came together in a bipartisan \nfashion, behind the President, to authorize and create the very \nprograms the Senator is describing today? Is it not true that the \nSenator from Massachusetts, who has been on this Senate floor as a \nleader in education, worked hand in hand with the President to put in \nplace this reform of public education across America with the promise \nit would be more than a press conference, that it would be a commitment \nto funding education to make certain these programs work? Is that not a \nfact?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator states the history entirely accurately. We \nwere stalemated here on the floor of the Senate when we tried to visit \nthe reauthorization of elementary and secondary education. President \nBush made this an important item during the course of his campaign. All \nof us welcomed the opportunity to work with him.\n\n  I do not question his own personal commitment to education reform. \nBut if we are going to really be serious about trying to make a \ndifference, after we have the reform, we have to fund it.\n  The question of the Senator suggests a very important item with which \nwe wrestled. If you have money without reform, you are not having an \neffective use of your money. If you have reform without resources, you \nare not going to achieve any goal. That was basically the dilemma we \nwere facing. We put the reform together. The question is now whether we \nare going to give the help to those children, to those teachers, to \nthose parents.\n  Let me, since the Senator is on his feet, just mention one item in \naddition which is of enormous importance. I see my friend from \nMinnesota here as well. The Bush budget provides zero funding to \nsupport parental involvement. There is not a successful school district \nin this country that does not have the involvement of the parents, the \nrepresentation of the parents--people who are involved whose interest \nis the interest of the child in the school. Not only that, the \nadministration has failed to include parents in a meaningful way in the \ndevelopment of the rules and regulations for the No Child Left Behind \nAct. Of the 22 panelists presiding over the Title I rules, only 2 \nrepresented parents and the administration is now facing a law suit for \nleaving parents behind in this process.\n  Now the parents organizations are challenging the Department of \nEducation to say: ``Let us in the door.'' ``We thought we were \nincluded.'' We see parents being closed out here with no involvement \nand effectively being denied inclusion in the development of the rules \nand regulations. I will come back to them in just a few moments. But \nthis must be a matter of concern as well.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Isn't it also a fact, as we read the newspapers from \nacross the United States, that State after State is facing a cutback in \nthe resources that the States have available for education? In my home \nState of Illinois, they are currently in session in Springfield trying \nto figure out how they are going to deal with diminished resources. \nThis morning's paper talks about the State of California losing 20 to \n25 percent of its revenue in the coming year, forcing hard decisions in \nevery area, including education.\n  So this refusal of the Bush administration to fund the very programs \nthey were crowing about, announcing just a few months ago, is going to \nhave a multiple impact on these States that are already facing tough \ntimes when it comes to their own budgets, as I see it.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. The estimates are \nanywhere from $40 to $50 billion of shortfalls in States in terms of \ndeficits. And, of course, an important impact of that $40 to $50 \nbillion shortfall will be in areas of education, both higher education \nand also State support to K-12 education.\n  We have, in this legislation, requirements that the States are not \npermitted to let the Federal money supplant the States' obligations.\n  And now, when we have the situation that the Senator has outlined, \nhow are we going to say to the States, no, you can't cut back--when we \nare already cutting back on them, when we are already undercutting what \nis happening in the States by denying the investment in these children \nin these areas which we have worked out in a bipartisan way, virtually \nunanimously, in both Houses, with the great support of parents, of \neducators, of school boards, superintendents? It was not completely \nunanimous, but about as close to it as you could have on a major kind \nof a policy issue. And I am just as troubled, as the Senator must be, \nthat we are failing.\n  I am troubled, as well, with what we saw just this past week. I ask \nthe Senator whether he would agree that we have to ask ourselves, is \nthis administration really committed to quality education, when they \nwere about to eliminate the possibility of students consolidating their \nloans at the current lower interest rates and save students and \nfamilies hundreds of millions of dollars? And they beat a quick retreat \non this.\n  But does it not suggest to the Senator that we are at least missing \nthe note on investing in children and making good education more \navailable and accessible?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The Senator from Massachusetts, I think, brings two \npoints together. When you reduce the ability of students to go to \ncollege, you necessarily reduce the opportunities to create tomorrow's \nteachers. We need to hire 55,000 new teachers in my State of Illinois \nover the next 4 years. What the Bush administration proposed was to \nmake it more expensive for students across America to go to college.\n  Students who are working hard and sacrificing would have paid more \nwere it not for the efforts of the Senator from Massachusetts and many \non this side of the aisle that forced the Bush administration, in the \nlast few days, to back off that.\n  But let me ask the Senator, if I may, this one last question because \nmy colleague from Minnesota would also like to participate in this. Is \nthis not, in this budget this year from this Bush administration, the \nsmallest proposed increase in K through 12 education since 1988?\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct, this is the smallest increase \nnot only for K-12 education since 1988, but also the smallest proposed \nincrease for education as a whole in seven years, as I am quickly \nreminded by my wonderful staffer Danica. As this chart says: ``The Bush \nAdministration: Smallest Increase for Education in 7 Years.'' This \nrepresents the increase in education. As you can see, The increase for \n1997 was 16 percent, for 1998, 12 percent, for 1999, 12 percent, for \n2000, 6 percent, for 2001, 19 percent, for 2002, 16 percent and then \nfor next year Bush proposes only 3 percent. This is total education. \nSometimes there is a flyspecking in terms of education. We have not \ngotten into, for example, the IDEA and the retreat the Republicans had \nin making\n\n[[Page S4342]]\n\nsure we are going to have the full funding for the IDEA, which the \nSenator fought for and is so important.\n  But let me just mention one final item--going back to the \nconsolidation issue. Only 3 percent of the graduate degrees conferred \nin this country are in law and in medicine. If you remember the \nrationale of the administration, they said: we do not need to provide \nfor consolidation at a fixed rate because these young people are all \ngoing to be lawyers and doctors, and they will be able to pay it off. \nThey represent only 3 percent of the graduate degrees conferred.\n  The people I am concerned about are those childcare workers--who we \nare trying to help in terms of providing better quality childcare--who \nare trying to get their degrees and are going to have to borrow money. \nI am concerned about the nurses who are trying to get those advanced \ndegrees so they can provide better care. And I am concerned about the \nteachers who are trying to get a better upgrading of their own kinds of \nskills who are going to have to go out and borrow. Those are the ones \nwho would have been affected by denying these borrowers the lower \ninterest rates. So that is why I am so glad the administration \nretreated on it.\n  I thank the Senator for bringing up these important points.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Yes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I applaud the Senator from Massachusetts whose leadership \nand commitment to these children for decades have been resolute. When I \ncame to the Senate a year ago, I thought what a phenomenal opportunity \nI would have to work with the Senator and others of our colleagues, \ngiven the resources we seemed to have available at that time. As I \nrecall, we had trillions of dollars of surpluses. That was the context \nin which I recall the Leave No Child Behind partnership was forged.\n  I wonder how the Senator feels about having made that commitment, and \nseeing that promise made for funding for all these areas, and now \nseeing a budget that comes out like this. What happened to all that \nmoney we were going to spend on children?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct. As a matter of fact, the \n$1.3 billion the OMB had expected, if their proposal in terms of \neliminating the consolidation of loans had taken place, would have \neffectively been used for the tax breaks. You would have had a \ntransferring of resources from the sons and daughters of working \nfamilies--and not just the sons and daughters because many now in these \ncommunity colleges, I am sure in your State as well as mine, are mid-\ncareer people trying the upgrade their skills. So it is also mothers \nand fathers who are going for graduate degrees, as well as sons and \ndaughters. But it effectively would have had those individuals paying \nmore interest on their student loans so that the top 1 or 2 percent of \nthe income-tax payers would have been able to get their additional \nkinds of tax relief. I think those are absolutely the wrong priorities.\n\n  It seems to me we heard in the Senate not long ago that we can have \nit all, we can have the tax cut and the education and the defense--we \ncan have it all. And there were many of us who did not believe you \ncould have it all. There are still some trying to say you still can.\n  But the Senator's question points out how the education for working \nfamilies--in the K through 12, and also in college--is going to be \nlimited because of the administration policy.\n  Mr. DAYTON. The Senator's use of the word ``priorities'' is exactly \nthe right choice. I recall this year we approved another $43 billion in \ntax breaks for the largest corporations in this country. Combined with \nwhat was done last year, would the Senator agree that the priorities of \nthis administration are just fundamentally at odds with the interests \nof children in America?\n  Mr. KENNEDY. It seems to me most Americans are agreeing, we have a \nnew day in America as a result of the tragedies of September 11: \nenormous loss, incredible inspiration for the men in blue, who will be \nhonored outside this Capitol today, and mindful of the 233 who were \nlost, and the incredible courage of those Americans. We have a new and \ndifferent day. We have a different economy, different obligations in \nhomeland security, in foreign policy. We have a responsibility here at \nhome to meet the needs of our people.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 more seconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I think that is what is enormously important: Be strong \nat home. And there is no place we can be stronger at home than \ninvesting in the children of this country.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Senator, again, for his courageous leadership \non this issue for so many years.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Under the previous order, the \ntime until 10:30 a.m. shall be under the control of the Republican \nleader or his designee.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes of that time.

Mr. President, I find the discussion of the Senators from \nMassachusetts and Illinois and Minnesota most interesting. It reminds \nme of that old story of the attorney up in northern New Hampshire who \nreceived a report from one of the logging camps he represented. There \nwere seven people in this camp, five men and two women. The report came \nin that 50 percent of the women were marrying 20 percent of the men.\n  The numbers which have been thrown out here are, to say the least, a \nbit disoriented, dysfunctional, and inaccurate. They certainly don't \nreflect this President's commitment to education. In fact, I don't \nthink anybody can seriously question this President's commitment to \neducation. He not only has made it a priority, he has essentially made \nit his No. 1 domestic priority after the issue of fighting terrorism, \nwhich of course is our Nation's No. 1 issue right now.\n  It was under his leadership that we passed a landmark piece of \nlegislation in which obviously the Senator from Massachusetts played a \nlarge role, as did the Senator who is presiding at the present time. \nThat legislation essentially reorganized the way we approach \nlegislation at the Federal level as it affects elementary and secondary \nschool education.\n  Basically, it took a large number of programs and merged them \ntogether and turned that money back to the States with more \nflexibility, the purpose of which was to give the States and the local \ncommunities specifically more dollars with fewer strings and, in \nexchange for giving them more dollars with fewer strings, expect more \nfor those dollars and have standards which have to be met to show that \nthat has occurred; in other words, specifically saying, we don't expect \nany children to be left behind.\n  The Federal role in elementary and secondary education is a fairly \nnarrow role; 92 to 93 percent of the money comes from the local \ncommunities or the States; they have the priority role in education. \nThe Federal role in education has picked two targeted areas on which to \nfocus. No. 1 is low-income kids, making sure they are not left behind. \nNo. 2 is special needs kids, special education kids. This ESEA bill \nwhich we passed, the No Child Left Behind bill, essentially said we \nwill give the local communities more money with fewer strings, fewer \ncategorical programs; but in exchange for that, we will expect that \nespecially low-income kids have a better opportunity to learn and that \nthey are not left behind; we will ask the States to set up standards \nwhich test that.\n  What did the President do? He didn't give them less money. He gave \nmore money into this program. If you look at the chart the Senator from \nMassachusetts held up, you will see that the increases in the Federal \ncommitment to education have been massive over the last 2 years: 19 \npercent over the base 2 years ago; 16 percent on top of the 19-percent \nbase; and then 3 percent on top of that, with the practical effect \nbeing that the dollar increase has been\n\n[[Page S4343]]\n\nabsolutely huge, as has the percentage increase for education.\n  In fact, what the President did was consolidate that money into \nbasically a more focused stream so that it goes back to the States in a \nmore effective way. I have charts to reflect this, but I am not sure \nthey are here. Hopefully, they will be arriving soon.\n  In any event, if you look at what we did, what the President did, you \nsee he put the money into title I. Yes, some of these other programs--\nthey held up five or six different programs--have been zero-funded. \nThey should have been, because they were a little bits of money tossed \naround for the purposes of some Member of this legislative body getting \nout a press release.\n  What the President said was: Let's not do that. Let's put this money \ninto one focused stream and have those dollars flow directly back to \nthe communities. The practical effect of that is that the title I \ndollars over the last 2 years, the President's increase in title I \nspending, the money going to low-income kids, has seen a $2.5 billion \nincrease. If you take all the money that went into title I, all the \nincreases during the administration of President Clinton, which was 8 \nyears, not 2 years, his increases only amounted to $2 billion in that \naccount.\n  So in 2 years the President has exceeded by 20 percent the amount of \nmoney that went in as increases over 8 years into the Clinton accounts. \nThis concept that the President has not funded education is absolutely \nfallacious.\n  You could hold up another chart on this relative to special education \nwhich would show the exact same thing. In fact, it would show that \nPresident Bush has made a stronger commitment to special education than \nPresident Clinton ever did during his entire term in office. President \nBush in the last 2 years, in both of those years, has increased special \neducation by $1 billion each year. President Clinton, of his entire 8 \nyears, in only 1 year, the last year when he was basically forced into \nit, did he increase special education by $1 billion. In every other \nyear, for the 7 prior years, his increase in the special education \namount was actually negligible.\n  As we know, special education has a huge impact on the local tax \nbase. The failure of the Federal Government to pay its fair share of \nspecial education has been one of the real problems local communities \nhave had.\n\n  President Bush has made, from the start, a major commitment to \nfunding special education, increasing that funding by over $2 billion, \n$1 billion in each year of the last 2 years and, as a result, has lived \nup to a commitment he made during the campaign which was that he was \ngoing to move towards full funding of special education. This concept \nthat the President is not funding education really doesn't hold water.\n  Then there was some discussion of postsecondary activity and this \nconsolidation issue, this ``bloody shirt'' that the other side \ncontinues to draw across the floor. Let's talk about a little bit of \nhistory. This concept was reported as a concept, as a trial balloon in \nthe New York Times. That is where the issue comes from.\n  Somebody in OMB, which is not the education policy arm of the \nadministration, threw out the idea: We have to pay for the Pell grant \nshortfall which is $1.3 billion. One way to do that would be to \ndisallow consolidation of student loans. That is one of the many ways \nwe could do it.\n  It was reported in the New York Times as a concept. It was a trial \nballoon. The education arm of the administration, which is the \nEducation Department, immediately rejected it. The OMB was told to \nforget it. In fact, the OMB called around the Hill to the staff of the \nappropriate committees and members of the appropriate committees and \nsaid they would not pursue it. Yet for 3 weeks now we have heard it as \nif it were a policy. How outrageous. I refer to the approach the other \nside is taking as the thought police, where, if you have an idea, you \njust beat it into the ground, like those mullahs who run around with \nsticks and beat people if they have ideas. This idea doesn't even exist \nas a policy. Yet we continue to hear about it.\n  What does exist as a policy, however, is what this administration has \ndone in the area of postsecondary education, which is huge in the way \nof funding. The largest increase in Pell grants in the history of this \ncountry has occurred under this administration. More students, 500,000 \nmore students, will get Pell grants this year than got them in the last \nyear of the Clinton administration. This administration has committed \nhuge dollars into this program. The rate of interest which a student \nwill pay on their student loans will drop to below 2 percent by the \nbeginning of next year--below 2 percent--as a result of this \nadministration supporting language which allowed those loans to be \nreorganized in a way that students could get a less than 2-percent rate \nof interest on their student loans--incredibly low-cost money to help \nkids go to school, huge benefits to students trying to go to graduate \nschool. And equally important, the tax bill which passed this Congress \nand which a number of Members on the other side did vote for but nobody \nwho just spoke voted for, the tax bill which passed this Congress gave \na massive increase, something in the vicinity, I think, of $30 billion \nof incentive money to help parents fund their children's education in \nthe expansion of the Coverdell accounts, the expansion of the \ndeductibility of interest for student loans, and a variety of other \ninitiatives--teacher tax credits for people who stay to go on to teach, \na supplemental payment there--all sorts of initiatives which \ndramatically increased the funding available to assist parents who are \ntrying to put their children through school.\n\n  So to come to the floor of the Senate, as some of the Members have \nfrom the other side for literally 3 or 4 weeks now, to berate the \nadministration for the consolidation proposal, which was never a \nproposal, which was simply a trial balloon, and to berate the \nadministration for not funding education is, in my opinion, tilting at \nwindmills by the other side and trying to set up straw men because the \nissues hold no water on the basis of fact.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from Ohio \nletting me go forward, and I appreciate the courtesy of the Chair.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/15/senate-section/article/S4343-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4343-S4345]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, over the last couple of weeks during the \ndebate on this trade bill we have heard arguments for and against trade \npromotion authority, the Andean Trade Preference Act, and trade \nadjustment assistance. Many of the arguments have focused, and I think \nrightfully so, on the impact of those issues on American jobs and on \nthe American economy. American workers and the American economy benefit \nfrom free and open trade. Granting the President trade promotion \nauthority will greatly help to facilitate open trade. It will help our \neconomy and it will help jobs.\n  Today, I would like to focus on another benefit of the passage of \nthis legislation. I would like to talk about the benefit to our foreign \npolicy, to our national security. A top priority in our foreign policy \nmust be to promote freedom, peace, and stability in the world and \nparticularly in this hemisphere, the Western Hemisphere.\n  Last year, a Dallas Morning News editorial put it very well. Here is \nwhat they said:\n\n       In the post September 11 world, free trade is not just good \n     economic policy. It is also good foreign and security policy.\n\n  We, as a nation, stand to lose or gain depending on the economic \nhealth and security of our neighbors. A strong, a free, and prosperous \nWestern Hemisphere means a strong, free, and prosperous United States. \nThat prosperity depends in large part on free and fair trade. In 1987, \nPresident Ronald Reagan told Soviet Premier Gorbachev to tear down the \nBerlin Wall. It was a symbol of repression, keeping freedom and \nprosperity out of Eastern Europe. Today, we need to destroy another \nwall, a wall that prohibits the free and fair trade that Ronald Reagan \nenvisioned for not just the people of Eastern Europe but for all of the \nworld.\n\n  I am talking, of course, about the tariffs, quotas, the lack of trade \nagreements that are really bricks in the walls that surround all \ncountries. We must work to eliminate those barriers while also \nnegotiating free trade agreements so our Nation has reciprocal access \nto these foreign markets. Such efforts are key foreign policy steps \nthat\n\n[[Page S4344]]\n\ncan effectively counter poverty, disease, and tyranny.\n  From an economic point of view, business in the developing world \nstruggles to survive for a multitude of reasons. During my 15 years in \nthe House and Senate, I have traveled across many poverty-stricken and \ndisease-ridden parts of the world. My wife Fran and I have seen the \ndestitution, devastation, and desperation in which millions and \nmillions of men, women, and children live. I believe we have both the \nability and the obligation to help these suffering people.\n  In addition to foreign aid, to foreign assistance, increasing our \ntrade relationship with these countries will help promote economic \nfreedom and growth.\n  I cannot tell you how many foreign leaders I have met--I know my \nother colleagues have also met--who say do not be concerned about \nforeign assistance to us. What we really need is access to your \nmarkets. What we really need is the opportunity to sell the goods that \nwe can produce to the American people. Tear down the artificial \nbarriers. That is the best assistance that you can give us.\n  So in addition to helping us, it helps them and ultimately helps our \nvision of the world, which is a world filled with countries that are \nDemocratic and that have developing middle classes.\n  Statistics show that when developing countries engage in \ninternational trade and investment, they develop and grow faster than \nclosed economies. Trade agreements open up markets. It cuts poverty and \nadvances the cause of economic and political liberty. The sad fact is \nthe United States has underutilized trade to the detriment of our \nNation and our trading partners, particularly in our own hemisphere. \nRight now, the United States is only party to 3 of the more than 130 \nbilateral and free trade agreements in this area--that is right, only \n3. The European Union, on the other hand, has had free trade agreements \nwith 27 nations. Mexico, our Nation's and my home State of Ohio's \nsecond leading trading partner, has secured 25 such agreements just \nsince 1994.\n  Providing our President trade promotion authority is a chance for us \nto, once again, show our leadership in this area.\n  Many foreign leaders have expressed this frustration, that the \nagreements they sign with the United States, frankly, could get bogged \ndown in Congress. So without trade promotion authority, it is \ndifficult, if not impossible, for our President to conclude the \nagreements that we so desperately need. That is why this bill must pass \nand we must send it on to the President.\n  Few foreign leaders candidly will be inclined to invest their time or \neffort in working out agreements that may be radically altered by \nCongress. At best, the administration's ability to negotiate bilateral \nfree trade accords will be seriously hampered. We need to remember that \ntrade promotion authority is not a new concept. Our Presidents were \ngranted this authority almost continuously from 1974 to 1994 when the \nauthority lapsed and was not renewed. We also should remember that \nunder the provisions of TPA, the President is required to consult with \ncongressional committees and to notify Congress at major stages during \ntrade negotiations. And we also should remember that Congress retains \nthe ultimate authority, of course, to approve or disapprove the final \ntrade agreement.\n  By granting trade promotion authority, we are not abdicating control \nof our Nation's trade policy. On the contrary, we in Congress are \nhelping our Congress to lead. Many of my colleagues have spoken very \neloquently about why the President needs trade promotion authority. And \nthey have provided statistics showing how increased trade will help \nopen markets and provide job opportunities right here in the United \nStates in every sector of our economy. They have argued further that \nthe President needs TPA in order to strike the best deals for American \nworkers, for families, for farmers, and for business men and women.\n  They have shown that trade promotion authority represents the vital \npartnership between Congress and the executive branch.\n  These are all important points, and they are all valid. They all \nillustrate how free and fair trade agreements, accomplished through the \nexercise of trade promotion authority, are important for the United \nStates. They are correct. But as we have seen, free trade also benefits \ndeveloping countries, and this is important to the United States.\n  For example, for most of the 20th century, Mexico had closed itself \noff from international trade and capital flows by setting up currency \ncontrols and trade barriers. Only with the Latin American debt crisis \nof the 1980s did Mexico slowly begin to open its economy to global \ntrade and investment. Then with NAFTA the payoffs to Mexico's economy \nand workers were certainly very real.\n  Between 1993 and 1999, Mexico climbed from 26th place to 8th place \namong the world's largest exporters, and in recent years Mexico's \nexports fueled growth rates of 4 percent. Free trade also has enhanced \nMexico's overall stability, and the involvement of U.S. businesses has \npositively influenced both labor conditions and environmental quality \nin Mexico. Due to increased competition, domestic firms in Mexico \nincreasingly are forced to compete with foreign-owned businesses and \njoint ventures by offering better working conditions and higher pay. \nThe situation in Mexico is not perfect and the results so far are \nuneven, but overall there has been improvement.\n  Meanwhile, U.S. production methods and technology are demonstrating \nto Mexican business that it is possible to be both profitable and \nenvironmentally responsible. The Mexican Government has actually \nstrengthened its environmental regulations and enforcement procedures \nsince NAFTA has been in place, and this, of course, benefits the United \nStates, particularly the area along our southern border.\n  Ultimately, the example of Mexico demonstrates that free trade is not \nonly in Mexico's best interest, but it is also in our best interest as \nwell.\n  If we in the United States care about the illegal drugs that are \ncoming into our country across our southern border, if we care about \nimmigration problems, if we care about other issues of political and \neconomic stability, then we want our neighbors to be peaceful \ndemocratic nations. It is in our national interest.\n  It is in our national interest to see a Mexico, to see a Central \nAmerica, to see the rest of this hemisphere be democratic, to see \npeople have opportunities, to have a chance for the future. It is \nimportant for someone who has a family in Central America or Mexico to \nthink they have the opportunity to feed that family and not have to \nmake the very difficult, tough, and illegal decision to come to the \nUnited States and cross our border. It is in our interest for Mexico to \ndevelop, and one of the best ways is through fair trade.\n  What is true of Mexico is also true with the rest of the hemisphere. \nThat is why it is important this legislation pass.\n  Some of the strongest evidence of the benefits of free trade is over \nthe past couple of decades developing countries have been opening their \nmarkets voluntarily. Even some of the most traditionally closed \neconomies are abandoning protectionism in favor of freer trade. The \nWorld Trade Organization's own history illustrates this trend.\n  Established in 1948, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the \nprecursor to the WTO, had only 23 contracting parties, most of which \nwere industrialized countries. Today more than three-quarters of the \nWTO's 144 members are developing nations. Of the 49 countries \ndesignated as least developed by the United Nations, 30 have become \nmembers of the WTO, 9 are eagerly awaiting coming in, and 2 are WTO \nobservers.\n\n  The world of trade, economics, and international development is, of \ncourse, extremely complex, and it is hard to narrow things down to a \ndirect cause-and-effect relationship, but, for most people, the \nbenefits of free trade can be boiled down to one key point: Trade does \nspur economic growth and growth raises living standards.\n  There is an undeniable relationship between growth rates and economic \nfreedom, including the freedom to conduct international transactions, \nand research supports this. One study found that developing countries \nwith open economies grew by an average of 4.5 percent per year in the \n1970s and 1980s,\n\n[[Page S4345]]\n\nwhile those with closed economies grew by only .7, less than 1 percent.\n  Other studies have concluded that nations with relatively open trade \nregimes grew roughly twice as fast as those with relatively closed \nregimes. According to a recent report of Africa, East Asia, South Asia, \nand Latin America, were each to increase their share of world exports \nby just 1 percent, the resulting gains in income would lift 128 million \npeople out of poverty. The $70 billion that Africa alone would generate \nis approximately five times the amount it gets through aid and debt \nrelief. If developing countries as a whole increase their share of \nworld exports by just 5 percent, this would generate $350 billion, \nseven times as much as they receive in aid.\n  It is important that we now, more than ever, provide the President \ntrade promotion authority.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one of the issues that continues to haunt \nAmericans is the whole question of the cost of prescription drugs. I \nhave been troubled, as I have traveled across my State of Illinois, at \nthe number of people I have met who are facing serious hardship trying \nto pay for their drugs.\n  There was a hearing in the city of Chicago where a lady came forward \nto tell a sad story of how once she had received her prescription drugs \nfrom her doctor, she realized the cost of the drugs were so much that \non her fixed income under Social Security she could not take it. This \nlady was facing a particular hardship because she had received an organ \ntransplant. If she failed to take the antirejection drugs, she stood \nthe chance of dying or having even a worse medical condition.\n  Mr. President, do you know how she answered that particular dilemma? \nShe moved into the basement of her children's home. She is living in \nthe basement of her children's home so she does not have to pay for \nrent or utilities so she can have enough money to pay for the drugs to \nkeep that new organ in her body that keeps her alive.\n  That is a tale of desperation which unfortunately highlights the \nchallenge facing Congress as we need to find a way to make prescription \ndrugs not only accessible but affordable.\n  There are many projected ideas out there and some of them are \nvaluable and worth pursuing and some of them are certainly not. We have \nto keep in mind it is not just accessibility to the drugs, but it is \nalso the price of the drugs, to say to someone, you have a right to buy \nthe drugs, and we will help you up to a certain extent, may be of \nlittle or no value if the price of the drugs is so high the person \ncannot afford it. That, unfortunately, is a reality.\n  Last year the cost of prescription drugs across America went up 16 \npercent.\n  Mr. President, try to imagine a program or even something in your \nhome budget that you could deal with honestly with an annual increase \nin cost of 16 percent. So what we have tried to do on the Democratic \nside, as we address prescription drugs, is to go to the heart of the \nissue, to talk about the affordability of drugs, and to make certain \nthe way we pay for these drugs is not at the expense of the people \nacross America who need a helping hand.\n  Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan has been a leader on this issue. \nShe held a press conference I attended last week and talked about a \nprescription drug approach which needs to be thoroughly considered. \nRight now across America pharmaceutical companies are buying ads on \ntelevision, in magazines, and in newspapers talking about the \nimportance of research for new drugs. Believe me, there is not a person \nin the Senate who does not agree with that.\n  We also know that many of these pharmaceutical companies are spending \nextraordinary amounts of money, in excess of their research budgets, \nfor advertising. We see it every time we turn on the television, every \ntime we open a magazine or a newspaper--full-page ads for new drugs. \nThey show people dancing through a field of wildflowers and not \nsneezing, saying: Go to the doctor and ask for Claritin, or Clarinex, \nor Clarinet, or whatever happens to be the latest from Schering-Plough. \nWhen it comes to drugs such as Vioxx from Merck and other drugs, \nconstantly we are bombarded with this information.\n  What Senator Stabenow has found is that pharmaceutical companies \nacross America are spending two to three times as much on advertising \nas they are on research to find new drugs. Why should they be given a \ntax deduction for promotion, marketing, and advertising in excess of \nwhat they are spending for research? I do not think they should.\n  Frankly, I think we ought to call their bluff. If they tell us they \nneed money for research, then for goodness' sake, put in it research. \nGive us the new drugs. Make the profits by giving us these kinds of \nblockbuster revelations of new drugs that can change our lives. But do \nnot focus the money on advertising, promotion, and marketing when, \nfrankly, all it does is create false need and false demand.\n  So as we consider the prescription drug challenge that faces us, \nlet's be honest about the program we put together, that it is \naccessible and affordable, and let us also be honest about the source \nof the money. On the House side of the Rotunda, the Republicans have \nproposed a prescription drug bill which is paid for by taking money \nfrom hospitals under Medicare and doctors across America. That is not \nthe appropriate way to deal with it. We have to deal with it in an \nhonest fashion so that the people of America are not shortchanged in \nterms of their health care.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/15/senate-section/article/S4345-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4345-S4346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRADE PROMOTION AUTHORITY\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my thanks to \nSenator Baucus and Senator Grassley for accepting the Kennedy-\nFeinstein-Feingold amendment to trade promotion authority. Our \namendment instructs our trade negotiators to respect the Declaration on \nthe TRIPS Agreement and Public Health adopted by the World Trade \nOrganization at the Fourth Ministerial Conference at Doha, Qatar.\n  This amendment is essential for the developing countries of the world \nas they confront public health crisis, such as the HIV/AIDS pandemic.\n  The Doha declaration simply recognizes the right of these countries \nto use practices such as ``compulsory licensing'' to gain access to \naffordable pharmaceutical drugs. These practices are fully consistent \nwith international law, specifically the TRIPS agreement which is the \npresumptive legal standard for intellectual property rights.\n  Without these practices, the vast majority of HIV/AIDS patients in \nthe developing world would not be able to afford the more expensive \ndrugs from American pharmaceutical companies and, as a result, they \nwould suffer and die.\n  The statistics compel us to action. HIV/AIDS is now the leading cause \nof death in sub-Saharan Africa. Worldwide, it is the fourth biggest \nkiller. At the end of 2001, an estimated 40 million people globally \nwere living with HIV/AIDS; there were 5 million new infections and 3 \nmillion deaths as a result of the disease. In the last twenty years, we \nhave come a long way, but we are still losing because people are still \ndying.\n  Sub-Saharan Africa houses about 10 percent of the world's population \nbut more than 70 percent of the worldwide total of infected people, 95 \npercent of all HIV/AIDS cases are of those living in developing \ncountries.\n  An estimated 25.3 million people are living with HIV/AIDS in sub-\nSaharan Africa and 19.3 million Africans have died of AIDS, including \n2.3 million last year. This has meant an increase to a cumulative total \nof 12.1 million AIDS orphans, which is expected to increase to 42 \nmillion by the year 2010. An estimated 600,000 African infants become \ninfected with HIV each year through mother-to-child transmission, \neither at birth or through breast-feeding.\n  These statistics are what they are in spite of the tools we have to \nease the situation.\n  The Kennedy-Feinstein-Feingold amendment is by no means the perfect\n\n[[Page S4346]]\n\nsolution and there is a great deal of work yet to be done. But it is an \nimportant step for the United States to maintain a leadership role in \nthe global effort against HIV/AIDS.\n  We should not punish countries of the developing world for using \ndifferent tools to provide affordable treatment for their citizens who \nare suffering. We should be a partner and a leader in this effort.\n  Again, I thank the managers of this bill for accepting the amendment \nand I look forward to working with them again on this important \ninternational health issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/15/senate-section/article/S4346-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4346]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Minnesota [Mr. Wellstone] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3416 to amendment No. 3401.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To include additional criteria for reviewing the impact of \n  trade agreements on employment in the United States, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n       Section 2102(c) is amended by striking paragraph (5) and \n     inserting the following new paragraph:\n       ``(5) review the impact of future trade agreements on \n     United States employment, modeled after Executive Order \n     13141, taking into account the impact on job security, the \n     level of compensation of new jobs and existing jobs, the \n     displacement of employment, and the regional distribution of \n     employment, utilizing experience from previous trade \n     agreements and alternative models of employment analysis, \n     report to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate on \n     such review, and make that report available to the public;''.\n\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, this amendment, which I offer to the \nfast-track portion of the substitute, will enable us to get a better \nand more accurate assessment of the true impact of trade agreements as \nthey affect the job security of America's working families. In \nparticular, what this amendment does is clarify the scope of the labor \nimpact assessment called for in the underlying fast-track bill. What we \nsay is that the full assessment should be an assessment on the impact \nof job security, the level of compensation of new jobs and existing \njobs, the displacement of employees, and the regional distribution of \nemployment.\n  Let me explain each of these one by one. First, the impact of the \ntrade agreement. With this important impact statement being made \navailable to Members of Congress, to the Finance Committee, to the Ways \nand Means Committee, and, more importantly, I would argue, to the \npublic, it has an impact on job security. What we now know, on the \nbasis of some very good work by economists, is that when one has a \ntrade agreement and a company leaves, it is not only a question of \nwhether or not there are now fewer jobs by definition in our own \ncountry; it is also a question of the overall impact trade deficits \nhave on our economic performance in our country and what kinds of jobs \nare generated.\n  It is also true that when companies end up leaving and saying, \nlisten, we are going to go to Juarez, or Taiwan, or wherever, because \nwe can pay 50 cents an hour, or we can have children we can employ for \n18 or 19 hours a day with pretty horrible child labor conditions, what \nalso happens is that workers in our country are put in a really weak \nposition vis-a-vis bargaining so that quite often they then settle for \nlower wages, less by way of health care coverage, and all the rest, \nbecause companies say, if they demand this, we are leaving.\n  What this amendment says is let us have really a good economic impact \nanalysis and let us look also at the impact of these trade agreements \non not only job security, which in and of itself is really important, \nbut also the level of compensation, and then the whole question of \ndisplacement of employment and regional distribution. It could be and \nmay be that Senators want to make an argument that overall these trade \nagreements benefit our economy in the aggregate and benefit our Nation \nas a whole.\n  I think that is always open for debate, and people of good faith can \nreach different conclusions about it, but what we also need to \nunderstand is what regions of the country are most devastated, what \nsectors of the economy are most devastated, and what happens to those \nindustrial workers, be it textile workers in the South, be it \nsteelworkers, be it taconite workers on the Iron Range of Minnesota.\n  What this amendment does is clarify. It also calls for an examination \nof previous trade agreements and says we ought to take into account a \nvariety of different economic models: Let us look at NAFTA as it would \naffect future trade agreements, let us look at the different kinds of \neconomic models we can employ to do the most rigorous assessment; and \nthen, after we do these assessments, let us make sure this is made \navailable to the public.\n  What we do not want is a whitewash analysis. What we do want is a \nreal analysis so we can know what kind of impacts to expect from \nparticular trade agreements.\n  I think it is actually an amendment that adds to the strength of the \nbill. My colleagues, Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley, certainly \nhave tried to move in this direction, and I appreciate their work. This \nbuilds on their work.\n\n  I would quote again the Swedish sociologist Gunnar Myrdal, who said \nignorance is never random. My translation of that is: We do not know \nwhat we do not want to know.\n  All this amendment says is let us do a rigorous analysis of what the \nimpact of these trade agreements is on the lives of many families we \nrepresent.\n  There can be no doubt about some of the adverse effects of so-called \nglobalization and our trade relationships on jobs and job security in \nour country. In my home State of Minnesota, unfortunately, examples \nabound. The impact of the steel imports on the Range--other Senators \nfrom steel States, Democrats and Republicans, can present their own \ndata--but as I look at the sort of import surge of semifinished slab \nsteel and its impact on the taconite industry, all I have to do is look \nat 1,400 LTV workers now out of work.\n  In greater Minnesota, or in rural America, when someone has a job \nthat pays $50,000 to $60,000 a year, with good health care benefits, it \nis not at all clear what happens to those families. Those jobs are hard \nto find. They are hard to find outside metro areas.\n  The most poignant thing of all is that not only have these workers \nlost their jobs but now, depending upon their seniority, after 6 \nmonths, a year, they are losing their health care benefits as well.\n  Tomorrow there will be an amendment offered by Senator Rockefeller, \nSenator Mikulski, and myself, and what is especially poignant about \nthis is that these retirees who have worked hard all their lives now \nfind, as these companies declare bankruptcy, that these companies walk \naway from retiree health care benefits. They are terrified about what \nthey will do now.\n\n  We are very hopeful we will get strong support on the Senate floor \ntomorrow for an amendment that at least will provide a 1-year bridge at \nminimal cost toward maintaining coverage for the retirees. Then, of \ncourse, we have to come to terms with what we\n\n[[Page S4347]]\n\nintend to do in the long run in the future for the retirees and for the \nsteel industry. More about that amendment tomorrow.\n  Potlach shut down in Minnesota. Senator Dayton and I met with the \nworkers in the Brainerd area. It is never easy when grown men and women \nhave tears in their eyes. These were good-paying jobs, hard-working \npeople. I talked to the CEO of Potlach. He told me outright, Senator \nWellstone, we can compete with any company in the United States of \nAmerica but it is the trade policy that has simply done us in. We have \nno other choice. The results have been devastating for the workers.\n  I spoke yesterday to machinists and aerospace workers. They don't \nunderstand why so many jobs are farmed out. Northwest Airlines in our \nState is an example. The jobs are farmed out to repair shops in other \ndeveloping countries that do not have to live up to the same standards \nas the repair shops in our country. We may want to have high standards \nfor all the repair shops. I may have an amendment on this bill that \nspeaks to the specific question of safety for airline passengers.\n  We have heard of the difficulties from workers all across our \ncountry: auto workers, textile workers, steelworkers. Looking at NAFTA, \nthere is a direct link between the NAFTA trade agreement and trade \nadjustment assistance. I have three pages of companies and workers who \nhave lost their jobs in the State of Minnesota. It is quite \nunbelievable. For the families, it is devastating. There have been all \nsorts of promises made about the great benefits that would flow from \nNAFTA and from granting permanent trade relations with China. They have \nnot panned out. As I mentioned before, the studies on NAFTA have \nestimated we have lost about 766,000 actual and potential U.S. jobs \nbetween 1994 and 2000 because of the rapid growth in the trade deficit \nwith Mexico and Canada.\n  Canada increased from $17 billion to $53 billion; our trade deficit \nwith Mexico doubled from $14.5 billion to $30 billion. I congratulate \nmy colleague from Minnesota for his amendment which said we are not \ngoing to give up our right to review trade remedy legislation which is \nso important to making sure that working families in our country are \nnot put in an awful situation when other countries engage in illegal \ntrade practices and we begin to lose our jobs. That amendment that \nSenator Dayton and Senator Craig passed yesterday was an extremely \nimportant amendment.\n  Make no mistake, the job losses are real. These are workers who have \nactually been certified as eligible for trade adjustment assistance \nunder NAFTA. That means there is an official finding regarding these \nworkers in the State of Minnesota, these three pages of lists of \nworkers. There was an official finding that they lost their jobs \nbecause of trade covered under the NAFTA agreement.\n  A few examples: Cummins, located in St. Peter, MN, which made power \nsupplies, estimates the loss of jobs at 350 because of NAFTA imports. \nThat is a lot of jobs for the town of St. Peter, MN.\n  Hampshire Designers, located in La Crescent and Winona, MN, knit \nsweaters. The estimated loss is 150 jobs because the plant moved to \nMexico.\n\n  Hearth Technologies located in Savage, MN, produced prefab \nfireplaces. The estimated loss of jobs is 160 because the operation \nmoved to Canada.\n  There is an excellent groundbreaking study by Dr. Kate Bronfenbrenner \nat Cornell University, prepared for the U.S. China Security Review \nCommission and the U.S. Trade Deficit Review Commission which took a \ndetailed look at the impact of United States-China trade relations on \nworkers, wages, and employment in the United States. That is what this \namendment says. We want that analysis on these trade agreements, and we \nwant it made public before a final agreement is signed.\n  This was a pilot media tracking study that Dr. Bronfenbrenner did at \nCornell, an indepth analysis of production shifts out of the United \nStates since the enactment of the permanent normal trade relations \nlegislation.\n  Frankly, colleagues, it is a sad state of affairs and exemplifies the \nneed for this amendment that this pilot study was even necessary. As \nthe authors point out, there is no government data in this area. I want \nto make sure we have the data so we can be responsible policymakers. \nIndeed, the database developed in this pilot is the only national \ndatabase on production shifts out of the United States.\n  Let me give colleagues a feel for some of the conclusions. In the few \nmonths, between October 1, 2000, after enactment of PNTR legislation, \nand April 20, 2001, more than 80 corporations between October and April \nannounced their intentions to shift production to China. With the \nnumber of announced production shifts increasing each month, from 2 per \nmonth in October to November to 19 per month by April, the estimated \nnumber of jobs lost through these production shifts to China was as \nhigh as 34,500. Unfortunately, because this data is not regularly \ntracked, and hence the need for the amendment, we can only speculate \nthe trend has worsened.\n  The study also showed that the production shifts out of the United \nStates into China are highly concentrated in certain industries. Let me \ngive some examples of the electronics and electrical equipment, \nchemicals and petroleum products, household goods--toys, textiles, \nplastics, sporting goods, wood, and paper products. The U.S. companies \nare shutting down and moving to China and other countries. These tend \nto be the large, profitable, well-established companies, primarily \nsubsidiaries of publicly held U.S.-based multinationals: Mattel, \nInternational Paper, General Electric, Motorola, Rubbermaid. These \nmultinationals are not shifting production to China to serve a Chinese \nmarket. Their goal is to still serve the United States and a global \nmarket.\n  Perhaps even more important, of the jobs moving to China, \nincreasingly, they are the jobs in high-paying industries, for example, \nproducing goods such as bicycles, furniture, motors, compressors, fiber \noptics, injection molding, and computer components.\n  I hope all Senators read a front page story yesterday in the \nWashington Post about a 20-year-old woman in China who lived in the \nmost rural part of China. She came to one of the industrial cities to \nwork for one of the subsidiaries producing toys. She was working many \ndays in a row, day after day after day, 18, 19 hours a day, well until \n10, 11, 12 o'clock at night, from early in the morning. She felt ill \nand was not allowed a break. She became sick, threw up blood, and died. \nThere are working conditions like this all over the world--deplorable \nchild labor conditions, with violations of people's human rights, trade \nagreements with governments that systematically torture their citizens. \nAnd we don't consider any of this?\n  That is one of the reasons I am sorry to say these companies must \nleave the United States of America. They say to our wage earners: \nListen, you who want to make a living wage and you want to have health \ncare benefits and you want to be able to support your family, we don't \nneed to pay attention to you any longer. We will go to China. We will \ngo to other countries. We will go to countries where if people try to \norganize and bargain collectively and join a union, they will find \nthemselves tortured or find themselves in prison. It happens all the \ntime. Or we will go to countries where there are no labor standards and \nas a result, we lose these jobs. Our families are the ones who pay the \nprice. Then, if other nations should say we want to have some child \nlabor standards, these companies say: We will not go to your nation. We \nwill go someplace where we don't have to deal with any of that.\n\n  Then, what makes me most angry is that working families, working \npeople in the United States of America who dare to raise the question \nas to whether or not these trade agreements or this fast-track bill is \nexactly in their interest or their children's interests, are called \nprotectionists.\n  Then the argument is made: You terrible labor unions. You don't care \nabout the poor in these other nations. This helps them obtain \nemployment.\n  I will tell you something. I have been to some of these trade \nconferences, and I have never seen any of the poor represented by these \ncountries. I see their trade ministers. I never see the poor there.\n  What we have going on here is a race to the bottom. It is time we \nthink about this new international economy and how we can make sure \nthis new\n\n[[Page S4348]]\n\ninternational economy doesn't just work for multinationals but works \nfor working people or works for the environment or works for human \nrights.\n  Let me conclude the study's conclusion.\n\n       The employment effects of these production shifts go well \n     beyond the individual workers whose jobs were lost. Each time \n     another company shuts down operations and moves work to \n     China, Mexico, or any other country, it has a ripple effect \n     on the wages of every other worker in that industry and that \n     community, through lowering wage demands, restraining union \n     organizing and bargaining power, reducing the tax base, and \n     reducing or eliminating hundreds of jobs in the related \n     contracting, transportation, wholesale trade, professional, \n     and service-sector employment in companies and businesses.\n\n  Finally, the study notes that the employment effects of United \nStates-China trade relations are not felt in the United States alone. \nData points to massive shifts of employment around the world. As Dr. \nBronfenbrenner's study notes:\n\n       Contrary to the promise of rising wages and living \n     standards that free trade and global economic integration \n     were supposed to provide, in many countries these global \n     production shifts have led to decreases in employment, \n     stagnating wages, and increasing income inequality.\n\n  These conclusions were also echoed in a report presented by the U.S. \nBusiness and Industry Council Education Fund, ``Exporting Jobs: When \nTrade Agreements Are Really Investment Agreements.''\n  What this study points to is to a trend of low-income countries such \nas Mexico and China becoming sources of high-tech products for the \nUnited States. Import levels increasingly have swamped exports which \nare increasingly concentrated in the high-value industries, with the \nresult that we even lose more.\n  Here is the problem. It is not just that we are losing low-value \nproducts produced by low-wage workers, we are now losing the higher-\nvalue products produced by skilled labor that goes to other countries \nwhere these companies pay much less, do not have to abide by any \nstandards dealing with labor, don't have to abide by any human rights \nstandards, don't have to abide by any democracy standards, don't have \nto abide by any environmental standards.\n  What this says is let's take a close look. We need to understand \nexactly how this affects the people we represent.\n  A USBIC report, and numerous studies, including one published by the \nFederal Reserve Board of New York, made clear that most Chinese imports \nconsist of imports that are turned into exports. Since 1997, our trade \ndeficit with China has mushroomed from $49.7 billion to $83 billion. \nContrary to the promise of how this was supposed to help so many \nworking families in our country, this is great for the multinational \ncompanies involved, but it does not help most of our small businesses, \nand it doesn't help most of our workers.\n  Make no mistake, this amendment is not about being opposed to trade \nagreements. This is not about protectionism. I do not have the \nslightest interest in building walls at our borders or keeping out \ngoods and services, nor do I fear fair competition from workers and \ncompanies operating in other countries. I am not afraid of our \nneighbors. I do not fear other countries, nor do I fear other peoples. \nI favor open trade, and I believe the President should negotiate trade \nagreements which lead generally to more open markets here and abroad.\n  I am aware of the benefits of trade for the economy of Minnesota and \nthe economy of our country. In Minnesota, we have an extremely \ninternationally minded community of corporations, small businesses, \nworking people, and farmers. Open trade can contribute significantly to \nexpansion of wealth and opportunity, and it can reward innovation and \nproductivity. Negotiated properly, trade agreements can bring all these \nbenefits to trading partners in a fair way.\n  The question is, How do American values around protecting labor \nrights, the environment, food safety, and consumer protections figure \ninto our trade agreements? And what are the true costs of not \nrespecting these values?\n  The Bush administration believes commercial property rights are \nprimary in trade agreements but that labor and environmental and human \nrights are secondary. I think this is wrong. I think--and I think most \nAmericans agree with me--that fundamental standard of living and \nquality of life issues are exactly what trade policy should be about.\n  Trade agreements that do not respect the universality of these issues \nor these values undermine human dignity around the world, and they hurt \nAmerican workers in the process. If we fail to document the extent of \nthe impact of American workers and American jobs, then we have done a \nreal disservice to our own Nation.\n  So before we enter into additional trade agreements, we simply have \nto have better data and a more sophisticated analysis of the full \nemployment impacts of these trade agreements: Loss of jobs but also \nwage levels, ability to organize, impact on regions in-country, impact \non sectors of the economy. We need to know the impact of the agreement \non job security, level of compensation of new and existing jobs, \ndisplacement of employment, and the regional distribution of \nemployment. That is the purpose of this amendment.\n  It is a pretty simple amendment. Frankly, I would be surprised if my \ncolleagues did not accept it, although I am pleased to debate it as \nwell.\n  This is a labor impact amendment. I hope there will be strong support \nfor it.\n  I also say to Senators while I am out on the floor--and I know there \nare other Senators who want to speak--that this is the first amendment \nI have which is to improve the labor assessment impacts of trade \nagreements. Both my colleagues, Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley, \nstart down this direction. This is just a fuller analysis. We ought to \nknow the impact on job security. We ought to know the impact on the \nlevel of compensation of jobs. We ought to know what the displacement \neffects of unemployment are. We ought to know what the regional \ndistribution of employment will be. And we ought to look at prior trade \nagreements and come up with the best models of assessment. That is what \nI am saying. We need to be honest and rigorous in our analysis.\n\n  I also will have another amendment which will call upon us to assure \nthe consideration of democracy and human rights in trade agreements. \nBelieve me, I think it is vitally important that fast-track trade \nnegotiating authority for any trade agreement must have a specific \ndemocracy and human rights clause.\n  Let me just mention one other amendment. The other amendment I will \nbe introducing is an amendment regarding the contracting for Federal \nservices overseas. What this amendment with Senator Feingold says is \nthat right now, State authorities--too many--use TANF to administer \nelectronic benefits programs. Right now what they are doing is they are \ndoing business with companies that contract this abroad.\n  It is kind of an irony. This is the welfare reform. Actually, some of \nthese mothers could take these jobs. So it seems to me, the TANF money \nitself should not be used to support companies that are subcontracting \nwith companies that then basically do all the electronic work, so if \nyou are a welfare mother and you are calling and trying to find out \nwhere you are, where there is job training, basically you are talking \nto somebody in India. It strikes me that this is a bitter irony, \nespecially when some of the jobs could actually be available for these \nmothers and other families.\n\n  So this amendment would prohibit the use of any part of a TANF grant \nto enter into a contract with an entity that employs workers located \noutside the United States to carry out the activities under the \ncontract. I think that would be an interesting debate. I hope to have \nsupport for it.\n  I want to say, while my colleagues are out on the floor, the heart \nand soul amendment is the one--they are all important--that deals with \nthe steelworkers and a small amount of money. I know we have a Joint \nTax Committee estimate where we can help at least with a 1-year bridge \nfor the retiree health care benefits. This will be with Senators \nRockefeller, Mikulski, and I know other Senators joining in as well.\n  I want to, before relinquishing my right to the floor, speak on the \ndemocracy and human rights amendment, which my guess is will be \nsomewhat controversial. The reason for this is--\n\n[[Page S4349]]\n\njust look at this, just listen to this. This is from our own ``State \nDepartment Country Reports on Human Rights for 2001.''\n  For China:\n\n       Police and other elements of the security apparatus employ \n     torture and degrading treatment in dealing with some \n     detainees and prisoners.\n\n  This is the State Department report, not my report:\n\n       Senior officials acknowledge that torture and coerced \n     confessions are chronic problems.\n       Former detainees and the press reported credibly that \n     officials used electric shocks, prolonged periods of solitary \n     confinement.\n\n  And the list goes on and on.\n  Russia--I know we are establishing better relations with Russia--but \nfor Russia:\n\n       There are credible reports that some law enforcement \n     officials used torture regularly to coerce confessions from \n     suspects, and that the government does not hold most \n     officials accountable.\n       Torture usually takes one of four forms: beatings with \n     fists, batons, or other object; asphyxiation using gas masks \n     or bags--sometimes filled with mace--electric shocks; or \n     suspension of body parts.\n\n  Colombia: According to the ``Amnesty International Annual Report for \n2001'':\n\n       More than 4,000 people were victims of political killings, \n     over 300 ``disappeared'' and an estimated 300,000 people were \n     internally displaced.\n\n  And also, again, there are too many connections between military and \nparamilitary, which I think will be part of the debate on Colombia.\n  Labor rights, and Mexico:\n\n       Independent trade unions faced difficulties in organizing \n     during the year. . . . there are frequent abuses in the \n     country's 4,000 or so maquiladoras. Since NAFTA came into \n     force, some 3,000 assembly-for-export companies have set up \n     business in Tijuana. According to a study by Infolatina, over \n     1.3 million workers are paid less than $6 a day to work in \n     often deplorable conditions. . . .\n\n  These are our own Government reports. This one was actually the \n``International Confederation of Trade Unions Annual Survey of \nViolations of Trade Union Rights for 2001.''\n  The ``2002 International Labor Organization (ILO) Global Report on \nChild Labor'' has estimated that over 8 million children worldwide are \ntrapped in the unconditional worst forms of child labor--which are \ninternationally defined as slavery, trafficking, debt bondage, and \nother forms of forced labor.\n\n  And 180 million children aged 5 to 17--or 73 percent of all child \nlaborers--are now believed to be engaged in the worst forms of child \nlabor, comprising hazardous work and the unconditional worst forms of \nchild labor.\n  From the April 2002 Human Rights Report titled, ``Tainted Harvest: \nChild Labor and Obstacles to Organizing on Ecuador's Banana \nPlantations'':\n\n       Child workers explained that they were exposed to toxic \n     chemicals, handling insecticide-treated plastics, working \n     under fungicide-spraying airplanes in the fields, and \n     directly applying post-harvest pesticides in packing plants.\n\n  You name it. I could go on and on.\n  There was a Washington Post piece, which I mentioned earlier: \n``Worked Till they Drop: Few Protections for China's New Laborers.''\n  Again, the young woman I talked about was 19:\n\n       Lying on her bed that night, staring at the bunk above her, \n     the slight 19-year-old complained she felt worn out, her \n     roommates recalled. Finally the lights went out. Her \n     roommates had already fallen asleep when Li started coughing \n     up blood. They found her in the bathroom a few hours later, \n     curled up on the floor, moaning softly in the dark, bleeding \n     from her nose and mouth. Someone called an ambulance, but she \n     died before it arrived.\n\n  Colleagues, I just have to tell you, it is like we are being told \nthat we should lead, but we should lead on the basis of our own values.\n  On the first amendment, we will see what my colleagues do. I want to \nhave a rigorous analysis of what the impact of these trade agreements \nwill be on our working families. I do not want anything whitewashed. I \nwant to know what the effect will be in the south. I want to know what \nthe effect will be for textile and steelworkers. And I want to know \nwhat the effect will be on not only jobs lost but wages and the right \nto organize--you name it. That is what this first amendment is about.\n  With the second amendment, I want to have a democracy, human rights \nclause. I think we should at least say the countries that we are \nsigning these trade agreements with, will at least agree to make an \neffort. I have pretty reasonable language to deal with human rights. \nThere are probably 70 governments in the world that systematically \npractice torture. Do we care? Can't we at least have some language that \nsays countries have to show they are making an effort?\n  Why would we oppose that? Shouldn't we do something about these \ndeplorable child labor conditions? Are we just going to put this \nunpleasant reality into parenthesis? I don't believe so.\n  I am the son of a Jewish immigrant who fled Russia, born in the \nUkraine. I believe in human rights. I think my colleagues do. And the \namendment I am going to bring to the floor later is very reasonable. It \njust says let's at least have a clause where there has to be some \neffort on the part of these countries to make a commitment to moving \nforward on this democracy and human rights agenda.\n  And then, I just have to say, the TANF amendment is a no-brainer. \nWith all due respect, why should our Government money, why should our \nTANF money--States are hard pressed right now--why should we see that \nsubcontracted out to companies that are actually doing the work in \nregard to welfare reform located in other nations--India or wherever. I \nam not picking on India. I am just saying, it is not appropriate to use \nTANF money to do that when we are supposed to try to enable welfare \nmothers to do some work. And they could be doing the work. It does not \nmake a bit of sense.\n\n  Finally, we will be out here tomorrow with this steel amendment, \nwhich is so important. It is the right thing to do. It has a reasonable \ncost. It will be a great statement for the Senate to make, Democrats \nand Republicans alike: a 1-year bridge on legacy costs. Retirees have \nworked hard all their lives. Companies now go bankrupt and walk away \nfrom retiree health care benefits.\n  This is about compassion. This is about basically our being willing \nto help. Boy, I will tell you what. For the Iron Range in Minnesota, \nnothing could be more important. It is like that is why you are here. \nIt is why you are here because everybody has this experience. You know \npeople are frightened, and you know people really don't know what they \nare going to do. They don't know what they are going to do, and they \nask you to help. That is what this is about. And it certainly should be \npart of the trade adjustment assistance package. It is a good package.\n  I give my colleagues a lot of credit for working hard and coming up \nwith a bipartisan package.\n  Mr. President, there are other Senators in the Chamber. I will stay \nhere if there is debate on this amendment that basically calls for, \nreally, as I say, a rigorous labor impact clause to this bill. But I \nwill wait to hear from my colleagues. I am hoping there will be strong \nsupport because it just says let's know what we need to know. Let's \nmake sure that information is public.\n  Mr. President, I wait to hear from my colleague from Iowa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am not going to debate the Senator \nfrom Minnesota, but I am going to raise some questions he may want to \nanswer.\n  First of all, our bill, the bipartisan trade promotion bill that is \nbefore us, does provide for a study on the impact of trade on the \neconomy and jobs and things of that nature. So, quite obviously, we are \nnot opposed to studies that are within the bill.\n  The Senator from Minnesota wants to be a little more specific, give \ndirection to the study. And I suppose those directions and those \nstudies are something that I will want to have him answer some \nquestions about what his intent is.\n  I also surmise that the Senator from Minnesota probably will not vote \nfor trade promotion authority. That doesn't make his efforts to amend \nthe bill illegitimate in any way, but there are a lot of amendments \nthat could be adopted that probably will not get the support, in the \nfinal analysis, of the Senator from Minnesota.\n  One of the things we need to remember is that trade is all about \njobs. For instance, the whole movement of the last seven decades \nstarted with the bad economic impact of protectionism all over the \nworld. It started in the United\n\n[[Page S4350]]\n\nStates with the Smoot-Hawley Act. I don't know that it was intended to \nbe a bad piece of legislation. Probably the people who got it passed \nthought they were doing the right thing for the country. It bred \nprotectionism all over the world.\n  Everybody knows what happened in the 1930s, the tremendous movement \ntoward protectionism. World trade shut down and, consequently, the \nworld economy shut down. The Great Depression was a worldwide \ndepression. It wasn't long afterward, a new President came in, Franklin \nDelano Roosevelt, and a new Congress, and they had a rude awakening to \nthe bad impact of protectionism.\n  We have heard Senators give the history, so I will not go into it. \nStarting in the mid-1930s, with the Trade Reciprocity Act that passed \nCongress and, under the President's authority, the ability to reduce \ntariffs when it was reciprocally done by other countries, it was a \npattern from the mid-1930s until the present setup of the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade that went into effect in 1947, followed \nby the World Trade Organization in 1994. But that whole regime that \nstarted in 1947 was building on what started in the mid-1930s with \ntrade reciprocity to bring down tariff and nontariff trade barriers to \nenhance the world economy and to create jobs.\n  Trade is all about jobs. I keep referring to what President Clinton \nsaid about the expansion of jobs in his 8 years as President: 22 \nmillion jobs. He said one-third of them came because of foreign trade. \nThe reason he could say that is he negotiated the final agreements on \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement and on the Uruguay Round of \nGATT. So 22 million jobs, one-third, approximately 7 million jobs--7 \nmillion jobs--President Clinton said, were created as a result of \ntrade.\n  I hope everybody understands that there are leaders in the Democratic \nParty and leaders in the Republican Party who think trade is good for \nAmerica and it creates jobs. They are good-paying jobs that pay 15 \npercent above the national average; some people would say somewhere \nbetween 13 percent and 19 percent above the national average. We are \nnot talking about flipping hamburgers at McDonald's; we are talking \nabout good jobs.\n  You have to put this debate in the context of what the history of the \nworld economy has been in the last 70 years and what has happened in \nthe United States to create jobs as well. In my State of Iowa, at John \nDeere, one out of every five jobs on the assembly line is related to \ntrade. At 3M Company, Knoxville, IA, 40 percent is related to trade. I \ncould go on and on. It is probably more true in Minnesota than my State \nof Iowa, jobs related to trade.\n  The Senator's amendment doesn't undo anything we have in the bill. He \nasks for a study. There is nothing wrong with intellectually honest \napproaches to reviewing public policy. Senator Baucus and I believe \nthat is important. We have a study in our bill.\n\n  With that background, I would like to raise some questions with the \nSenator that he might want to answer or might not want to answer. As I \nunderstand it, the amendment would replace language in our bill which \nrequires the President to review the impact of future trade agreements \non U.S. employment and report to the Ways and Means Committee and to \nthe Senate Finance Committee on these reviews.\n  The amendment of the Senator from Minnesota expands upon this report, \nrequiring the President to take into account the impact on job \nsecurity, the level of compensation of new jobs and existing jobs, the \ndisplacement of employment, and the regional distribution of employment \nin conducting this review. The amendment requires the President to \nutilize experience from previous international trade agreements and to \nuse, in the words of the amendment, ``alternative models of employment \nanalysis.''\n  My question on that point would be: How is the President, in \nconducting the report, going to take into account the impact on job \nsecurity? How is he going to take into account the level of \ncompensation of new jobs and existing jobs?\n  Obviously, there is some data for that, as I indicated by the 15 \npercent figure I used that trade-related jobs pay above the national \naverage. But does the Senator from Minnesota want to take more than \nthose things into account that are already out there? Whatever the \nSenator from Minnesota wants the President to take into account, is \nthat data available? What is the relevance of requiring the President \nto take into account the regional distribution of employment? Is \nproviding jobs in one part of the country more important than jobs in \nanother part of the country, if the overall economic wealth of our \nNation is enhanced?\n  When President Clinton said one-third of the jobs created in the 8 \nyears of his Presidency were related to trade, he didn't say it \nbenefited Massachusetts much more than California, or much more \nMinnesota than it did the southern part of the United States. We are a \nnational economy.\n  I might also ask the Senator to explain, what are alternative models \nof employment analysis? In other words, how do his alternative models \nof employment analysis differ from what might be the present models of \nemployment analysis or maybe what you might call other models that are \nin use, or maybe there is a standard model out there? And have these \nalternative models of employment analysis been used by other nations, \nor in any venue, for that matter, to evaluate trade agreements? I think \nit is important that we know how they have been used. The Senator would \nwant answers to these questions to be part of the Record in case his \namendment is adopted so that we can have a basis for the direction of \nthe study. But we cannot be opposed to intellectually honest approaches \nto getting information and analyzing the policies we make. But we want \nto make sure there is a basis for producing the information that the \nSenator from Minnesota wants.\n\n  I am going to stop there. I have raised some questions about it \nwithout taking a position for or against the amendment at this \nparticular point.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I will respond to my good friend from \nIowa in a couple different ways. First of all--and I think he came \naround to this--well, I don't know what his overall position is, but I \nthink this amendment is not about an overall discussion about trade \npolicy. As my colleague said, it is all about jobs. What this amendment \nsays is, that is right; it is all about jobs. Let's have a thorough \nanalysis. Let's have a thorough analysis of the impact of these trade \nagreements on jobs.\n  We can debate for a long time, I say to my colleague from Iowa, about \ntrade policy. I am pleased to do so. I do not want to take a lot of \ntime away from other Senators, and I want to answer the specific \nquestions. I do want to say one thing, though. I do not want my good \nfriend from Iowa to corner me as a sort of protectionist.\n  I do not view this debate as being between people who are for or \nagainst free trade or protection. I view this as a debate between \npeople who are saying, look, we have this new international economy and \nlet's go forward with it, and the market will take care of everything; \nthere do not have to be any rules with it, versus those of us who say, \nyes, we have this international economy, we are all for trade, let's \nmake sure we harness this in such a way that there are some rules \nensuring these agreements work not just for the multinational \ncorporations but for our workers and for the environment and human \nrights and independent producers.\n  That is all this debate is about. Frankly, if I were to look at this \nwith a sense of history, I do not think this is a lot different than \nthe beginning of the 1900s. What happened in the beginning of our \nNation 100 years ago is that the economy went from more local and \nagrarian to national and industrial, and as these economic changes took \nplace, some of these economic changes were wrenching changes. It gave \nrise to very interesting politics as to what happened during that \nperiod of time. This was the populist-progressive politics. This was \nTeddy Roosevelt's time. This was the Farmers Alliance. This was the \nlabor unions building.\n  What happened? We had demands for an 8-hour day. We had antitrust \naction, the Clayton Act and the Sherman Act, women demanded the right \nto vote, and progressives said Senators should be directly elected, and \nso on and so forth. And you know what. Actually, as hard\n\n[[Page S4351]]\n\nas those struggles were, the media was opposed to all those groups and \norganizations and people who felt that, in a democracy, you demand what \nyou have courage to demand. They did not have the support of the media. \nThe Pinkertons murdered organizers, and money dominated politics \nprobably more so even than it does now.\n  Believe it or not, but you know what. Those courageous citizens were \nsuccessful. They changed our country for the better.\n  So it is, 100 years later, we now see some revolutionary changes in \nthe economy. Now it is an international economy, and trade policy \ndramatically affects the quality or lack of quality of the lives of \npeople we represent. What I insist on is that there be some rules that \ngo with this new international economy. I don't trust these \nmultinational corporations to look out for the best interests of family \nfarmers or workers or ordinary citizens in my State of Minnesota or \nanywhere else.\n\n  I will tell you something. Over the next 10 years, I want to say \ntoday in this Chamber to the Senator from Iowa, this will become a \nburning issue--whether or not with this new international economy we \njust say the market handles everything or whether or not we say, isn't \nthere some way that ordinary citizens fit into this somehow and there \nare some rules that go with this to make sure it works for people.\n  That is what people 100 years ago were saying: We want this new \nnational commerce civilized. We want it to work for us ordinary people, \ntoo. That is basically my framework.\n  Now, first of all, the amendment is about jobs, not this overall \npolitical economy debate in particular and specifically I say a \nthorough analysis of the impact. Second of all, as to why we are \ntalking about an impact, we have some specificity, I say to my \ncolleague from Iowa. It is on the basis I said earlier during the \ndebate. You want to look at job security. You want to look at also the \nlevel of compensation. You want to look at regional distribution. You \nwant to look at where people are losing jobs. And you want to look at \npast trade agreements. Frankly, we ought to look at all of that.\n  There are some good economists and others who have argued that it \nisn't even just the case of loss of jobs. It is also a question of \nwhether or not these trade agreements and companies that then leave \nparts of our country basically deny ordinary working people the \nleverage they need in their bargaining and their negotiations so they \nare put at a more severe disadvantage and have to settle for even lower \nwages or even worse health care benefits because of the threat of more \ncompanies leaving. Let's have analysis of that.\n  The next question from my colleague from Iowa was, how would this \naffect what a President does? Presumably, a President, whether that \nPresident is a Democrat or Republican, will look at the impact it has \non many working families throughout the country or in regions of the \ncountry and then decide it is good or decide maybe not--maybe now that \nI have all this data before me and all the specific information before \nme what I thought was a good agreement might not be good.\n  I think the President and the Members of the Congress as \ndecisionmakers should have more information. That is all. Frankly, I \nthink the general public should as well.\n  As to the whole question of why regional, I do not prejudge the final \ndecision that any President or we would make, I say to my colleague \nfrom Iowa, about these agreements, but I do think we should know if it \nhas a particularly harsh impact on textiles in the South. If it has a \nparticularly harsh impact on auto workers, let's know. If it has a \nparticularly harsh impact on steelworkers or taconite workers on the \nIron Range, we want to know. All politics are local. Tip O'Neill said \nthat. It is true. We all come to fight for people in our States, and we \nshould have the information on how these agreements affect particular \nregions or States. Does it mean a President might not still think it is \nthe right agreement? Does it mean that Senators agree or disagree?\n  Gunnar Myrdal was right, and I am not firing accusations at my \ncolleagues. I just love the quote. Gunnar Myrdal, the Swedish \nsocialist, once said, ``Ignorance is never random. Sometimes we don't \nknow what we don't want to know.'' I say we should know what we need to \nknow. That is what this amendment says.\n\n  Finally, and this is my only hard-hitting point, my colleague from \nIowa said it could be dropped from the conference--I think heard him \nsay that--if we accept it. It could be. I tell you what my position is \non this bill. If the Senator did not say that, better yet. I apologize.\n  My position on this bill is, we will see what it turns out to be in \nthe Senate. I think there are some good amendments that have passed. We \nstill have an amendment on supporting legacy costs for steelworkers. We \nhave good trade adjustment assistance. I want to see ultimately where \nwe come down. I reserve final judgment until I see what kind of bill we \nhave. But if, in conference committee, this becomes some little \nstrategy game and there are a few people in conference committee who \nsay, ``Well, now we are together here, we will just knock this \namendment out and knock that amendment out; they passed it in the \nSenate, and they did it on voice vote and we can knock it out,'' there \nare a lot of us who are going to raise cane, and we probably won't win \non the vote, but, ultimately, we all get held accountable. I think it \nwill take some real explaining as to why anyone would not want to have \nan honest, rigorous assessment of how trade agreements affect the lives \nof people we represent, period.\n  I am pleased to have a recorded vote on this if we are going to start \ntalking about knocking it out of conference committee. I have not \ndecided; I guess I could ask for the yeas and nays. I do not know. I \nwant to see what my colleagues are interested in.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I commend the Senator from Minnesota for his amendment. I \nthink it is a good amendment. It improves upon an already good piece of \nlegislation. That is, the underlying legislation already has employment \nimpact provisions.\n  The amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota goes further, and \nI think that is good. The more people know about the ramifications of \ntrade and the more different organizations investigate the \nramifications of trade, the better we will be. I tend to subscribe to \nthe John Locke ``marketplace of ideas'' philosophy and welcome a good, \nhonest discussion of the issues. I believe that the more discussion we \nhave, the more the sun shines, the more likely it is we will do what is \nright.\n  It is almost axiomatic. The more the Senator from Minnesota offers \namendments such as these, the better off we are all going to be in the \nshort term and the long run. We will know more about how trade does or \ndoes not affect job security, one of the provisions in his amendment. \nWe will know more about how trade affects levels of compensation.\n  It has often been stated, frankly, that some of the jobs created as a \nresult of trade pay more than nontrade jobs. It is equally clear that \nmany jobs are displaced by this very rapid race to globalization that \nis occurring in the United States as well as other countries.\n  I also think that regional distribution of employment, another one of \nthe Senator's goals, is a good one. Let's see if there is regional \ndistribution as a consequence of trade. I say this in part because \ntrade itself is not the most exciting topic in the world. It is sort of \nan opaque gauze that clouds Senators' minds when we talk about trade, \nexcept when we see the real life effects of trade. Real life effects \ncan be positive and not so positive.\n  The Senator is trying to put a real life face on trade, to look at \nthe actual effects or real people. I think this is a very good idea. I \ncommend him and urge the Senate to accept this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am going to go along with the \namendment as well, but I want to make very clear that it seems to me it \nemphasizes the negative impact of trade, and we have 70 years that \nprove the positive impact of international trade. We also had President \nClinton saying that out of 22 million jobs, a third of those, 7 million \njobs, were a result of trade. So there are positive aspects of trade.\n  Somewhere along the line in conference this has to be rewritten so it \nis\n\n[[Page S4352]]\n\nbalanced between what is negative with trade, which I have to admit \nthere are always adjustments in the economy. With or without trade, \nthere are adjustments in the economy. There are winners and losers. But \nthere are positive benefits of trade and the positive benefits outweigh \nthe negatives many times. We have to emphasize that.\n  Also, before we leave this issue, there is an emphasis between the \napproach of the Senator from Minnesota, to what he calls a new \ninternational economy, and my approach to the new international \neconomy. He says this is not a debate between protectionism and free \ntrade. He puts it in terms of those who think you ought to manage the \nnew international economy or let the marketplace have free flow.\n  When the Senator from Minnesota uses the word ``manage''--I do not \nknow whether he used the word ``manage''--we have to be able to manage \nthe new international economy. There is a difference in approach. If we \nare going to have management, it is going to be the government doing \nthe managing, as opposed to the free marketplace.\n  Is there an unfettered use of the free marketplace? Absolutely not. \nThere have always been rules. What is basic to this debate, center to \nthis debate, is whether the United States is going to be at the table \nfor the rulemaking of the international economy, and the rulemaking \nmeaning we are not going to have an unfettered free market, but we are \ngoing to have a predictable free market. There are going to be certain \nrules that all competitors will follow in the international community.\n\n  Trade promotion authority is whether or not the Congress of the \nUnited States, through our contract with the President to represent the \npeople of the United States, will be at the negotiating table when the \nrules are made. That is why it is so darn important that this \nlegislation pass because, as the Senator from Minnesota says, we need \nto give some direction. That has been the history of the General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade process since 1947. That has been the \nbasis of the World Trade Organization process since 1994: to have the \nrule of law apply to international trade.\n  Should the 270 million people of the United States be at the table to \nhelp write those rules? For that to happen, this bill must pass for the \nPresident to have the authority and the credibility to help write those \nrules that the Senator from Minnesota believes are so necessary. That \nis not managing the world economy; that is giving predictability to the \nplayers in the world economy, and rules of the game that must be \nfollowed and for a dispute settlement process when somebody is an \noutlaw in the international economy.\n  I hope we make clear this legislation is very important to accomplish \nwhat the Senator from Minnesota wants to accomplish at least in the way \nof not having an unfettered free market, although in his statements he \ntends more toward the government managing the world economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, we can finish. I do not know why the \nintensity goes up with my colleague from Iowa since I think we enjoy \neach other as friends. I have two quick points and will be done.\n  First, I have to say in a friendly way that I think the Senator from \nIowa misreads this. I am not going to call for a recorded vote. We are \ntrying to work together and the Senator supports this amendment. When \nmy colleagues says this is too negative, I do not prejudge what these \nstudies find. I am skeptical about it. I have laid out some figures of \nwhat I think is happening to trade, but to say you are going to do an \nassessment on job security, compensation of jobs, displacement of \nemployment, and regional distribution, my colleague is actually making \nmy case for me by thinking it is negative because he must think the \nstudy will show the consequences are negative. We do not need to change \nany language. Just do the assessment.\n  People in good faith can have different views. My colleagues might \nthink such a study makes the case for these trade agreements. Maybe it \nwill. I do not think so. Frankly, let's see what the assessment does. \nIt is not negative or positive. I am just saying this is what we have \nto look at and then we will see what the results show.\n  I never used the word ``manage.'' This is semantics. This \nadministration thinks that commercial property rights are primary in \ntrade agreements. I think labor, environment, human rights, and \nconsumer protection are also primary. They are not secondary. That \nshould be part of the new rules. That is the only difference we have.\n  By the way, what is interesting to me is that there can be a million \neditorials written in the most prestigious newspapers--actually most \npeople in the country feel the same way. They feel like, let us not \nbuild walls. I am an internationalist, but please make sure our \nconcerns and our families' concerns are somehow met.\n\n  What is going to be the impact on us? Are there going to be any fair \nlabor standards? Are there going to be any human rights standards? Is \nthere going to be anything about the environment? Why is it so weighted \ntoward commercial property rights? What happened to our rights as \nworkers? What happened to our rights as consumers? What happened to our \nrights as families who are worried about the jobs we lose? We could go \non, but we will not.\n  I have one final thing to say. My colleague from Montana, when he was \ntalking about the increase in jobs, or someone was--I remember this \nfamous quote, and I think it was a good one, from one of the industrial \nworkers who lost her job in a high-paying industry. President Clinton--\nI will be bipartisan about this--was talking about all the jobs \ncreated, and she said: Yes, I know all of them now. I have three of \nthem because I need three jobs to make the wages and support my family \nfrom what was my one job as an autoworker.\n  None of the Senators, Democrats or Republicans alike, would ever \nconvince the industrial workers of this Nation that they have not \ngotten the short end of the stick as a result of some of these trade \nagreements. The autoworkers in Iowa will not be convinced of that. They \nnever will, I do not think, as good a Senator as the Senator from Iowa \nis, and my colleague from Iowa is as good a Senator as one could find. \nI just think they do not see it that way. And I do not, either.\n  In any case, we will do the impact statement, with my colleagues' \nsupport, and I hope this is not gutted in conference committee. I think \nit would be a huge mistake. I think it would be as if to say we do not \nwant to have a good study. Let us have the assessment and then we will \nknow.\n  Do my colleagues want to move forward on the vote?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment? If \nnot, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 3416.\n  The amendment (No. 3416) was agreed to.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we have made progress on this bill. There \nare a couple of other Senators who are now in a position to offer \namendments, which I think will be offered very shortly. I hope they \noffer them very shortly because that would mean more progress.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3417 to Amendment No. 3401\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk numbered \n3417 and I call it up at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Edwards] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3417 to amendment No. 3401.\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4353]]\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To authorize the Secretary of Labor to award grants to \n  community colleges to establish job training programs for adversely \n                           affected workers)\n\n       Chapter 2 of title II of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. \n     2271 et seq.), as amended by section 111, is amended by \n     inserting after section 240 the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 240A.

Mr. President, I have an amendment which I will speak to \nthat contains a number of proposals.\n  We all recognize that trade has done some very good things for many \nAmericans. We know that. It is also important to recognize something \nelse: Trade has hurt a lot of people; it has hurt them in ways that \nsometimes people in Washington are not willing to recognize. To people \nin Washington, DC, free trade is a good concept. To a lot of people in \nmy State of North Carolina, and all over the South, and, in fact, for \nthat matter, all across America, free trade is a lot more than an \nabstract concept that people in Washington talk about. For them, trade \nhas had an enormous impact. In some ways, it has meant an end to a way \nof life that they have enjoyed for a long time, from generation to \ngeneration.\n  For those people who are hurting, we have an opportunity as part of \nthis legislation to make life better. My view is we have not only an \nopportunity but a responsibility to make life better. Americans have \nalways watched out for each other, and we need to do exactly the same \nthing when it comes to trade. We need to watch out and make sure we do \nnot leave behind millions of our fellow citizens who have been hurt by \ntrade and trade policy.\n  The people who are hurt are real people. They are mothers and \nfathers. They work hard. They work just as hard as anyone else in this \ncountry. They play by the same rules as everyone else. They do right by \ntheir family. They go to work every day and do their job. They work \nvery hard to build a future for their family.\n  These people are being hurt, and many of them badly hurt, by trade.\n  I am speaking particularly about folks who are in the textile and \nfurniture industries. There are a lot of those folks in my State of \nNorth Carolina. But there are also hundreds of thousands of those \nworkers across the South--in fact, in places all over the country, such \nas upstate New York.\n  For most of the 20th century, manufacturing jobs were the basis of \nour economy in this country. People who worked in those jobs didn't get \nrich, but they were able to take care of their families, they were able \nto go to church, participate in and contribute to their communities, \nand oftentimes they were able to send their kids to college. The jobs \nnever paid great, but they paid well enough--you know, $10, $12 an \nhour--for them to take care of their families.\n  The jobs did, however, come with health care benefits so they didn't \nhave to worry about taking care of their family if someone got sick or \ntheir children got sick. They came with vacations so they got a chance \nto spend time with their family every year.\n  The textile mills and furniture factories have been the cornerstone \nof a way of life in the South, a very good way of life. That way of \nlife is now being greatly affected and, in many cases, destroyed by \ntrade.\n  Since the beginning of the year 2001, 179 textile plants have closed \nin this country. We have lost 91,000 textile jobs. That is just since \nthe beginning of the year 2001.\n  If you go back to 1997, the numbers are even worse. This chart is a \nlisting of the jobs, textile jobs that have been lost since 1997. My \nState of North Carolina has been hardest hit. We have lost 122,000 jobs \nsince 1997. That is 122,000 families who, over the course of the last 5 \nyears, have lost their jobs.\n  In Georgia, they have also been hit hard, losing 95,000 jobs during \nthe same period of time. South Carolina lost 61,000 jobs; Alabama, \n35,000 jobs lost; Virginia, 23,000 jobs lost.\n  In North Carolina, we have had 57 plants close since the year 2001. \nIn the years between 1994 and 2000, we lost more than 100,000 jobs due \nto international trade.\n  There are towns in North Carolina where the mill employed literally a \nquarter of the people who lived in the town--one out of every four \npeople. Now the mill is gone and hundreds of people are looking for \nwork and the town is devastated.\n  In Washington, you often hear people say--and I have heard this in \nthe debate on the floor of the Senate, and I have heard it all around \nWashington, DC, in discussions on the impact of trade--well, they lost \nthose jobs, but they can get better jobs. That probably is true. It may \nwell be true in the big picture. The problem is, in a Southern mill \ntown it is a very different picture.\n  I grew up in Southern mill towns. My father worked in textile mills \nall of his\n\n[[Page S4354]]\n\nadult life--37 years, if I remember correctly. I know firsthand what \nimpact closing of these mills has on the town. They are the heart and \nsoul of the economy, and they are part of a way of life. The vast \nmajority of these other, better jobs that you hear people talk about \nare not in that town. That is the problem. When the mill closes down, \nthese jobs everyone is talking about, the better jobs that will \nultimately be available because of free trade, they are not in that \ntown. They are not anywhere near that town in a lot of cases.\n\n  It so happens that those jobs are also not the kind of jobs that a \nmiddle-aged ex-millworker is going to be able to get.\n  I often thought when I heard the discussions about, ``There are other \njobs,'' ``We can do job retraining,'' all of that is important. I do \nbelieve, for the country as a whole, free trade has a lot of positive \nbenefits. There is no question about that. But for those people who are \naffected directly, they are hit like a laser by these trade policies \nand this trade legislation. They are tremendously affected.\n  To say to men or women who have spent their entire lives taking care \nof their family, providing for their family, now at the age of 45, 50, \n55, ``We want you to change work; we want you to go to another kind of \nemployment,'' this is not just about a job, although their job is very \nimportant to them. It is about their dignity, their self-respect. It is \nabout their belief that that mother and father have always been able to \ntake care of their family, and all of a sudden they are not able to do \nthat anymore. They are being asked to train to do something entirely \nnew when they have spent their entire life doing this particular job.\n  I was blessed to be the first person in my family to go to college. A \nlot of folks are like my parents. They are great people. They work very \nhard, but sometimes they have not in their life had the extraordinary \nopportunity that many of us had in terms of our education. Across this \ncountry, about 60 percent of people have some college education, which \nis good; we hope that continues to improve as we go forward. But in the \nareas we are talking about, where these mills are closing and where \npeople have spent a lot of their lives working in those mills, the \nnumber is closer to 20 percent. It is more like one out of five people \nhave some college education.\n  So when a furniture factory or cotton mill in North Carolina shuts \ndown, oftentimes we have half the workers who do not even have a high \nschool diploma or a GED. The workers in these mills also are not young. \nThe average worker affected by a trade deal is more than 40 years old. \nThey have usually two kids, sometimes more. There is a good chance many \nof them have never spent any time working outside that factory. That \nhas been their entire life.\n  So when that factory closes and somebody in Washington, DC, says, \n``Oh, you can get a job in one of these other dynamic sectors of the \neconomy,'' it is a lot easier said than done. The people suffering from \ntrade have tremendous trouble getting back what they are losing.\n  When you look at North Carolina workers over age 55 who lose their \njobs due to trade, only half have found work within 2 years. So within \n2 years, still almost half of those people are unemployed. These are \nfolks who know how to work. They have worked all their lives. They are \nsome of the hardest working people I have ever seen.\n  I still remember vividly going in the mill when I was young and \nseeing the men and women who worked in that mill with my dad, and then \nwhen I got a little older I worked there sometimes in summers or part-\ntime. I have never seen anyone work harder. They were extraordinary. \nThey did it to provide for their families--for their family's self-\nrespect and dignity and for their own. They were proud of what they \ndid, and they ought to have been proud of it.\n  The problem is, although they are looking for work, and they know how \nto work, they just cannot find work. If they do find work, sometimes it \nis not good work. Instead of making $12 an hour, which they had been \nmaking in a mill, or $15 an hour, they are looking instead at a \nminimum-wage job with no benefits and no health care. Those are the \nkind of problems with which these folks are confronted. It is real. It \nhas an enormously devastating effect on their lives.\n\n  When a plant closes, it is not just the people who work there who are \naffected; the small businesses that used to sell groceries and clothes \nto the people who work in that mill suffer as well. The companies where \nthe plant used to buy materials and equipment suffer. The city \nhospitals, the police force that depend on taxes from that plant and \nfrom the people who work in that plant suffer.\n  According to some projections, for every job the textile industry \nloses, we may lose two more jobs as well. So families are suffering \nbecause of trade, but not just families; communities are also \nsuffering.\n  We need to do right by these folks, by the people who lose their \njobs, and by the communities. We need to do right by doing two things. \nFirst, we need to make sure that our trade deals give the same \nconsiderations to textile workers they are giving to our farmers. That \nis totally consistent with the current TPA bill and totally consistent \nwith fair trade.\n  By the way, I think it is a very good idea to have the language in \nthe bill that provides protection and support for our farmers. That is \nalso important in North Carolina. But we ought to treat these factory \nworkers, these textile workers exactly the same way. It is right and it \nis fair.\n  Second, when trade does hurt factory workers in industries such as \ntextiles, we need to make sure those workers have every opportunity to \nget back on their feet. We all say that is our goal, but we need to \nmake sure the law is as strong as our words.\n  So today, I have three proposals, all contained in one amendment now, \nfor amending trade promotion authority and trade adjustment assistance. \nI expect as we go forward that I may have additional proposals and at \nleast one, and perhaps more, additional amendments.\n  I have been working with my colleagues, the Senator from Iowa and the \nSenator from Montana, on not only this amendment and proposals \ncontained in this amendment, but also additional amendments. I will \ncontinue to work with them. I appreciate very much their cooperation.\n\n\n                       RECOVERY OF SENATOR HELMS\n\n  I take a moment to bring my colleagues up to date on how our friend \nand colleague, Senator Jesse Helms, is doing. I spoke with his staff a \nfew minutes ago. They are very pleased with his progress. He is doing \nwell. They think he is making terrific progress. I know all Members \nhave been thinking about him and have had Senator Helms and his wife \nDot and their entire family in our thoughts and prayers since this \nserious surgery. We will continue to do so. He is doing well.\n  His terrific staff, as usual, is carrying on their work with great \ndiligence and skill, as I told Senator Helms. He is doing very well. We \nare very encouraged.\n  Mr. MILLER. I thank my colleague from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. MILLER. I thank him for that eloquent presentation. He knows \nthese people and he knows this problem so very well.\n  Mr. President, I rise also in support of this country's textile \nindustry, an industry that is in crisis and an industry that needs our \nhelp very badly.\n  By the way, it was good to hear that report on Senator Helms. I know, \nif he possibly could, he would be here speaking with that unique \npassion that he has on this subject.\n  This industry is suffering from the worst economic crisis since the \nGreat Depression. I realize several factors have contributed to this \ncrisis; most notably is the strong competition of the U.S. dollar \nagainst foreign currencies.\n  For example, there has been an average 40-percent decline in Asian \ncurrencies against the U.S. dollar over the past 4 years. Prices for \nAsian yarn and fabric have dropped by as much as 38 percent.\n  This has caused a flood of artificially low-priced textile and \napparel products into our U.S. markets. At the same time, prices for \nU.S. textile products have plummeted since 1997 and profits have \nevaporated. And when prices fall, and profits disappear, plant owners \nhave no choice but to lay off workers\n\n[[Page S4355]]\n\nand close down plants. And that is exactly what has happened in this \ncountry.\n  The Senator from North Carolina gave you some telling statistics. \nSince the beginning of 2001, 179 textile plants have closed in this \ncountry. We have lost 91,000 textile jobs.\n  Bringing it home to my State of Georgia, since 2000, 17 textile \nplants have closed. That has put more than 19,000 Georgians out of \nwork--19,000 Georgians out of work.\n  This is not just some cold statistic that some member of my staff has \nresearched and come up with. I know many of these workers. They are my \nfriends. They are my neighbors. They have families to care for. They \nwant to work. As the Senator from North Carolina emphasized, they want \nto work.\n  In my neighboring mountainous county of Fannin County, where the last \nplant closed in Georgia, we call them the salt of the Earth.\n  My colleague from North Carolina, Senator Edwards, has offered \nseveral amendments to provide some assistance to our ailing textile \nindustry and to offer relief to hundreds of thousands of textile \nworkers who have lost their jobs.\n  I am very grateful he has come forward with these amendments--and \nthis amendment. This amendment would help level the playing field for \nthe textile industry in trade negotiations. It spells out for the \nPresident the objectives he should seek in any trade agreement that \ninvolves the textile industry.\n  I want to be very clear--as the Senator from North Carolina was--we \nare not seeking special treatment for the textile industry. The \nobjectives we want to include for textiles are no different than the \nobjectives spelled out in trade promotion authority for other \nindustries, such as agriculture.\n  The objectives are simple and broad. We ask that the President seek \ncompetitive opportunities for U.S. exports of textile products.\n  Also, we ask that the President reduce or eliminate tariffs or other \ncharges that hurt market opportunities for U.S. textile exports.\n  Again, these are the very same objectives we have listed for other \nindustries in the TPA bill.\n  The textile industry in the United States has a proud history, and it \nhas served this country well. All we are asking for today is a level \nplaying field. All we are asking for is a seat at the negotiating table \nfor an industry that is so important to rural communities across the \nSouth and across the Nation.\n  Simply stated, it is a matter of fairness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Georgia. He and \nI understand the people who work in textile mills in these small towns, \nas do a number of our other colleagues in the Senate. It is wonderful \nto hear him describe, firsthand, what he and I have both seen all our \nlives among the people who live there. I appreciate his support of the \namendment. And I appreciated his eloquence on this subject because he \ntruly does understand the plight of these folks.\n  I want to talk about the three proposals contained in this amendment. \nThe first proposal is very simple. Right now, the trade promotion \nauthority bill is full of objectives for different purposes--electronic \ncommerce, intellectual property, border taxes. Every one of those \nthings has its own objectives. The bill has a whole section of \nobjectives for agriculture, which is good. It is a good thing.\n  All told, there are more than a dozen kinds of objectives, with pages \non each. I do not have any problem with any of that.\n  When Congress gives the President as much negotiating authority as \nTPA provides, the least we can do is make sure how the President should \nexercise that authority.\n  This is my concern. There is a glaring omission from those \nobjectives. That omission is textiles and apparel. There is not a \nsingle objective for trade in textiles and apparel. Here is an American \nindustry clearly being destroyed by trade, and there is not a word \nabout it--not a word. That is wrong.\n  If we are going to give the President broad authority to enter more \nfree trade agreements, we need to make sure the President's negotiators \ndo not leave behind the people who work in these mills. These folks \nhave already suffered enough from trade agreements. This amendment \nwould set this problem straight, by including a set of objectives for \ntextiles and apparel.\n  There is nothing radical about the objectives. In fact, the language \nclosely parallels existing objectives for other areas, specifically \nagriculture.\n  Let me give you a few examples of how closely my amendment tracks the \nagriculture language already in the bill. For agriculture, the \nobjective is: ``to obtain competitive opportunities for United States \nexports of agricultural commodities in foreign markets substantially \nequivalent to the competitive opportunities afforded foreign exports in \nUnited States markets and to achieve fairer and more open conditions of \ntrade'' for various agricultural commodities.\n  That language makes sense.\n  This is what our amendment does: If you take out the words \n``agricultural commodities'' and insert the words ``textiles and \napparel,'' you have the amendment. It does exactly the same thing with \nexactly the same language.\n  The agricultural objectives talk about ``reducing or eliminating, by \na date certain, tariffs or other charges that decrease market \nopportunities for United States exports.'' Again, the language makes \nsense. Our amendment has exactly the same language.\n  So my point is this: We are not asking for any special treatment for \nthe textile industry. It just says that textile workers are just as \ngood and just as important as others who make enormous contributions to \nour economy, such as farmers.\n  Let me also be clear, the amendment does not ask for special \ntreatment for our textile industry compared to other countries. The \namendment just says that our textile industry should be treated by \nother countries the same way their textile industries are treated in \nthis country--with a level playing field. That is all we are asking.\n  Today, that field is not level. We have cut our tariffs. Between 1995 \nand 2000, our imports of textiles from other countries have nearly \ndoubled. That is because we cut our tariffs.\n  In the same period, our trading partners maintained their barriers to \nour products. We played fair; they did not. As a result, our partners \nhave gotten access to markets and shut down our mills. When we have \ntried to get into their markets, we have been met by trade barriers \nthat make it impossible.\n  This amendment says, very simply, that when it comes to textiles, the \nPresident's negotiators should work for a level playing field--not \nspecial preferences, just equal treatment.\n  So, to sum up, there are two major points in this part of the \namendment, this part of the proposal. First, textiles deserve to be \ntreated as well as agriculture--not better, just the same. Second, as \nwith agriculture, that does not mean special treatment for American \ntextiles compared to other countries; it just means equal treatment \ncompared to other countries. That is fair and just.\n\n  The second proposal contained in this amendment is aimed at making \ncommunity college more accessible for people who have lost their jobs \nand are being hurt by trade. We all know how critical education is to \neconomic opportunity. But for workers who lose their jobs, community \ncollege really is the key. It can make the difference between chronic \nunemployment or a good career in a new job.\n  Community colleges cost half as much as the average public university \nand 90 percent less than the average private college. And thanks to \ncommunity colleges, 5 million workers earn degrees and certificates \nevery year in professions ranging from information technology to health \ncare to construction.\n  Let me give one example of how community colleges can transform \nlives. These are the words of a former textile worker who is now a \nstudent at Guilford Technical Community College in Jamestown, NC. He \nsays:\n\n       The college gives you more than just the ability to train \n     for a different job. It also gives you back some hope that \n     has been stripped away when your skills and experience are no \n     longer useful.\n\n  I talked about this earlier. This is not just about a new job and \ntaking\n\n[[Page S4356]]\n\ncare of your family. It is about self-respect and dignity. We ought to \ngive people back the hope that unemployment has taken away.\n  The trouble now is that many community colleges can't keep pace with \nthe demand, especially in communities where textile mills are closing. \nIn fact, as mills close and workers need retraining more than ever, \ncommunity colleges are seeing their budgets go down. So you have more \ndemand for community college and fewer seats in the classroom. That is \nthe opposite of what we want.\n  Let me give a couple of examples. In 2001, Mayland Community College \nin Spruce Pines, NC, saw enrollment go up by 40 percent after two \ntextile plants in the area closed. Hundreds of additional workers had \nto be turned away from courses. The college didn't have the resources \nto serve them.\n  At Cleveland Community College in Shelby, NC, enrollment will grow by \n15 percent next year at the same time that the college's budget is \nbeing cut by 10 percent. As a result, the school had to cancel training \nprograms this summer that would have served over 400 workers, about 20 \npercent of the school's population.\n  These stories are typical. All across the country our community \ncolleges are struggling. We, in Congress, have to step up and make sure \ncommunity colleges fulfill the critical role they have always filled.\n  This amendment establishes a grant program to provide an emergency \ninfusion of aid to community colleges in areas hard hit by foreign \ntrade so that they can create or expand retraining programs. This \nprogram will compensate for cuts in State and local aid and make sure \ncommunity colleges can meet the needs of workers in their area who have \nlost their jobs.\n  At the same time, this amendment also encourages community colleges \nto serve workers who have not yet lost their jobs but who are at a high \nrisk of losing them. If you know you are going to lose your job and you \nwant to go back to school for a new job, you are doing the right thing. \nWe ought to help that and promote it. Much of the time we do exactly \nthe opposite. Folks can't go back to school. At a result, they are left \nstuck where they are.\n  People who want to plan ahead ought to be able to do it. This \namendment would give them a chance by supporting training not just for \nworkers who have already lost their jobs and been displaced but also \nfor workers who know the pink slip is coming and that they have to \nprepare for it.\n\n  The third proposal and the last proposal in the amendment meets a \nvery specific need. When a worker loses his job at a mill, one of best \nthings he can do is go back to school for more training. That is \nespecially true for working people who do not have a GED or who are \nimmigrants with very poor English. The best thing these workers can do \nis get a GED or take an English as a second language class, an ESL \nclass.\n  Here is the problem. Today if you qualify for trade assistance, you \nget 2 years of help with your education, but only 18 months of help \nwith your income. That is a huge problem for somebody who is trying to \nget a GED or take an ESL class. If they are getting help paying for \nschool, they often run out of money because they have to provide for \ntheir family before they finish their education and their training.\n  As a result, they are forced to drop out of school. Instead of \ngraduating and getting a job that may pay $15, $20 an hour, they have \nto stop, quit, and take a job that pays the minimum wage. This is \nwrong. We should not force people who lose their jobs because of \nforeign trade to choose between getting the education they want and \nneed and being able to put food on the table.\n  This amendment solves that problem by allowing extensions for 6 \nmonths of the TAA income allowances for workers who have taken a GED or \nESL class and are finishing up their training. Six more months of \nincome support can mean a lifetime of higher wages and higher living \nconditions. It is the right thing to do.\n  In sum, the three proposals contained in this amendment are aimed at \na very specific objective. They are aimed at helping people who have \nfamilies, mothers, fathers, people who have worked hard all their lives \nto provide for their family, to contribute to their community, to \ncontribute to their country, to get back on their feet and in another \njob, to get back to work, which they desperately want to do. They have \nspent their whole lives taking care of their families, doing right by \ntheir families and their communities and making an enormous \ncontribution. They just want to do it again. We want to make sure they \nget a chance to do it again. That is what the amendment is about.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support it. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from North \nCarolina on his amendment. It is one that is particularly needed for \nhis area of the country for several reasons. One is that under \nagreements that predate the Uruguay Round in 1992, the quota on \ntextiles and apparel is gradually being phased out. That is going to \nput tremendous additional pressure on employees working in the \nSenator's area of the country, the South, which means we need to go the \nextra mile to help people who will be dislocated as a result of various \nand significant changes in the textile and apparel industry.\n  I compliment the Senator. He is standing up for his people and the \nState he represents, as is Senator Miller. I am sure that others who \nrepresent textile and apparel workers have the same concerns. I \ncompliment them as well.\n  The underlying bill, as the Senator said, does have certain \nnegotiated objectives. The Senator adds an additional objective that \nwould specifically address trade in textile and apparel products. I \nmust say that although we have the most open market in the world, many \nof our competitors, unfortunately, are not nearly as open. As it \nhappens in the textile and apparel sector, some of the most active \nexporters of these products happen to be countries that maintain the \nhighest barriers to imports into their own country. For that reason, \nthe amendment we are now discussing directs our negotiators to focus \ntheir efforts on achieving fairer and more open conditions of trade in \ntextile articles, particularly with major textile and apparel export \ncountries.\n  It also instructs them to take into account whether our negotiating \npartners have played by the rules under existing agreements. This, too, \nis very important.\n  For that reason, I urge the Senate to strongly endorse this \namendment. I am sure my colleague from Iowa has the same point of view. \nWhen he finishes his statement, I will make a request as to when we \nvote on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I support the three amendments offered \nby the Senator from North Carolina. He has been very accommodating in \nworking with us to make sure these amendments could go very smoothly.\n  I believe it is appropriate to establish principal negotiating \nobjectives for textiles and for apparel. Neither the House trade \npromotion authority bill nor the bipartisan trade promotion authority \nbill that Senator Baucus and I now have before the Senate--and was \napproved by an 18-to-3 vote in our committee--contain negotiating \nobjectives for this sector of our economy, textiles and apparel.\n  The amendment of the Senator from North Carolina fills this gap by \nestablishing principal negotiating objectives modeled after things I \nhave supported for agriculture, such as we have agricultural \nnegotiating objectives that emphasize the importance of reciprocal \nmarket opening commitments.\n  These new textile negotiating objectives also recognize that it is \nimportant to promote market access opportunities abroad and to do it \nfor U.S. producers and to reduce and/or eliminate nontariff trade-\ndistorting measures which limit access for U.S. producers in markets \noverseas.\n  Ultimately, the best way to help workers in the United States who are \nor may be displaced by trade is to create as many new market access \nopportunities overseas for U.S. producers as possible because the more \ntrade and the more product we sell creates jobs in America, and we only \nhave a trade bill before the Senate for one purpose: To help our \neconomy. When we help our economy, we create jobs. This legislation \ndoes that, and the amendments by the Senator from North Carolina add to \nthe objectives of this goal.\n\n[[Page S4357]]\n\n  I also support enhancing educational opportunities for displaced \nworkers. Enhancing workers' educational opportunities is a very \npositive step forward and represents a strong investment in each \nindividual worker's future.\n  Finally, I support providing emergency assistance grant programs for \ncommunity colleges that provide training programs for displaced \nworkers. In fact, in my very State of Iowa, community colleges are \nright in the center of job opportunities, not just for displaced \nworkers but even for the training of workers for specific jobs, of \nexpanding businesses within our State or jobs that are moving into my \nState from another State.\n  This puts on the community colleges a burden for which they are \nprepared. This assistance to the community colleges is consistent with \nthe administration's efforts to increase and improve the quality of 2-\nyear-degree institutions. Workers or families and their communities \nwill benefit from this type of assistance. It is consistent with the \nsocial contract between dislocated workers and our country that is at \nthe heart of trade adjustment assistance.\n  Obviously, I urge all my colleagues on this side of the aisle to join \nme in supporting these amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the amendment offered \nby my colleague from North Carolina. I have joined with the Senator to \naddress the shortage of capacity in our community and technical \ncolleges as they attempt to meet the increasing demand for job training \nduring this period of high unemployment.\n  My State in recent months has consistently ranked among the three \nhighest unemployment states in the nation. It seems almost every week \nacross Washington, we have seen more layoffs, including a large number \nrelated to the aviation manufacturing industry.\n  Washington State has some of the most innovative programs in the \ncountry to provide displaced and incumbent workers with the training \nthey need to find and keep good jobs.\n  Unfortunately, as unemployment has gone up, training programs have \nhad to turn people away, since there's not enough financial assistance \navailable.\n  In March, my office issued a report that documented this shortfall of \ncapacity to deliver job training in our State. That report showed that \nwhile there were approximately 115,000 dislocated workers in Washington \nState in January, and an estimated 38,000 of those seeking job training \nservices, our institutions would only be able to accommodate \napproximately 12,500 of those individuals.\n  All of these Washingtonians want new skills, and they should have the \nopportunity to achieve those goals through the hard work and \ndetermination required to complete additional job-training courses.\n  Those skilled workers are critical to the competitiveness of our \nState and national economy, and the firms that hire them.\n  At this critical time for these workers and our economy, community \ncolleges in my State are doing everything possible to serve as many \napplicants as possible with existing resources. In Snohomish County, \nover 700 workers are on a waiting list to get help with training costs; \nEverett Community College is approximately 70 percent over-enrolled; \nand Lower Columbia Community College and Clark Community College are \neach more than 250 percent over-enrolled.\n  It is clear that we need to significantly increase our Federal \ncommitment to job training--both by continuing to expand funding for \nvouchers and Pell Grants, so that workers can pay for tuition, and by \nassisting our institutions that serve those students, so that they can \noffer an adequate number of courses for high-demand occupations.\n  My colleague's amendment--now incorporated in amendment No. 3417--\nwould specifically address this capacity shortage in our community \ncolleges. In areas of massive dislocation due to trade, such as \nWashington, the amendment would provide emergency assistance to \ncommunity colleges that plan to create or expand worker training \nprograms. The amendment would also encourage colleges seeking \nassistance to not only serve already dislocated workers, but also \nexpand programs for incumbent workers at-risk of losing jobs for trade \nrelated reasons.\n  I strongly support this concept, and urge my colleagues to support \nits inclusion in the bill.\n  Assisting workers displaced by trade cannot simply be a single-minded \napproach. That's why we have worked so hard to ensure that TAA eligible \nworkers have access to an expanded, comprehensive package of benefits \nthat includes up to two full years of income and training assistance, a \nstrong health care subsidy that will help workers maintain health \ncoverage for their families, and job search assistance.\n  We have improved the TAA program a great deal in this bill, but \ntraining assistance will not go far if those workers do not have access \nto the job training programs that they desire because classes at the \nlocal community college are full, and because funds simply are not \navailable in the state to hire new professors, offer more courses, and \ndevelop the systems to handle more students.\n  That is why this amendment is so important. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this effort and to work with us in the future to ensure that a \nsystem exists to better support our job training infrastructure in the \nfuture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are ready to vote on these amendments, \nbut we cannot vote at this time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that once debate is concluded on the Edwards \namendment No. 3417, the amendment be set aside to recur at 1:45 p.m. \ntoday, and that at 1:45 p.m., there be 4 minutes remaining for debate \nwith respect to the Edwards amendment, with the time equally divided \nand controlled in the usual form; that upon the use or yielding back of \ntime, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the amendment, with no \nsecond-degree amendment in order prior to the vote; that once the \nEdwards amendment is set aside, Senator Lieberman be recognized to \noffer an amendment relating to enforceable commitments, without further \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I want to spend a little time today \ndiscussing the labor and environment provisions of the fast-track bill \nthat is before us. I want to start with one simple truth: When it comes \nto labor and the environment, this is the most progressive trade bill \nthat has ever received serious consideration in the Senate. The labor \nand environment provisions in this bill represent dramatic--and I mean \ndramatic--improvement over the bill this Senate considered just several \nyears ago.\n  Some of my colleagues in both the House and the Senate have \nintroduced other bills this year. Some of those bills ignore labor and \nthe environment. Others require so much on these issues as to make the \nnegotiating process unworkable.\n  Both types of bills, in my view, are equally antitrade. They either \nignore the reality that labor and environment issues are now an \nentrenched part of the trade dialog, or they impose so many burdens and \nbarriers on fast track that they render it useless.\n  Last year, Congress and the administration worked together to solve \nthis problem. We unanimously passed in the Senate the Jordan free trade \nagreement negotiated by the Clinton administration, and President Bush \nsigned it into law.\n  Using the Jordan agreement as a model, our colleagues in the House \nand Senate drafted a fast-track bill that fully reflects the provisions \nof the Jordan agreement.\n  As the committee report states, the negotiating objectives on labor \nand environment are ``based upon the trade and labor and trade and \nenvironment provisions found in articles 5 and 6 of the United States-\nJordan free trade agreement. Those provisions (including their coverage \nby the Agreement's general dispute settlement procedures) have come to \nbe known as the Jordan ``standard.''\n\n  The Jordan agreement breaks new ground on labor and environmental \nissues in two ways. First, both countries agree to work toward better \nlabor and environmental standards. That is an agreement by both the \nUnited States and Jordan, written into the agreement.\n\n[[Page S4358]]\n\n  In the area of labor, we agreed to promote respect for worker rights \nand the rights of children--this is very important--consistent with the \ncore labor standards of the International Labor Organization, the ILO.\n  We also agreed to protect and preserve the environment and to pursue \ntrade and environmental policies that are mutually supportive.\n  Second, both countries agreed we would not lower labor or \nenvironmental standards in an effort to improve our positions on trade. \nThat provision of the agreement has equal weight with all other \nprovisions of the agreement--it is just as important, and it is just as \nenforceable.\n  I want to be clear on this point. By necessity, the language in the \nfast-track bill is not and cannot be identical to the Jordan agreement \nbecause the Jordan agreement is limited to two countries. The fast-\ntrack bill sets the agenda for future trade agreements.\n  That said, the fast-track language incorporates all of the elements \nof the Jordan agreement--every single one--and those who criticize the \nfast-track bill before us as not meeting the Jordan standard are simply \ninaccurate; they are not stating the case. They exaggerate the \nprovisions of the Jordan agreement or they mischaracterize the bill.\n  Let me address several of the critics' assertions.\n  First, opponents criticize this bill as failing to require that \ncountries implement core internationally recognized labor standards. \nThat is true, the bill does not make that requirement. But the Jordan \nagreement does not make that requirement either. The Jordan agreement \nsimply reaffirms obligations of each country that already exist by \nvirtue of ILO membership, and it establishes the countries' agreement \nto ``strive to ensure'' that ILO standards are recognized and protected \nby domestic law. If a country strives but fails to actually ensure that \nILO standards are reflected in domestic law, it has not violated its \nobligation.\n  Second, opponents criticize the bill as not including the Jordan \nstandard on enforcement. That is simply not true. The Jordan labor and \nenvironment provision that is susceptible to dispute settlement--that \nis, the requirement that a country not fail to effectively enforce its \nlabor and environmental laws in a manner affecting trade as \nincorporated as a priority negotiating objective in the bill.\n  Also, negotiators are directed to treat all principal negotiating \nobjectives equally with respect to access to dispute settlement, as \nwell as with respect to procedures and remedies in dispute settlement.\n  Third, opponents criticize this bill because of the late addition of \nthe so-called Gramm language. That is the Senator from Texas. They \nsuggest this language allows countries to lower labor and environmental \nstandards with impunity.\n  While I am not a fan of the Gramm language, critics grossly \nexaggerate the effects of this language. The language states that ``no \nretaliation may be authorized based on the exercise of these rights''--\nthat is, regarding countries' discretion to take certain actions--``or \nthe right to establish domestic labor standards and levels of \nenvironmental protection.''\n  As explained in the committee report accompanying the bill, this \nlanguage is simply meant to--that is the Gramm language--is meant to \n``clarify the language that precedes it in subparagraph (B).\n\n       That is, in negotiating provisions on trade and labor and \n     trade and environment, the United States should make clear \n     that a country is effectively enforcing its laws if a course \n     of action or inaction is the result of a reasonable exercise \n     of discretion or a bona fide decision regarding the \n     allocation of resources and, as such, the country cannot be \n     subject to retaliation on the basis of that course of action \n     or inaction alone.\n\n  In short, the language at issue does not allow countries to lower \nlabor and environmental standards with impunity. It does not add to or \nsubtract from the other provisions on labor and environment in the \nbill. It merely clarifies that administering authorities are to be \naccorded some leeway, as they are in the United States-Jordan \nagreement. Same, no difference.\n  Finally, opponents criticize the fact that promotion of respect for \nworker rights is included in this bill as and ``overall trade \nnegotiating objective'' rather than a ``principal trade negotiating \nobjective.''\n  As explained in the Finance Committee report, all of the subsections \nin section 2 of the bill carry equal importance in defining the trade \nnegotiated positions of the United States.\n  The report further states:\n\n       It is the expectation of the committee that in affirming \n     that a trade agreement makes progress toward achieving the \n     applicable purposes, policies, priorities, and objectives of \n     this bill, the President will address the purposes, policies, \n     priorities, and objectives in each of the subsections of \n     Section 2.\n\n  Moreover, by criticizing the placement of promotion of respect for \nworker rights under the heading of ``overall trade negotiating \nobjectives,'' the assertion implies that placement of the objective \nunder the heading of ``principal trade negotiating objectives'' would \nsomehow make it more enforceable. That is not true.\n  The fact is, the ability to use dispute settlement to enforce an \nobligation to promote or to strive to ensure is extremely limited, \nregardless of the section in which it is listed. How would someone \ndetermine whether a country is promoting core labor standards or \nstriving to ensure that those standards are reflected in domestic law?\n  Clearly, this legislation would direct the administration to \nnegotiate Jordan-like provisions as it completes negotiations with \nChile and Singapore. And as it moves forward on the free trade area of \nthe Americas, it makes Jordan the model for new negotiations with \nCentral America, with Australia and others.\n  There are also key provisions on labor and the environment added to \nthe Senate bill that were not in the House bill. First, in addition to \nan environmental report, which would be codified into law, the \nlegislation requires a new report on trading partners' labor practices. \nThese reports should clearly identify the problems to be addressed in \nnegotiations.\n  Second, the Senate bill contains important language to ensure that \nnew investor-State provisions, such as NAFTA chapter 11, are \ntransparent and accessible to the public. The bill also addresses \nconcerns that investor-State provisions may give foreign interests more \nrights than U.S. investors; that is, we made sure that provision is \naddressed in the solution in the bill, and, particularly with the \nadoption of the recent Kerry amendment, strikes a balance between \nlegitimate concerns of environmental citizen groups and legitimate \nconcerns of American investors overseas.\n\n  Foreign investors and domestic investors are treated the same way, \nand also municipalities are treated the same way with respect to \ndomestic investors or foreign investors that may be challenging a \ncertain environmental or municipality law under article V of the \nConstitution, the takings provision of the U.S. Constitution.\n  Some critics have said this legislation does not go far enough on \nlabor and the environment. Many critics, I believe, will never be \nsatisfied. They just cannot be satisfied. They simply oppose trade. \nThat is fine. Some will be for trade; some will be against trade. I \nrespect that. But as we move forward on these issues, we have to be \nrealistic. It is simply unreasonable to suggest that we can take our \nlabor and environmental laws, that is the United States, impose them on \ndeveloping countries, and slap sanctions on them if their laws do not \nlive up to our standards in a few years. That is simply unrealistic. We \nsimply would not be able to negotiate agreements if that were the \nposition the United States took and those were the provisions that we \nhad written into the underlying fast-track bill.\n  We have to move forward very aggressively, and the provisions in this \nbill do make that aggressive step forward. We have to keep in mind that \nmany of these countries are at a level of development that the United \nStates was at 100 years ago. At that time, the U.S. labor and \nenvironmental laws looked much different than they do today. That is \nnot to say we must wait a century for progress. Clearly, we should not \nwait a century.\n  Every trade agreement must recognize that labor and environmental \nstandards are now on the agenda. I might say that is one of the reasons \nthat the Ministers in Seattle collapsed because the world recognized \nthat\n\n[[Page S4359]]\n\nlabor and environmental provisions should now be on the trade agenda. \nThey should not be separate from trade. Our Ministers worldwide were \nunable to adapt quickly enough to come up with a solution dealing with \nlabor and environmental issues. The fact is, they are here. The \nquestion is, What is the most appropriate way to incorporate labor and \nenvironmental standards?\n  We have worked very hard with those most interested in this issue to \nwrite provisions in the Jordan agreement. That is a major step forward, \nand we are making those Jordan standards the core basis by which we \nproceed today.\n  We can lock in important advances that have already been achieved. \nThat is what we are doing with the underlying bill. We can create \npositive incentives for countries to raise their standards. We are \ndoing that, too. For example, we see phase-in benefits more quickly for \ncountries that make progress on labor and environmental issues. We can \nprovide technical assistance to help those countries improve their \npractices. Importantly, we can trade more with them.\n  Progress on labor and environmental standards often follows economic \ngrowth. That is certainly true of the United States. Our own country is \nthe best example of that. Isolating developing countries will not help \nthe United States, either. There will always be those that the fast-\ntrack bill does not do enough for, does not go far enough in protecting \nlabor and environmental standards worldwide.\n  To them, I say this bill is an enormous step forward. By definition, \nit is a fitting--and I say by definition because the prior bills were \nzero. This has a very significant provision so this is a great step \nforward. It is far stronger on these issues than any previous grant of \nfast track. It is far stronger than the fast-track bills considered by \nthe House and Senate only a few short years ago.\n  So can we not do more on these issues? Absolutely. And I will \ncontinue mightily to work to make improvements. That is a process that \nis likely to continue for decades to come. We will continue to work and \nmake progress with each passing couple of years on labor and \nenvironmental provisions.\n  At the end of the day, I believe there is something in this bill that \nis very solid with respect to labor and the environment. It is a \nwonderful first step forward, and I believe those who are truly for \ntrade worked hard to pass this comprehensive trade bill because, if \nthey vote against this bill, then we are back to where we were before, \nthat is, no meaningful labor and environmental standards as we have \nworked for in fast track.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, as we are getting set under the \nunanimous consent agreement before the Senate to take up a Lieberman \namendment, I will speak about what we have in the bill on workers' \nrights and how we deal therewith.\n  The Trade Promotion Authority Act is a bipartisan bill that Senator \nBaucus and I have brought to the floor which contains the most \ncomprehensive set of objectives on workers' rights and core \nInternational Labor Organization labor standards that have ever been \nincluded in any U.S. trade law dealing with international trade \nnegotiations.\n  Respect for workers' rights consistent with core International Labor \nOrganization standards is a clearly stated U.S. trade objective.\n  The President, in his contract with Congress, does our negotiating \nfor us, since we cannot have 535 Members negotiating with 142 other \ncountries. We have this contract with the President to do it. We direct \nthe President through this contract, which is this bill we are \nconsidering, to seek greater cooperation between the International \nLabor Organization and the World Trade Organization.\n  Furthermore, the President is directed to strengthen the capacity of \nforeign governments to achieve core labor standards. The Department of \nLabor will offer technical assistance to these foreign governments. The \nPresident will seek a commitment by other governments to effectively \nenforce labor laws. The labor provisions will encourage countries to \nimprove their labor laws without infringing on their sovereignty.\n  The labor negotiating objectives capture the key trade and labor \nprovisions we have had before this Senate previously in the U.S.-Jordan \nFree Trade Agreement passed last summer.\n  Our contract with the President to negotiate for us contains the \nstrongest labor positions our Government has ever taken regarding \nbargaining in the history of World Trade Organization negotiations over \nthe last 25 years.\n  For the first time, U.S. trade law will include environment as a U.S. \ntrade negotiating objective. The environmental provisions will \nencourage countries to improve their labor laws without infringing upon \ntheir sovereignty. Our President, through these directions, is to \npromote multilateral environmental agreements and consult with parties \nregarding consistency of such agreements with World Trade Organization \nrules. This addresses the widespread concern legitimately expressed \nthat trade rules should not interfere with U.S. environmental treaties. \nThis bill includes a requirement to conduct environmental reviews of \nfuture trade and investment agreements.\n  This is where we are. The bill before the Senate provides this \ncontract for the President to negotiate with these other countries for \nus. And by the way, it is something we must pass by majority vote once \nit is done or it never becomes law. In this contract we have the \nstrongest labor and environmental provisions ever.\n  The Senator from Connecticut will come to the floor and these will be \nunder attack. He will try to amend these very strong provisions we have \nin this legislation because somehow the strongest provisions ever on \nlabor and on environment, on trade legislation, are not good enough.\n\n  These are very much a very delicate compromise--issues that have been \nworked out between Republicans and Democrats, not just in this body but \nalso in the other body. As you can tell, that was a very tenuous sort \nof agreement that you don't want to mess with so much because it only \npassed by a 1-vote margin, 215 to 214.\n  So when we have this sort of bipartisan approach on these very \ncritical but sensitive issues such as labor and environment, we want to \nmake sure we do not upset that. It is my view, as you will hear later \non in debate when we get to the specifics of the amendment of the \nSenator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, that his amendments will upset \nthis very carefully crafted bipartisan agreement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, what is the present regular order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is under a unanimous consent \nagreement under which the next amendment to be considered will be the \nLieberman amendment, followed by a vote on the Edwards amendment at \n1:45.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a section of the \ntrade adjustment language in this bill. I congratulate the managers for \nthe hard work they put into bringing this bill forward. Trade \nadjustment is part of the three basic bills. There are four bills \naltogether, but I now address the three bills--the Andean trade bill, \ntrade promotion authority, and trade adjustment.\n  The trade adjustment language in this bill has some huge problems and \nsets off on a new policy course in a number of areas which I believe \nare extremely problematic and inappropriate. One of the issues it \nraises is that of how you deal with people who do not have health \ninsurance. I do not want to speak specifically to that, but I want to \nallude to that. In this bill there is a brand new major entitlement \nwhich will say if you are put out of work, allegedly because of a trade \nevent, you will have the right to get health insurance and have that \nhealth insurance paid for by the taxpayers, or 70 percent of it.\n\n[[Page S4360]]\n\n  That will create the anomalous situation, the really terrible \nsituation that people who are working for a living, working hard, \nworking 40, 50, 60 hours a week, and who do not have health insurance, \nwill end up paying an increased tax burden to pay to subsidize the \nhealth insurance of somebody who does not have a job, is not working, \nand who is already getting significant unemployment benefits, training \nbenefits, education benefits, and now will be getting very significant \nnew health insurance benefits.\n\n  The practical implications are significant, obviously. You are going \nto create two classes of citizenry in this country, one of which is the \nworking American who does not have health insurance and the other is \nthe nonworking American who does have health insurance. The person who \nis working is going to be scratching his head and saying: What am I \ndoing? Why am I toiling all these hours to pay for something I cannot \nafford for myself for somebody who doesn't have a job and who may not \nget a job because they are getting such good benefits that getting a \njob they may lose those benefits? So it creates some serious problems.\n  Basically, it is opening the door to a massive expansion of an \nentitlement program in the area of health care. That worries me a lot. \nIf we are going down that road, we should do it in the context of \ncomprehensive health care reform. We should look at all the people who \ndo not have health insurance in this country, not just a slice of \npeople, and make sure all those folks get a fair shot at health \ninsurance, not just a small slice.\n  But the more problematic, from the standpoint of policy, is this new \nconcept called wage insurance, which is in the trade adjustment bill. \nBasically, we are going to pay people to work less productively is what \nthis amounts to. This is sort of a French system of economics. We are \ngoing to say to someone: If you are out of a job because of a trade \nadjustment situation and you take another job where you earn less, the \nFederal Government will now come in and pay you the difference between \nwhat you made in the old job and what you make in the new job, up to \n$5,000. That creates a huge incentive for people to take a job where \nthey are less productive, to take a job that they might enjoy more, \nwhich they might like more but which doesn't pay as much because \neverybody else in the country is going to pay them something to take \nthat job.\n  It is a management of the marketplace which undermines all the \nconcepts we have in our country today of having money flow and having \npeople work in their most efficient way in order to create the most \nproductivity, in order to create the strongest economy.\n  One of the geniuses of our economy is that we are resilient and \nflexible. If you look at what has happened to Japan over the last 10 \nyears, they have been in recession. Look at what has happened to France \nover the last 20 years and their productivity has essentially been \nflat. So their standard of living has not grown the way our standard of \nliving has grown.\n  Look at the country of Italy where if you get a job you get it for \nlife. Again, you have low productivity growth and you have essentially \na flat economy in the context of our economy.\n  All these countries are functioning in a manner entirely different \nthan ours because they basically create an economy where productivity \nis not rewarded, where efficiency is not rewarded, where having capital \nflow to its most efficient place is not rewarded--it is actually \npenalized--whereas in America, our genius as an economy has always been \nthat we are a mobile, flexible economy where the money and the \nproductivity and people's jobs flow to the place where they are going \nto receive their highest economic reward. We create incentives for \npeople to go to work where they are going to get their highest economic \nreward. As a result, we rebound from economic slowdowns quickly and we \nhave an incredible rate of productivity in this country--we have for \nthe last few years--and we have economic growth.\n\n  What this proposal does, essentially, is reverse course. It goes \nback. It takes the socialistic concept that the Government should pay \nyou for not working, or at least for not working efficiently, and puts \nit in place. It is an idea that has been tried, of course. It is being \ntried. It is being used in many of our sister countries--France and \nItaly being the two best examples. But it is a system which has totally \nfailed. It is a 1950s idea of economics which essentially said that the \nstate can better manage the economy of a country than the marketplace. \nIn its extreme, it essentially has productive citizens paying to have \npeople who are doing less productive jobs stay in those jobs.\n  The idea that when somebody loses his job where he is earning a good \nsalary--let's say in a steel mill because that seems to be the industry \nmost affected--and then that person looks around and says, I didn't \nlike working in the steel mill, I am going to go out to the golf course \nwhere I can be a starter and get my free round of golf every day \nbecause that's what I would really like to do, that person, as a result \nof taking that job which he enjoys more but which pays significantly \nless, is going to be paid by all the other people in America who are \nworking hard every day, maybe doing jobs they do not find that exciting \nbut at least jobs at which they are being extremely productive.\n  That person who goes to the golf course is going to be paid up to \n$5,000 for taking this job which pays less than what he was receiving \nas a steelworker.\n  It is outrageous. It is incredible. It is a rejection of everything \nwe conceive as marketplace economics as a country. And it opens the \ndoor to proposals and concepts which will significantly undermine our \nproductivity as a society, which will lock in place job activity which \nis not producing but which is draining from the economic growth and \nwill inevitably undermine our vitality and will end up costing us jobs.\n  If a person is thrown out of a steel job and takes a job in some \nother position that pays less because that is the job they want or that \nis the job they can get, there are alternatives which we put in place \nto try to help that person improve their position. Under the trade \nadjustment assistance language that person gets more training, more \neducation, more educational opportunities.\n  Under trade adjustment assistance, that person gets longer \nunemployment benefits so they can look harder for the job they want. \nBut that person--for taking a job where their income is less and \nprobably, therefore, they are being less productive in a society that \nties productivity to income to a large degree--surely should not get a \nstipend to take a job which pays less.\n  It inverts the whole system of how we reward people in our society. \nWe are rewarding someone for taking a job that pays less and saying: \nHere is $5,000 on top of whatever you are being paid. I can see a lot \nof small businesses, medium-sized businesses in this country that are \nmarginal today where their employees could say, because they might be a \nsmall business where all the employees are participants, we are going \nto have to go out of business. Let's make sure we go out of business \nfor a trade reason. Let's figure out some way to do that because we can \nmove on and do something else and get $5,000 of assistance on top of \nwhatever job we take.\n  The unintended consequences, the perverse incentives are truly--well, \nthey can't be anticipated, but we know they are going to be \nsignificant.\n  This is one of the worst ideas I have seen come forward in this \nCongress, the idea that we are going to basically pay people to take \nlesser paying jobs. It is almost, on its face, a reason to reject this \nbill. When you couple it with some of the other problems with this \nbill, it becomes a heavy burden for those of us who support free trade \nto support a bill with this type of language.\n  So I do intend, at some point, as we go forward, to offer a motion to \nstrike this alleged wage insurance program. I hope Members will join me \nin rejecting this concept which can best be described as French \neconomics.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4361]]\n\n                Amendment No. 3419 To Amendment No. 3401\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I have an amendment at the desk which \nI call up for immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the pending \namendment is set aside and the clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], for himself, \n     Mr. Dodd, Ms. Mikulski, and Mr. Kennedy, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3419.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To clarify the principal negotiating objectives with respect \n                               to labor)\n\n       On page 245, line 14, beginning with ``and'', strike all \n     through ``protection'' on line 18.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, this amendment that I offer strikes \n27 words in the bill. These words are not many in number, as \nlegislating goes, but they embrace, in their exclusion, a very \nimportant series of principles that are at stake. So let me read the \nwords to you that would be struck. And I quote:\n\n       No retaliation may be authorized based on the exercise of \n     these rights or the right to establish domestic labor \n     standards and levels of environmental protection.\n\n  I say, respectfully, to those who put these words in the bill, and \nreported it out of the Finance Committee, that these words are a \nmistake because they essentially cancel out this provision, this \nsection in which they appear, which is one of the 13 principal trade \nnegotiating objectives in this bill before us, and the only one dealing \nwith labor and environmental protections. In effect, because of this \nlanguage that this amendment would strike, this becomes the only \nobjective in the bill that the bill itself says, in effect, ``we, the \nUnited States, will never enforce these portions of an agreement.'' And \nthat is the section relating to domestic labor standards and levels of \nenvironmental protection.\n  I do not understand why we would place such a self-defeating \nprovision in legislation, to create a standard and then to frustrate \nany potential for realizing and implementing it.\n  If this bill stated that we would not enforce an agreement we reach \non trade and services, for instance--which happens to be the second \nprincipal trade negotiating objective in the bill--I am sure we would \nhear an outcry. And I would be part of that outcry.\n  If we said in advance we would never seek to enforce an agreement \nthat we might reach on intellectual property protections or anti-\ncorruption obligations or electronic commerce or agriculture, there \nwould naturally be an outcry.\n  So there is no reason why we would want to enter into agreements on \nany of these subjects while telling our trading partners in advance \nthat we are not concerned about whether they are actually going to \nhonor the commitments they make to us--in this case regarding labor and \nenvironmental protections. But that is precisely what we do in this \npart of this proposal that I would strike with this amendment.\n  We say, in the pending bill, that we will never seek to enforce these \nlabor and environmental standards, the agreements made by the parties \nto agreements. I find this not only illogical but inappropriate and \nwrong.\n  Let me be clear, I am not here to propose that we only seek to \nenforce labor and environmental protections and not seek to enforce any \nother protections. This amendment proposes that we should have the \npower to enforce all of the provisions of these trade agreements that \nwould come before Congress under the legislation before us, to enforce \nthem equally, including labor and environmental protections. They \nshould not be placed in a second class of objectives as stated in the \nbill.\n\n  The pending bill already includes a clear statement in support of the \nequal enforcement principle I am advocating. That is the 12th principal \nnegotiating objective. It states that we should ``seek provisions that \ntreat United States principal negotiating objectives equally with \nrespect to--the ability to resort to dispute settlement under the \napplicable agreement, the availability of equivalent dispute settlement \nprocedures, and the availability of equivalent remedies.''\n  Then let me read it again. The words I am striking with this \namendment hope to say ``no retaliation'' may be authorized based on the \nexercise of these rights; that is, ``the right to establish domestic \nlabor standards and levels of environmental protection.''\n  My amendment simply conforms the rest of the bill to the objective \nstated in the 12th principal negotiating objective; that is, the \navailability of equivalent remedies: equal enforcement, equal standing, \nand no discrimination against the labor and environmental provisions of \nan agreement.\n  I have an additional reason to strike the statement in the bill that \n``no retaliation'' may be authorized based on ``the right to establish \ndomestic labor standards and levels of environmental protection.'' This \nenforcement exemption goes even further than the exemption I have just \ndescribed.\n  I read the language as exempting any labor and environmental standard \na country chooses to set from any potential retaliation under this \nbill. That includes labor and environmental commitments of the country \nwe might be negotiating with and that that country has specifically \nagreed to include in a trade agreement. It says, I fear, that any \nstandard is fine with us, even if it conflicts with a standard that has \nspecifically been set, negotiated, agreed to in the trade agreement \nthat would be the subject of consideration by the Senate under the \nrules established by this TPA proposal.\n  If countries can establish any domestic standards they wish to and no \nretaliation can be used regardless of what they do, they will be able \nto use that language to violate any commitment they have made or be \nable to bend and break every international standard without fear of \nconsequences.\n  For example, they will have an excuse to lower domestic standards to \nenhance their trade competitiveness, something nearly every trade \nagreement bars. This exemption makes a mockery of labor and \nenvironmental protections in trade agreements. It is an invitation to \nabuse, to sham agreements, and to evasion. That is why I move to strike \nit.\n  The labor and environmental protections at issue are very mainstream. \nThey express broadly held American values and broadly accepted American \npolicies.\n  Let me read to you some of the core labor standards set by the \nInternational Labor Organization. One is the freedom of association and \nthe effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining. \nAnother is the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor. \nThese aren't extreme requirements, these are basic humanitarian \nrequirements, in some sense even beyond the normal conflict of labor/\nmanagement or often the conflict of labor/management negotiations. \nThird is the effective abolition of child labor.\n  Does anyone wish to stand in this body, or anywhere else in America, \nand say we should not make clear that the powers of retaliation that \nare available for all the other principal trade objectives stated in \nthe bill should not be available against a country that is guilty of \nchild labor abuses?\n\n  Finally, the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment \nand occupation. Again, this is the fourth of the core labor standards \nset by the International Labor Organization, obviously accepted--\nenshrined, in fact--in amendments to our Constitution. It was certainly \nenacted explicitly in our time in a specific series of laws that have \nmade real the promise of equal opportunity and nondiscrimination in \nemployment which we would naturally not want to stand idly by and see \nviolated in countries with which we were negotiating agreements.\n  Is there any reason we would not want to enforce those values in a \ntrade agreement? Is there something protectionist about those values? \nIs there some reason we would want to invite countries to violate those \nstandards with impunity and provide no enforcement mechanism or remedy \nshould they do so?\n  I would ask the same about the environmental protections here. Is \nthere some reason we would not want to support clean air and clean \nwater in countries with which we are negotiating, some reason we would \nwant to tolerate\n\n[[Page S4362]]\n\nexposing workers, for instance, to destructive, dangerous toxic \nchemicals when that country in an agreement has made commitments not to \ntolerate these low environmental standards?\n  In its current form, this provision I wish to strike with my \namendment cancels out the very provisions on labor and environmental \nprotections it seeks to legislate as one of the 13 principal trade \nnegotiating objectives. It does so uniquely, putting this non-\nretaliation language only in this particular section dealing with labor \nand environment and not in any of the other 13 principal trade \nnegotiating objectives.\n  The issue I wish to raise with my amendment is simple. The question \nis, will we seek, whether we want to preserve within our Government the \npower to stand by our word and compel countries that are trade \nnegotiating partners with us to stand by their word, to keep their \npromises when it comes to labor and environmental commitments, promises \nthat they will have negotiated and made in the agreements we would sign \nand bring before the Congress for ratification? Or are we going to \nallow these agreements to be rendered meaningless and unenforceable, \neven before we enter into them?\n  The amendment I propose this afternoon says we will hold our trading \npartners to the commitments they make in trade agreements. We are not \nlegislating to reach out and tell them exactly what to do within their \ncountries. We are saying, if they make an agreement with us regarding \nenvironmental protection or labor standards, they have to keep that \npromise. We will expect them to do no less.\n  This is a critical part of the proposal before us, making trade \nagreements that are not only in the interest of commerce and economic \ngrowth but that are consistent with some of our most fundamental values \nand certainly consistent with a wide range of our laws adopted at the \nFederal, State, and local levels.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. I thank the Chair and \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I rise in opposition to the Lieberman \nmotion to strike. I welcome the opportunity to debate it because this \nmotion goes right to the heart of the constitutional system that we \ncherish in America, and from which we benefit every single day.\n  Let me explain this amendment and what it would do, where it came \nfrom, and why it is relevant. For the first time under fast-track \nauthority, we in this bill will be bringing labor and environmental \nissues into the trade negotiation process. In 2000, the Clinton \nAdministration negotiated a free trade agreement with Jordan that for \nthe first time brought both labor and the environment fully into the \nprocess. Now, based on the Jordan Agreement, the bill before the Senate \nwould direct our negotiators in all future trade agreements to \nestablish international dispute resolution tribunals to proctor and \nenforce trade agreements in which labor and environmental issues are \ninvolved. And this will probably become the standard for our trade \nagreements with the rest of the world.\n  The bill approved by the House of Representatives and then the Senate \nFinance Committee sets out our negotiating objectives of the United \nStates with respect to labor and the environment. These objectives are \npretty clear, and I want to take the time to read them because I want \nto be absolutely sure everybody understands this issue.\n  Section 2102(b)(11) says that the principal trade negotiating \nobjectives of the United States with respect to labor and the \nenvironment are:\n\n       To ensure that a party to a trade agreement with the United \n     States does not fail to effectively enforce its environmental \n     or labor laws through a sustained or recurring course of \n     action or inaction, in a manner affecting trade between the \n     United States and that party after entry into force of a \n     trade agreement between those countries.\n\n  This objective is what we would be trying to achieve, and it would be \nbinding on both the United States and on the trading partner with whom \nwe are negotiating.\n  I want to remind my colleagues that the first sentence of the \nConstitution of the United States--article I, section 1--sets forth the \nlegislative power, and sets it squarely in the Congress:\n\n       All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a \n     Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a \n     Senate and House of Representatives.\n\n  It is the first sentence of our Constitution, so we are not fooling \naround here. In other words, there is no question under the American \nconstitutional system that Congress has the power to make the law.\n  But now we are entering into trade agreements that for the first time \nwill involve passing judgment on our labor and environmental laws and \nstandards. In light of the constitutional guarantees of article I, \nsection 1, the House and Senate authors of the trade promotion \nauthority bill before us decided to set out what our rights are as \nAmericans with regard to our labor and environmental standards. It \ntherefore goes on to say that our objectives also are:\n\n       (B) to recognize that parties to the trade agreement retain \n     the right to exercise discretion with respect to \n     investigatory, prosecutorial, regulatory, and compliance \n     matters and to make decisions regarding the allocation of \n     resources to enforcement with respect to other labor or \n     environmental matters determined to have higher priorities, \n     and to recognize that a country is effectively enforcing its \n     laws if a course of action or inaction reflects a reasonable \n     exercise of such discretion, or results from a bona fide \n     decision regarding the allocation of resources.\n\n  It then goes on to say, and this is the sentence that Senator \nLieberman would strike:\n\n       And no retaliation may be authorized based on the exercise \n     of these rights or the right to establish domestic labor \n     standards and levels of environmental protection.\n\n  What does this mean? It means that we are going to enter into trade \nagreements, and that in those trade agreements we are going to try to \npromote labor and environmental protection, but that we will maintain \nour sovereignty with regard to writing our own labor and environmental \nlaws, and to exercising Executive Branch power to enforce the law \nthrough the promulgation and enforcement of regulations. It means that \nin exercising our rights under the Constitution of the United States, \nwe could not be subject to retaliation by our trading partners.\n  Let me point out to my colleagues that the concern about retaliation \nis not an idle concern. It is the kind of problem that we increasingly \nwill run into as we move further into a world where trade crosses \nborders and where international agreements increasingly bind the United \nStates. The question as we move into this world comes down to this: \nWhat rights will we preserve as a sovereign country?\n\n  If we struck the protective language approved by the House and by \nSenate Finance, we would be passing the decisionmaking authority on \ndomestic labor and environmental issues from the Congress and the \nPresident to international tribunals. Those tribunals--not Congress and \nthe President--would be the ones to pass judgment as to whether changes \nin U.S. labor and environmental laws represented a failure to \neffectively enforce our laws. The tribunals, on which Americans are a \nminority, would be the ones making those decisions. And if they found \nthat U.S. actions were wanting, they could authorize retaliation \nagainst American exporters--all on the basis of the exercise of our \nlegitimate constitutional rights.\n  Let me give you some real examples that exemplify this concern. In \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement, we did not include Jordan-like \nlabor and environmental provisions, but we did have side agreements on \nlabor and environment. Those side agreements, which were negotiated \nafter President Clinton came into office, include an enforcement \nmechanism that allows parties to file claims alleging failure by a \nNAFTA country to effectively enforce its labor and environmental laws.\n  The NAFTA experience provides several examples that go to the very \nheart of this sovereignty issue. For example, a complaint was filed \nalleging that the United States was not effectively enforcing the \nEndangered Species Act--namely, in protecting the spotted owl--and \ntherefore was benefitting the United States in trade.\n  If the protective clause of the pending bill were stricken by the \nLieberman motion, and the bill became law, who would make the \ndetermination as to whether we are protecting\n\n[[Page S4363]]\n\nthe spotted owl if a similar complaint were filed under that new law? \nThese decisions would be made not by the American Congress, not by the \nAmerican President, not by the American courts, but by an international \ndispute resolution tribunal, the majority of whose members would not be \nAmerican. That tribunal would decide whether or not we are protecting \nthe spotted owl and, therefore, whether or not we are enforcing the \nEndangered Species Act. And if they concluded that we were not, they \nwould have the power to order retaliation against American manufactured \nproducts and American agricultural products.\n  Let me give another example. Some years ago we passed a rider to an \nappropriations bill that eliminated private remedies for salvage timber \nsales. Following the constitutional process, that rider was approved by \nthe Senate, approved by the House, and signed into law by the \nPresident. Subsequently, a complaint against the United States was \nfiled under NAFTA that alleged that by passing that rider, we had \nfailed to effectively enforce our environmental laws.\n\n  If this bill were approved without the protective clause, due to the \nLieberman motion to strike, then an international tribunal--only one of \nwhom would be an American--would make a determination as to whether or \nnot, in exercising our right to enact laws regarding federal timber \npolicy, we should be subject to retaliation against our manufactured \nproducts, our agricultural products, or our services, or anything else \nwe sell on the world market.\n  Let me give one more example. I could cite examples that involve \napple growers, and egg workers, but let me talk about one that involves \nConnecticut. A complaint was filed under NAFTA against the United \nStates by the Yale Law School Worker's Rights Project alleging failure \nto effectively enforce U.S. minimum wage and overtime protections.\n  If this bill were approved as modified by the Lieberman amendment, we \nwould face a situation where the decision as to whether or not the \nUnited States was enforcing fair labor standards would have been \ndetermined not by a Federal court sitting in Connecticut but by an \ninternational tribunal. In the case of NAFTA, that tribunal would \ninclude only one American among the three judges. In the case of a \ntrade agreement with Europe, that tribunal making a determination about \nwhether or not we are enforcing our laws would include mostly \nEuropeans. I submit that we do not want to put ourselves in that \nposition.\n  The issue here is pure and simple: it is sovereignty. If we strike \nthis protective provision, we will be putting ourselves in a position \nwhere we can change our laws but we will be subject to a judgment by \nnon-Americans that in making that change we gained an unfair trade \nadvantage and can be penalized for it. Determinations about whether or \nnot we are enforcing labor and environmental laws would be transferred \nfrom Congress and the President to international tribunals.\n  I believe it is critical that we preserve American sovereignty. I \ncannot believe that the American people, if they were alerted to this \nissue, would support putting decisions on labor and environmental \nissues in the hands of international tribunals rather than in the hands \nof American courts, the Congress, and the President.\n  Let me give a final example. I know many people in the Senate did not \nvote to open ANWR, but had Congress made a decision to open ANWR based \non national security concerns, under the provisions of this bill as \nproposed to be amended by Senator Lieberman, we could see retaliation \nimposed on cotton growers, computer manufacturers, or any other \nexporter in the United States. Based on a complaint filed before an \ninternational tribunal, the majority of whose members are not \nAmericans, we could see a decision that we benefited in trade by \nopening ANWR, and therefore, that we could be subject to sanction. A \ntribunal could not overturn our action in making the law, but it could \nauthorize retaliation in the form of punitive tariffs against American \nmanufacturers, agricultural producers, and service providers. That is \nsomething I do not believe we want to do.\n  I want submit for the Record a letter from the American Farm Bureau \nFederation that is dated today:\n\n       The American Farm Bureau Federation urges your opposition \n     to the Lieberman motion to strike language in the Trade \n     Promotion Authority bill that would safeguard U.S. \n     sovereignty and protect U.S. agricultural producers from \n     retaliatory tariffs.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                              American Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 2002.\n     Hon. Phil Gramm,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Gramm: The American Farm Bureau Federation \n     urges your opposition to the Lieberman motion to strike \n     language in the Trade Promotion Authority bill that would \n     safeguard U.S. sovereignty and protect U.S. agricultural \n     producers from retaliatory tariffs.\n       As approved by the House and reported by the Senate Finance \n     Committee, the TPA bill contains a protective clause that \n     will ensure that Congress and the President may make and \n     enforce U.S. labor and environment laws and can protect U.S. \n     farmers and ranchers from the threat of retaliation. Without \n     this critical protection, U.S. agriculture could be targeted \n     by our trading partners solely on the basis of the normal \n     exercise of Congressional lawmaking.\n       As you know, U.S. farmers and ranchers worked hard to \n     ensure that exports markets around the world would be open to \n     our products. If successful, the Lieberman motion to strike \n     would effectively allow international panels to authorize \n     retaliation against the United States for exercising its \n     sovereign discretion on U.S. labor and environmental laws.\n       For these reasons, we urge your opposition to the Lieberman \n     amendment to the Trade Promotion Authority bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Richard W. Newpher,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3417 to Amendment No. 3401\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour has come \nfor 4 minutes to be evenly divided on the Edwards amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Is the Edwards amendment subject to a point of order under \nthe Budget Act?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. At this time, the Chair does not have \ninformation as to the specifics of that order.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I raise a point of order that the amendment violates \nsection 311(a)(2)(B) of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is not in order while time \nremains for debate on the amendment.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will reserve until the appropriate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask unanimous consent for no more than 3 minutes to \nrespond to my colleague, the Senator from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I understand the order was given to go \nto the Edwards amendment at 1:45 p.m. I ask that the Senator from \nConnecticut withhold his comments at this point.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask my friend from Montana if he would be certain \nthat I have an opportunity, before the vote, to respond to the Senator \nfrom Texas.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nproceed to 4 minutes of debate evenly divided on the Edwards amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I urge my colleagues to support the \nEdwards amendment and, frankly, I urge my good friend from Texas to \nalso support it and refrain from raising a point of order or otherwise \nopposing the Edwards amendments. They are very good amendments. They \nhelp this bill. I am quite surprised, frankly, that the Senator from \nTexas was having objections to them. I am not going to use all the \nremaining couple minutes we have. I will let my friend and colleague \nfrom North Carolina make those statements, but I strongly urge us to \nwork this out so we can get these Edwards amendments passed.\n  I yield the remaining time to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n[[Page S4364]]\n\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, I point out for my colleagues that both \nthe ranking Republican Member and the chairman of the committee support \nthese amendments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators be added as \ncosponsors: Senators Hollings, Miller, Cleland, Lincoln, and Allen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. EDWARDS. Madam President, this amendment does two things. First, \nit says our trade negotiators have to stop entering into trade \nagreements that hurt North Carolina textile workers and that are unfair \nto North Carolina textile workers. North Carolina's textile workers are \nentitled to a level playing field, and that is what this amendment is \ndesigned to give them--no better, no worse than anybody else, just a \nlevel playing field.\n  Second, it makes sure that workers who have lost their jobs because \nof trade have an opportunity to get the education and the training they \nneed to get another job at as good or better wages.\n  At its base, that is what this amendment is about. The amendment \nserves those two purposes. It is a critical amendment for the textile \nworkers in my State of North Carolina where, over the course of the \nlast 5 years, over 100,000 workers have lost their jobs. These people \nhave been hurt by trade. We need to give them an opportunity to get \ntheir lives back in shape. That is what this amendment is about: No. 1, \nmaking sure any trade agreement that is negotiated is fair and fair to \nNorth Carolina textile workers; No. 2, for those people who have lost \ntheir jobs, families who have lost their jobs, making sure they have an \nopportunity to get back on their feet and do what they have always \ndone--work and help to support their family and give their kids a \nchance for a better life.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, as the chairman of \nthe committee and the ranking Republican Member do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Two minutes remain in opposition to the Edwards amendment.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I will not speak at length on the Edwards amendment, but I \nwould like my colleagues to note that under this amendment, we once \nagain would be expanding trade adjustment assistance benefits. The \nCongressional Budget Office, for some inexplicable reason, is saying \nthat the Baucus-Grassley amendment--already itself subject to a point \nof order--has some savings in the outyears, even though those savings \nare grossly smaller than the new expenditures. Therefore, they are \nsaying that because the program put in place by this amendment would \ntake 18 to 24 months, it would not be subject to a point of order.\n  It sounds to me as if people are decided on this amendment. But under \nthis amendment we once again would be adding additional benefits for up \nto 26 weeks for people who are not now receiving trade adjustment \nassistance. It seems to me at the very moment we are spending Social \nSecurity trust funds, we should care about preserving funds. But nobody \nseems to care. Yet if we were debating giving someone a new tax cut, \nthere would be a great hue and cry that we were taking money away from \nthe Social Security trust fund. Yet here, when we would be adding more \nbenefits and creating more programs, nobody seems to care.\n  I am opposed to this amendment. I hope some will join me in voting \nagainst it. I don't know how we are ever going to pay for all these new \nspending programs at the very moment when we are running a deficit and \nspending Social Security surplus. Everyone seems joyful to create a new \nprogram to benefit someone. But at some point, we have to draw the \nline.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

The majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, we are making better progress this \nafternoon. I really appreciate the two managers and the work they are \ndoing to move it along. I hope we can line up a series of amendments, \nhopefully with time agreements. I know there is an interest on the part \nof both sides to accommodate as many amendments as possible. The best \nway to do that is with time agreements. I encourage all Senators to \nagree to a time limit on their amendments so that we can move through \nadditional amendments.\n  There have been questions about the schedule. To accommodate an event \nI know a number of our Republican colleagues want to attend tonight, we \nwill not be in late tonight, but I do hope, for those who could offer \ntheir amendments and have some debate on the amendments without having \na vote, we might do that in the interest of moving the legislation \nforward. We should not just look at tonight as a lost opportunity. To \nthe extent Senators can come to the floor and offer amendments, we can \ncertainly stack some of those votes tomorrow morning.\n  It is also our expectation that we will not be in session during the \ngold medal ceremony tomorrow afternoon. That will last about an hour \nfrom 2 to 3. We need to make the most of the time that is available to \nus tonight and tomorrow, both before and after the ceremony.\n  Senators should know that we will be in session on Friday and we can \nexpect votes Friday morning. We will try to move this legislation along \nand accommodate as many Senators who have amendments as possible, but \nthey need to help us by agreeing to time limits.\n  I know there has been some concern for the May 16 deadline. That is \ntomorrow. The Andean Trade Preference Act expires tomorrow. We do know \nthat the administration has the authority to move that date, should \nthey choose to do so. I hope they will consider doing that given the \nfact that tomorrow is May 16. We will move this expeditiously. We will \ndo all we can to get this job done. Nobody wants to pass ATPA more than \nI do. I do think it is important for the administration and for all of \nus to work together to ensure\n\n[[Page S4365]]\n\nthat we leave no question about our determination to complete our work \non ATPA and ensure there is continuity when it comes to the application \nof the trade legislation and our determination to ensure that that \ncontinuity is created in law.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I believe the majority leader is correct as to the May 16 \ndate, that the administration does have the ability to change that day, \nbecause it was set, as far as an agreement, with the chairman of the \nWays and Means Committee in the other body. The fact remains, there is \ngreat uncertainty in these countries. They don't know how the Congress \nof the United States works. They don't know that May 16 isn't a drop \ndead date. It does not remove the compelling aspect of us reauthorizing \nATPA as quickly as possible.\n  I hope the majority leader will consider, if there are further \nproblems--and I hope not--that we would split that bill out and pass \nit, which would be overwhelming, 98 or 99 votes. The President of Peru \nhas been up here. There is enormous uncertainty in already unstable \neconomic situations in those countries. I still don't think it is right \nfor us to unnecessarily tie ATPA to the other legislation. I appreciate \nthe majority leader's appreciation for that as well. I thank the \nmajority leader.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I will just say that the Senator from \nArizona is absolutely right. If all else fails, we have no other choice \nbut to split it off. We would do so if we were not able to make \nprogress, which is why I started out as I did urging Senators to come \nto the floor. I know Senator Lieberman and others are prepared to offer \namendments this afternoon. Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley have \naccelerated the consideration of these amendments. As always, Senator \nReid has been on the floor to help serve as a motivator in getting the \njob done.\n  Mr. REID. Will the leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. REID. I would note, while the leader has been engaged in other \nbusiness during this last vote, I have checked with the two managers. \nIt is my understanding within the next few minutes, next 15 minutes or \nso, there will be a motion to table Senator Lieberman's amendment. He \nknows that. Following that, we are in the process of working out an \nagreement with the Senator from New Hampshire who will offer an \namendment. The Senator from Illinois will offer an amendment--maybe in \ninverse order. They have both agreed to time limits. We should have \nthat done by the time the next vote occurs.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I would like to echo the colloquy between the Senator \nfrom Arizona and the majority leader. It is true that the Secretary, \npursuant to the discretion he is given under the law, did extend the \nperiod with respect to the Andean tariffs to May 15. It is also true \nthat he has the authority to extend it even longer. It is also true \nthat the last time this issue arose, some in the administration \nsuggested to Chairman Thomas in the House that this would only be \nextended once. We are very close to passing the trade package in the \nSenate, getting to conference very quickly. I urge the administration \nto extend the period for a little bit longer.\n  Having said that, it is important to remind all Senators that the \nunderlying bill is drafted to make benefits retroactive to December 4, \n2001. So even if the period the administration has suggested expires \nand we would move past that period, nevertheless all collected tariffs \nwould be returned retroactive to December 4, 2001. It is our hope to \nget this passed very quickly.\n  I say all that so it is clear that we have pressure but all is not \nlost if we don't move to get it all passed within the next days or the \nnext few weeks. We are working together to solve the problem which has \nbeen mentioned.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3419\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I believe my friend from Texas would \nlike to enter a letter into the Record. I yield to him.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I thank our dear colleague from \nConnecticut.\n  I would like to enter a letter, and at that point I would like a \nminute toward the end to sort of sum up. I have a letter here from the \nthree principal Democrat cosponsors of the trade promotion authority \nbill in the House, Cal Dooley, Bill Jefferson, and John Tanner. This \nletter is important because it discusses the very provision of the bill \nrelated to no retaliation based on sovereign rights, an issue which is \nbeing discussed here with an effort to strike this language. Since they \ndiscuss it directly, I would like to commend it to my colleagues.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print the letter in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2001.\n     Senator Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Senate Finance Committee, Dirksen Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Baucus: We were happy to hear that you and \n     Senator Grassley reached an agreement regarding trade \n     promotion authority legislation. We have spoken many times on \n     this issue. As you know, many of your TPA concepts are \n     reflected in the House-passed legislation.\n       We are particularly proud of the progress this legislation \n     makes on labor and environmental issues. The legislation \n     passed by the House incorporates fully the enforceable \n     standard on labor and the environment in the Jordan Free \n     Trade Agreement, and includes objectives that will allow \n     negotiators to seek and obtain all of the commitments in the \n     Jordan FTA. Moreover, by including the enforceable Jordan \n     standards and provisions promoting increased standards on \n     worker, child labor, and environmental protections, the \n     legislation reflects the principle that countries should \n     improve--not roll back standards for labor and environment.\n       Last week, you had inquired about the principal negotiating \n     objective on labor and the environment, in particular, \n     section 2(b)(11)(B). Subparagraph (B) provides that one of \n     the principal negotiating objectives will be: to recognize \n     that parties to a trade agreement retain the right to \n     exercise discretion with respect to investigatory, \n     prosecutorial, regulatory, and compliance matters and to make \n     decisions regarding the allocation of resources to \n     enforcement with respect to other labor or environmental \n     matters determined to have higher priorities, and to \n     recognize that a country is effectively enforcing its trade \n     laws if a course of actions or inaction reflects a reasonable \n     exercise of such discretion, or results from a bona fide \n     decision regarding the allocation of resources and no \n     retaliation may be authorized based on the exercise of these \n     rights or the right to establish domestic labor standards and \n     levels of protection.\n       You had asked about the meaning of the last phrase, which \n     was added to section 2(b)(11)(B) as a part of the rule \n     providing for consideration of H.R. 3005: ``and no \n     retaliation may be authorized based on the exercise of these \n     rights or the right to establish domestic labor standards and \n     levels of protection.'' This phrase, which is limited to \n     subparagraph (B), clarifies what was already the case in the \n     TPA legislation that was reported out of the Ways & Means \n     Committee, and reflects the standard set forth in the Jordan \n     FTA. That is, countries have the right to exercise discretion \n     needed to enforce regulations regarding to health, worker \n     safety and the environment without fear of retaliation for a \n     reasonable exercise of that discretion.\n       We hope this is helpful to you. We look forward to working \n     with you to pass this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n     Cal Dooley.\n     Bill Jefferson.\n     John Tanner.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  I want to come back to respond to some of the things my friend and \ncolleague from Texas said in opposition to my amendment.\n  I do want to state for the record what I hope is clear, which is that \nI support the underlying bill. I support the trade promotion authority, \nso-called fast track. I believe one of the great lessons we learned in \nthe 1990s, under President Clinton, was that trade is a pillar of \neconomic growth in our country.\n  We only have so many people in our country. There is only so big a \nmarket. We have to open up markets around the world to create more jobs \nat home. We have to find other places around the world to sell our \nproducts.\n  We have obligations, and that generally creates not only economic \ngrowth, more jobs, more wealth but improves our country generally. So I \nsupport the underlying bill.\n  This amendment I have offered deletes words in the pending bill which \nI\n\n[[Page S4366]]\n\nbelieve are very unfair and discriminate against the provisions of the \nbill that call for some concern and consideration of labor standards \nand environmental objectives in the agreements.\n  The statement of my friend from Texas in opposition to my amendment \nfascinated me, surprised me, and I say with all respect, I do not \nbelieve it is real. I do not believe his concerns are justified by the \nterms of the legislation or what would be normal trade practice. Let me \nspeak to this.\n  The amendment strikes language that is unique to one of the 13 \nprincipal trade objectives in the bill that deals with labor standards \nand environmental protection. The language is unique and says:\n\n       No retaliation may be authorized based on the exercise of \n     rights of discretion that are uniquely given with regard to \n     labor and environmental standards and the right to establish \n     domestic labor standards and levels of environmental \n     protection.''\n\n  In essence, we are saying to those with whom we enter into a trade \nagreement that in regard to commitments they make that affect labor \nstandards or environmental protection in their country, we will not \nhave the capacity to enforce those promises they have made. That was \nthe concern I had about the pending bill that motivated my amendment.\n\n  The Senator from Texas has a very different response. He is worried \nthat foreign nations may retaliate against us for our failure to keep \nour promises regarding labor standards and environmental protection. \nThat thought never struck me. I must admit, it never struck me because \nour standards are higher, generally speaking, than most of the nations \nwith which we negotiate, so I could not conceive they would want to \nretaliate against us.\n  Also, remember the obligations that are imposed on a party to a trade \nagreement are set in that agreement. They are agreed to by the parties. \nWe would not be held to fulfill any commitments regarding labor and the \nenvironment that we and they did not make in the agreement. The same is \ntrue of our foreign negotiating partners and of us.\n  I want to respond to, I guess, what we used to call in law school, \nsince my friend from Texas mentioned my law school, a ``slippery \nslope'' argument. If the United States commits to enforce the \nEndangered Species Act or a labor standard is applied to a particular \nlaw school that happens to be in New Haven, which I went to, the United \nStates would be bound by those commitments. Those would be pledges we \nwould have made.\n  If the United States agrees to enforce every labor and environmental \nstatute we have on our books and makes that agreement in a trade \nagreement--I cannot imagine we would make such an agreement, but if we \ndid--we would be bound by that commitment.\n  The rights we give to others must be found in the agreement we \nratify. No foreign country will have free-range opportunity to \nchallenge any action or inaction we take with regard to labor or \nenvironmental protections.\n  For instance, the trade negotiation objective for foreign \ninvestment--I use this as an example; it is one of the other 13 \nprincipal trade negotiation objectives in the bill--calls for \nnegotiation of agreements that reduce or eliminate exceptions to the \nprinciple of national treatment, freeing the transfer of funds relating \nto investments, et cetera.\n  If we reach an agreement where we and our trading partners commit to \n``reduce or eliminate exceptions to the principle of national \ntreatment'' that is in the bill, that is the commitment that each party \nhas the right to seek to enforce. That is in the agreement.\n  Countries, again, have no free-wheeling right to challenge any U.S. \naction or inaction concerning foreign investments; certainly no right \nto rewrite our laws. We can only be held to what we have promised to do \nin the agreement, just as the foreign country can only be held to that.\n  Foreign countries' rights are set and limited by the terms of the \nagreement we negotiate. Our own standards, again, with regard to labor \nand environmental protection, are almost always higher than the foreign \nnations with which we are negotiating. The agreements focus on trying \nto slightly raise the standards of less developed countries. That is \nwhat we are all about and about which some have been concerned.\n  Second, this trade objective focused on labor and environment is \nunique in another regard in this bill. My amendment takes out the part \nthat prohibits retaliation for any reason. It does not eliminate any of \nthe rest of section (B) of this part--I believe it is trade negotiating \nobjective No. 11.\n  What does the rest of it do? It does something unique in this bill. \nThe 11th principal negotiating objective is already qualified in ways \nnot applicable to any other trade negotiating objectives. That makes it \neven more important that we retain the power to enforce these \ncommitments, which my amendment would do with regard to trade in \nservices--these are other negotiating objectives--intellectual \nproperty, agriculture, and other subjects. Compliance of the parties is \nstrictly enforced. No excuses are permitted; no discretion is granted. \nIf there is a violation, the parties are held strictly liable.\n\n  With regard to labor and environmental commitments, the pending bill \nalready states that noncompliance can be tolerated under certain \ncircumstances. Parties are granted the right to ``exercise discretion \nwith respect to investigatory, prosecutorial, regulatory, and \ncompliance matters,'' and they are granted the right to ``make \ndecisions regarding the allocation of resources to enforcement with \nrespect to other labor and environmental matters determined to have \nhigher priorities.''\n  This discretion and these decisions must be reasonable and bona fide \naccording to the bill. It explicitly states that we ``recognize that a \ncountry is effectively enforcing its laws if a course of action or \ninaction reflects a reasonable exercise of such discretion, or results \nfrom a bona fide decision regarding the allocation of resources.''\n  We do not see language about discretion or allocation of resources \napplied to any other section in the bill--not to the services section, \nnot to the intellectual property section, not to the agricultural \nsection, not to any other section.\n  Madam President, I am, in fact, troubled by the inclusion of this \nlanguage regarding such discretion as it applies to labor and \nenvironmental protections. I worry that it is a bit open-ended, perhaps \nambiguous. But despite those misgivings, the language does come \nverbatim from the United States-Jordan trade agreement. We granted that \ndiscretion in that agreement. Therefore, that is why the language has \nbeen picked up in the bill and I do not move to strike it. The language \nto prohibit any retaliatory action does not come from the Jordan \nAgreement. It is something new and it says essentially that we are not \ngoing to hold the other party to its promises and, in that sense, \nviewing this from the perspective of the Senator from Texas, they \ncannot hold us to our promises.\n  That is not the kind of country we are. That is not the kind of \nCongress I believe we are.\n  Why include in this bill a negotiating objective that contains its \nown negation? Why include fine print that essentially says we do not \nmean what we have said, and we do not care to hold the foreign country \ninto which we have entered a trade agreement to what they have said?\n  The issue is simple: Do the commitments made in these trade \nagreements regarding labor and environment--our commitments and their \ncommitments--mean something?\n  I am pleased again to say that the U.S. is much more likely to have \nhigher standards and be committed to honoring those commitments. So I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support this amendment, which I think \nimproves the bill and still leaves a lot of discretion in the \nenforcement of these labor and environmental sections of this pending \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. First, I express appreciation to the Senator from New \nHampshire for allowing us to go forward with the unanimous consent \nagreement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that following disposition of the Lieberman \namendment No. 3419, Senator Durbin be recognized to offer his amendment \nregarding TPA; that there be 90 minutes for debate in relation the \namendment, equally divided in the usual\n\n[[Page S4367]]\n\nform, prior to a vote in relation to the amendment, with no second-\ndegree amendments in order prior to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I have the highest regard for the \nSenator from Connecticut and his adherence to provisions to protect the \nenvironment. I do not know who has worked as hard as he or as effective \nas he in working to support measures to help not only the Nation's but \nthe world's environment. However, I strongly oppose his amendment and I \nwill say why.\n  First, the provisions in the underlying bill are a dramatic \nimprovement to protect the American environment overseas as compared \nwith current law, any other fast-track bill. It is a major step \nforward. For example, it incorporates the basic provisions of the \nJordan agreement, provides no derogation, that is, neither country will \nderogate, will reduce, the environmental protection that has an effect \non trade. That is a major step forward.\n  I cannot overemphasize how important it is to have those Jordan \nstandards in the underlying trade agreement, that is, the fast-track \nagreement. It is incredible. I am, frankly, surprised to be saying at \nthis point that those provisions are already in the bill because it was \nsuch a hard battle to get them.\n  In addition, this is the first time that the environment has been \nmade a principal negotiating objective. It is the first time the \nenvironment was given priority to other matters. It is the first time \nthe multilateral environmental agreements are recognized, the so-called \nMEAs, that is, to protect the ozone, for example. That is a big first \nstep. It is also the first time efforts have been made to improve the \nability of other countries to enforce their environmental laws. So it \nis important not to just talk about this subject in the abstract but to \ncompare it with what is in the underlying bill. The underlying bill \ngoes a tremendous way to improving the environment.\n\n  This reminds me of the metaphysical question: How many angels are \nthere on the head of a pin? That debate has gone on for years. We do \nnot know how many angels there are on the head of a pin. It is a \nmetaphysical question as to the meaning of life and its existence. It \nis also unknowable.\n  To be honest, that is what this amendment is, and I will explain what \nI mean. I take a slightly different tack than my good friend from \nTexas. I think the amendment does nothing, either way, with respect to \nprotecting the environment. It is, frankly, poorly drafted. It is \nambiguous. It is hard to say what is meant by it. So I say if we \nalready have strong provisions to protect the environment, why add \nsomething that takes or does not take away a provision which is \nambiguous and redundant, an argument made either way?\n  However, the main point is, this fast-track bill is the result of \nvery intensely negotiated positions and it is in the balance. If this \namendment passes, I fear for the life of this bill in the Senate. This \nis a killer amendment, as strange as that may sound.\n  I said earlier, this is basically a metaphysical question: How many \nangels are on the head of a pin? Why would that be a killer amendment? \nI grant that is another metaphysical question. That is another very \nstrange situation we find ourselves in, but I must say that it does. \nThis is an amendment which, if it passes--first, it has no practical \neffect, has no substantive effect, but it has, unfortunately, a strong \nsort of political effect within this body.\n  I support the protection of the Senator from Connecticut of the \nenvironment, but this is one amendment which, frankly, does not further \nprotect the environment and, if passed, is going to weaken this bill.\n  In a moment I am going to move to table, but I am first going to \nrecognize my friend from Texas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Madam President, I will be very quick. The Senator from \nConnecticut asks us: What is wrong in being held to our promises? What \nis wrong in fulfilling our commitments? There is nothing wrong with it. \nBut the real question is who should make the judgment as to whether we \nhave fulfilled our commitments and holding to our promises. Should \nthose judgments be made by the Congress, the President, and our Federal \ncourts, or should it be made by international tribunals?\n  If we could divide the question so that we could impose these \njudgments on our trading partners, and in the process deny their \nsovereignty, I think that might find some favor around her. But the \nproblem is that the objectives in this bill apply to us as well. \nTherefore, this is not an environmental question. It is not a labor \nquestion. It is a sovereignty question.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I move to table the Lieberman amendment, \nand I ask for the yeas and the nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.

The Senator from Nevada has just moved to \nreconsider.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding on the Edwards \namendment there was no motion to reconsider and motion to lay on the \ntable in that regard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote on the Edwards \namendment, and I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIllinois, Mr. Durbin, is recognized to offer his amendment.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will withhold, I say to the chairman and the \nranking member, Senator Gregg has agreed to offer his amendment upon \nthe completion of the vote on the Durbin amendment. He would lay down \nthat amendment tonight. There would be debate as long as anyone wanted \nto speak tonight. And in the morning there would be an hour and a half \nprior to a vote on that amendment.\n\n[[Page S4368]]\n\n  We will have something written up so that the minority can review it \nso that we can see if there are any problems with it.

Mr. President, I say to the Senator, if that is a \nunanimous consent request, I don't think we need to have anything \nwritten up--with no second degrees.\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, is there a unanimous consent request \nbefore the Senate?\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will withhold, I ask that the unanimous \nconsent agreement then be effectuated with the Senator's addition that \nthere would be no second-degree amendments in order.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator restate the unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, upon \ndisposition of the Durbin amendment, Senator Gregg be recognized to \noffer an amendment which will strike the wage insurance portion of the \nunderlying substitute amendment; that the amendment be debated tonight; \non tomorrow, when the Senate resumes consideration of the bill at 10 \na.m., there be 90 minutes remaining for debate in relation to the Gregg \namendment, with the time on Thursday equally divided and controlled in \nthe usual form, with no second-degree amendment in order, nor to any \nlanguage which may be stricken.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3422 To Amendment No. 3401\n\n(Purpose: To provide alternative fast-track trade negotiating authority \n               to the President, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Mr. \n     Dorgan, and Mr. Wellstone, proposes an amendment numbered \n     3422 to amendment No. 3401.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding we have an hour and \na half to debate the amendment equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to, during this opening period of time, try \nto lay out for my colleagues in the Senate the reason why I am offering \nthis amendment.\n  Let me, first, give accolades to the Senators from Montana and Iowa, \nMr. Baucus and Mr. Grassley, for their hard work on this underlying \nlegislation. This is not an easy issue. It is an issue that is \nextremely complicated. It is one I know they have devoted their efforts \nto in a very good-faith way for a long period of time.\n  I disagree with one of the fundamental principles of their bill, and \nthat is why I am offering the amendment. I hope during the course of \nthis debate to engage my colleagues in a discussion about their vision \nof trade and the difference between the Baucus-Grassley bill and the \nDurbin amendment.\n  There are some Senators who will come to the floor to discuss the \ntrade issue but have never voted for a trade agreement in their entire \ncongressional careers. That is their right. They are representing \npeople in States and parts of the country that obviously concur with \nthat point of view. But that is not my position.\n  In my time that I have served in the House and Senate, I have voted \nfor trade agreements--some of the most important, some of the biggest. \nI believe they have been in the best interest of the United States, \nthough, clearly, they have brought both gain and pain to parts of the \nAmerican economy.\n  I have voted for NAFTA. As a Democrat in the House of Representatives \nvoting for NAFTA, I heard a lot about that vote. I think it was the \nright vote. I think history will prove it. But I do not dispute for a \nmoment that the agreement with Canada and Mexico has caused pain within \nour economy. Yet I think it reflects the end of the 20th century and \nthe beginning of the 21st century where, more and more, countries are \nengaged in trade in an effort to not only share their comparative \nadvantage in making a product but also to share certain values.\n  When we look at the course of history, we in the United States \nbelieve that if you can combine democracy with an open market economy, \nyou can strive for a winning combination.\n  Expanding trade goes hand in glove with disseminating and \ndistributing the values of America. That is why I have supported many \nof these trade agreements. Yet I have had difficulty with the concept \nbefore us today.\n  This was once known as fast track. Now it is known as trade promotion \nauthority. In my time on Capitol Hill, I have learned this: When you \nhave to change the name of a program consistently, it is because the \nprogram is not very popular. If there is a program that is popular, \nsuch as Pell grants for college students, nobody has suggested changing \nthe name. But in this case, fast-track authority was such a pejorative \nterm that now in Congress its proponents have been banned from using \nit. Instead, they are supposed to talk about trade promotion authority. \nThat tells me that the underlying concept is fraught with controversy. \nIt should be.\n  At issue in this debate--I will go to the specifics in a moment--is a \nmost fundamental question for the Senate to consider. What is at issue \nis the power of the Senate and Congress under the Constitution and the \nprotection of the rights and future of American businesses and labor. \nWhat we are being asked to do with this bill is to extend to a \nPresident, not just this President but future Presidents, a very \nsignificant authority. It is not only the authority to negotiate broad-\nranging trade agreements. It is the authority to bring back those \nagreements, propose significant changes to U.S. law, and require \nCongress to approve those changes on an up-or-down vote.\n  This bill, the trade promotion authority, is going to tie the hands \nof Congress when it comes to considering trade agreements in the future \nwith consequences that I believe could be substantial and even \nhistoric.\n  This bill represents the most significant giveaway of congressional \nauthority to the President in modern memory. Presidents throughout \nhistory have resisted congressional intrusion in their realm of \ngovernment, in areas as fundamental as the declaration of war, treaty \nagreements with foreign nations, and the power to advise and consent. \nThe tension between the executive branch, the President, and the \nlegislative branch, Congress, has historically resulted in a \nconfrontation at these desks.\n  I am in the process of slowly reading an amazing book called ``The \nMaster of the Senate'' by Robert Caro. It is his third volume in the \nbiography of Lyndon Johnson, former President, Vice President, majority \nleader of the Senate, and Member of the House. I am reading it slowly \nbecause I appreciate it so much.\n  In the first 100 pages, Robert Caro, with painstaking precision, goes \nthrough the history of this body. He starts by referring to a moment \nwhen he sat in one of our galleries and looked down at the semicircles \nof desks and reflected on what was going on in this Chamber, not just \non that day but in the history of the United States, since we have been \nin the new Chamber of the Senate.\n  The thing he noted was the role of the Senate, the preeminent role of \nthe Senate in decisionmaking in America. If you take a look at our \nConstitution closely, Presidents come and go. The House of \nRepresentatives changes every 2 years. But in the Senate only a third \nof the membership stands for reelection every 2 years. The Senate is a \ncontinuing body under the Constitution with rules that are not \nabandoned, ratified again, but rules that continue time and time again.\n  Because of the continuous nature of the Senate and its role in \nCongress, it has played a most important role in terms of power in the \nUnited States. The Senate more than any other institution is a check on \nthe power of the President. The Senate is where the President's power \nmay stop, when a decision is made by a majority here that he has gone \ntoo far.\n\n[[Page S4369]]\n\n  Presidents don't like that. There isn't a President who has ever \nserved who wanted to go hat in hand to the Senate. In the same book, \nCaro talks about Teddy Roosevelt who, when he was elected President--\nfirst appointed, then elected President--came to a position where he \nwas pushing through patronage positions without clearing it with the \nSenate. They came down on him like a ton of bricks. He came up to the \nSenate, this bully leader of the United States, and was humbled by the \nSenate and its leadership and worked with them very closely from that \npoint forward.\n  Historically, the Senate has played that key role with trade \npromotion authority. We are saying this generation of Senators, this \nU.S. Congress is going to give power back to the President--our power, \nour authority, our responsibility. We are saying that when this \nPresident negotiates a trade agreement, we will not stand in judgment \nof that trade agreement in its specifics but only an up-or-down, yes-\nor-no vote.\n  That, to me, is a significant constitutional and historic decision. \nIt is the reason that though I have voted in the past repeatedly for \nglobalization and expanding trade and looking for new markets, I have \nresisted fast track and trade promotion authority because I cannot \nbelieve that a Senate in good conscience would walk away from its \nconstitutional authority.\n  The President makes the argument: Of course, you know these trade \nagreements are very complicated, and if you expect me to have to answer \nto the American people through the Senate for each and every provision, \nI will never reach a trade agreement.\n  Excuse me, if you look at the history of the United States, many \ntreaties which we have considered and were pretty complicated--I think \nof Woodrow Wilson and the League of Nations; I think about the treaties \nrelating to proliferation of nuclear weapons--were very complicated, \nbut they came to the floor of the Senate. Historically, trade \nagreements came to the floor of the Senate, and we walked through them.\n  Why do we want to do that? I represent a diverse State, strong in \nfarming, manufacturing, and financial services. Certainly, when a trade \nagreement comes to the floor of the Senate, as a Senator from Illinois, \nI want to step back and look at these areas of the economy and how that \nPresident's idea of a good trade agreement actually has an impact on \nthe jobs and the businesses of my State. I think that is part of my \nresponsibility. Yet the trade promotion authority bill before us says \nthe Senate is going to give away this authority.\n  We are being asked to surrender the authority of the Congress to \nratify trade agreements. This has been a dream of every President in \nour history and, of course, this President could negotiate a trade \nagreement with broad and far-reaching implications for farmers, \nworkers, and businesses across the Nation without fear of scrutiny or \nclose review by Congress.\n  Instead, our role would be limited, our constitutional authority \nconstrained to an up-or-down vote, a take-it-or-leave-it vote. Why? As \nthe President said, they do not want Congress to meddle; they do not \nwant Congress to interfere; they do not want Congress to delay. I \nbelieve that is wrong.\n  Let me tell my colleagues specifically why I think we should consider \nthis approach I am suggesting as an amendment to the underlying bill.\n  The Baucus-Grassley bill does not clearly delineate the authority \nthey are asking the Senate to give to the President and to future \nPresidents. Further, this legislation sidesteps many of today's key \nchallenges in such a way that will diminish America's chances to \nnegotiate solid trade agreements with other nations which would benefit \nour workers, farmers, and businesses.\n  The process of economic integration across borders, often referred to \nas globalization, is the defining economic event of our era. \nGlobalization has had and continues to have fundamental transformative \neconomic, political, and social consequence, and it is undergoing a \nrevolution as profound as interstate commerce in the United States a \ncentury ago.\n\n  There has been a dramatic increase in the volume and value of trade. \nThe number of countries participating in the international trade arena \nhas mushroomed from 23 in 1947 to 111 10 years ago, to very likely 170 \nor more before this decade is completed.\n  Trade expansion now involves China, Vietnam, Russia, and many \ncountries with different traditions and different economic structures \nthan the United States. Major developing countries such as Brazil, \nKorea, India, Singapore, even South Africa, no longer compete in trade \nprimarily in raw materials, agricultural products, or light \nmanufactured goods. They also compete in steel, automobiles, \nelectronics, and services such as telecommunications and software.\n  Trade is not only far different in its quantity but also in its \nquality. We have progressed beyond the relatively uncomplicated world \nof tariffs reflecting the success of the GATT in the first 50 years in \naddressing most international trade barriers.\n  We have now even moved beyond the challenges of many basic nontariff \nbarriers and have entered an era in which trade policy includes a full \nrange of policy laws and regulations that used to be considered \nexclusively or primarily domestic policy, including domestic \nagricultural programs, antitrust law, food safety, telecommunications, \nnatural resources, conservation, labor standards, insurance regulation, \nand the intersection of effective protection of intellectual properties \nwith health policy. Trade policy directly impacts domestic policy, and \ndomestic policy impacts trade policy in ways that have far-reaching \nimplications on our negotiating trade agreements and the legislation of \ndomestic policy.\n  It is precisely at this great time of great change and great \nchallenge that it is most important for U.S. trade policy to reflect a \nreal understanding of the substantive issues involved and be driven by \nsound guiding principles. Unfortunately, the bill before us does not \nrise to this challenge.\n  Let me show one chart which demonstrates what is happening in the \narea of trade negotiations just over the past 30 or so years.\n  In the Tokyo Round in 1979, we were focused on tariff levels and four \nor five other concerns, such as antidumping and government procurement.\n  In the Uruguay Round, just 15 years later, one can see we went beyond \nthe tariff levels and those issues that were part of the Tokyo Round \nand started including specific items such as textiles and clothing, \nnatural resource products, services, dispute settlement, intellectual \nproperty, trade-related investment measures, trade in agriculture, \nhealth and safety measures. This was 1994.\n  In 2001, in the WTO negotiations, one can see we have included all \nthe things before from the Uruguay Round and added to that antitrust \nlaw, investment issues, pharmaceutical pricing, trade facilitation, \nelectronic commerce, and many other issues.\n  The point I am trying to make is if one reads the history of the \nUnited States and the issue of trade, for over 150 years this Nation \nfocused almost exclusively on tariffs--that is the tax that we will \nimpose on imports coming into the United States--and some very heated \nand pitched battles resulted.\n  By 1979, we had gone beyond tariffs and four or five other issues. By \n1994, we added many more issues. By 2001, all of a sudden a trade \nagreement becomes much more than questions about tariffs and taxes. We \nstart talking about policy considerations as varied as pharmaceuticals \nto agriculture--across the board.\n\n  Giving the President the fast-track authority, trade promotion \nauthority is saying to him: We are prepared to let you come to your \nbest judgment with any country in the world when it comes to trade on \nall of these issues, and before you take your last stop in Congress and \ngive us an up-or-down vote, we expect this is going to be ratified.\n  Congress is walking away from all of these issues and subjects of \nconcern. I can tell my colleagues that as I get into this, they will \nrealize we have not lost any of our fervor or interest in any of these \nissues. In fact, Members who come to the floor today will say: What \nabout textiles? What about intellectual property? What about electronic \ncommerce?\n  The fact is, if trade promotion authority passes as suggested by the \nBaucus-Grassley bill, we will have given\n\n[[Page S4370]]\n\naway our constitutional right to be part of this debate. The best you \nget, Mr. Senator, is an up-or-down, take-it-or-leave-it vote. I believe \nthis is moving us in the wrong direction.\n  Let me address two issues included in my amendment. The first is \nlabor. The one thing I have noticed is this: Without fail, those who \nvote for it and those who even oppose it say the same thing about \nlabor. Listen, I understand it may be cheaper to hire somebody in the \nThird World, in a developing country, to make a product, but shouldn't \nwe as the United States, as part of a trade agreement, be encouraging \nsome basic issues when it comes to labor overseas? Shouldn't we ask \nthat both countries in a trade agreement have some basic dignity in \ntheir treatment of labor?\n  People say, sure, I understand that, and you get down to specifics. \nLet me show a chart.\n  Is there much doubt in the minds of all the Senators about what \nAmerica thinks of child labor? If we knew we were entering into a trade \nagreement that would in any way promote the exploitation of children \noverseas, the hue and cry against it in the Senate would be \noverwhelming.\n  This is a photo illustration. It may not be too visible to my \ncolleagues, but it shows the use of child labor from 1908 all the way \nto 1992, a street vendor, a tiny little girl in Mexico City. It shows a \nbrick worker, a young man in 1993 in Katmandu in Nepal. It is an \nillustration that when Americans see this, when Senators see it, they \nwant to make certain, if we are going to enter into a trade agreement, \nit will not result in the exploitation of children overseas.\n  We do not want to promote forced labor, slave labor, prison labor. We \nwant to stand for the right of workers around the world to associate \ntogether and bargain collectively. These are core values of America, \nand they are core labor standards. Sadly, the Baucus-Grassley bill does \nnot provide adequate protection for these principles.\n  It does not require countries to implement core labor standards. The \nonly enforceable commitment in this bill is the commitment that \ncountries enforce their existing labor laws. The Baucus-Grassley bill \ndoes not require countries with inadequate labor laws to improve their \nstandards to include core, internationally recognized labor rights.\n  Let me be more specific, if I may, on this issue. We are considering \nthis Free Trade Area of the Americas agreement, and in this free trade \nagreement is a question of whether or not we will try to expand trade \nwith countries in our hemisphere. Certainly that, in and of itself, is \na positive thing to do. But when one looks at the labor standards in \nsome of the countries, they can understand why many of us are concerned \nthat the Baucus-Grassley bill does not have adequate protections.\n  Bolivia--part of the negotiations--has been criticized by the \nInternational Labor Organization for provisions in its labor law that \npermit apprenticeships for children who are 12 years old, which is \nconsidered by some as tantamount to not only child labor but to \nbondage. The International Labor Organization Committee of Experts also \nreports that abuses and lack of payment of wages constitute forced \nlabor in the agricultural sector of Bolivia.\n  Does the United States want to be party to an agreement with Bolivia, \na trade agreement that would perpetuate this kind of exploitation? I do \nnot think so. I think instead the United States wants to stand up for \nbasic labor principles.\n  This Baucus-Grassley bill would allow Panama to deny worker \nprotections in export processing zones. In fact, in the so-called \nexport processing zones, they would suspend basic collective bargaining \nand impose mandatory arbitration.\n  The list goes on. It is a list which tells us that this should not be \na naive endeavor in the belief that every country in the world shares \nour values. They do not, nor will they. But is it not important that as \npart of our trade agreements with labor standards we establish some \nbasic standards on which we agree?\n  We have done this now. President Clinton, in his administration, in \nthe Jordan free trade agreement, based it on the premise that the \nparties to the agreement reflect core, internationally recognized labor \nrights in their domestic labor law. I quote the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, Senator Baucus, when we had the Jordan free trade agreement \nbefore us. Senator Baucus said:\n\n       Both Jordan and the United States, both countries, have \n     strong labor and environmental laws. Recognizing this, both \n     countries agree to effectively enforce their own laws.\n\n  Senator Baucus recognized then and there the point I am making with \nthis amendment. The key is not to say we are going to have strong labor \nstandards and respect for working people in America and we will enter \ninto a trade agreement with your country which may ignore them but, \nrather, to say we should agree to some basic, core labor standards. \nOtherwise, what will happen? You know what will happen. We will lose \njobs in the United States. We will lose them to companies that shift \ntheir production overseas, that put the production out of the hands of \nAmerican workers who are making a decent wage and into the hands of \nchildren and people who are being paid little or nothing, people in \nother countries that, frankly, do not have the most basic labor law \nprotection.\n\n  Is that what the United States is about? Is that what we want to \nachieve with trade agreements? Is it so important that we can buy \nsomething on sale in a store on Sunday that we can ignore the fact that \na month before it was made with the hands of children in bondage in \nsome small country on the other side of the world? I hope not.\n  Unfortunately, the Baucus-Grassley bill, without the protection of \nthis amendment, will leave the door wide open for little or nothing \nwhen it comes to labor standards.\n  This amendment calls for the FTAA countries to implement and enforce \nfive core International Labor Organization standards in domestic law. \nThis objective only applies to the FTAA and other free trade \nagreements, not to the WTO, and it recognizes that least developed and \ndeveloping countries should not be penalized because they face serious \nresource constraints in raising labor standards. My amendment calls for \nthe inclusion of a work program in FTAA to assist lesser developed \ncountries in implementing core labor standards using market access \nincentives and technical assistance.\n  I also add that contrary to critiques being circulated by trade \nassociations, the amendment does not require countries to sign \nInternational Labor Organization conventions.\n  The most common questions I hear about trade agreements are: Are you \ngoing to exploit labor overseas and therefore kill American jobs? And I \nhave addressed that. The second question is: Well, what are you going \nto do about the environment? Are you going to ignore the fact that some \ncompanies, because they do not like the restrictions of American law on \nthe environment, will ship their production overseas and pollute the \nrivers, contaminate the air, and leave toxic waste behind? What are we \ngoing to do about the environmental side of the equation? I have never \nheard a Senator on either side of the aisle for or against trade \nagreements who has not said the following: Well, we should hold them to \nenvironmental standards. We do not want to say it is unreasonable, but \ncertainly they ought to be held to environmental standards.\n  As to the environment, this bill, the Baucus-Grassley bill, does \nnothing to address the intersection between trade rules and \nenvironmental standards.\n  As to investment, the Baucus-Grassley bill could be read to broaden \nthe ability of investors to challenge U.S. environmental, health, \nsafety, and other regulations. In contrast, my amendment includes \nimportant clarifications to investment standards to ensure that \ninvestment rules cannot be used to undermine legitimate U.S. laws while \nensuring effective protection for U.S. investors overseas.\n  Let me try to be specific about that, if I may. Imagine that we had \nentered into an agreement with a foreign country with one of their \ncompanies and that foreign company wanted to locate in the United \nStates, and that country then came in and said: Before we locate in the \nUnited States, we want to take a look at your laws and see if they are \ndiscriminatory.\n  Let's use an example. They take a look at a wetland regulation. What \nis a wetland regulation? Well, it is a protection of the environment \nfor certain\n\n[[Page S4371]]\n\nfragile land that is important for us to maintain drinkable water, safe \nwater, habitat for animals. American businesses customarily are \nbound by wetland regulations. So the company from overseas, because the \ntrade agreement says, wait a minute, we do not have to play by your \nwetland regulation rules because of the trade agreement, we consider \nthat to be unfair, uncompetitive, and a taking from our company. So \nwhat we have done with the Baucus-Grassley bill is to open up a \nchallenge from a foreign corporation that wants to come into the United \nStates against our environmental standards. That, to me, is not \nconsistent with what most of us want to see achieved in our trade \nagreements.\n\n  Let me give a couple of other illustrations. There is the area of \nmultilateral environmental agreements. The Baucus-Grassley bill does \nnothing to clarify the relationship between World Trade Organization \nrules and multilateral environmental agreements. In contrast, my \namendment calls for creating an explicit rule ensuring that a country \ncan enforce a multilateral environmental agreement without violating \nWTO obligations.\n  What would that mean? Let me give an example. We enter into an \ninternational agreement about endangered species around the world. All \nof the countries sign on and say, we are going to protect these \nspecies, and if one of the countries overseas violates it, they are \nsubject to penalty provisions. Whether we are talking about protecting \nan endangered animal or whether we are talking about eliminating the \ntrade in skins or ivory tusks, countries around the world enter into \nthese multilateral environmental agreements. Our fear is that the \nBaucus-Grassley bill will allow a trade agreement between two countries \nto supersede this multilateral environmental agreement. It is playing \nto the lowest common denominator when we allow trade agreements to \nsupersede these kinds of multilateral agreements.\n  On enforcement of environmental standards, the Baucus-Grassley bill \nretains the midnight change added to the bill in the House of \nRepresentatives. That change guts the already weakened environmental \nprovisions in the bill by making clear that a country can lower its \nenvironmental standards for any reason with impunity. I want to make \nclear what that is all about because that is an important issue. It is \none that was raised by the Senator from Texas, and it is one that I \nwould like to address.\n  We have a situation in the United States where we have established \nstandards, and what if we had a provision where, in order to entice a \ncertain company to locate its factory in the United States that our \npartner overseas would ask for a change in standards when it comes to \nenvironmental safety. The language which was added in the House states \nthat no enforcement actions can be brought against a country for \nlowering environmental standards for any reason, including to begin a \ncompetitive advantage--again, playing to the lowest common denominator. \nThe Baucus-Grassley bill retains this change from the House.\n\n  Finally, in the area of regulatory authority, the Baucus-Grassley \nbill includes antiregulatory, anticonsumer provisions. These include \nrequirements for a cost-benefit analysis for proposed regulations and a \nvery reactionary approach toward food and labels.\n  I have been through the cost-benefit analysis. Some who are opponents \nof consumer safety and environmental safety say, if you cannot prove to \nme there are dollars to be saved, we certainly should not allow the \nregulation to be in place. Many times the things that protect us the \nmost in this country are hard to quantify in dollar terms. We know they \nare of value to us. Frankly, putting a dollar amount on it, so-called \ncost-benefit ratio, becomes difficult. That is the standard of this \nbill.\n  Do you think as an American consumer it should be wrong or against \nthe law that the food we import from overseas is labeled as to the \ncountry of origin? I don't think that is unreasonable. The Baucus-\nGrassley bill characterizes food labeling as ``unjustified trade \nrestrictions.'' Is it your right as a consumer to know when you buy \ncanned goods that they are from overseas? Do you have a right to know \nthat? I think you do. Then you can make your decision. Maybe you still \nwant to buy that product from overseas. But should you have the right \nto make that decision? The Baucus-Grassley bill says no, it is an \nunfair trade restriction. That is what we face with the Baucus-Grassley \namendment.\n  Aside from the failure of this bill to adequately address the issues \nof labeling and environment, this legislation is dangerously flawed \nbecause it fails to ensure the vital role the Congress and the American \npeople need to play at a time when trade is affecting so many \nbusinesses and so many jobs. I have listened to Senators on this floor, \nMr. Lott, a Republican, minority leader, complain about Vietnamese \ncatfish farmers. He said their competitive advantage was ``due to cheap \nlabor and very loose environmental regulations.'' Senator Lott, my \namendment addresses that. I hope you and others who feel the same will \nconsider supporting it.\n  I reflect for a moment on what has happened when it comes to steel, \nrecalling I voted for these trade agreements. I cannot state how \ndisappointed I am in the way we have dealt with challenges to the steel \nindustry in America. I believe in trade, but I think it should be \naccording to the rules. Countries around the world violated the rules; \nthey dumped their product on the United States.\n  What does it mean to dump a product? It means you sell your product \nin the United States at a price lower than the cost to produce it in \nyour own country or lower than the amount that you sell it in your own \ncountry. You are clearly trying to run competitors out of the market. \nYou are dumping. You are violating the rules. It happened in the United \nStates and we lost over 25 of our best steel mills and tens of \nthousands of steelworker jobs.\n  The President responded with an imposition of tariffs with some \nexceptions and made a move in the right direction. Critics came forward \nand said that was a very wrong thing for the President to do--too \npolitical. Excuse me, but if we are going to trade with other countries \naround the world, don't we owe it to our businesses and our workers to \nenforce laws? Don't we need to have a Congress and a President who will \nstand up for American businesses and workers? That is not political; \nthat is what the debate is all about.\n\n  The people who believe you can just expand trade without taking \nconcern of its consequences, frankly, believe that the expansion of \ntrade in and of itself is something that is ultimately going to be good \nno matter the consequences. I don't believe that. We have a \nresponsibility. We as a Congress have to maintain this responsibility, \nto make sure that we have a process for the disapproval of certain \ntrade agreements, to make certain that we have a voice when it comes to \nenforcing labor and environmental standards.\n  Before closing, I acknowledge in particular two House Members, \nCongressman Charlie Rangel, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and \nMeans Committee, and Congressman Sander Levin of Michigan. They have \nbeen invaluable in working with me to bring this amendment to the \nfloor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Hatch and Mr. Leahy pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 2520 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield some time to myself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana controls the time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Utah.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \namendment offered by my friend from Illinois, Mr. Durbin.\n  Before I discuss the specifies of the Durbin amendment, I feel \ncompelled to comment upon some of the dynamics of the trade bill.\n  First, we reported the trade promotion authority bill out of the \nFinance Committee by a broad bipartisan 18-to-3 vote. There is strong \nbipartisan support for trade. I was the one, I believe, who called for \nthe vote.\n\n[[Page S4372]]\n\n  I believe this vote was in accordance with the tradition of the \nFinance Committee in doing what is right for the American people. I am \nafraid that from the moment this bill hit the floor this emerging \nspirit of bipartisan consensus on trade has been jeopardized. \nThroughout, the committees, work this Congress, I stated my view that \nboth trade promotion authority and trade adjustment assistance \nlegislation must be passed or neither would be adopted. I still believe \nthat is the case.\n  Frankly, the compromise that was reached on TAA last week was at the \nvery limit of what many of us on our side of the aisle could stomach. I \nhave many reservations about the health care policies embraced by the \ncompromise and the overall cost of the program.\n  I think it is going to louse up the health care system of this \ncountry, and it is unfair to those workers who do not have health care, \nwho have to pay for those who do not work so they can have health care. \nThat is just one comment about it.\n  As everybody knows, I worked very hard in the area of health care, \nand I really think we have made some big mistakes on some of the \nprovisions we are going to accept in this bill.\n  As I understand it, the final deal on TAA was at a cost that is very \nclose to what Republican members of the Finance Committee opposed last \nfall.\n  And then yesterday, the Senate accepted the Dayton-Craig amendment, \nwhich stands in violation to the very principle of TPA--a simple up or \ndown vote on each trade agreement that USTR negotiates.\n  The Dayton-Craig amendment, if signed into law, will establish a new \nset of rules with respect to agreements that purport to impinge upon \nU.S. trade remedy laws. Talk about opening a Pandora's box, that us \nwhat Dayton-Craig does.\n  If you don't like the way a particular trade agreement affects the \ntrade remedy laws, vote it down. USTR will quickly get the message. TPA \nis known is fast track for a good reason; let's not adopt amendments \nthat act to slow down TPA.\n  I have no doubt that President Bush, Secretary Evans, and Ambassador \nZoellick will not undermine our trade protection laws.\n  We saw that the administration did with steel and is doing on \nsoftwood lumber. I have had something to do with that. I stood up on \nthe steel matter, lining up with my colleagues on the other side, \nespecially Senator Rockfeller. This administration took a pretty tough \nposition and has been criticized, especially in Europe, for having done \nso. There is good reason to have confidence in the administration and \nevery reason to fear that enactment of Dayton-Craig would encourage \nsome of our trading partners to attempt to wall off areas of the law \nthat will be deemed near and dear to them.\n  I hope that other nations will not try to relax their intellectual \nproperty laws or enforcement of these laws or enforcement of these laws \nas high technology represents an important area for U.S. interests and \nfor the world at large. We are talking about software, information \ntechnology, entertainment, and biotechnology, all of which the whole \nworld depends on. And we better protect it--in the sense of protecting \nthe rights under these intellectual property laws.\n  So I understand that we accepted Dayton-Craig, I am becoming fearful \nthat the accumulated weight of the additions of the trade bill from the \ntime it left the Finance Committee will bring down support for the \nbill.\n  It is true that we passed a farm bill, but the loaded up version that \nwe passed should not make us very happy. Let us not repeat \nthat experience by passing a trade bill that tries to do too much for \ntoo many interests that are extrinsic to trade that, at the end of the \nday, it does not deserve our support.\n\n  Comes now the Durbin amendment.\n  I know Senator Durbin. He is a good man and has nothing but the best \nof intentions. I personally appreciate his help in funding the generic \ndrug interests lost year. He did a good job.\n  But, if enacted, the substitute would make it difficult or impossible \nto bring home the best trade deals for the United States. The \nsubstitute is so prescriptive it removes needed flexibility. It \ncontains 70 pages of ``principal negotiating objectives.'' The effect \nof all this detail is to bind the administration's hands at the \nnegotiating table and to telegraph a long list of U.S. ``bottom-lines'' \nto our negotiating partners--who will make us pay a heavy price.\n  The substitute changes negotiating ``objectives'' into mandates. It \ngives 18 ``congressional advisers'' the right to withdraw TPA after an \nagreement is negotiated unless a majority considers that the trade \nagreement ``substantially achieves'' the substitute's principal \nnegotiating objectives. That effectively makes the 70 pages of detailed \nnegotiating objectives into requirements, setting an unrealistic and \nunobtainable standard for negotiations.\n  The substitute adopts inconsistent approaches to negotiating \nobjectives. For example, while the substitute says the United States \nshould try to amend or clarify the GATT conservation exception, it says \nthe United States should oppose opening the SPS Agreement, which is \nderived from the same set of GATT exceptions.\n  The substitute will make it harder for the President to strike the \nbest possible deals with our trading partners because it raises \nquestions about whether the President will be negotiating on behalf of \nthe United States as a whole.\n  The substitute creates a biennial fast-track procedure for Congress \nto withdraw TPA for any reason after a negotiation has begun. That \nprocedure--and the one allowing the congressional advisers to withdraw \nTPA if the administration has not ``substantially achieved'' the \nsubstitute's negotiating objectives--will lead our trading partners to \nquestion whether Congress and the President are united at the \nnegotiating table. How could you make it tougher on the President and \nthe U.S. Trade Representative?\n\n  Instilling confidence is a major reason for enacting TPA. It means \nthe President can push other governments to their ``bottom lines.'' The \nsubstitute bill would remove that confidence.\n  The substitute is not drafted with an eye to what the United States \ncan realistically achieve, or should try to secure, in trade \nnegotiations. For example, the substitute says the administration \nshould ``establish promptly a working group [in the WTO] on trade and \nlabor issues.''\n  This is something that the overwhelming majority of WTO members \nadamantly oppose. There is no realistic hope of achieving it anytime \nsoon.\n  In sum, the proposed substitute is based on the flawed assumption \nthat Congress can pre-negotiate our future trade agreements through \nhighly detailed negotiating objectives, regardless of whether they are \nachievable, and the implied threat to withdraw TPA if those objectives \nare not met. That is a recipe for no agreements, rather than better \nagreements. To achieve the best results, the two branches need to work \ntogether.\n  I have to say that I have been a supporter of the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative since I have been in the Senate. I supported President \nClinton's U.S. Trade Representative. I was one of the people who \ncleared the way for some of the things she did--and others as well.\n  But the fact is, I think we need to support this Trade \nRepresentative, someone as bright as anybody we have ever had in that \nposition, and someone who understands the need to satisfy 535 Members \nof Congress.\n  The Finance Committee got it right. The House got it right. I oppose \nthe Durbin amendment and will oppose other efforts to load up this \ntrade bill with so much unnecessary, although sometimes well-\nintentioned, baggage that the bill will fall of its own weight.\n  That is the net effect of many of these amendments. The American \nlabor force would have been better off if we had entered conference \nwith the bill passed by the Finance Committee, rather than this ever \ngrowing extravaganza.\n  This is important stuff. The Finance Committee is a great committee. \nOur two leaders on the committee have done a great job. I compliment \nSenator Baucus and Senator Grassley for the work they have done. They \ndeserve our support. We ought to support them.\n  We should not be undermining what they and 18 members of the \ncommittee did. It was a bipartisan bill if there ever was a bipartisan \nbill. All of us knew that we have to get together in\n\n[[Page S4373]]\n\norder to do the constructive trade work that benefits our country.\n  This amendment, unfortunately, undermines almost everything that we \ndid in the committee and that the House has done. It is tough to get \nthis kind of broad consensus in the Finance Committee on something that \nis very complex anyway, but we did. And I think that ought to be given \ngreater consideration than we have thus far given it.\n  I want to support my chairman. He has stood tall on this issue. And I \nlook forward to working with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield myself about 10 minutes.\n  I obviously have the highest regard for my colleague from Illinois. \nHe is advocating a point of view that is extremely important; namely, \nthe protection of American employees, the environment, basic principles \nthat are fundamental to the human condition, working hard. I highly \napplaud him for what he is doing.\n  I would like to comment a bit on some of the points that the Senator \nand that others who are in support of his amendment have made, just to \nclear the air a little bit so we know what is in the underlying bill \nand what isn't.\n  The Senator said--and we all agree--that we want to uphold the \ndignity of law, particularly the dignity of labor, and do all we can to \ndiscourage the exploitation of children around the world, or other \nemployees who are in adverse conditions. We all know that.\n  I might say that one of the core objectives in the underlying bill is \nto promote the ILO core standards in new trade agreements. That has not \nbeen mentioned very frequently here. I think it is something that \nshould be stated very clearly. That is, one of the negotiating \nobjectives in the underlying bill is that the United States pursue \npromotion of the International Labor Organization core standards as one \nof our negotiating objectives.\n  It is also important to know that each of the negotiating objectives \nin the underlying bill is of equal weight. We are not picking and \nchoosing here. They all have the same weight.\n  Some talk about textiles. There is a negotiating objective on trade \nin textiles. That is in a special category. There are other objectives, \nbut the bill makes clear they all have equal weight, and our trade \nnegotiators must pursue them all equally.\n  Pursuance of ILO core standards is certainly one objective stated in \nthe bill. It also has been said the bill does not push the United \nStates strongly enough toward promoting ILO core standards. But, again, \nI want to underline that the provision in the bill directing our \nnegotiators to pursue ILO core standards has the same weight as other \nnegotiating objectives. It is not less important than any other \nobjective; it is equal.\n  Now, it has been stated that the so-called investor-State dispute \nresolution provisions in the bill kind of tilt toward foreign investors \nat the expense of American investors, or that environmental provisions \nthat a State may pass, that Congress may pass, that a local government \nmay pass, are in jeopardy because of rights we may afford to foreign \ninvestors; that is, it is asserted that foreign investors will have an \neasier time in challenging a State action as a compensable taking than \na domestic investor.\n  I might say, we corrected that problem with the Baucus-Grassley-Wyden \namendment. The Baucus-Grassley-Wyden amendment makes it very clear that \nforeign investors should not be accorded a greater level of protection \nin the United States than domestic investors in the United States. That \nis, there should be a level playing field.\n  We make that very clear in the Baucus-Grassley-Wyden amendment that \nwe adopted just yesterday.\n  Now, it has also been stated: Gee, we have these multilateral \nenvironmental agreements that could be superseded by trade agreements. \nI urge all Senators to read the bill, and read it fairly closely, \nbecause it states very clearly that one of our overall objectives is \nfor trade agreements and MEAs to be mutually supportive. That is the \ngoal.\n\n  It is clear that the United States cannot dictate exactly what the \noutcome of a trade negotiation will be, but it is certainly clear that \nwe, in the underlying bill, have set as our objective making \nmultilateral environmental agreements and trade agreements consistent \nwith one another; that is, they should be mutually supporting. And many \nof those multilateral environmental agreements are good agreements.\n  The one on ozone, for example, or the CITES on trade in endangered \nspecies products are terrific agreements. It is only proper that our \ntrade agreements not undermine these environmental agreements.\n  It has also been stated here: Well, gee, under the provisions of this \nbill, it says we cannot have country-of-origin labeling. I ask Senators \nto go back and read the bill. That is not an accurate statement. It is \naccurate to say there are provisions in the bill that say that we \nshould not agree to deceptive labeling requirements or labeling \nrequirements that are not based on scientifically sound principles. \nThat is true. We should not allow labeling requirements that are not \nbased on scientifically sound principles.\n  But there are all kinds of labeling requirements that are \npermissible. I know my friend from Illinois agrees, as do others, that \nwe should not have deceptive labeling or labeling requirements that are \nnot based on sound science.\n  It has been stated here that enforcement of environmental and labor \nlaws is weak in the underlying bill. But, again, I remind my colleagues \nthat enforcement of environmental and labor laws is a priority; it is \none of the objectives that is listed in the underlying bill. It has \nequal weight with all of the other objectives.\n  We want to enforce environmental laws. We want to enforce labor laws. \nIt is also important, on this point, to remind ourselves that the \nvision of the bill with respect to labor and environment is a dramatic \nimprovement over the status quo; that is, over current law, current law \nbeing no fast track.\n  Let's remember, in previous fast-track bills, there was virtually \nnothing on the environment or on labor that made any sense. It took a \nlot of work to get these provisions in, that is, the Jordan provisions, \nwhich provide that no country should derogate from its environmental or \nlabor laws in a manner that has an adverse effect on trade with the \nUnited States. That is very important.\n  Clearly, that is a first step. We have to take steps here. The United \nStates cannot today pass, in my judgment, fast-track legislation which \nreally dictates to other countries what their environmental and labor \nstandards should be.\n  The amendment offered by my friend from Illinois unfortunately goes \nin that direction. It is an extremely prescriptive bill. It is \nunworkable. It basically is not a fast-track bill delegating \nnegotiating authority to the executive branch, which we must do if we \nare going to have trade agreements. Rather, it is writing the trade \nagreements. It is saying what all the provisions must be, which is \nclearly a very unworkable way for the United States to negotiate trade \nagreements.\n  I have deepest sympathy for the intent of my friend from Illinois. \nBut I must say, after listening to his presentation, there are \nprovisions in the bill which address some of the concerns he has--in \nfact, almost all the concerns he has. We have to take this a step at a \ntime. We cannot solve all the world's problems in one fast-track \ndelegation bill, but we can take tremendous steps forward, as this bill \ndoes.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to not adopt the amendment by the \nSenator from Illinois. It goes much too far. The provision the Senator \nis suggesting was defeated resoundingly in the other body by over 100 \nvotes. In the Ways and Means Committee, the vote was 22 to 10. So it is \nnot a consensus measure by any stretch of the imagination. It was \ndefeated quite soundly in the other body. On the other hand, the \nFinance Committee passed out the current version by a vote of 18 to 3, \nfavorably, which indicates a much stronger consensus. It would have to \ngo back to the House.\n  I urge Senators again to not support the Durbin amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n\n[[Page S4374]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve and a half minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And on the opposition side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nineteen minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I support the Durbin amendment but not \nbecause I support fast track. Trade promotion authority, which is \nbetter known as fast track, is a piece of legislation this Congress \nshould not adopt. However, if the Congress decides that there are \nsufficient votes for fast track, I certainly want the provisions \ndealing with labor and the environment offered by Senator Durbin to be \nin that final package.\n  Yesterday, at some length I described the dilemma. The dilemma is, in \ninternational competition, what is fair competition and what is the \nadmission price to the American marketplace? Do we want standards, when \nwe adopt trade agreements, that do not put American producers in a \ncircumstance of having to compete with others around the world who are \nhiring 12-year-old kids, putting them in factories working 12 hours a \nday, paying them 30 cents an hour? Yes, that happens. The question is, \nIs that fair competition for American producers? The answer is clearly \nno.\n  What do we do about that? Every single trade agreement we seem to \nadopt--and it is proposed now that we adopt them under fast track so we \ncan offer no amendments when they come back--every single trade \nagreement fails to address these underlying issues. What is fair \ncompetition? Will we really deal with the labor issues? Will we really \ntell others that you cannot hire kids and put them in plants at age 12 \nand 11 and 10 and pay them pennies and then ship their products to \nPittsburgh or Toledo or Cleveland or Fargo or Los Angeles? Will we do \nthat or will we tell companies you cannot pole-vault to Sri Lanka or \nBangladesh or China and pollute the water and air and hire kids? Is \nthat fair competition? Will we ever as a country decide that we will \nstand up for our producers and our workers to say, yes, you must \ncompete, you must be ready to compete, but we will make sure the \ncompetition is fair?\n  That is why the underlying issue is not fast but fair trade; not fast \ntrack but fair trade.\n  This debate will go on at some great length. If this Congress is to \npass fast track, it must do so with the provisions on labor and the \nenvironment offered by my colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin.\n  I do not support fast track. Our trade deficit is growing every \nsingle year. It is now at record high levels: $450 billion, over $1 \nbillion a day every single day in merchandise trade deficit.\n  That is not a debt we owe to ourselves. That is a debt that will be \nrepaid someday with a lower standard of living in this country. Why? \nBecause our trade agreements haven't been in this country's best \ninterests. They don't deal with the central issues of what is fair \ncompetition.\n  That is why my colleague, Senator Durbin, is proposing, if we have an \namendment dealing with fast track that allows no amendments to be \noffered when trade agreements come back, that at least fast track \ninclude the labor and environmental provisions he proposes. I will not \nsupport fast track, but I do believe his attempt to insert these \nprovisions in this legislation makes good sense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is my understanding I have about 9 minutes remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Exactly.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And 19 minutes on the other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. In the interest of expediting the debate, if the Senator \nfrom Montana has anyone who wants to speak in opposition, I invite him \nto use the time now. I can close using my 9 minutes and then allow him \nsimilar time to close, if that would be appropriate. If we could bring \nthis to a close, it would be in the best interest of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I did not hear the response. How much time remains on \nboth sides?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has 18 minutes 54 \nseconds; Senator Durbin has 8 minutes 42 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, just a couple points to make here. We \nhave to pass this bill. We in America must show that we are not \nisolating ourselves from the world but, rather, moving forward; we are \nengaging the world in trade agreements. We must move forward. As the \nlargest, strongest country in the world, we must not abdicate our \nleadership position in the world.\n  The underlying bill, the fast-track bill before us, which includes \ntrade adjustment assistance as well as the Andean Trade Preference Act, \nwill help the United States regain some lost position in world \nleadership certainly with respect to trade, international affairs, and \neconomic affairs, particularly. We can say no. We can say we are not \ngoing to pass this bill. One Senator said he is opposed to fast track.\n  Frankly, if we as a body say no, we as a Congress say no, we are, as \na country, like the ostrich with his head in the sand, isolating \nourselves from the rest of the world. We cannot go backwards. We must \nembrace the future, embrace it, work with it, help it work to our \nadvantage, work with other countries to our mutual advantage, but \ncertainly not to the disadvantage of the United States. That is what we \nmust do.\n  The amendment offered by my friend from Illinois is a killer \namendment. It is clearly a killer amendment. It is an amendment to \ntotally undermine the provisions of this bill. It is totally contrary \nto a balanced effort on a bipartisan basis, working together, both \nsides of the aisle, to get legislation passed. For that reason, it is \nessential that it not be adopted.\n  Let's not forget, too, that in addition to the trade negotiating \nobjectives, which we have been talking about, this bill also includes \nanother provision which, frankly, is the driver. It is the main \nprovision in the whole bill. That is trade adjustment assistance. That \nis the most important part of this legislation. It expands the current \nprogram by three or fourfold. It includes secondary workers. It \nincludes health insurance benefits, provisions that don't exist today \nin current law.\n  This bill is designed to strike a bargain between manufacturers and \nproducers on the one hand and people who work in plants and factories \nand companies on the other hand. We are all Americans in this together. \nIt is true that trade with other countries yields tremendous economic \nadvantages to the United States. We all know that. That is a given. We \nalso know that trade with other countries also causes dislocations, the \ntopsy-turvy world we are in now, almost chaotic, certainly sometimes \nunsettling. We know that. The trade adjustment provisions in this bill \nhelp people who are dislocated, who lose their jobs on account of \ntrade. It also provides them health insurance if they lose their jobs \non account of trade. That cannot and should not be forgotten here. That \nis part of the bargain in reaching a trade agreement; namely, helping \nmake sure our country can negotiate trade agreements overseas but doing \nthe best we can to protect our workers at home. It is vitally \nimportant.\n\n  The Senator earlier said that we have a huge trade deficit that has \nbeen caused by all these trade agreements. That is not accurate. We \nhave a large trade deficit for many reasons. One is, frankly, because \nAmerican consumers want to buy cheaper products made overseas. I do not \nthink that very many Americans want to move overseas, or work for 25 \ncents or $1 an hour making shoes or products that are produced \noverseas. Rather, it is up to us in the United States to keep working \non the areas we are best at; and that is, educating our workforce, \nproviding more job training and more ways for us to secure better, \nhigher paying jobs. That is the goal we should have.\n  Another cause of the trade deficit which has nothing to do with trade \nlaws in a certain sense, is the high U.S. dollar versus other \ncountries' currencies. In fact, that is the main reason we have a trade \ndeficit. I think to some degree it is a little secret, but all Treasury \nSecretaries who followed this the last 20, 30 years, like the high \ndollar. Why? Because a strong dollar\n\n[[Page S4375]]\n\nkeeps inflation down. They think it is good to keep inflation down, so \nwe have a high dollar.\n  As a consequence, foreign products are cheaper, irrespective of trade \nagreements--totally irrespective of trade agreements. That is one of \nthe main reasons we have a trade deficit, which should be addressed, I \ngrant my colleagues, but not addressed in a way that says: Let's have a \nvery prescriptive fast-track bill which dictates what all the \nprovisions should be in a way that is totally unworkable. It will not \nwork at all, and that means not giving the President authority to \nproceed.\n  I will yield back the remainder of my time--I do not have much to \nadd--with the understanding my good friend from Illinois also will not \nhave a lot to add so we can vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Durbin \namendment. It is just what we need to get this fast track on the right \ntrack because right now it is not. The reason it is not is because we \nare giving up our rights under the underlying bill to amend to take \ncare of our people, to make sure these agreements are fair to our \nworkers, to our families, to our environment.\n  When I got elected to the Senate, I did not say: I want to come here \nand fight for you, but there is one area I am going to give up all of \nmy views and allow the President to address. I am not going to do it. \nIt does not make sense. The Durbin amendment understands that we are \nhere to do a job. He makes sure we are putting into place environmental \nchecks. He makes sure working standards are looked at. It is very \nimportant.\n  I did not give fast-track authority to a President of my own party \nbecause I did not want to give up my rights. I agreed with that \nPresident so much of the time. I think it is a matter of how we view \nourselves here: Do we come here to whimp out on important issues that \nhave an impact on the daily lives of people? I did not come here to go \nhome and face workers and say: Gee, I am really sorry, we could not \nfight for you. We gave that authority to President Bush. Especially \nwhen President Bush was Governor, he supported a minimum wage of $3.35 \ncents an hour in Texas, and he is trying to roll back environmental \nstandards in our own country. Talk to Jim Jeffords about it. Talk about \nhow this President said he was going to do something about global \nwarming and not only backed out of Kyoto but now does not want to do \nanything about CO2.\n  Why on Earth would we give over our authority and our vote to someone \nwho has not fought for the rights of workers? As a matter of fact, he \nfights ergonomics standards. He fights when we try to pass a minimum \nwage. He is fighting us on this. Why would we give up our rights to \nthat kind of President? It does not make sense.\n  In closing, I want to read a letter I found in the New York Times in \nthe Metropolitan Diary:\n\n       Dear diary:\n       Got out of bed:\n       Took off my pajamas--made in Guatemala.\n       Put on my shorts--Brooks Brothers imported fabric.\n       T-shirt--Dominican Republic.\n       Terry robe--Pakistan.\n       Slippers--China.\n       Drank my coffee--Colombia.\n       Put on my pants--China.\n       Golf shirt--Peru.\n       Socks--Korea.\n       Belt--Uruguay.\n       Zipper jacket--Korea.\n       Drove to the mall.\n       Which countries will I discover today?\n       Good morning, America.\n\n  It is signed Henry Karig.\n  If all these nations treated their workers fairly, had good \nenvironmental standards, up to our standards, I would not be here today \nbecause I would give fast-track authority for a treaty where we are \nnegotiating with someone who is our equal. But we are giving this \nPresident the broad authority to walk in and, frankly, negotiate the \nrights of our workers, our families, and our environment.\n  I hope we adopt the Durbin amendment. I think it is a solid \namendment. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes 19 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California for her words of \nsupport.\n  Senator Hatch said the Durbin amendment makes it tougher on the \nPresident. I remind my good friend from the Senate Judiciary Committee \nand my colleague from Utah that the Constitution makes it tough on the \nPresident. Article I section 8 says:\n\n       The Congress shall have Power . . . To regulate Commerce \n     with foreign Nations . . .\n\n  Every President would like to see that stricken from the Constitution \nso they do not have to worry about this meddlesome interference from \nCongress. Congress comes in here representing all these people, all \nthese businesses, all these farmers, all these ranchers, and Presidents \ndo not have time for that. So they need fast track so they can have a \nfast track around Congress, give us a quick up-or-down, take-it-or-\nleave-it, thank-you-ma'am vote and go home. That is what this is about. \nIt is a question of constitutional authority and whether Congress is \ngoing to vote to give away our authority under the Constitution which \nwe have sworn to uphold and protect.\n  Also, the Senator from Montana has said his bill is going to dedicate \nus to ``pursuing international labor objectives.'' My amendment goes \nfurther. It does not talk about pursuing them. It says implement and \nenforce them. Do my colleagues know the difference? I can pursue a \ncareer in the movies for as long as I want. I do not think I am going \nto get it. But if I am told that I have to get one, get out to \nHollywood and get busy, I take it a little more seriously. That is what \nthe Durbin amendment does when it comes to labor standards.\n  This has been characterized--and it is typical in debate--as a killer \namendment. Allow me to respond. Without this amendment, the Baucus-\nGrassley bill is going to, frankly, put us in a position where we will \nbe killing jobs in America.\n  To say we have a strong adjustment assistance section is like saying: \nI am sorry I have to spread disease across America, but the good news \nis we are going to open more hospitals. In this case, we are saying: We \nknow we are going to lose jobs to these trade agreements; the good news \nis we will keep your family together for a few months and give you \nhealth insurance. How is that for a deal? Not a very good one.\n  Frankly, we should be saying we need expanded trade, we need trade \nagreements, but we need to work with countries that respect the basic \nstandards and treatment of workers so we do not have exploited child \nlabor, slave labor, and forced labor; so that workers around the world \nhave the rights they have in the United States to bargain collectively \nand to associate together.\n  What is radical about this notion? For 70 years in America it has \nbeen one of our core values. Why isn't it part of our values when it \ncomes to trade agreements? If we do not have it as part of our values, \nbelieve me, we are going to be continuing to lose jobs.\n  We have to have trade that is fair, and if we fail to pass this \namendment, we are also going to kill environmental quality. Let's be \nvery clear about this. These multilateral environmental agreements are \nnot respected by the Baucus-Grassley bill. Our bill basically says if \ntwo countries have entered into these agreements, they will be \nrespected. No trade agreement is going to supersede it. Should we not \nbe striving for a cleaner environment around the world? Is it not \nimportant to us, whether it is in Mexico, Brazil, or Uruguay, that we \nhave environmental standards? I think it is.\n  Expanding trade is good, but it is not always good. It should be done \nin the context of fairness, of rules that can be enforced, of standards \nand values that America is proud of so that when it is all said and \ndone, we can say to the American workers: Roll up your sleeves and \nlet's get ready to compete, you know we can.\n  We are competing against a country that is going to play by the same \nrules we are playing by or aspire to the same values, but the Baucus-\nGrassley bill says, no, do not force those standards; play to the \nlowest common denominator when it comes to labor standards, play to the \nlowest common denominator when it comes to environmental protection. \nThat is not what we should do.\n\n[[Page S4376]]\n\n  Before this Congress gives away constitutional authority established \nby our Founding Fathers, in a constitution we have sworn to uphold and \nprotect, stop for a minute and think: Should we not put safeguards in \nthis process so that the Senate and Congress have a voice, so that the \nAmerican people have a voice, so that the millions I represent and \nothers represent when the trade agreements come due understand they \nhave the protection of a Congress that will fight for their rights, not \nan alternative of take it or leave it, up or down, thank you, ma'am, \ngood-bye Congress?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, my good friend from Illinois ridiculed \nthe concept that if he pursued to be an actor or movie star, he would \nnever be one. I might say I think the Senator is a great actor. I will \nnominate the Senator for an Oscar for best actor or best supporting \nactor. I think the Senator has a great career in the movies based upon \nthis last performance.\n  In that vein, to be honest about all of this, we have to ask \nourselves, what is best, given all the complexities we are dealing \nwith? That is really the question. This bill is a huge step forward \nwith respect to protecting labor and the environment overseas. It is \nmassive compared to what we have done in the past. A basic question we \nhave to ask ourselves is: Are we in favor of trade agreements or are we \nnot? Generally, that is the basic question.\n  I think we should pursue trade agreements. There are some in this \nbody who will vote against all of them, fast track or trade agreements. \nLet's not forget, most trade in this country has nothing to do with \nfast-track negotiating authority. Some of it has to do with some trade \nagreements that are reached without fast track. We are talking only \nabout the very complex multilateral trade agreements. That is what fast \ntrack is about. Companies, employees, and people should pursue their \neconomic objectives worldwide, irrespective of anything they call fast \ntrack.\n  In addition, there are lots of bilateral trade agreements that are \nnegotiated and reached all around the world, irrespective of fast \ntrack. Fast track will only be used for the very complicated \nmultinational trade agreements, and we have to delegate authority to \nthe President because we are the only nonparliamentary government \nnegotiating these agreements in most cases. That is in our separation \nof powers and in our Constitution. Other countries are not going to \nnegotiate with the President knowing that the Congress can totally \namend it according to our own particular State and congressional \ninterests. They cannot negotiate with us. We have to, on the very \ncomplex agreements, have a fast-track negotiating authority. It is just \na given. Otherwise, nothing happens on the very large, complex \nagreements we hope we can reach to knock down trade barriers around the \nworld in agriculture and lots of other areas if we are really going to \nhelp our people get these trade barriers overseas knocked down, which \nis the real goal of all of this--to open markets. We need to pass this \nto get that done.\n\n  Second, we have to ask ourselves, do we want a partisan bill or a \nnonpartisan bill? We know we have a closely divided Senate. We have to \nhave a nonpartisan bill. It has to be nonpartisan. The provision the \nSenator is advocating is totally partisan. It received not one vote \nfrom the Republican Party on the other side--not one vote on the floor \nor in committee.\n  Now, I am a Democrat. I am very proud to be a Democrat, but I am also \na Montanan and an American, and I want practical results that really \nmove us forward. This bill before us is that. It is a bipartisan bill. \nIt is not a partisan bill. It is a bipartisan bill. It passed the \ncommittee 18 to 3, and it has strong bipartisan support in this body.\n  So if we really want to reach our objectives and get things done and \nwork to try to solve these extremely complex problems--and they are \ncomplex--I believe we should do it on a bipartisan basis, not on a \ntotally partisan basis. Even though I am a Democrat and strongly \nsupport the ideas of our party, we have to be practical about things \nand get some results as well.\n  Third, this is the most progressive fast-track bill this country has \never seen, by far. I understand some of the problems the Senator from \nIllinois is suggesting. We cannot let perfection be the enemy of the \ngood. The Senator is seeking perfection. We cannot have perfection. His \nidea of perfection is totally opposite to some other Senator's idea of \nperfection, and we can think right now in our minds who that Senator \nmight be.\n  We cannot let perfection be the enemy of the good. We have to find a \ngood solution, a good result, and this underlying bill is just that. I \nask my colleagues, therefore, to vote for the most progressive trade \nbill this body has ever seen. Unfortunately, that means voting against \nthe amendment of my good friend from Illinois for all the reasons I \nhave indicated.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, as we emerge from last year's \nrecession, we must remain focused on promoting economic opportunities \nand creating jobs.\n  Expanding international trade can help our economy.\n  Our small and large companies, and our workers benefit when we open \nforeign markets to American goods. Our farmers and ranchers benefit \nwhen they can sell their agricultural products overseas and our \nfamilies benefit when reduced tariffs lower the price of consumer \ngoods.\n  However, as we look to expand economic opportunities through \ninternational trade, we should remember the Hippocratic oath that all \nphysicians must take: ``First, do no harm.''\n  While we should strive to expand international trade, we must first \ndo no harm to our economy and our workers.\n  Now more than ever as our Nation continues to lose manufacturing \njobs. We must not allow our trading partners to gain unfair advantages \nat the expense of American workers.\n  Fair trade expands opportunities and creates jobs. Unfair trade ships \nopportunities and jobs overseas.\n  My State alone has lost nearly 40,000 manufacturing jobs since 1998. \nIn fact, in fiscal year 2001 alone, Missouri lost 25,000 jobs. Jobs \nwere lost in every region of the State.\n  Springfied, MO, used to be home to a Zenith Electronics facility that \nmanufactured molded cabinets. Four-hundred and thirty residents of that \ncommunity lost their jobs when the company closed down and moved to \nMexico in 1994.\n  Lamy Manufacturing had been making pants in Sedalia, MO, for 132 \nyears. They made pants for the army during World War II. The company \nwas forced to close its doors and lay off approximately 350 workers in \n1999 because of a flood of inexpensive imports.\n  Eight-hundred and twelve people lost their jobs last year when GST \nSteel shut down its plant in Kansas City. That closing marked the end \nof a plant whose history dated back to 1888.\n  And earlier this year, Ford Motor Company announced that it was \nclosing its manufacturing facility in Hazelwood, MO. This plant employs \nnearly 2,600 people. It has been open since Harry Truman was in the \nWhite House.\n  The jobs we have lost are good jobs, the type of jobs that come with \nhealth benefits, and a pension, the type of jobs that enable you to pay \nthe mortgage and put some money aside to pay for college or care for an \nelderly parent.\n  On April 2, the Los Angeles Times ran an article about this \nphenomenon entitled ``High Paid Jobs latest U.S. Export.''\n  The article told of the efforts of several U.S. manufacturers to \nlower their costs by moving facilities abroad.\n  Our government should not encourage these moves, which result in \nthousands of American jobs being exported to foreign countries. But \nthis is precisely what happens when we sign trade agreements with \ncountries that do not allow workers to form labor unions, countries \nthat allow children to work in unsafe factories, and countries that \nproduce cheap goods because their factories can wantonly pollute the \nenvironment.\n  I firmly believe that expanded international trade can benefit \nAmerican companies, American farmers, and American workers. But unless \nwe ensure that our trade agreements contain real labor standards, \nworking families will continue to suffer and we will continue to lose \nAmerican jobs.\n\n[[Page S4377]]\n\n  President Bush has announced that he wants to expand NAFTA to the \nrest of the hemisphere and cared a Free Trade Area of the America. If \nwe want to prevent even more jobs form being lost, we must ensure that \nan agreement to expand NAFTA contains meaningful protections for \nAmerican workers.\n  That is why I support Senator Durbin's alternative. His proposal \nstrikes the appropriate balance between promoting trade and protecting \njobs. It would give the President the authority he needs to pursue \ninternational trade agreements. And at the same time, it would ensure \nthat those agreements do not threaten working families.\n  Workers in this country fought for years to gain the rights they \ncurrently enjoy: the right to organize; the ban on child labor; the 40-\nhours work week; and the minimum wage.\n  The Baucus-Grassley Amendment concerns me because it does not \nadequately protect working families. It doesn't require our trading \npartners to have any laws or regulation to protect workers. The \namendment only requires that a country enforce its existing labor \nlaws--regardless of how weak those laws may be.\n  How can we possible engage in fair trade with a country that permits \n14-year-olds to work in factories?\n  How can we engage in fair trade with a country where the hourly wage \nis mere pennies an hour?\n  We cannot. And if we sign trade agreements with countries like this, \nand don't demand basic protections, we will continue to see American \njobs evaporate.\n  To make matters worse, the Baucus-Grassley amendment contains a \nprovision that actually allows a country to weaken its labor and \nenvironmental laws in order to attract investment.\n  This flies in the face of the concept of fair trade. In order for \nfair trade to truly exist, all of the nations involved must meet and \nmaintain certain minimum requirements so American workers can compete \nfairly.\n  The proposal that Senator Durbin has offered provide real \nprotections. His amendment requires countries to implement and enforce \nfive core standards. Those standards include: One, the right of \nassociation; two, the right to collectively bargain; three, a ban on \nchild labor; four a ban on forced labor; and five, a ban on \ndiscrimination.\n  Ensuring that these minimum labor standards are included in our trade \nagreements will enable American workers to compete on a level playing \nfield and help stop the loss of American jobs.\n  I believe in America's workforce. And I am confident that, given the \nchance to compete fairly, American workers will thrive.\n  I believe that the alternative that Senator Durbin has put forward \nstrikes the right balance.\n  This common-sense approach will enable all the working families of \nthis Nation to enjoy the benefits offered by expanded international \ntrade.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield whatever time my friend from Utah desires.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I also agree that the distinguished \nSenator would make an excellent actor. In fact, I am going to talk to \nour mutual friends at DreamWorks to make sure they extend an offer to \nhim because I believe he could do much better than he is doing on the \nfloor today.\n  Secondly, on the Constitution, we are going through this exercise \nbecause we control this process. The Finance Committee, 18 to 3, said \nwe should have a process that works, and it should be a nonpartisan \nprocess that works. We have come very close to having a very partisan \nprocess as it is. We cannot take any more of these kinds of amendments \nand have a process that will work at all in the best interest of our \ncountry.\n  I am, of course, kidding my partner. I have a lot of respect for him. \nHe is clearly a very intelligent and very articulate spokesperson for \nhis point of view. But the fact is, it is not easy to get 18 votes in \nthe Finance Committee on most issues. Our chairman has done a terrific \njob. So has our ranking member. We need to back them. We need to back \nour U.S. Trade Representative. He is a terrific human being, and he \nworks very hard, as did his predecessors in the prior administration. I \nsupported them.\n  This bill is an extremely important bill for our country, and I \nbelieve in the end it is an important bill for the world. We know our \nrole in the world. We know we have to play that role, and we have to \nhelp many countries throughout the world.\n  I think it is a little ironic that some would suggest our country \nwould not do what is right for the rest of the world, even though we \ncannot do everything the rest of the world wants, nor can we always \nplease our friends in Europe or anybody else for that matter. But this \nbill will help us. This bill will help strengthen our economy. This \nbill will help every worker in America. This bill helps people who are \nnot able to work right now.\n  I have said we have to have both TPA and TAA. I said it in committee. \nI want to compliment our leaders on the Finance Committee and our \nleaders on the floor. They have done a terrific job and they deserve \nbacking. We ought to defeat this amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I move to table the amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  Is all time yielded back on the amendment?\n  Does the Senator from Montana yield back all time on the amendment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kohl). The question is on agreeing to the \nmotion. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I announce that the Senator from North Carolina (Mr. \nHelms) is necessarily absent.\n  I further announce that if present and voting the Senator from North \nCarolina (Mr. Helms) would vote ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I am happy to: Dodd, Republican, Rockefeller-Mikulski, \nRepublican, Kerry, Republican, Dorgan, Republican, Torricelli.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, the Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3427 To Amendment No. 3401\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3427.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To strike the provisions relating to wage insurance)\n\n       Strike section 243(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 as added by \n     section 111.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, this amendment deals with one of the \nissues in the trade adjustment section of the bill. This bill, as has \nbeen mentioned in numerous discussions here, has four major sections, \nfour major issues. One of them is trade adjustment.\n  First off, I do not think all these issues should have been joined. \nHistorically, the Congress has taken up trade promotion authority, \nwhich used to be known as fast track, independent of these other \nissues. It has taken up trade adjustment as a freestanding bill. And \ncertainly it has taken up the Andean trade preference bill as a \nfreestanding bill.\n  They should not have been merged, but, unfortunately, they were \nmerged. As a result of being merged, I believe a lot of language has \nbeen basically hooked to the train because they know the train is \nleaving the station.\n  The language, regrettably, is not good. It is not good policy. In \nfact, it is extremely detrimental policy. It should be rejected by the \nSenate. However, it is part of the package, and there is concern about \nthe whole package going down if this language is deleted.\n  In my opinion, some of this language is so egregious, we as a Senate \nneed to be on record about it, and we should defeat it. Two of these \nsections that are egregious, because they open huge new entitlement \nquestions, are the health care section of the trade adjustment language \nand what is called the wage insurance section, wage subsidy section of \nthe trade adjustment language.\n  The health insurance language has been talked about quite a bit. I \nhave certainly talked about it. It basically, in a very haphazard way, \naddresses one of the fundamental issues we as a Congress have to \naddress, which is how we deal with people who are uninsured in our \nsociety in health care. In my opinion, doing it in this very narrow way \nis taking a step down a path which will probably lead to having poor \npolicy overall in the area of health insurance, something I have spent \na lot of time working on in the Senate. Therefore, I think this is the \nwrong vehicle in which to have that type of language.\n  I am not addressing that tonight. What I have proposed is a motion to \nstrike the wage subsidy language in this bill. What is wage subsidy? It \nis very important to understand this right upfront. What this is is a \nnew concept, a concept which essentially says that if you lose your job \nas a senior citizen--not a senior citizen, I am not a senior citizen--\nif you lose your job and you are over age 50--although you do qualify \nto be a senior citizen over age 50; I get all these forms now that tell \nme I am a senior citizen--if you lose your job over age 50 as a result \nof a trade adjustment event, and then you go out and take another job, \nyou will have a right--this is the point, the big point of context--you \nwill have a right to receive, if the second job you take pays you less \nthan the job you lost as a result of trade activity, you will have a \nright to get from the taxpayers of America up to $5,000 to make up the \ndifference between the job you lost and the job you have taken.\n\n  This is a concept which, as I mentioned earlier, is in great vogue in \nplaces such as Italy and France but which goes fundamentally against \nthe free market society we have in our country and which has been the \ndynamic that has made our society so strong. That dynamic is \nessentially this: We have a marketplace which says we want people to be \nthe most productive they can be; we want them to have jobs where they \nare going to obtain the best benefit, not only for themselves but the \nbest benefit for the whole, by doing the best they can in a job that is \nproducing economic activity that is benefiting everyone.\n  The way you do that is you allow the marketplace to decide what a \nperson's value is within the marketplace, and the person can move from \njob to job and improve their standing and, as a result, improve their \nown personal income but also improve the economic activity of the whole \ncountry.\n  What this bill is proposing is that we no longer do that, that we \nreward people for taking a less efficient job, for taking a job where \nthey are less productive, and for taking a job which basically is less \nof an incentive for them to be productive than what they presently \nhave, and we are going to reward them for that. We are going to reward \nthem for stepping out of the mainstream of the marketplace, where they \nhave been successful, and stepping backwards.\n  It is really a unique concept for us as a country to pursue at this \ntime. It is especially ironic in light of what has happened in such \nother industries; for example, the whole technology industry, where you \nhad a huge reorganization as a result of the late 1990s activities and \nthe Internet and the boom in the Internet and then the bust in the \nInternet, people having to move from job to job.\n  Suddenly we are going to say we no longer have any confidence in the \nmarketplace. We are going to tell people, you can take a lesser job, be \nless productive, but we will pay you more money and use tax dollars to \ndo it. It is a concept which is used in France and Italy, but it \ncertainly is not appropriate here.\n  I want to talk about the specifics of how this is structured. The \nstructure of it is also unique. It abandons all the basic rules and \nregulations under the present trade adjustment authority. Then I want \nto talk about the philosophy of it.\n  To outline what it does, it says, if you lose a job as a result of \ntrade and you are over 50 years old and you get a new job within 26 \nweeks and the new job pays less than the old job, then the taxpayers \nwill make up the difference up to $5,000 if the job pays less than \n$50,000. It does not require any training. It does not require that you \nchoose a similar or suitable job that is available.\n  In other words, if there is a job out there that is equal to what you \nare presently doing and you can have that job or you want to take a \ndifferent job that pays a lot less--I can think of a lot of reasons \nsomebody might want to do that if they are over 50 years old--then you \ncan take that job that pays less and the taxpayers have to make up the \ndifference. You do not have to take a similar or suitable job.\n\n[[Page S4379]]\n\n  It does not require that you remain in the community, which is \nsomething the trade adjustment clause has required. There is no \nlimitation based on necessity, and the program does not consider \nwhether wage rates at the new employer have been altered or negotiated \nor manipulated to basically make a deal.\n  These are all big issues. There is no requirement that the \nrelationship be arm's length between the new job you take that is \nsubsidized by the taxpayer and the old job that you lost. There is no \nprotection afforded to other workers who may be displaced. It just runs \nto the people who are over 50 years old and who are subjected to trade \nadjustment.\n  The fact that there is no training required flies in the face of the \nwhole concept of the trade adjustment proposal. Anybody who has spent \nany time with trade adjustment knows its real strength is that it says \nto a person who loses their job because the industry they are in maybe \ncan't compete with products coming in as a result of a trade agreement \nor for some other reason--we say to that person, we are going to give \nyou all sorts of training options so you can improve your position, \nimprove your knowledge base, and move forward, hopefully to a higher \nlevel job in a different sector that has not been so significantly \nimpacted by trade.\n  That is one of the key ingredients to trade adjustment. The wage \nsubsidy has absolutely no training requirement. So it basically throws \nout one of the key components of trade adjustment.\n  Another key component is that if there is a similar or suitable job \navailable, you should take it. Why shouldn't you? Let's say you are \nworking for an employer for whose product you have a skill that you \nhave developed but the employer didn't do a good job competing in that \narea. That skill is unique and it is special. And there is another \nemployer over here across the street who is making the same product and \nis competing well in the international marketplace. If that job is \navailable to you, you should take it. Under trade adjustment, you are \nsupposed to take it.\n  Under this proposal, you don't have to take that job. You don't have \nto take a similar, suitable job. So basically it throws out the concept \nthat people should be encouraged, before they start getting Federal \nbenefits, if the availability is there, to move laterally and even move \nup. No. Instead, you can take a lesser paying job where you are less \nproductive and the taxpayer comes in and pays you $5,000 to do it.\n  You don't have to remain in the community. One of the keys to the \nwhole concept of trade adjustment was that you would remain in the \ncommunity. This is a bill that is structured around the concept of \ntrying to keep people and communities vibrant when they are hit by a \nhuge trade event. That grew out of the textile and clothing fights, \nproblems not only in the South but in the North.\n  In my State, where we had all our shoe factories closed, all our \ntextile mills closed, we have recovered dramatically because the people \nwho were working in those textile mills and those shoe mills moved into \nindustries which were competitive and which involved being retrained. \nActually they ended up, in most instances, with higher paying jobs; \ncertainly their kids did. By staying in those communities, they are \nbeing productive citizens. That is a concept.\n  Under this bill, you can leave the State, move across the country, \nand take a job somewhere else. And if it pays you less than what your \nold job paid you, even though there may be lots of jobs in the \ncommunity that paid you more, you just wanted a job that paid you less, \nthe taxpayers pay you $5,000 for taking that job and for leaving your \ncommunity. It is an incentive to leave your community rather than an \nincentive to stay.\n  It does not require any showing of need before the person gets this \nmoney. It is just basically a payment. If you meet the requirement of \n$50,000, you get paid.\n  There are a lot of people out there who might have personal assets, \nwealth, or who may be part of a family who has an income who certainly \ndoesn't need a $5,000 subsidy coming from the Federal Government.\n  Other taxpayers are working hard. There should be, obviously, some \nthreshold standard to meet as to assets which the person has, or as to \nwhat their income is as a family, rather than simply sending them the \nmoney.\n  A steelworker might get laid off from a steel plant. He or she may go \nto work for his or her son who runs a construction company, take a \nsignificant cut in pay, have the taxpayers pay a $5,000 supplement.\n  Basically, this is a great deal for the son. He gets an employee with \n$5,000 of the cost of that employee picked up by the taxpayers. No \narm's length necessity, no limitations on arm's length transactions, no \nrequirement that they be arm's length, no requirement that there be any \nreview for the purposes of fraud or abuse.\n  There could be all sorts of deals made out there--and I can see them \nactually occurring--where somebody closes a plant, alleges it is trade \nadjustment, reopens another facility, or has somebody else reopen \nanother facility--I am not talking large numbers of people here maybe--\nand they work it out for a couple years where these employees will get \nthis $5,000 payment from the taxpayers and they do not have to pay it. \nAs a result, they have a huge windfall and a gaming of the system. It \nis a very distinct possibility.\n  Of course, without the arm's length transaction, there are all sorts \nof implications for the ways this could be gamed by somebody. One does \nnot even have to be that creative to game the system.\n  The actual language of this section is poorly drafted, to be kind, \nand has significant problems substantively in its application beyond \nthe policy problems--beyond the huge policy problems--of being a \ntotally new approach to how we address our productivity as an economy \nand how we approach market forces in our economy.\n  It is important to remember that the TAA proposal had some core \npurposes. I alluded to them, but one of them is, of course, to retrain \npeople who are dislocated. It has had tremendous success in this area. \nIn fact, in 2001, 75 percent of dislocated workers who sought service \ngot jobs and averaged 100 percent of their predislocation earnings. \nFurthermore, 86 percent were still working after 6 months in those new \njobs.\n  The theme of trade adjustment is: Give people training so they can \nmove to a new job when they lose a job and have that job be a better \njob. That is logical; that makes sense.\n  Unfortunately, this proposal says: No, we are going to tell people \nwhen they lose their job, to get a job that pays them less, which means \nthey are less productive; and it also probably means they have chosen a \ndifferent type of activity that is maybe more lifestyle appropriate to \nthem, but they are doing it all at a subsidy from the taxpayers.\n  It is not too farfetched to presume that if you are 50 years old and \nyou lose your job through trade adjustment and you are working in the \nNortheast that you may want to go to Florida or you may want to go to \nArizona or New Mexico because you are tired of the snow, you are tired \nof the winters. All that shoveling does catch up with you when you get \na little older sometimes and trying to get your car started in the cold \nweather.\n  Madam President, you can see where this proposal is going, basically, \nto create a huge incentive for people to leave those communities in the \nNorth, move to the Sun Belt, take jobs that pay significantly less, \nhave the taxpayers send them $5,000 as a benefit, and go into, \nbasically, semiretirement. We could almost call this the ``Disney World \nEmployment Act.'' Disney World is going to be overwhelmed with people \nin their fifties who want to come down and maybe do the Adventure Ride \nand the Jungle 3 days a week and spend the rest of the time enjoying \nFlorida's weather and golf courses and get a $5,000 bonus.\n\n  That is not the concept of trade adjustment. If somebody wants to do \nthat, that is fine, but the guy or woman who is out there working on a \nfactory line somewhere paying taxes or working in a restaurant paying \ntaxes or working in a computer company paying taxes should not have to \nsubsidize that sort of mismanagement of our economy, that sort of \nactivity which is going to basically redirect\n\n[[Page S4380]]\n\nproductivity to nonproductive activity and take tax dollars to do it.\n  The way the bill is drafted flies in the face of all the basic policy \nwe have passed in Congress relative to age discrimination. Basically, \nthe concept of age discrimination we passed has been that when people \nhit age 50 or 55 and want to work, they should not be discriminated \nagainst in maintaining and improving their position in the workplace.\n  What this bill says is: When you reach age 50, we are going to create \nan economic incentive for you to reduce your productivity and to reduce \nyour position in the workplace. It is totally inconsistent with the Age \nDiscrimination Act and the Older Americans Act because it is basically \nsubscribing to a theory that when you hit 50, you should be pushed into \na job that pays you less and have the taxpayers come along and \nsubsidize it.\n  That is the opposite of what we thought the Age Discrimination Act \nwas. The purpose of the Age Discrimination Act was when somebody \nreaches 50, they cannot be pushed out of their job because of their age \nand they should be encouraged to continue to improve in their \nproductivity by growing in their job.\n  The language says if a person is over 50 and loses their job, we do \nnot have any confidence they can find another job that is going to pay \nthem more; we do not have any confidence they can go through trade \nadjustment training and improve their position; we do not believe what \nwe said in the Age Discrimination Act or the Older Americans Act.\n  No, rather, this language believes you cannot teach an old dog new \ntricks. So instead of trying to teach him new tricks, we are going to \npay him $5,000 a year to forget everything he knew, everything he \nlearned at his workplace, and take a lesser job. What an outrageous \npolicy that is.\n  On the specifics, this language, first, is terribly drafted because \nit has no training requirement, no requirement that similar and \nsuitable jobs be taken, no requirement you remain in the community, no \nrequirement that it be based on necessity, no requirement for arm's \nlength, no requirement you check for fraud and abuse, no requirement \nthere be a necessity, some sort of test as to whether or not the person \nshould get the $5,000, and it does not protect anybody else except \npeople over age 50 and actually creates an incentive which flies in the \nface of all the age policy, antidiscrimination language we passed in \nthis Congress for the last 10, 15, 20 years.\n  Other than that, it is a great idea. Beyond those specific problems \nin the drafting, there is a bigger issue at stake and it goes to \nsomething I mentioned earlier and have alluded to, and that is the \nquestion as to how our economy remains resilient.\n  I happen to believe, and I think there are a lot of people who agree \nwith this, especially ironically in Europe and in Japan today, that one \nof the key elements of the resiliency of our economy is the flexibility \nof our workforce and the fact that we have a workforce which is dynamic \nand is capable of moving with the times from jobs to jobs which are \nmore and more competitive.\n  I take my State as the classic example. Twenty years ago in my \nState--maybe 30 years ago now--we were a textile, woolen mill, shoe \nfactory State, where most of the people worked in large factories. In \nfact, up through the middle part of the last century, we had the \nlargest continuous mill in the world in Manchester, NH. It was built in \nthe 1800s and functioned right into the 1900s. Then everybody moved to \nthe South. All our textile mills closed, our shoe mills closed, and \nthey took all this business down south where they could get a different \nwage rate.\n  So New Hampshire had to adjust. I remember when I was growing up in \nNashua, NH, we lost our single biggest employer. They left the city and \nwe had to adjust. So those people in the mills that had been textile \nand shoe mills had to find something else to do. They started moving \ninto technology-related activities. Slowly, we developed this \ntechnology-based economy to the point where today more people on a per \ncapita basis work in technology-based activities in New Hampshire than \nin any other State in the country.\n  What has been the practical impact? It has meant that we went from a \nper capita income which was in the mid-thirties--relative to other \nStates we were about 35th, 36th in the country in the 1960s and 1970s--\nto a per capita income which is now fourth in the country. That has \nbeen a function of the fact that we have not changed our people but we \nhave retrained our people. Our people have shown the initiative and the \ncreativity to take new jobs, different jobs, and people have come to \nNew Hampshire to employ them. Jobs have been created in New Hampshire, \nand we have created an economic climate where we have seen this huge \nexpansion.\n  This is not a unique New Hampshire story. This is an American story. \nWe, as a culture, are constantly moving through different forms of \nvalue-added activity where we create new concepts, new initiatives, \nwhether it is in the technology area or whether it is in the medical \narea or whether it is in the widget area or whether it is in the \nStarbucks area. There is always a new idea in America that is creating \njobs and activity.\n  Regrettably, on the other side of the coin there are quite often \nindustries which have not kept up with the times or which can no longer \ncompete for some reason with some international company that maybe is \nable to do something at a lower wage.\n  Those people who are in those jobs for the most part find themselves \nwith opportunities in other industries which are growing. We have not \npursued the Italian model where, when you get a job, you have that job \nfor life, literally have it for life, and that company cannot fire you, \nor the French model which essentially says, when you get a job, first \nyou do not have to work too hard and, second, if you lose that job you \nare basically taken care of as if you still had the job and you get to \nretire very early.\n\n  In fact, I remember the truckdrivers in France about 3 years ago \nstruck because they wanted to be able to retire at full pay when they \nwere 55. Well, the life expectancy has extended quite a bit, so \nbasically you had people working half their working lives and retired \nhalf their working lives, and they basically ran out of money. It \nbecomes a pyramid that is inverted after a while in the classic Mark \nTwain story where there is only one person still working and everybody \nelse is taking, which totally undermines productivity when there is \nthat sort of approach to the economic structure of your country in what \namounts to an alleged market economy.\n  We have not pursued that course. We have instead pursued a course to \nmaintain flexibility. We want people to be able to move up and always \nimprove, and if somebody has gone on hard times because the competition \nfrom an international commodity has been overwhelming and they have \nlost their job because of it, we have trade adjustment to help train \nthat person and move up and improve their life. We do not want to say \nto that person, you should move down in your economic activity, you \nshould slow your productivity, you should reduce your efficiency, you \nshould take a job which we, the taxpayers, or everybody in America, all \ntaxpayers, have to end up subsidizing so that you can have a job that \npays you less where you probably are asked to do less and where the \nskills which you have are probably not adequately used.\n  If you as a citizen lose your job because of trade adjustment, \nwhatever the job might be--steel is being talked about today so let's \nsay it is steel--and there is not a similar job--if there was a similar \njob, theoretically you should take it but, of course, under this \nlanguage you do not have to--but you decided that you wanted to go to \nFlorida and become a greens keeper, that was always your dream and you \nwere 50 years old and you thought you might be running out of time and \nyou wanted to be on that golf course every day and play a little golf \nwhen you were not working on the golf course, or maybe be a part-time \ngolf pro, that is your right. You can do that, but there is absolutely \nno reason that we should come along and, as a society, subsidize your \ntaking that position and doing that job which basically you are \noverqualified to do.\n  You could do something else if you wanted to that would pay you \nsignificantly more and which would be much better in the sense of the \noverall economy potentially.\n\n[[Page S4381]]\n\n  This is one of the worst ideas to come down the pike in a long time. \nIt, obviously, arises out of a philosophy which is attracted to the way \nthings occur in France and in Italy. It is a 1950s form of economics \nwhich was in vogue at one time, sort of a quasi-socialist view of the \nworld which says essentially that someone should always be able to \nreceive a benefit from the government, even if they are making choices \nwhich are basically counter to what the government policy should be.\n  It is a view of the world which seems to have incredible disregard \nfor those Americans who are working and who are paying taxes, because \nit is essentially saying to those Americans who are working hard every \nday and paying taxes, we are going to subsidize someone to the tune of \n$5,000 to take a job they do not necessarily need to take in many \ninstances, but we are going to subsidize them, and then we are not \ngoing to ask that person to train. We are not going ask that person to \ntake a similar job. We are not going to ask that person to stay in the \ncommunity. We are not going to find out whether that job was agreed to \nat arm's length. We are not going to check on the abuse. We are not \ngoing to check on even whether the person needs the job from a \nfinancial situation. We are simply going to pay that person $5,000 to \ntake less of a job, simply because they were allegedly put out of work \nas a result of a trade event and because they are over 50 years of age.\n  It delivers the wrong message to somebody who is working pretty hard, \nwho is under 50 years old and happens to lose their job because they do \nnot have this opportunity. It clearly delivers the wrong message to \nsomebody who is working very hard trying to make ends meet, paying a \nsignificant amount of their income in taxes, and suddenly finds they \nare supporting someone to the tune of a $5,000 benefit that creates \nless efficiency, less marketplace productivity, and undermines the \nbasic concept of our approach as a nation to how one remains vibrant in \na competitive world.\n  So this language, I would hope, would be deleted. Tomorrow we will \nhave a vote on it. I appreciate the courtesy of the Senate, and \nespecially the staff of the Senate, for listening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the loya jirga process moves forward in \nAfghanistan, all of us must realize that U.S. security depends on a \npolitical solution in that far-away country that truly creates \nfunctioning stability there. All of us know what the costs of an \nunstable Afghanistan have been--those costs were delivered to us on \nSeptember 11.\n  A political solution in Afghanistan, in my opinion, cannot rely \nsolely on the Northern Alliance leaders who control many aspects of the \ngovernment today. While we have had numerous military successes in \nAfghanistan, we must be as serious about our commitment to a truly \nmulti-ethnic political resolution to the country's current \ningovernability.\n  Last week, Dr. Marin Strmecki, a scholar on Afghanistan for the past \n20 years, a fine intellectual who served on my staff many years ago, \nwrote an excellent analysis in the National Review. I have much respect \nfor Dr. Strmecki's analysis and would urge my colleagues to read it. I \nask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the National Review, May 20, 2002]\n\n                     Winning, Truly, in Afghanistan\n\n                         (By Marin J. Strmecki)\n\n       In late March, President Bush placed a call to Prime \n     Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy that led to the delay of \n     the departure from Rome of the former king of Afghanistan, \n     Zahir Shah. The king had wanted to return to his war-torn \n     country in the hope of reunifying it--but the U.S. had \n     credible information that there would be an attempt on his \n     life. The most dismaying aspect of this news was that the \n     ringleaders of the plan were members of the Northern \n     Alliance, an Afghan faction closely aligned with the U.S. and \n     propelled into Kabul by the U.S. rout of the Taliban.\n       This episode illustrates a growing danger: Despite having \n     won militarily in Afghanistan, the U.S. may still lose \n     politically. A complete victory would mean a pro-Western \n     government in Kabul, one that would mop up the remnants of \n     al-Qaeda and cooperate in the larger regional war. But if the \n     U.S. doesn't change its policies soon, radical Islamists \n     could end up in the driver's seat in Afghanistan.\n       The critical error came last fall, when U.S. officials \n     selected their principal Afghan allies. The Bush \n     administration opted against working with ``the Rome group,'' \n     a faction of Western-oriented Afghans (including the former \n     king) who sought to recreate the country's moderate and \n     secular pre-1978 government. Though it had no forces in the \n     field, the Rome group could have rapidly mobilized \n     sympathetic commanders and fighters, particularly in Taliban \n     strongholds in southern and eastern Afghanistan. The U.S. \n     chose instead to ally itself with the Northern Alliance, a \n     faction supported by Iran and Russia and in control of about \n     10 percent of the country.\n       The Northern Alliance was a dubious choice. Two of its \n     principal leaders, Burhanuddin Rabbani and Abdul Rasul \n     Sayyaf, are major figures in the jihadist movement and were \n     close associates of Osama bin Laden in the 1980s. When \n     Rabbani served as president in the early 1990s, his \n     administration granted visas to the foreign elements of al-\n     Qaeda. Also, he and his party, Jamiat-i-Islami, sought to \n     seize dictatorial power, with his secret-police and interior \n     ministries, led by Qasim Fahim and Yunus Qanooni \n     respectively, killing thousands of members of other political \n     groups. Moreover, Rabbani's Tajik-led military forces carried \n     out atrocities against ethnic Pashtuns in many areas, abuses \n     that contributed greatly to the outbreak of the civil war out \n     of which the Taliban emerged.\n       Not surprisingly, when Northern Alliance forces rolled into \n     Kabul last fall, its leaders picked up where the Rabbani \n     government had left off. Rabbani himself reoccupied the\n\n[[Page S4382]]\n\n     presidential palace and appointed ministers and governors, \n     all from his Islamist party. More troubling, the Northern \n     Alliance opened the doors to Russian and Iranian advisers and \n     intelligence operatives, who arrived in Kabul on a steady \n     stream of air transports. Fahim, now the defense minister, \n     garrisoned his forces in the capital and staffed the military \n     high command exclusively with his political cronies and \n     former Communist officers selected by his Russian allies.\n       Though international pressure forced the creation of a \n     coalition government in late December, all of the powerful \n     ministries--defense, interior, and foreign affairs--remained \n     in the hands of the Northern Alliance. Qanooni, again the \n     interior minister, and Fahim proceeded to use their power to \n     harass political opponents, with several senior officials \n     reportedly taking part in the assassination in January of a \n     cabinet minister associated with the Rome group.\n       The Northern Alliance's winner-take-all approach threatens \n     U.S. interests. First of all, the interim government has not \n     been much help to U.S. forces against al-Qaeda in the south \n     and east, where Pashtuns remember all too well the atrocities \n     of the Rabbani government and seek to hold the new government \n     at arm's length. Second, its Iranian allies have established \n     two Hezbollah-style clandestine networks, Sepah-e-Mohammed \n     and Sepah-e-Sahaba, to wage a campaign of Lebanon-style \n     attacks designed to bog down the U.S. or even force it to \n     withdraw. Third, Northern Alliance leaders have sought to \n     delay or subvert the scheduled June meeting of the national \n     assembly, or loya jirga, which is the key event in the \n     planned transition to a more representative government. \n     Fourth, if the dominance of the Northern Alliance persists, \n     the Pashtuns (40-45 percent of the population) could rise up \n     in a renewed civil war, and offer Pakistan's intelligence \n     service an opportunity to reestablish its pernicious practice \n     of supporting Taliban-style movements in Afghanistan.\n       The Bush administration must act carefully--but quickly. \n     First, the U.S. must assert itself as the dominant foreign \n     power in Afghanistan until the transition is completed (when \n     elections take place in about two years). Bush has made \n     excellent statements indicating that the U.S. will remain \n     engaged over the long haul. In practical terms, this means \n     that the U.S.--even as it moves on to other theaters--must \n     retain sufficient strike power in the region to cow the \n     Afghan factions. The U.S. also must check the roles of Russia \n     and Iran. Although Bush encouraged Russia's President Putin \n     to bolster the Northern Alliance as it fought to topple the \n     Taliban, he must now explain to Putin that stability can only \n     come from pluralism in an open political process--and that \n     Moscow needs to rein in its client. The U.S. must also insist \n     that the Afghan authorities cut off incoming flights from \n     Iran.\n       Second, the U.S. must signal a shift away from its \n     excessive reliance on the Northern Alliance. It should \n     emphasize the need to pluralize Afghan politics and to \n     distribute important cabinet seats more broadly: The stacking \n     of ministries with Northern Alliance Appointees--often \n     incompetent and in many cases illiterate--must not be allowed \n     to stand. The coalition should further insist that--with the \n     deployment of the International security assistance Force \n     (ISAF) in Kabul--Northern Alliance troops begin to be \n     redeployed back to their native provinces. At the same time, \n     the U.S. and its allies must try to level the playing field \n     for the loya jirga. Russia and Iran have provided vast \n     amounts of money to the Northern Alliance to buy political \n     support; the U.S. should assist pro-Western parties, just as \n     it did in Europe after World War II.\n       Third, the U.S. should insist that the loya jirga end the \n     current imbalance of power favoring the Northern Alliance. We \n     should also demand that every new minister be professionally \n     qualified for his position and that no minister have a \n     history of massive human-rights abuses. These criteria would \n     preclude reappointment of Qanooni and Fahim, who were deeply \n     involved in massacres in the early and mid 1990s. This step \n     is essential to opening a new chapter in Afghanistan's \n     troubled recent history.\n       Fourth, the U.S. should take the lead--but with the \n     smallest possible footprint--in solving the security problem \n     in Afghanistan. The ISAF should not be drawn into policing \n     Afghanistan. If its mission expands geographically, a larger \n     deployment--even one with as many as 20,000 additional \n     troops--would be spread so thinly as to be militarily \n     meaningless. The primary U.S. goal should be, rather, the \n     creation of professional, nonpolitical, and ethnically \n     balanced police and military services. This would require \n     playing an intrusive role in rebuilding Afghan security \n     services, similar to the one the U.S. played in El Salvador \n     in the 1980s. Qualified Afghan personnel are available, at \n     home and abroad, and many were not involved in factional \n     politics during the 1990s. Even before the defeat of the \n     Taliban, members of the Rome group had organized an \n     association of former officers of the Afghan armed forces \n     and police in anticipation of the need to rebuild the \n     government; the U.S. should use these professionals to \n     form core groups in each agency or service who would then \n     recruit and train their subordinates and line officers.\n       Because of its poverty, Afghanistan should have a military \n     limited to approximately 50,000 troops, though these forces \n     must have sufficient mobility to deploy rapidly anywhere in \n     the country. This limits the scope of the task of rebuilding \n     the armed forces, and the process could readily be completed \n     in two to three years. Only by creating such a professional \n     military force can the U.S. have a local ally sufficiently \n     able to hunt down remaining Taliban and al-Qaeda elements and \n     preclude their return after the U.S. moves on to other \n     theaters.\n       Fifth, the U.S. must be willing to fund the operations of \n     the Afghan government--and particularly its police and \n     military services--until its capacity to raise revenues has \n     been reestablished. Providing sufficient pay for troops is \n     crucial, because it enables the government to draw the best \n     personnel away from factional armies, such as those of the \n     Northern Alliance, and from regional warlords.\n       Together, these actions can, over time, secure a political \n     outcome commensurate with the victory won by American arms \n     last fall. But the adjustment in policy is badly needed. If \n     we stay on the present course, the most likely outcome is a \n     Northern Alliance-dominated government--a result that will \n     leave Islamists like Rabbani in power, extend Iranian and \n     Russian influence, and set the stage for renewed civil war \n     when Pakistan eventually reengages in Afghanistan's politics. \n     If the United States wisely recalibrates, it can establish a \n     moderate and pro-Western state in Afghanistan, an outcome \n     that will have a powerful and unmistakable demonstration \n     effect for those who seek positive political change in the \n     members of the Axis of Evil.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/15/senate-section/article/S4382-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Although my vote would not have affected the \noutcome, I would have voted to table the amendment. The language in the \nlegislation, which was also included in the Jordan Free Trade Agreement \nsinged into law on September 28, 2001, is vital to ensuring that \nCongress preserves its exclusive right to establish and enforce U.S. \nlabor and environmental standards.\n  During the vote I was attending a White House signing ceremony for \nH.R. 169, the Notification and Federal Employee Anti-discrimination and \nRetaliation Act, ``No FEAR'' Act. I was the sponsor of this legislation \nin the Senate, S. 201--the Federal Employee Protection Act.\n  The press has referred to the No FEAR Act as ``the first civil rights \nbill of the new century.'' It significantly strengthens existing laws \nprotecting Federal employees from discrimination, harassment, and \nretaliation for whistle blowing in the workplace. It is an unfortunate \nfact that too many federal employees are subjected to such treatment \nwith alarming regularity.\n  I am pleased that President Bush has signed this important \nlegislation and honored I was invited to the Oval Office for the \nsigning ceremony. No FEAR will promote a more productive work \nenvironment by ensuring agencies enforce the laws intended to protect \nFederal employees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/15/senate-section/article/S4382-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, today more than 15,000 peace officers \nare expected to gather in Washington, D.C. to join with and honor the \nfamilies of federal, state, and local officers who were killed in the \nline of duty.\n\n[[Page S4383]]\n\n  On March 17, I was joined by Senators Leahy, Hatch, Allard, Cantwell, \nGregg, Rockefeller, Bingaman, Biden, Bunning, Cochran, Allen, Thomas, \nand Hutchinson in introducing S. Res. 221, to keep alive in the memory \nof all Americans the sacrifice and commitment of those law enforcement \nofficers who lost their lives serving their communities. Specifically, \nthis resolution would designate May 15, 2002, as National Peace \nOfficers Memorial Day. These heroes have established for themselves an \nenviable and enduring reputation for preserving the rights and security \nof all citizens. This resolution is a fitting tribute for this special \nand solemn occasion.\n  As a former deputy sheriff, I know first-hand the risks which law \nenforcement officers face every day on the front lines protecting our \ncommunities. Currently, more than 700,000 men and women who serve this \nnation as our guardians of law and order do so at a great risk. Every \nyear, about 1 in 9 officers is assaulted, 1 in 25 officers is injured, \nand 1 in 4,400 officers is killed in the line of duty. There are few \ncommunities in this country that have not been impacted by the words \n``officer down.''\n  On September 11, 2001, 70 peace officers died at the World Trade \nCenter in New York City as a result of a cowardly act of terrorism. \nThis single act of terrorism resulted in the highest number of peace \nofficers ever killed in a single incident in the history of this \ncountry. Thirty-seven of those fallen heroes served with the Port \nAuthority of New York and New Jersey Police Department; twenty-three \nwere New York City police officers; three worked for the New York \nOffice of Court Administration; five were with the New York Office of \nTax Enforcement; one was an FBI special agent; and one was a master \nspecial officer with the U.S. Secret Service. Before this event, the \ngreatest loss of law enforcement life in a single incident occurred in \n1917, when nine Milwaukee police officers were killed in a bomb blast \nat their police station. Yet the incredible bravery and selfless \nsacrifice our officers displayed that day was no different that any \nother day of the year in communities across America.\n  In 2001, more than 230 federal, state and local law enforcement \nofficers gave their lives in the line of duty. This represents more \nthan a 57 percent increase in police fatalities over the previous year. \nAnd, in total, nearly 15,000 men and women have made the supreme \nsacrifice. We owe all of our police officers a huge debt of gratitude \nfor the invaluable work they do.\n  As we gather on this special day here in Washington, D.C. and \nnationwide to honor our fallen heroes, we must be ever vigilant and \nremember those outstanding men and women who continue to put their \nlives on the line so that we may continue to enjoy the freedom we have.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/15/senate-section/article/S4383-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNITION OF ALAN B.

Miller of Gladwyne, PA, \nwho on Sunday, May 19, 2002, will be honored with the George Washington \nUniversity's prestigious President's Medal.\n  This award, which has been bestowed upon such distinguished and \nvaried figures as Soviet statesman Mikhail Gorbachev, renowned \njournalist Walter Cronkite, and political humorist Mark Russell, will \nserve to recognize Alan's many achievements as a leader in the health \nservices industry.\n  In 1978, Alan founded Universal Health Services, Inc., based in King \nof Prussia, PA, which was then the third-largest proprietary hospital \nmanagement company in the Nation and now operates 100 facilities in 22 \nStates, plus the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and in France. He \ncurrently serves as the company's president and chairman.\n  Alan is an authority on hospital management and has served as health \ncare adviser to the Federal Mediation and Coalition Service. Among the \npioneering activities developed under his direction was the founding of \nan industry mutual insurance company that provided malpractice \ninsurance to over 200 hospitals at a substantial savings, thereby \nlowering health care costs.\n  He is a graduate of the College of William and Mary in Virginia and \nearned his M.B.A. at the Wharton School of the University of \nPennsylvania, where he now serves on its executive board. He also holds \nan honorary doctorate from the University of South Carolina and is the \nrecipient of the Federation of American Health Systems' Industry Award \nand the Anti-Defamation League's Americanism Award.

There are several areas scored in this \ncompetition including missile operations, satellite operations, remote \nspace tracking, security forces, helicopter operations, food services, \nmissile maintenance, communications, and missile codes.\n  The men and women who compete in Guardian Challenge are the best of \nthe best from their respective Air Force Bases. This year marks the \n35th anniversary of the competition, boasting some 200 participants. \nBesides the competition, Guardian Challenge helps sharpen the skills of \nand improve our military personnel's effectiveness and combat \ncapability, while showing the world that the United States is the \nworld's premier space force, second to none. The 341 Space Wing of \nMalmstrom AFB controls 200 Minuteman III missiles. This award is just \none of several that Team Malmstrom has won over the years. They are \ntruly the best of the best.\n  I am very proud of the men and women from Malmstrom AFB. As Operation \nEnduring Freedom continues, our military personnel are being tasked \nwith increased missions and more time spent away from their families to \nsupport the war on terrorism. As a former member of the U.S. Marine \nCorps, I understand and appreciate the sacrifices these people and \ntheir families make in the name of freedom.

Mr. President, there are areas of the California \ndesert near the Salton Sea that can best be described as dry, desolate \nand forlorn. Indeed, there are those who describe the area around \nNiland off Highway 111 as godforsaken. But rising out of this sere, \nsuper-heated desert is the multi-colored and textured Salvation \nMountain, a unique and visionary sculpture encompassing five acres. \nSalvation Mountain is Leonard Knight's personal statement on the love \nand the glory of God.\n  Leonard Knight, a one-time snow shoveler from Vermont, came to \nSalvation Mountain from the sky. His hot-air balloon crashed into the \nsite and he decided to stay, believing the experience to be a sign from \nGod. Here he produces his unique creation, using adobe, straw, and \nthousands of gallons of paint to color and reshape the desert \nlandscape. Seen from afar, Salvation Mountain is an unlikely mass of \ntechnicolor shapes and textures. Up close, it is an iridescent fusion \nof doves, clouds, flags, flowers, hearts, streams, biblical messages \nand countless other images.\n\n[[Page S4384]]\n\n  In the last 16 years, Knight's creation has been visited by thousands \nof people from all over the world, artists and art lovers, journalists, \nstudents on field trips, retirees, newlyweds and just plain curious \npeople come by the mountain each day. The Folk Art Society of America \nhas declared Salvation Mountain a national folk art shrine. The \nAmerican Visionary Art Museum has embraced Leonard Knight and his \nmountain monument.\n  Salvation Mountain is the product of the vision and non-stop labor of \none dedicated man. Leonard lives alone at the base of the mountain, \nsleeping in a converted school bus that is as colorful as his desert \ncreation. He uses paint constantly supplied by visitors, local \nresidents and others willing to be a part of this stunning work-in-\nprogress. He figures that he has used close to 60,000 gallons of \ndonated paint over the years.\n  American folk art is found in all corners of our nation. Perhaps one \nof the least likely locations would be the desert where Salvation \nMountain is found. Leonard Knight's artwork is a national treasure, a \nsingular sculpture wrought from the desert by a modest, single-minded \nman. It is a sculpture for the ages--profoundly strange and beautifully \naccessible, and worthy of the international acclaim it \nreceives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/15/senate-section/article/S4384-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING KENTUCKY REFUGEE MINISTRIES\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to honor the 23 \nmembers of Kentucky Refugees Ministries, Inc. (KRM) for all they have \ndone to bring and welcome refugees to Kentucky.\n  Kentucky Refugee Ministries, Inc. is the refugee resettlement office \nin the Commonwealth of Kentucky for two national church-based programs: \nChurch World Service and The Episcopal Migration Ministries. This \ngroup, which has offices in both Louisville and Lexington, is \nauthorized by the U.S. Department of State to assist refugees legally \nadmitted to the United States as victims of warfare, or other forms of \npersecution related to their religious or political beliefs. Since \ntheir inception in 1990, KRM has placed over 3,000 refugees \nrepresenting 25 different nationalities and ethnic groups, in various \ncommunities throughout the Commonwealth. Once the refugees have been \nadmitted, KRM provides them with housing, furnishings, food, and \nclothing. They also offer educational opportunities such as English and \ncultural orientation classes in order to help refugees adapt to their \nnew life. In virtually every instance, these individuals have become \nproductive and active citizens, willing to work their way up from the \nbottom in an effort to live the American dream.\n  One fact we as Americans must never forget is that our forefathers \nwere also political and religious refugees in search of a better life. \nThe system they established was specifically set up so people could \nlive their lives without fear of endless persecution. Late last year, \nPresident Bush signed the Presidential Determination authorizing the \nUnited States to admit 70,000 refugees in 2002. I applaud President \nBush's efforts concerning refugees. Only 8,100 refugees, a quarter of \nthe number admitted at the same time last year, have so far been \nadmitted. This slowdown in admittance has obviously occurred because of \nsecurity matters resulting from the September 11 tragedies. However, I \nhope that soon we can begin expediting refugee admittance again after \nwe put the proper security and safety procedures in place. The \nprinciples of freedom and democracy our nation lives by must serve as \nour guide in this extremely important matter. If we let these \nindividuals languish in deplorable conditions in refugee camps or \nhostile lands, we will be turning our backs on the principles we so \ncherish. We cannot let this happen.\n  Once again, I ask that my colleagues join me in thanking and honoring \nKRM. I am grateful to know that Kentucky's adopted refugees and their \nfamilies are being looked after in such a careful and caring \nmanner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/15/senate-section/article/S4384-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4384]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       IN RECOGNITION OF MICHIGAN STATE UNIVERSITY'S DEBATE TEAM\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join me in \ncongratulating Michigan State University's Debate Team. These bright \nyoung men and women recently won this year's Cross Examination Debate \nAssociation Seasonal National Championship--the most prestigious \nnational college debating title.\n  As I am sure many of my colleagues in this room can appreciate, \ndebating is a skill that requires enormous preparation, great \nintelligence and the ability to think and speak quickly. Michigan State \nUniversity's Debate Team has repeatedly excelled in these areas, \nestablishing itself as one of the finest debate teams in the nation. In \nfact, since 1994 the team has finished no worse than fifth in the \ncompetition, and it recorded another first place finish in 1996. This \nis a spectacular record of achievement that is the source of great \npride for the University and for the State of Michigan.\n  We often come to this floor to congratulate the hard work and \ndedication of the student athletes from our states who have won \nnational championships on the basketball court or the football field, \nwhose competitions are shown on television and whose victories are \nwritten about in newspapers. However, the young men and women who \ncompete with their quick minds and sharp wit deserve just as much of an \naccolade as those who compete with quick legs or strong arms. The \ndebate season lasts virtually the entire academic year. From August to \nApril the team spends countless hours every week studying, analyzing, \nresearching and practicing. The commitment that these young people have \nshown to competition is unrivaled.\n  Director of Debate Jason Trice, Head Coach William Repko and \nAssistant Coaches Alison Woidan and Michael Eber did an excellent job \nof preparing this year's team. The full roster of that team is Anjali \nVats, Geoff Lundeen, Maggie Ryan, Job Gillenwater, John Rood, Austin \nCarson, Calum Matheson, Greta Stahl, Suzanne Sobotka, John Groen, Gabe \nMurillo, Amber Watkins, Aaron Hardy and David Strauss. I can think of \nno better place for these young men and women to be congratulated than \nin the Congressional Record of the U.S. Senate, an institution known \nfor its history of great debaters.\n  I know that all these individuals, as well as their families and \nfriends, are incredibly proud of their accomplishments. I also know \nthat Michigan State University is thrilled to have this honor. In \naddition to adding my own congratulations I would also like to wish \nthese young men and women the best of luck in defending their \nchampionship next year and extending the proud record of accomplishment \nfor which this team has come to be known. I know that my Senate \ncolleagues join me in congratulating Michigan State University's Debate \nTeam for their victory as National Champions of the Cross Examination \nDebate Association.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/15/senate-section/article/S4384-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4384-S4385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING LTG THOMAS J. KECK\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a member of \nour military who has faithfully served the United States for over 30 \nyears. LTG Thomas J. Keck is to retire this Friday and I think it is \nappropriate that we honor him here on the Senate floor today.\n  Lieutenant General Keck graduated from the Air Force Academy in 1969. \nAfter completing flight training, he was sent to Vietnam. While there, \nhe flew B-52 missions over North Vietnam, and distinguished himself in \ncombat numerous times. In recognition of his gallantry, Lieutenant \nGeneral Keck was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Air \nMedal. The bravery he displayed in Vietnam is demonstrative of the \ncharacteristics that define the Air Force Officer's Core Values: \nIntegrity first, Service Before Self, Excellence in all that is done. \nHe has certainly displayed these values throughout his career.\n  After the War, Lieutenant General Keck came back to the U.S., and \nserved in a variety of commands in the Air Force. Throughout his \ncareer, Lieutenant General Keck has flown twenty-two different planes \nin several different missions. He logged over 4,600 flying hours, 886 \nof which were in combat. He has certainly shown himself to be an able \nand adaptable pilot, perhaps one of the finest that the Air Force has \nproduced.\n\n[[Page S4385]]\n\n  Lieutenant General Keck served in many places throughout the U.S. and \nabroad, including California, Arizona, Nebraska, Guam, Alabama, and \nPanama. I think it is also appropriate to recognize his family on this \noccasion as well, as they have supported him throughout many years and \nmany moves.\n  Lieutenant General Keck leaves the military as the Commander of the \nEighth Air Force. The Eighth Air Force, or ``Mighty Eighth'' as it is \nknown, consists of nine wings and two groups--nearly 500 aircraft, more \nthan 53,000 active duty and civilian personnel, and 80 major \ninstallations world wide. The Mighty Eighth is headquartered at \nBarksdale Air Force Base in Northwest Louisiana. I am extremely proud \nto have my state host this exemplary unit. The relationship between the \npeople of Northwest Louisiana and the community on base is excellent, \nand Lieutenant General Keck has only made that relationship better.\n  On September 11th, Air Force One landed at Barksdale while it was on \nits way back to Washington. Lieutenant General Keck and Briadier \nGeneral Bedke played host to President Bush. Less than a month later, \nnumerous units from the Mighty Eighth would be deployed across the \nglobe, defending America from the menace of terrorism. As Lieutenant \nGeneral Keck leaves the service, we are a nation at war, but our Air \nForce is no doubt stronger as a result of Lieutenant General Keck's \nleadership. In the years to come, the Eighth Air Force will undertake \nmany more missions in Operation Enduring Freedom, and there is no doubt \nin my mind that they will be successful.\n  In closing, I would like to thank Lieutenant General Keck for his \nyears of dedicated service to our country. I would also like to thank \nhis family for the support they have provided over all of these years. \nI wish him well in the future and success in all of his \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/15/senate-section/article/S4385-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ON THE AGUA CALIENTE CULTURAL MUSEUM\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce that, \nafter several years of preparation, the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla \nIndians is ready to construct a major cultural museum. The Agua \nCaliente Cultural Museum will be built at the Indian Canyons near Palm \nSprings, California.\n  The Agua Caliente Cultural Museum will pay tribute to the Agua \nCaliente Band's rich heritage and at the same time educate the \ncommunity and visitors about the tribe's history of tribulation and \ntriumph. This museum will truly be a bridge to the tribe's past and a \nplatform for celebrating its future and potential.\n  A greatly expanded facility from the temporary museum built in 1995, \nthis new 100,000 square-foot museum will house an auditorium, provide \nspace for traveling exhibits, and allow for the expansion of the \ncurrent museum's education programs in language, singing and crafts. \nVisitors to the museum will learn about the tribe's history through \nexhibits of photographs, videotaped testimonies and other historical \nartifacts. The facility will also feature exhibits on current issues \nlike land and water rights, as well as sovereignty issues.\n  When completed, the cultural museum will be a fitting tribute to the \nAgua Caliente Band, its proud traditions and history. The tribe, part \nof the Cahuilla Nation, survived the arrival of the Spanish in 1776, \nand through the centuries has become a strong and enduring people \ndespite many challenges. The tribe is an important economic force in \nSouthern California, has endowed an extremely generous and ambitious \nphilanthropic program, and is a visionary steward of the land. This \nmuseum will ensure that the great heritage and spirit of the Agua \nCaliente Band of Cahuilla Indians are never forgotten and are \naccessible to all.\n  I commend all those who have made the dream of an Agua Caliente \nCultural Musuem a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/15/senate-section/article/S4385-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             IN RECOGNITION OF PASTOR ALVIN M. STOKES, SR.\n\n Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nefforts of Pastor Alvin Stokes, Sr. of Trinity A.M.E. Church and \ncongratulate him on his forthcoming retirement.\n  Pastor Stokes has served as a positive and energetic force within the \nNew Jersey communities he has served. In his efforts as a member of the \nclergy, he organized the United Black Clergy Association of Bridgeton \nand aided in obtaining plans to build the new Grant A.M.E. Church. \nPerhaps his most important work, however, has been through his ministry \nto his parishioners at Trinity A.M.E. Church, where he has been pastor \nsince 1979.\n  While Pastor Stokes has a strong presence outside of his ministry, \nsome of his greatest efforts have been on behalf of the schoolchildren \nof New Jersey. During his time in Chesilhurst, he served on the School \nboard and organized efforts that led to the construction of the \ncommunity's first elementary school. He has also served on the New \nJersey Federation of District School Boards, a county Task Force for \nschool dropouts and teen pregnancy, and the Fairfield Township's School \nCrisis Committee.\n  I would like to express my sincere gratitude for the efforts of \nPastor Stokes to improve the lives of those around him. The people of \nNew Jersey are truly grateful for his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/15/senate-section/article/S4385-3", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/15/senate-section/article/S4385-4", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/15/senate-section/article/S4385-5", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:48 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1370.

A bill to prevent trafficking in child pornography and \nobscenity, to proscribe pandering and solicitation relating to visual \ndepictions of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct, to prevent \nthe use of child pornography and obscenity to facilitate crimes against \nchildren, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. CARNAHAN. Mr. President, child pornography is an affront to the \ninherent decency of our society. Creating and distributing this \nrevolting material causes severe damage to the children involved. Those \nwho purchase this material also harm children by creating a demand for \nproduction of more child pornography, leading to a greater number of \nvictimized children.\n  Congress has enacted strong criminal laws outlawing the production, \ndistribution, and possession of child pornography. But the advent of \nthe internet and advances in imaging technology have made enforcing \nthese laws more difficult. The problem is twofold. First, child \npornography can now be created using digital technology such that the \nsubjects of the images are virtual, not real, children. Second, child \npornographers facing criminal prosecution now claim that the materials \nat issue contain computer-generated, virtual image, and claim that such \nimages are constitutionally protected free speech. The technology is \nnow so advanced that it is difficult for expert witnesses to determine \nwhether the pornographers' claims are true, giving real pornographers \nthe ability to escape prosecution.\n  Congress attempted to address this problem in 1996 by expanding the \nscope of federal child pornography statutes to cover sexually explicit \nimages that appear to depict children, but were created without using \nactual children. Unfortunately, last month the Supreme Court determined \nthat parts of the statute were unconstitutional. The Court concluded \nthat the law was drafted too broadly and covered speech that is \nprotected by the First Amendment. Unless Congress takes further action, \nfuture prosecutions of child pornographers will be in jeopardy. \nAccording to Associate Deputy Attorney General Daniel Collins, if \nprosecutors can only obtain convictions when the have affirmative proof \nthat actual children were used, the ``[g]overnment may be able to \nprosecute effectively only in very limited cases, such as those in \nwhich it happens to be able to match the depictions to pictures in \npornographic magazines produced before the development of computer \nimaging software.''\n  The legislation I am introducing today, along with my colleague \nSenator Hutchison, will cure this problem. It is companion legislation \nto H.R. 4623 and contains the Justice Department's recommendations on \nhow to draft a constitutional statute that will facilitate prosecution \nof child pornographers. The legislation strikes a balance between the \ngovernment's compelling interest in protecting children while not \ninfringing on First Amendment rights.\n  The bill has a number of features. First, it narrows the definition \nof virtual child pornography and includes an affirmative defense that \nplaces the burden of proof on defendants to establish that the \nmaterials at issue were created without using real children. Second, it \nprohibits all real or virtual child pornography that depicts preteens. \nThese sexually explicit materials involving young children are obscene \nand, in my view, do not enjoy any first amendment protection. The bill \nalso creates new ways to crack down on pedophiles by outlawing showing \npornography to children. It also encourages greater voluntary reporting \nof suspected child pornography found by internet service providers on \ntheir systems.\n  This legislation is progressing quickly through the House of \nRepresentatives. I hope that we can move expeditiously in this body as \nwell to give the Justice Department the tools it needs to continue its \ncampaign against the exploitation and degradation of children.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nMissouri to introduce the Child Obscenity and Pornography Prevention \nAct of 2002. The passage of this legislation is urgently needed to stop \nthe marketing of child pornography and its destructive impact on our \nsociety.\n  This bill is similar to the House version, which has the strong \nsupport of the Department of Justice. Attorney General Ashcroft has \nasked for this legislation so that he will have the tools to prosecute \nchild pornographers. In this Internet age, it is becoming more \ndifficult to ascertain whether child pornography is produced by \nexploiting real minors or whether it is made with computer imagery. I \nunderstand the Supreme Court's concerns about First Amendment rights. \nThe bill we are introducing today does not violate the First Amendment.\n  Our bill goes after the marketing of child pornography, regardless of \nwhether it is produced using a real minor. Legal precedent is clear \nthat Congress may outlaw the solicitation and attempt to commit a \ncrime, even if the core crime does not transpire. I have been a strong \nadvocate against marketing violence to children, and similarly, I am \nstrongly against the marketing of child pornography. The bottom line is \nthat sexual images of children, even if produced by computer-imagery, \nonly increase the chances of sexual crimes occurring against our \nchildren.\n  In addition, our bill outlaws the production of ``obscene'' child \npornography, regardless of whether a real child or a computer-image is \nused. The Supreme Court has been clear that obscenity deserves no \nprotection under\n\n[[Page S4390]]\n\nthe first amendment, much less obscenity related to child pornography. \nWithout a new law, the Supreme Court's ruling several weeks ago could \nmean a pornographer might use the defense that the child pornography \ndoes not involve a real minor and thus constitutes protected speech. \nThat is a terrible outcome and we must remedy it.\n  I am pleased to be cosponsor of this important legislation, and I \nurge the Senate to address this issue expeditiously.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \n        Cochran, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Helms, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        Reid, Mr. Smith of Oregon, and Mr. Wellstone):\n  S. 2512. A bill to provide grants for training court reporters and \nclosed captioners to meet requirements for realtime writers under the \nTelecommunications Act of 1996, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, the \nTraining for Realtime Writers Act of 2002, on behalf of myself and my \ncolleagues, Senators Grassley, Bingaman, Cochran, Dodd, Helms, Kerry, \nRockefeller, Reid, Gordon Smith, and Wellstone. The 1996 Telecom Act \nrequired that all television broadcasts were to be captioned by 2006. \nThis was a much needed reform that is helping millions of deaf and \nhard-of-hearing Americans to be able to take full advantage of \ntelevision programming. As of today, it is estimated that 3,000 \ncaptioners will be needed to fulfill this requirement, and that number \ncontinues to increase as more and more broadband stations come online. \nUnfortunately, the United States only has 300 captioners. If our \ncountry expects to have media fully captioned by 2006, something must \nbe done.\n  This is an issue that I feel very strongly about because my late \nbrother, Frank, was deaf. I know personally that access to culture, \nnews, and other media was important to him and to others in achieving a \nbetter quality of life. More than 28 million Americans, or 8 percent of \nthe population, are considered deaf or hard of hearing and many require \ncaptioning services to participate in mainstream activities. In 1990, I \nauthored legislation that required all television sets to be equipped \nwith a computer chip to decode closed captioning. This bill completes \nthe promise of that technology, affording deaf and hard of hearing \nAmericans the same equality and access that captioning provides.\n  Though we don't necessarily think about it, on the morning of \nSeptember 11, Holli Miller of Ankeny, Iowa was captioning for Fox News. \nShe was supposed to do her three and a half hour shift ending at 7 a.m. \nbut as we all know, tragedy struck. Despite the fact that she had \nalready worked most of her shift and had two small children to care \nfor, Holli Miller stayed right where she was and for nearly five more \nhours, she captioned. Without even the ability to take bathroom breaks, \nHolli Miller made sure that deaf and hard of hearing people got the \nsame news the rest of us got on September 11. I want to say thank you \nto Holli Miller and all the many captioners and other people across \nAmerica that made sure the country was alert and informed on that sad \nday.\n  But let me emphasize that the deaf and hard of hearing population is \nonly one of a number of groups that will benefit from this legislation. \nThe audience for captioning also includes individuals seeking to \nacquire or improve literacy skills, including approximately 27 million \nfunctionally illiterate adults, 3 or 4 million immigrants learning \nEnglish as a second language, and 18 million children learning to read \nin grades kindergarten through 3. In addition, I see people using \nclosed captioning to stay informed everywhere, from the gym to the \nairport. Captioning helps people educate themselves and helps all of us \nstay informed and entertained when audio isn't the most appropriate \nmedium.\n  Although we have a few years to go until the deadline given by the \n1996 Telecom Act, our Nation is facing a serious shortage of \ncaptioners. Over the past five years, student enrollment in programs \nthat train court reporters to become realtime writers has decreased \nsignificantly, causing such programs to close on many campuses. Yet the \nneed for these skills keeps rising. That is why my colleagues and I are \nintroducing this vital piece of legislation. The Training for Realtime \nWriters Act of 2002 would establish competitive grants to be used \ntoward training real time captioners. This is necessary to ensure that \nwe meet our goal set by the 1996 Telecom Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to review this legislation and I hope they will \njoin us in support and join us in our effort to win its passage. I ask \nunanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2512\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Training for Realtime \n     Writers Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) As directed by Congress in section 723 of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 613), as added by \n     section 305 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Public Law \n     104-104; 110 Stat. 126), the Federal Communications \n     Commission adopted rules requiring closed captioning of most \n     television programming, which gradually require new video \n     programming to be fully captioned beginning in 2006.\n       (2) More than 28,000,000 Americans, or 8 percent of the \n     population, are considered deaf or hard of hearing and many \n     require captioning services to participate in mainstream \n     activities.\n       (3) More than 24,000 children are born in the United States \n     each year with some form of hearing loss.\n       (4) According to the United States Department of Health and \n     Human Services and a study done by the National Council on \n     Aging--\n       (A) 25 percent of Americans over 65 years old are hearing \n     impaired;\n       (B) 33 percent of Americans over 70 years old are hearing \n     impaired; and\n       (C) 41 percent of Americans over 75 years old are hearing \n     impaired.\n       (5) The National Council on Aging study also found that \n     depression in older adults may be directly related to hearing \n     loss and disconnection with the spoken word.\n       (6) Over the past 5 years, student enrollment in programs \n     that train court reporters to become realtime writers has \n     decreased significantly, causing such programs to close on \n     many campuses.\n\n     SEC. 3.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     Act, amounts as follows:\n       (1) $15,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2003, 2004, and \n     2005.\n       (2) Such sums as may be necessary for each of fiscal years \n     2006 and 2007.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nIowa, Senator Harkin, in introducing legislation to provide grants for \nthe training of realtime reporters and captioners. Many Senators may \nnot be aware of a looming problem related to a shortage of what are \ncalled ``realtime writers.'' Realtime writers are essentially trained \ncourt reporters, much like the official reporters of debates here in \nthe Senate, who use a combination of additional specialized training \nand technology to transform words into text as they are spoken. This \ncan allow deaf and hard of hearing individuals to understand live \ntelevision as well as follow proceedings at a civic function or in a \nclassroom.\n  In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress mandated that most \ntelevision programming be fully captioned by 2006 in order to allow the \n28 million Americans who are deaf or hard of hearing to have access to \nthe same news and information that many of us take for granted. I know \nthat most of us were glued to the television on and after September 11 \nin order to absorb every scrap of information we could about the events \nthat took place. In order for those who are deaf and hard of hearing to \nreceive the same information as it is broadcast on live television, \ngroups of captioners must work around the clock transcribing words as \nthey are spoken.\n  As of this year, 2002, the required number of hours of captioned \nprogramming that must be provided by video-programming distributors \nincreased from 450 to 900. In 2004, this will increase to 1350 hours. \nBy 2006, 100 percent of new nonexempt programming must be provided with \ncaptions. At the same time, student enrollment in programs that provide \nessential training in captioning has decreased significantly, with \nprograms closing on many campuses. In order to meet the growing demand \nfor realtime writers caused by this mandate, we must do everything we \ncan to increase the number of individuals receiving this very \nspecialized training.\n  The legislation that Senator Harkin and I are introducing, along with \na number of other senators, will help address the shortage of \nindividuals trained as realtime writers by providing grants to up to 20 \ncourt reporting programs to promote the training and placement of \nindividuals as realtime writers. Specifically, court reporting programs \ncould use these grants for items like recruitment of students for \nrealtime writing programs, need-based scholarships, distance learning, \neducation and training, job placement assistance, the encouragement of \nindividuals with disabilities to pursue a career as a realtime writer, \nand personnel costs.\n  The expansion of distance learning opportunities in particular will \nhave an enormous impact by making training accessible to individuals \nwho want to become realtime writers but do not live in metropolitan \nareas. Also, need based scholarships offered using these grant funds \nwould be subject to an agreement with the National Telecommunications \nand Information Administration to provide realtime writing services for \na period of time.\n  Unless we act now, the shortage of individuals trained as realtime \nwriters will only grow more severe. This would leave the 28 million \ndeaf or hard of hearing Americans without the ability to fully \nparticipate in many of the professional, educational, and civic \nactivities that other Americans enjoy. I would therefore urge my fellow \nSenators to support the swift passage of this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/15/senate-section/article/S4391-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4391-S4404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS--MAY 15, 2002\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Sessions, Mr. \n        Hutchinson, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Edwards, and Mr. DeWine):\n  S. 2520. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, with respect \nto the sexual exploitation of children; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, every decent American joins with me in \nseeking to rid our country of child pornography. Unfortunately, the \ngrowth of technology and the rise of the internet have flooded our \nnation with it. Child pornography is inherently repulsive, but even \nmore damaging are the purposes for which it routinely is used. Perverts \nand pedophiles not only use child pornography to whet their sick \ndesires, but also to lure our defenseless children into unspeakable \nacts of sexual exploitation.\n  There is no place for child pornography even in our free society. Mr. \nPresident, I have long championed legislation designed to punish those \nwho produce, peddle or possess this reprehensible material. As I stated \nin introducing the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (``CPPA''), \nwe have both the constitutional right and moral obligation to protect \nour children from the horrors of child pornography.\n\n[[Page S4392]]\n\n  I remain fully committed to these principles today. We were \ndisappointed some weeks ago, when a majority of the Supreme Court \nstruck down some key provisions of the CPPA under the first amendment. \nWhile I firmly respect the Supreme Court's role in interpreting the \nConstitution, the decision left some gaping holes in our nation's \nability to prosecute child pornography effectively. We must now act \nquickly to repair our child pornography laws to provide for effective \nlaw enforcement in a manner that accords with the Court's ruling.\n  Mr. President, the legislation I introduce today strikes a necessary \nbalance between the first amendment and our nation's critically \nimportant interest in protecting children. This Act does many things to \naid the prosecution of child pornography, and I highlight some of its \nmost significant provisions here.\n  First, the act plugs the loophole that exists today where child \npornographers can escape prosecution by claiming that their sexually \nexplicit material did not actually involve real children. Technology \nhas advanced so far that even experts often cannot say with absolute \ncertainty that an image is real or a ``virtual'' computer creation. If \nour criminal laws fail to take account of such advances in technology, \nthey become completely worthless. For this reason, the act permits a \nprosecution to proceed when the child pornography includes persons who \nappear virtually indistinguishable from actual minors. And even when \nthis occurs, the accused is afforded a complete affirmative defense by \nshowing that the child pornography did not involve a minor.\n  Second, the act prohibits the pandering or solicitation of anything \nrepresented to be obscene child pornography. The Supreme Court has \nruled that this type of conduct does not constitute protected speech. \nCongress, moreover, should severely punish those who would try to \nprofit or satisfy their depraved desires by dealing in such filth.\n  Third, the act prohibits any depictions of minors, or apparent \nminors, in actual--not simulated--acts of bestiality, sadistic or \nmasochistic abuse, or sexual intercourse, when such depictions lack \nliterary, artistic, political or scientific value. This type of \nhardcore sexually explicit material merits our highest form of disdain \nand disgust and is something that our society ought to try hard to \neradicate. Nor does the first amendment bar us from banning the \ndepictions of children actually engaging in the most explicit and \ndisturbing forms of sexual activity.\n  Fourth, the act beefs up existing record keeping requirements for \nthose who chose to produce sexually explicit materials. These record \nkeeping requirements are unobjectionable since they do not ban \nanything. Rather, the act simply requires such producers to keep \nrecords confirming that no actual minors were involved in the making of \nthe sexually explicit materials. In light of the difficulty experts \nface in determining an actor's true age and identity just by viewing \nthe material itself, increasing the criminal penalties for failing to \nmaintain these records are vital to ensuring that only adults appear in \nsuch productions.\n  Finally, the act creates a new civil action for those aggrieved by \nthe depraved acts of those who violate our child pornography laws. Mr. \nPresident, this is one area of the law where society as a whole can \nbenefit from more vigorous enforcement, both on the criminal and civil \nfronts.\n  Mr. President, we will not need to wait long before those who deal in \nchild pornography will take advantage of the Supreme Court's decision. \nCongress can and should act, promptly and decisively, to close any gaps \nin current law to protect our children from the immeasurable harms \nposed by child pornography.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to join with me in promptly passing \nthis important legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2520\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I join Senator Hatch in introducing \nthe PROTECT Act of 2002. This bill is intended to protect our Nation's \nchildren from exploitation and protect our constitution at the same \ntime.\n  In the Free Speech Coalition case, seven Justices of the Supreme \nCourt ruled that the definition of child pornography in the CPPA was \noverbroad and covered such non-obscene movies as Traffic, Romeo and \nJuliet, and American Beauty. No one intended that.\n  It also ruled that Congress could not broadly ban all ``virtual child \npornography,'' which may make prosecutors' jobs very tough in the \ninternet age.\n  The Court in Free Speech faced a difficult task--as do we here--\napplying the time honored principles of the first amendment to the \ncomputer age. I join Senator Hatch today in introducing a bill \ncarefully drawn to stick. As a former prosecutor, I am more interested \nin making real cases that protect children than making new first \namendment law. There are many people who do not agree with the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Free Speech, but that will not erase it from the \nbooks. Everyone wants to protect our children, but we need to do it \nwith cases and laws that don't get tossed out in court. It is tempting \nto rush to come up with a ``quick fix,'' but we owe our children more \nthan just a press conference on this matter. We owe them careful and \nthoughtful action.\n  My initial review of the administration's proposal, now working its \nway through the House, gives me serious concern. Already I have a \nletter from six constitutional experts--prominent practitioners and law \nprofessors alike--that expresses ``grave concern'' about the Department \nof Justice's proposal from a first amendment perspective. I will put \nthat statement in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  Indeed, the entire approach that the administration has taken in this \nmatter is to reach as far as possible, not to hedge its bets, and \nsimply to throw\n\n[[Page S4394]]\n\ndown the gauntlet on the steps of the Supreme Court, daring it to \nstrike down the law yet again. That will help no one. In contrast, the \nbipartisan bill we introduce today is not an attempt to ``get around'' \nthe Supreme Court's decision, or to ignore that decision.\n  Instead, Senator Hatch and I have together to craft a bill that \nattempts to work within the limits set by the Supreme Court. At the \nsame time, the bill contains tough enforcement tools which are not in \nthe administration's bill. For instance, it creates a new crime aimed \nat people who actually use child pornography, whether real or virtual, \nto entice children to do illegal acts. This crime carries a tough 15-\nyear maximum prison sentence for a first offense. Second, the bill \nrequires the U.S. Sentencing Commission to address a disturbing \ndisparity in the current Sentencing Guidelines.\n  The current sentences for a person who actually travels across state \nlines to have sex with a child are not as high as for producing child \npornography. The Commission needs to correct this disparity \nimmediately, so that prosecutors are able to deal just as effectively \nwith dangerous sexual predators off the street as with child \npornographers.\n  Third, this bill has several provisions designed to protect the \nchildren so that they are not victimized again in the criminal process. \nThis bill provides for the first time ever a ``shield law'' that \nprohibits the name or other identifying information of the child victim \nfrom being admitted at any child pornography trial.\n  Next, this bill also provides a new private right of action for the \nvictims of child pornography. This provision has teeth, including \npunitive damages that will put those who produce child pornography out \nof business. I commend Senator Hatch for including this provision. None \nof these new prosecutorial tools presents first amendment issues. They \nare not going to result in Supreme Court arguments--all they will do is \nget bad guys in jail and protect children. Other parts of the bill are \ncloser to the first amendment line, and I expect that the debate on the \nconstitutional issues raised by this bill will be vigorous. That being \nsaid, this bill reflects a good faith attempt to protect children to \nthe greatest extent possible while not crossing that line.\n  I look forward to the debate on these issues, and I do not pretend \nthat I or any of us here have a monopoly on wisdom when it comes to \nsuch important constitutional questions. For all of these reasons, I am \npleased to introduce this legislation with Senator Hatch.\n  To reiterate, this bill is intended to protect our nation's children \nfrom exploitation by those who produce and distribute child \npornography, within the parameters of the first amendment. Just last \nmonth, the Supreme Court in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 122 S. \nCt. 1389 (April 16, 2002) (``Free Speech''), struck down portions of \nthe 1996 Child Pornography Protection Act (``CPPA'') as being in \nviolation of the first amendment. I voted for that act when it became \nlaw in 1996, and I join Senator Hatch today in introducing a bill \ncarefully drawn to square with the Supreme Court's decision and protect \nour children with a law that when used by prosecutors, will produce \nconvictions that will stick. While that task is not an easy one, \nSenator Hatch and I are working together to do all we can to protect \nour children and protect our Constitution at the same time.\n  In Free Speech, the Supreme Court voided two provisions of the CPPA \nas being overbroad and imposing substantial restrictions on protected \nspeech. The specific provisions struck down in that case targeted No. 1 \nvirtual child pornography--that is, child porn made not using real \nchildren but with computer images or adults and No. 2 material which is \n``pandered'' as child pornography (though the material may not in fact \nbe as advertised). In a complex and divided opinion, seven Justices \nruled that some part of the CPPA was unconstitutional as currently \ndrafted. Only Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia, in dissent, \nwould have upheld the CPPA in its entirety and only by reading the \nstatute more narrowly than it appears on its face.\n  The Court in Free Speech faced a difficult task--applying the time \nhonored principles of the first amendment to the computer age. The \nInternet provides many opportunities for doing good, but also for doing \nharm. Over the past few years, the Congress has paid a lot of attention \nto how the Internet is being used to purvey child pornography \nmanufactured through the sexual abuse of children, and has not always \nbeen successful in crafting legislation to address this problem that \npasses constitutional muster. Past efforts, such as the Communications \nDecency Act, the CPPA and the Child Online Protection Act have all had \ndifficulty overcoming constitutional challenges.\n  The majority opinion in Free Speech is grounded on two basic \npremises. First, the Court ruled that the definition of child \npornography in the CPPA was overbroad and covered a substantial amount \nof material that was not ``obscene'' under the Supreme Court's \ntraditional obscenity test. The Supreme Court's Miller test provides \nthat only ``obscene'' pornographic images can be prohibited without \nviolating the first amendment. See Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 \n(1973). Under the Miller test, the material must be viewed as a whole, \nand not judged by any single scene so that material with serious \nliterary, artistic, or scientific value cannot be banned in a blanket \nmanner. Thus, the Court ruled in the Free Speech case that the CPPA \nwent well beyond Miller and covered such non-obscene movies as Traffic, \nRomeo and Juliet, and American Beauty.\n\n  Second, the Court ruled that the CPPA could not be saved by the so-\ncalled ``child pornography doctrine,'' which excludes yet another class \nof speech from first amendment protection. Because the CPPA covers a \nbroad array of pornographic material that only ``appears to be'' of \nchildren, such as computer images or youthful adults, the Court ruled \nthat such material could not be banned and criminalized under the child \nporn doctrine first articulated in New York v. Feber, 458 U.S. 747 \n(1982) (``Ferber''). The Court ruled that the Ferber doctrine was \njustified based on the harm to real children, and that ``virtual \nporn,'' or material that ``appeared to be'' child pornography under the \nCPPA was not sufficiently lined to real child abuse to justify the \nCPPA's complete ban on it. In reaching this decision the Court \nconsidered and rejected some of the government's forceful arguments \nregarding the harmful secondary effects of even virtual child \npornography, finding them insufficient under the first amendment to \njustify a comprehensive ban. Since certain provisions of the CPPA were \noverboard and covered such ``protected'' speech, however offensive, the \nCourt struck those provisions down. The Court also struck down the \nCPPA's definition of ``pandered'' child pornography as overbroad, \nfinding that it criminalized possession of non-obscene material not \njust by the so-called ``panderer,'' but by downstream possessors who \nmight not have any knowledge as to how it was originally sold or \nmarketed.\n  The Free Speech decision has placed prosecutors in a difficult \nposition. With key portions of the CPPA gone, the decision invites all \nchild porn defendants, even those who exploit real children, to assert \na ``virtual porn'' defense in which they claim that the material at \nissue is not illegal because no real child was used in its creation. \nthe increasing technological ability to create computer images closely \nresembling real children may make it difficult for prosecutors to \nobtain prompt guilty pleas in clear-cut child porn cases and even to \ndefeat such a defense at trial, even in cases where real children were \nvictimized in producing the sexually explicit material. In short, \nunless we attempt to rewrite portions of the CPPA, the future bodes \npoorly for the ability of the federal government to combat a wave of \nchild pornography made ever more accessible over the Internet.\n  The bill we introduce today is not an attempt to ``get around'' the \nSupreme court's decision, or to ignore that decision, as do sizable \nportions of the administration's bill, which has been introduced in the \nHouse of Representatives. Ignoring the law will simply land America's \nchildren right back where they started--unprotected.\n  Instead, Senator Hatch and I have together crafted a bipartisan bill \nthat works within the limits set by the Supreme court. I expect that \nthe debate on the complicated constitutional issues raised by this bill \nwill be vigorous, and I appreciate that they may\n\n[[Page S4395]]\n\nbe isolated provisions of the bill that some may think crosses the \nfirst amendment line drawn by the court in the Free Speech case. That \nbeing said, this bill reflects a good faith attempt to protect children \nto the greatest extent possible by going up to that line, but not \ncrossing it. I look forward to the debate on these issues as the \nlegislative process moves forward, and I do not pretend that I or any \nMember of this body has a monopoly on wisdom when it comes to such \nimportant and complex constitutional questions. Let me summarize some \nof the bill's provisions.\n\n  Section 2 of the bill creates two new crimes aimed at people who \ndistribute child pornography and those who use such material to entice \nchildren to do illegal acts. Each of these new crimes carry a 15-year \nmaximum prison sentence for a first offense and double that term for \nrepeat offenders. First, the bill criminalizes the pandering of child \npornography, creating a new crime to respond to the Supreme Court's \nrecent ruling striking down the CPPA's definition of pandering. This \nprovision is narrower than the old ``pandering'' definition for two \nreasons, both of which respond to specific Court criticisms: First, the \nnew crime only applies to the people who actually pander the child \npornography or solicit it, not to all those who possess the material \n``downstream.'' The bill also contains a directive to the Sentencing \nCommission which asks them to distinguish between those who pander or \ndistribute such material who are more culpable than those who solicit \nthe material. Second, the pandering in this provision must be linked to \n``obscene'' material, which is totally unprotected speech under Miller. \nThus, while I acknowledge that this provision may well be challenged on \nsome of the same grounds as the prior CPPA provision, it responds to \nspecific concerns raised by the Supreme Court and is significantly \nnarrower than the CPPA's definition of pandering.\n  Second, the bill creates a new crime to take direct aim at one of the \nchief evils of child pornography: namely, its use by sexual predators \nto entice minors either to engage in sexual activity or the production \nof more child pornography. This was one of the compelling arguments \nmade by the government before the Supreme Court in support of the CPPA, \nbut the Court rejected that argument as an insufficient basis to ban \nthe production, distribution or possession of ``virtual'' child \npornography. This bill addresses that same harm in a more targeted \nmanner. It creates a new felony, which applies to both actual and \nvirtual child pornography, for people who use such material to entice \nminors to participate in illegal activity. This will provide \nprosecutors a potent new tool to put away those who prey upon children \nusing such pornography--whether the child pornography is virtual or \nnot.\n  Next, this bill attempts to revamp the existing affirmative defense \nin child pornography cases both in response to criticisms of the \nSupreme Court and so that the defense does not erect unfair hurdles to \nthe prosecution of cases involving real children. Responding directly \nto criticisms of the Court, the new affirmative defense applies equally \nto those who are charged with possessing child pornography and to those \nwho actually produce it, a change from current law. It also allows, \nagain responding to specific Supreme Court criticisms, for a defense \nthat no actual children were used in the production of the child \npornography--i.e. that it was made using computers. At the same time, \nthis provision protects prosecutors from unfair surprise in the use of \nthis affirmative defense by requiring that a defendant give advance \nnotice of his intent to assert it, just as defendants are currently \nrequired to give if they plan to assert an alibi or insanity defense. \nAs a former prosecutor I suggested this provision because it effects \nthe real way that these important trials are conducted. With the \nprovision, the government can marshal the expert testimony that may be \nneeded to rebut this ``virtual porn'' defense in cases where real \nchildren were victimized.\n\n  This improved affirmative defense provides important support for the \nconstitutionality of much of this bill after the Free Speech decision. \nEven Justice Thomas specifically wrote that it would be a key factor \nfor him. This is one reason for making the defense applicable to all \nnon-obscene, child pornography, as defined in 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2256. In \nthe bill's current form, however, the affirmative defense is not \navailable in one of the new proposed classes of virtual child \npornography, which would be found at 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2256(8)(D). This \nomission may render that provision unconstitutional under the first \nAmendment, and I hope that, as the legislative process continues, we \ncan work with constitutional experts to improve the bill in this and \nother ways. I do not want to be here again in five years, after yet \nanother Supreme Court decision striking this law down.\n  The bill also provides needed assistance to prosecutors in rebutting \nthe virtual porn defense by removing a restriction on the use of \nrecords of performers portrayed in certain sexually explicit conduct \nthat are required to be maintained under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 2257, and \nexpanding such records to cover computer images. These records, which \nwill be helpful in proving that the material in question is not \n``virtual'' child pornography, may be used in federal child pornography \nand obscenity prosecutions under this act. The purpose of this \nprovision is to protect real children from exploitation. It is \nimportant that prosecutors have access to this information in both \nchild pornography and obscenity prosecutions, since the Supreme Court's \nrecent decision has had the effect of narrowing the child pornography \nlaws, making more likely that the general obscenity statutes will be \nimportant tools in protecting children from exploitation. In addition, \nthe act raises the penalties for not keeping accurate records, further \ndeterring the exploitation of minors and enhancing the reliability of \nthe records.\n  Next, this bill contains several provisions altering the definition \nof ``child pornography'' in response to the Free Speech case. One \napproach would have been simply to add an ``obscenity'' requirement to \nthe child pornography definitions. Outlawing all obscene child \npornography--real and virtual; minor and ``youthful-adult;'' simulated \nand real--would clearly pass a constitutional challenge because obscene \nspeech enjoys no protection at all. Under the Miller test, such \nmaterial (1) ``appeals to the prurient interest,'' (2) is utterly \n``offensive'' in any ``community,'' and (3) has absolutely no \n``literary, artistic or scientific value.''\n  Some new provisions of this bill do take this ``obscenity'' approach, \nlike the new Sec. 2256(8)(B). Other provisions, however, take a \ndifferent approach. They attempt to address the fatal flaws identified \nby the Supreme Court in the CPPA with more narrow definitions of what \nthe Court found were overbroad definitions of ``child pornography,'' \nwhich still might not be obscene speech under the test set forth by the \nSupreme Court. While these new provisions are more narrowly tailored \nthan both the original CPPA and the administration's proposal \nintroduced in the House, these provisions may continue to benefit from \nfurther examination by constitutional scholars.\n  Specifically, the CPPA's definition of ``identifiable minor'' has \nbeen modified in the bill to include a prong for persons who are \n``virtually indistinguishable from an actual minor.'' This adopts \nlanguage from Justice O'Connor's concurrence in the Free Speech case. \nThus, while this language is defensible, I predict that this provision \nwill be the center of much constitutional debate. Unlike Senator Hatch, \nI believe that this new prong may not be needed, and may both confuse \nthe statute unnecessarily and endanger the already upheld ``morphing'' \nsection of the CPPA because it applies to that provision as well. This \nnew definition may create both overbreadth and vagueness problems in a \nlater constitutional challenge both the new and existing parts of the \n``child pornography'' definition. In short, while these new \ndefinitional provisions are a good faith effort to go as far as the \nConstitution allows, they risk crossing the line.\n  It does not do America's children any good to write a law that might \nget struck down by our courts in order to prove an ideological point. \nSince most all the real cases being prosecuted even under the CPPA \ninvolve clearly obscene material, by anyone's standard, one could \nlegitimately ask, `Why push the envelope and risk cases getting thrown \nout of court?' These provisions should be fully debated and examined \nduring the legislative process.\n\n[[Page S4396]]\n\n  The bill also contains a variety of other measures designed to \nincrease jail sentences in cases where children are victimized by \nsexual predators. First, it enhances penalties for repeat offenders of \nchild sex offenses by expanding the predicate crimes which trigger \ntough, mandatory minimum sentences. Second, the bill requires the U.S. \nSentencing Commission to address a disturbing disparity in the current \nSentencing Guidelines. The current sentences for a person who actually \ntravels across state lines to have sex with a child are not as high as \nfor child pornography. The Commission needs to correct this oversight \nimmediately, so that prosecutors can take these dangerous sexual \npredators off the street. These are all strong measures designed to \nprotect children and increase prison sentences for child molesters and \nthose who otherwise exploit children.\n  The act also has several provisions designed to protect the children \nwho are victims in these horrible cases. Privacy of the children must \nbe paramount. It is important that they not be victimized yet again in \nthe criminal process. This bill provides for the first time ever an \nexplicit shield law that prohibits the name or other identifying \ninformation of the child victim (other than the age or approximate age) \nfrom being admitted at any child pornography trial. It is also intended \nthat judges will take appropriate steps to ensure that such information \nas the child's name, address or other identifying information not be \npublicly disclosed during the pretrial phase of the case or at \nsentencing. The bill also contains a provision requiring the judge to \ninstruct the jury, upon request of the government, that no inference \nshould be drawn against the United States because of information \ninadmissible under the new shield law.\n  The act also amends certain reporting provisions governing child \npornography. Specifically, it allows federal authorities to report \ninformation they receive from the Center from Missing and Exploited \nChildren (``CMEC'') to state and local police without a court order. In \naddition, the bill removes the restrictions under the Electronic \nCommunications Privacy Act (ECPA) for reporting the contents of, and \ninformation pertaining to, a subscriber of stored electronic \ncommunications to the CMEC when a mandatory child porn report is filed \nwith the CMEC pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 13032. This change may invite \nfederal, state or local authorities to circumvent all subpoena and \ncourt order requirements under ECPA and allow them to obtain subscriber \ne-mails and information by triggering the initial report to the CMEC \nthemselves. To the extent that these changes in ECPA may have that \nunintended effect, as this bill is considered in the Judiciary \nCommittee and on the floor, we should consider mechanisms to guard \nagainst subverting the safeguards in ECPA from government officials \ngoing on fishing expeditions for stored electronic communications under \nthe rubric of child porn investigations. This may include clarifying 42 \nU.S.C. Sec. 13032 that the initial tip triggering the report may not be \ngenerated by the government itself. A tip line to the CMEC is just \nthat--a way for outsiders to report wrongdoing to the CMEC and the \ngovernment, not for the government to generate a report to itself \nwithout following otherwise required lawful process.\n\n  The bill provides for extraterritorial jurisdiction where a defendant \ninduces a child to engage in sexually explicit conduct outside the \nUnited States for the purposes of producing child pornography which \nthey intend to transport to the United States. The provision is crafted \nto require the intent of actual transport of the material into the \nUnited States, unlike the House bill which criminalizes even an intent \nto make such material ``accessible.'' Under that overly broad wording, \nany material posted on a web site internationally could be covered, \nwhether or not it was ever intended that the material be downloaded in \nthe United States.\n  Finally, the bill provides also a new private right of action for the \nvictims of child pornography. This provision has teeth, including \ninjunctive relief and punitive damages that will help to put those who \nproduce child pornography out of business for good. I commend Senator \nHatch for his leadership on this provision.\n  There are many people who do not agree with the Supreme Court's \ndecision in Free Speech, but that will not erase it from the books. It \nis the law of the land, and resulted from seven Justices who had \nproblems with the overbreadth of the last child pornography law passed \nby Congress. That alone should counsel a thoughtful approach this time \naround. Everyone wants to protect our children, but we need to do it \nwith cases and laws that stick.\n  It is tempting to rush to come up with a ``quick fix,'' but we owe \nour children more than a press conference on this matter. My initial \nreview of the administration's proposal, now working its way through \nthe House of Representatives, gives me serious concern. Already, the \nconstitutional law experts and law professors with whom I have \nconsulted on this matter have expressed a near consensus that large \nparts of that proposal will not withstand scrutiny under the first \namendment after the Free Speech case.\n  Indeed, the entire approach that the administration has taken in this \nmatter is to reach as far as possible, not to hedge its bets, and \nsimply to throw down the gauntlet on the steps of the Supreme Court, \ndaring it to strike down the law yet again. That does not serve \nanyone's interest, least of all the real victims of child pornography. \nCriminal prosecution is not about making an ideological point--whether \none agrees with it or not--that is for speeches and law review \narticles. Criminal prosecution should be about helping victims and \npunishing criminals with cases that do not get thrown out of court.\n\n  Let me discuss a couple of the most problematic aspects of the \nDepartment's proposal. First, it sweepingly rejects any attempt to \nincorporate the Supreme Court's doctrine of ``obscenity'' into the \ndefinition of child pornography. Not even one provision takes that \napproach, which would at least ensure that some of the law was upheld. \nInstead, in its new 2256(8)(B) definition of ``child pornography,'' the \nDepartment simply changes the words ``appears to be'' in the current \nstatute to ``appears virtually indistinguishable from'' in the new \nprovision. The problem with that approach is this is the same argument \nthat was tried by the Department in the Free Speech case and \noverwhelmingly lost. Although Justice O'Connor wrote that such an \napproach might satisfy her, she was not the deciding vote in the case--\nindeed she was the seventh vote to strike down the statute.\n  Second, the administration's proposal regarding the new crime for \nchild pornography involving ``prepubescent'' children is also \nproblematic under the Court's Free Speech case. Although the section is \nentitled ``Obscene visual depictions of young children'' the Department \nhas assiduously avoided any ``obscenity'' requirement in the provision \nitself. I recognize that headlines and titles like ``prepubescent'' and \n``obscene'' are popular, but one has to ask if the Department of \nJustice really believes that it can fool our federal judges with such \nlinguistic sleight of hand when there is no obscenity requirement in \nthe statute itself, only the title? Or perhaps it is only the public \nthat is supposed to be fooled.\n  In any event, as a legal matter, the provision contains absolutely no \nrequirement that the material be judged as a whole for artistic, \nliterary, or scientific value. That was a point that the Supreme Court \nrepeatedly pounded home in the Free Speech case, yet it is simply \nignored in this provision. This approach is especially frustrating \nbecause in the cases that the Department is likely to actually \nprosecute, it would be easy to meet the obscenity test. Under the \nDepartment's current approach, however, one can already predict the \nparade of legitimate movies and scientific or educational materials \nthat those challenging the act will produce which meet the new \ndefinition. In addition, no affirmative defense is available under this \nnew crime, so it cannot be saved from the Free Speech case on that \nbasis either.\n  There are other problematic provisions in the administration \nproposal, but I simply raise these two in order to make the point that \nthe Department's proposal seems to be more concerned with making a \npublic point than with making successful cases. If the Department's \nproposal becomes law, it will result in yet another round of court\n\n[[Page S4397]]\n\ncases, followed by another round of cases being thrown out, followed by \nanother round of legislation. America's children deserve better, and I \nthink that, while we may disagree on some of the specifics, that \nSenator Hatch and I have made a good faith and bipartisan effort to \ncome up with a law that will survive judicial scrutiny and protect them \nfor years to come.\n  For all of these reasons, I am pleased to introduce this legislation \nwith Senator Hatch to help protect our nation's children. I hope that \nwe can continue to work together to address the complex constitutional \nissues raised in this area.

The Free Speech Coalition, et al., No. \n     00-795 (Apr. 16, 2002). In particular, the pornography \n     (indeed, the bill expressly targets images that do not \n     involve real human beings at all). Accordingly, in our view, \n     it suffers from the same infirmities that led the Court to \n     invalidate the statute at issue in Ashcroft.\n       We emphasize that we share the revulsion all Americans feel \n     toward those who harm children, and fully support legitimate \n     efforts to eradicate child pornography. As the Court in \n     Ashcroft emphasized, however, in doing so Congress must act \n     within the limits of the First Amendment, in our view, the \n     bill proposed by the Department of Jutice fails to do so.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Jodie L.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my \ncolleagues, Senators Hatch and Leahy, in introducing the Prosecutorial \nRemedies and Tools Against the Exploitation of Children Today Act of \n2002, PROTECT, S. 2520. The spread of child pornography is one of the \ngravest dangers in our society because it harms the weakest among us, \nour children.\n  Since the Supreme Court's April 16, 2002, decision in Ashcroft v. \nFree Speech Coalition, I have been extremely concerned that those who \nwould prey on our children through the Internet have a shield from \nprosecution. They can simply claim the images they are posting, often \ncomputer files which are difficult to closely examine, are not of \nactual children but rather are computer generated. As the law currently \nstands, it is offering protection to the predators, not to the child \nvictims.\n  Those who collect and engage in child pornography are oftentimes \nfull-fledged sexual predators themselves who have abused real children. \nThis has been proven by the highly successful Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation operation, Operation Candyman. Investigators found 7,200 \nInternet child pornography traffickers. At this point, of the 90 people \narrested through Operation Candyman in March of 2002, 13 have admitted \nto molesting a total of 48 different children.\n  There is an achievable balance between preserving our first amendment \nright to freedom of speech and protecting children from Internet \npredators. I believe this bill strikes that balance, and I have \nconfidence that the Supreme Court will agree.\n  I would also like to thank Attorney General John Ashcroft for working \nwith Congress to draft this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mrs. Hutchison):\n  S. 2522. A bill to establish the Southwest Regional Border Authority; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nalong with Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison that will help raise the \nstandard of living for hundreds of thousands of Americans who live near \nthe United States-Mexico border. The Southwest Regional Border \nAuthority Act would create an economic development authority for the \nSouthwest border region, charged with awarding grants to border \ncommunities in support of their local economic development projects.\n  The need for a regional border authority is acute: The poverty rate \nin the Southwest border region is 20 percent--nearly double the \nnational average; unemployment rates in Southwest border counties often \nreach as high as five times the national unemployment rate; per capita \npersonal income in the region is greatly below the national average; \nand lack of adequate access to capital has made it difficult for \nbusinesses to start up in the region.\n  In addition, the development of key infrastructures--such as water \nand wastewater, transportation, public health, and telecommunications--\nhas not kept pace with the population explosion and the increase in \ncross-border commerce.\n  The counties in the Southwest border region are among the most \neconomically distressed in the Nation. In fact, there are only a few \nsuch regions of economic distress throughout the country--almost all of \nwhich are currently served by regional economic development \ncommissions. These commissions, which are authorized by Congress, \ninclude the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Delta Regional \nAuthority, and the Denali Commission. In order to address the needs of \nthe border region in a similar fashion, I propose the creation of a \nregional economic development authority for the Southwest border.\n  My bill, which is modeled after the Appalachian Regional Commission, \nis based on four guiding principles. First, it starts from the premise \nthat the people who live in the Southwest border region know best when \nit comes to making decisions that affect their communities. Second, it \nemploys a regional approach to economic development and encourages \ncommunities to work across county and State lines when appropriate. All \ntoo often, past efforts to improve the Southwest border region have hit \nroadblocks as a result of poor coordination and communication between \ncommunities.\n  Third, it creates an economic development entity that is independent, \nmeaning it will be able to make decisions that are in the best interest \nof border communities, without being subject to the politics of Federal \nagencies. Finally, it brings together representatives of the four \nSouthwest border States and the Federal Government as equal partners, \nall of whom will work to improve the quality of life and standard of \nliving for border residents.\n  This is not just another commission, and it is certainly not just \nanother grant program. I believe the Southwest Regional Border \nAuthority not only will help leverage new private sector funding, but \nalso will help better target Federal funding to those projects that are \nmost likely to achieve the desired outcome of increased economic \ndevelopment.\n  The legislation accomplishes this through a sensible mechanism of \ndevelopment planning. Under the bill, communities in each of the four \nborder States will work through local development districts to create \ndevelopment plans that reflect the needs and priorities specific to \neach locality. These local development plans then go to the State in \nwhich the communities are located, where they become the basis for a \nState development plan. The four State development plans, in turn, form \nthe basis for a regional development\n\n[[Page S4398]]\n\nplan, which is put together by the Authority. The purpose of this \nplanning process is to ensure that local priorities are reflected in \nthe projects funded by the Authority, while also providing flexibility \nto the Authority to fund projects that are regional in nature.\n\n  This process has several advantages. First, by ensuring that Federal \ndollars are targeted to projects that have gone through thorough \nplanning at the local level, we will greatly improve the probability of \nsuccess for those projects--thereby increasing the Federal Government's \nreturn on its investment. Second, local development plans are essential \nto attracting private sector funding. Increased private investment \nmeans less need for Federal, State, and local public sector funding. \nThird, combining resources in such a way will help communities get more \nfunding than they can currently get from any one program. This is \nparticularly important now as we in Congress grapple with how to fund \nthe needs of the border in the current budget climate.\n  I believe there are additional benefits to be derived from the Border \nAuthority. As the only independent, quasi-Federal entity charged with \neconomic development for the entire Southwest border region, the \nAuthority will become a clearinghouse of sorts on all the funding \navailable to the border region. This will enable the Authority to help \nborder communities learn which programs are best suited to their needs \nand most likely to achieve the goals of their local development plans. \nAnother benefit is its focus on economically distressed counties. Under \nthe bill, the Authority can provide funding to increase the Federal \nshare of a Federal grant program to up to 90 percent of the total cost. \nThis is particularly helpful to the many communities that are often \nunable to utilize Federal funding because they can't afford the \nrequired local match.\n  For far too long the needs of the Southwest border have been ignored, \noverlooked, or underfunded. I am confident that the creation of a \nSouthwest Regional Border Authority not only will call attention to the \ngreat needs that exist along the border, but also provide resources to \nlocal communities where the dollars will do the most good. I urge the \nSenate to move swiftly on this legislation, and I ask my colleagues for \ntheir support.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2522\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) a rapid increase in population in the Southwest border \n     region is placing a significant strain on the infrastructure \n     of the region, including transportation, water and \n     wastewater, public health, and telecommunications;\n       (2) 20 percent of the residents of the region have incomes \n     below the poverty level;\n       (3) unemployment rates in counties in the region are up to \n     5 times the national unemployment rate;\n       (4) per capita personal income in the region is \n     significantly below the national average and much of the \n     income in the region is distributed through welfare programs, \n     retirement programs, and unemployment payments;\n       (5) a lack of adequate access to capital in the region--\n       (A) has created economic disparities in the region; and\n       (B) has made it difficult for businesses to start up in the \n     region;\n       (6) many residents of the region live in communities \n     referred to as ``colonias'' that lack basic necessities, \n     including running water, sewers, storm drainage, and \n     electricity;\n       (7) many of the problems that exist in the region could be \n     solved or ameliorated by technology that would contribute to \n     economic development in the region;\n       (8) while numerous Federal, State, and local programs \n     target financial resources to the region, those programs are \n     often uncoordinated, duplicative, and, in some cases, \n     unavailable to eligible border communities because those \n     communities cannot afford the required funding match;\n       (9) Congress has established several regional economic \n     development commissions, including the Appalachian Regional \n     Commission, the Delta Regional Authority, and the Denali \n     Commission, to improve the economies of those areas of the \n     United States that experience the greatest economic distress; \n     and\n       (10) many of the counties in the region are among the most \n     economically distressed in the United States and would \n     benefit from a regional economic development commission.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to establish a regional economic development authority \n     for the Southwest Border region to address critical issues \n     relating to the economic health and well-being of the \n     residents of the region;\n       (2) to provide funding to communities in the region to \n     stimulate and foster infrastructure development, technology \n     development, community development and entrepreneurship, and \n     education and workforce development in the region;\n       (3) to increase the total amount of Federal funding \n     available for border economic development projects by \n     coordinating with and reducing duplication of other Federal, \n     State, and local programs; and\n       (4) to empower the people of the region through the use of \n     local development districts and State and regional \n     development plans that reflect State and local priorities.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to \nincrease assistance for foreign countries seriously affected by HIV/\nAIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation along \nwith Senators Frist, Biden, Helms, Daschle and others that offers our \nNation's most comprehensive response to date to the global HIV/AIDS \ncrisis. It authorizes $4.7 billion over the next two years for U.S. \ncontributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \nMalaria and for a dramatic expansion of bilateral U.S. programs\n\n[[Page S4403]]\n\nadministered by the US Agency for International Development, USAID.\n  There can be no question that the AIDS pandemic has truly reached a \ncrisis point, not only for the 40 million people infected worldwide, \nbut also for the communities in which they live. The pandemic strikes \nat the foundations of societies, devastating families, undermining \neconomies, and weakening a broad range of institutions by taking the \nlives of educators, health care providers, police, military personnel, \nand civil servants. These forces cripple the potential for long-term \neconomic development and jeopardize political and social stability in \nSub-Saharan Africa, the most-severely affected region, and increasingly \nin all corners of the world.\n  Although 95 percent of people infected with HIV live in developing \ncountries, this crisis ultimately affects us all. Here in the United \nStates, we cannot afford to ignore the fact that instability anywhere \nthreatens security everywhere. While this is certainly not a new \nreality, it became painfully evident on September 11 of last year that \nthe fate of our people is inextricably bound to the lives of those \nliving thousands of miles across the globe. We are called by moral duty \nand by our national interest to forcefully combat the further spread of \nHIV/AIDS. Only the United States has the capacity to lead and enhance \nthe effectiveness of the international community's response. Clearly we \nhave not done enough to address this crisis. The need for strong action \nhas never been so urgent or so great.\n  AIDS has become the fourth-highest cause of death globally, already \nclaiming the lives of 22 million people. More than three-quarters of \nthese deaths, more than 17 million, have been in Sub-Saharan Africa, \nwhere AIDS is now the leading cause of death. Last year alone, AIDS \nkilled 2.3 million African people, and experts project that the disease \nwill eventually take the lives of one in four adults throughout that \nregion. Because of AIDS, Botswana, Zimbabwe, and South Africa are \nalready experiencing negative population growth, and life expectancy \nfor children born in some parts of the continent has dropped as low as \n35 years. Of the estimated 40 million people now living with HIV \nglobally, 28.1 million are in Sub-Saharan Africa. This number includes \n3.4 million people who were infected last year alone.\n  Other parts of the world are going down the same path as Africa. The \nCaribbean is now the second most affected region, with 2.3 percent of \nadults infected with HIV. Eastern Europe, especially the Russian \nFederation, is experiencing the world's fastest-growing epidemic, \nmainly from injection drug use. In Asia and the Pacific region, 7.1 \nmillion people are infected with HIV or living with AIDS. Although \nnational prevalence rates in most countries throughout that region are \nrelatively low, localized epidemics have broken out in many areas, and \nthere is a serious threat of major outbreaks of the virus in China, \nIndia, and a number of other countries.\n  More than 20 years after the first cases were reported, basic \nknowledge about HIV/AIDS remains disturbingly low. Half of all teenage \ngirls in Sub-Saharan Africa still do not know that healthy-looking \npeople can have HIV. In Mozambique, 74 percent of young women and 62 \npercent of young men aged 15 to 19 cannot name a single method of \nprotecting themselves against HIV/AIDS. Worldwide, nine out of ten HIV \ninfected individuals are unaware they are infected.\n  The AIDS crisis is affecting females at an increasing rate. In 1997, \n41 percent of adults living with HIV/AIDS were women. By 2000, that \nproportion had increased to 47 percent. Biologically, the risk of \nbecoming infected with HIV during unprotected intercourse is greater \nfor women than for men, and gender inequalities in social and economic \nstatus and access to medical care increase women's vulnerability. This \ngender imbalance is even stronger for younger females, in some \ncountries, the rate of new infections among girls is as much as 5 to 6 \ntimes higher than among boys.\n  Although girls are hardest-hit, the HIV/AIDS crisis takes a \ndisproportionate toll on young people in general. Nearly one-third of \nthe 40 million people currently living with HIV are between the ages of \n15 and 24, and half of all new infections occur in this age group. \nMother-to-child transmission is responsible for the vast majority of \ninfections among children under the age of 15. Without preventive \nmeasures, 35 percent of infants born to HIV-positive mothers contract \nthe virus. Even those who are not infected in this manner can confront \ntremendous difficulties, more than 13 million children under age 15 \nhave already lost their mothers or both parents to AIDS, and this \nnumber is expected to more than double by the end of the decade. \nChildren orphaned by AIDS are susceptible to extreme poverty, \nmalnutrition, psychological distress, and a long list of other \nhardships. Many of these orphans turn to crime in order to survive.\n  HIV/AIDS can undermine the economic security of individual families, \ncommunities, and even entire nations. The disease weakens the \nproductivity and longevity of the labor force across a broad array of \neconomic sectors, reducing the potential for immediate and long-term \neconomic growth. In some countries, AIDS is reversing progress brought \nby decades of economic development efforts. But the ripple effects of \nthis pandemic go far beyond the economic realm, touching virtually all \naspects of life in the countries that are hardest-hit. HIV/AIDS strikes \nat the most mobile and educated members of society, many of whom are \nresponsible for governance, health care, education, and security.\n  Earlier this month, the World Bank reported that AIDS is spreading so \nrapidly in parts of Africa that it is killing teachers faster than \ncountries can train them. At the same time, HIV-infected children and \nthose orphaned by AIDS must often leave school. These trends have \ncombined to create an education crisis. Africa is also confronting a \nmounting security crisis with ramifications for the broader \ninternational community. According to UNAIDS, many military forces in \nSub-Saharan Africa face infection rates as high as five times that of \nthe civilian population. These military forces are losing their \ncapacity to preserve stability within their own borders and to engage \nin regional peacekeeping and conflict prevention efforts. This pattern \nis likely to compound the problem of failing states throughout Africa.\n\n  My words have barely begun to chronicle the extent to which this \npandemic has spread, the devastation it has wrought, and the myriad \nthreats it poses to distant countries and to our own. We are facing the \nworld's worst health crisis since the bubonic plague and it is not \n``someone else's problem.'' It is humanity's problem.\n  It is up to us to respond. American leadership is needed as never \nbefore. The United States can not afford to sit on the sidelines or \ntinker at the edges of a global pandemic. Only the United States is in \na position to lead the effort with other governments and private sector \npartners to beat this pandemic and only the United States has the \nresources to make a difference. History is going to judge how we react \nto this crisis and we want history to judge us well.\n  There is so much we can do--if we commit ourselves to the effort. We \nhave learned that we can change behavior through prevention and \neducation programs, especially if those programs make treatment \navailable for those already sick. We can stop the transmission of the \nHIV virus from mother-to-child through the use of the drug nevirapine. \nAnd we can reduce the growing number of ``AIDS orphans'' if we start \nadding voluntary counseling, testing and treatment of parents and care-\ngivers to children--in other words adding a Plus to the MTCT, mother-\nto-child transmission, programs.\n  That is the goal of this legislation. It will provide clear American \nleadership, helping to harness resources here at home and around the \nglobe for research and development to eradicate these deadly diseases. \nIt will inject unprecedented amounts of capital in effective prevention \nand treatment programs and direct resources to the people on the ground \nfighting these diseases.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today represents the first \neffort ever to create a comprehensive long term strategy for American \nleadership in responding to this global pandemic. If passed into law, \nthis bill would represent the largest single monetary commitment ever \nmade by the United States to deal with AIDS pandemic. It would double \nU.S. spending on global\n\n[[Page S4404]]\n\nAIDS from roughly $1 billion this year to more than $2 billion per year \nover the next two years. But equally important, it would require the \nU.S. government to develop a comprehensive, detailed five-year plan to \nsignificantly reduce the spread of HIV/AIDS around the world and meet \nthe targets set by the international community at the June 2001 United \nNations Special Session on HIV/AIDS.\n  This legislation authorizes $1 billion in this fiscal year and $1.2 \nbillion in the next for US contributions to the Global Fund to Fight \nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria--the international community's new \ncombined effort to increase resources against this pandemic. It \nauthorizes more than $800 million this year and $900 million next year \nfor an expansion of existing USAID programs and creation of new \nprograms to increase our efforts not only in the areas of prevention \nand education but also in the equally important areas of care and \nprevention. It provides significant new funding levels for programs to \ncombat tuberculosis and malaria--serious infectious diseases which, \ntogether with HIV/AIDS, killed 5.7 million people last year.\n  The fight against HIV/AIDS has started to produce results in some \ncountries. Cambodia and Thailand, driven by strong political leadership \nand public commitment, have developed successful prevention programs. \nHIV prevalence among pregnant women in Cambodia dropped by almost a \nthird between 1997 and 2000. In Uganda, rates of HIV infection among \nadults continue to fall, largely because President Yoweri Museveni has \npursued an aggressive education campaign to make people in his country \naware of ways they can protect themselves from this disease. President \nMuseveni has displayed courage in his willingness to break through \ncultural boundaries to discuss the AIDS crisis openly and \nrealistically.\n  Leadership within the countries that are most severely-affected by \nHIV/AIDS is absolutely indispensable. Our legislation seeks to \nencourage that leadership by offering the possibility of obtaining \ngreater resources to be used for health programs through a new round of \ninternational negotiations to further reduce the debt of many of these \ncountries. Ultimately the fight against AIDS requires a broad \npartnership between the governments of those countries severely \naffected, governments like ours in a position to provide assistance, \nand the private sector which can bring not only resources but \nscientific and medical knowledge and expertise to bear.\n  Various organizations in the private sector have already contributed \na great deal to the struggle against HIV/AIDS. Philanthropies like the \nBill & Melinda Gates Foundation have donated hundreds of millions of \ndollars to purchase drugs, improve health delivery systems, and bolster \nprevention campaigns, among other means of support. Pharmaceutical \ncompanies such as Merck and Pfizer have also offered a number of life-\nextending therapies to the developing world at no cost or at a very \ndiscounted rate.\n  These contributions and these public/private sector partnerships are \ncritical to the success or our effort. The bill that we are introducing \nmakes it clear that these kinds of partnerships should be strengthened \nand expanded. And for the first time, it also sets out a voluntary code \nof conduct for American businesses who have operations in countries \naffected by the AIDS pandemic to follow, not unlike the Sullivan Code \nof Conduct that many American firms followed during the days of \napartheid in South Africa.\n  The global HIV/AIDS crisis is a matter of money, for words alone will \nnot beat back the greatest challenge the world has ever witnessed to \nthe very survival a continent, Africa, and an ever growing number of \nother areas. But it is more than that, this is a question of \nleadership, not fate; of willpower, not capacity. The question before \nus is not whether we can win this fight, but whether we will choose to, \nwhether `here on earth,' as President Kennedy said, we are going to \nmake ``God's work truly our own.''\n  I believe we will. That is why there is such a broad coalition \nsupporting this effort. That is why my friend and colleague Senator \nKennedy, chairman of the HELP Committee, is working in concert with us \nto produce a bill that will authorize another $500 million for the CDC \nand other HHS agencies to help fight this epidemic. And that is why \nDemocrats and Republicans together are going to demonstrate the full \nmeasure of America's ability to respond to enormous tragedy with \nenormous strength.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/15/senate-section/article/S4404-1", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4404-S4405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS--MAY 14, 2002\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 267--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n     POLICY OF THE UNITED STATES AT THE 54TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE \n                    INTERNATIONAL WHALING COMMISSION\n\n  Mr. Kerry (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Hollings, Mr. McCain, Mr. \nLieberman, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Reed, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. \nFitzGerald, Ms. Collins, Mr. Lugar, Mrs. Boxer, and Mr. Kennedy) \nsubmitted the following resolution, which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n  (The resolution can be found in the Record of May 14, 2002, on page \nS4333.)\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the resolution that Senator Kerry and I are \nsubmitting is very timely and important. As we work here in the Senate \ntoday, representatives of nations from around the globe are preparing \nfor the 54th annual Meeting of the International Whaling Commission to \nbe held in Japan, May 20-24, 2002. At this meeting, the IWC will \ndetermine the fate of the world's whales through consideration of \nproposals to end the current global moratorium on commercial whaling. \nThe adoption of any such proposals by the IWC would mark a major \nsetback in whale conservation. It is imperative that the United States \nremain firm in its opposition to any proposals to resume commercial \nwhaling and that we, as a Nation, continue to speak out passionately \nagainst this practice.\n  It is also time to close one of the loopholes used by nations to \ncontinue to whale without regard to the moratorium or established whale \nsanctuaries. The practice of unnecessary lethal scientific whaling is \noutdated and the value of the data of such research has been called \ninto question by an international array of scientists who study the \nsame population dynamics questions as those who harvest whales in the \nname of science. This same whale meat is then processed and sold in the \nmarketplace. These sentiments have been echoed by the Scientific \nCommittee of the IWC which has repeatedly passed resolutions calling \nfor the cessation of lethal scientific whaling, particularly that \noccurring in designated whale sanctuaries. They have offered to work \nwith all interested parties to design research protocols that will not \nrequire scientists to harm or kill whales.\n  Last year, Japan expanded their scientific whaling program over the \nIWC's objections. The resolution that we are offering expresses the \nSense of the Senate that the United States should continue to remain \nfirmly opposed to any resumption of commercial whaling and oppose, at \nthe upcoming IWC meeting, the non-necessary lethal taking of whales for \nscientific purposes.\n  Commercial whaling has been prohibited for many species for more than \nsixty years. In 1982, the continued decline of commercially targeted \nstocks led the IWC to declare a global moratorium on all commercial \nwhaling which went into effect in 1986. The United States was a leader \nin the effort to establish the moratorium, and since then we have \nconsistently provided a strong voice against commercial whaling and \nhave worked to uphold the moratorium. This resolution reaffirms the \nUnited States' strong support for a ban on commercial whaling at a time \nwhen our negotiations at the IWC most need that support. Norway, Japan, \nand other countries have made it clear that they intend to push for the \nelimination of the moratorium, and for a return to the days when whales \nwere retreated as commodities.\n  The resolution would reiterate the U.S. objection to activities being \nconducted under reservations to the IWC's moratorium. The resolution \nwould also oppose the proposal to allow a non-member country to join \nthe Convention with a reservation that would allow it to commercially \nwhale. The\n\n[[Page S4405]]\n\nresolution would also oppose all efforts made at the Convention on \nInternational Trade in Endangered Species, CITES, to reopen \ninternational trade in whale meat or to downlist any whale population. \nIn addition, the IWC, as well as individual nations including the \nUnited States, has established whale sanctuaries that would prevent \nwhaling in specified areas even if the moratorium were to be lifted. \nDespite these efforts to give whale stocks a chance to rebuild, the \nnumber of whales harvested has increased in recent years, tripling \nsince the implementation of the global moratorium in 1986. This is a \ndangerous trend that does not show signs of stopping.\n  Domestically, we work very hard to protect whales in U.S. waters, \nparticularly those considered threatened or endangered. One own laws \nand regulations are designed to give whales one of the highest \nstandards of protection in the world, and as a result, our own citizens \nare subject to rules designed to protect against even the accidental \ntaking of whales. Commercial whaling is, of course, strictly \nprohibited. Given what is asked of our citizens to protect against even \naccidental injury to whales here in the United States, it would be \ngrossly unfair if we retreated in any way from our position opposing \ncommercial, intentional whaling by other countries. Whales migrate \nthroughout the world's oceans, and as we protect whales in our own \nwaters, so should we act to protect them internationally.\n  Whales are among the most intelligent animals on Earth, and they play \nan important role in the marine ecosystem. Yet, there is still much \nabout them that we do not know. Resuming the intentional harvest of \nwhales is irresponsible, and it could have ecological consequences that \nwe cannot predict. Therefore, it is premature to even consider easing \nconservation measures.\n  The right policy is to protect whales across the globe, and to oppose \nthe resumption of commercial whaling. I urge my colleagues to support \nswift passage of this resolution.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong support \nfor the resolution expressing the sense of the Senate regarding the \npolicy of the United states at the 54th Annual Meeting of the \nInternational Whaling Commission. This resolution affirms and renews \nour long-standing commitment to end the practice of commercial whale-\nhunting, as well as the killing of whales for profit under the false \nrubric of ``scientific whaling.'' It constitutes a powerful statement \nto the rest of the world that we have not, and will not, grow \ncomplacent in fighting to preserve the existence of these remarkable \nbeings.\n  Our present action draws urgency from the fact that the single most \nimportant safety net for ensuring the survival of whale species is \nunder threat of unraveling. When the International Whaling Commission, \nIWC, voted to establish a global moratorium on commercial whaling in \n1982, the decision represented a profound acknowledgement on the part \nof the international community of its abysmal and repeated failure to \nmanage whale stocks in a responsible manner. Such was the egregiousness \nof our collective whaling legacy that nothing short of a complete ban \non commercial whaling was determined to stave these creatures away from \nthe path to extinction.\n  Sadly, the thirty years since the enactment of the moratorium have \nonly served to vindicate the wisdom of the IWC's landmark decision. One \nneeds only look to the history of duplicitous efforts undertaken to \nskirt the strictures of the moratorium to see this. Most blatant among \nthese efforts has been the practice by certain countries to exploit the \nexemption for scientific whaling in order to hunt whales for ostensibly \nscientific, but essentially commercial, purposes. This disingenuous \nbehavior directly contradicts the purpose and spirit, if not the \nletter, of the moratorium. Regrettably, the lack of regard shown by \nthese nations for obligations that were assumed freely and voluntarily \ndoes not inspire one with faith that they would act any more \nresponsibly should the door to commercial whaling ever be opened.\n  Less apparent, but no less discouraging, is the unwillingness by some \nnations to vigorously monitor and prosecute the illegal trading of \nwhale meat. Whether the absence of rigorous policing measures is the \nresult of conscious intent or uninformed negligence, the outcome is the \nsame. Unscrupulous operators are provided with incentives to disregard \nthe law and afforded with the knowledge that they may do so with \nimpunity. The lax enforcement of existing laws calls into further doubt \nthe international community's prospective will and capacity to enforce \nquotas on catches if commercial whaling were resumed.\n  In light of the evidence refuting the notion that a uniform \ncommitment to act responsibly and in accordance with international \nmandates currently exits or would crystallize in the foreseeable \nfuture, it would be a grave and reckless mistake for the moratorium to \nbe lifted now. This is why we must endeavor to shore up support for the \nmoratorium prior to the IWC's 54th Annual Meeting, and to prevent the \nentry of any nation that seeks to have a voting voice in the IWC \nwithout agreeing to abide by the decisions of that same body.\n  I note with particular concern Iceland's pending application to \nrejoin the IWC with a reservation that would leave it with complete \ndiscretion in choosing whether or not to engage in commercial whaling. \nIt is well-established that Iceland's motivation in rejoining is to \nexpand the voting block for revoking the moratorium. In applying with \nthe reservation, however, Iceland aims to have all the privileges of \nmembership free and clear of any concomitant burdens and \nresponsibilities. But no nation should be allowed to have its cake and \neat it too. It would be fundamentally unfair to the other IWC members \nto give Iceland a role in defining the limits of their behavior when \nIceland itself would not have to play by the same rules. More \nimportantly, Iceland's admission would establish a dangerous precedent \nwhereby other nations would be encouraged to circumvent international \ntreaties by withdrawing from them and then re-joining with specific \nreservations against onerous obligations.\n  In view of our concerns over the deleterious consequences of \nIceland's re-entry, nineteen of my Senate colleagues and I previously \nsent a bipartisan letter to Secretary of State Colin Powell urging him \nto assume a leadership role in opposing Iceland's application. The time \nis ripe, however, for us to make a more public and formal declaration \nof our position, and to provide our Administration with the \nencouragement and support it needs to take bold action at the next IWC \nmeeting and the next conference of the Parties to the Convention on \nInternational Trade in endangered Species.

Res. 270\n\n       Whereas cystic fibrosis is one of the most common fatal \n     genetic diseases in the United States and there is no known \n     cure;\n       Whereas cystic fibrosis, characterized by digestive \n     disorders and chronic lung infections, is a fatal lung \n     disease;\n       Whereas a total of more than 10,000,000 Americans are \n     unknowing carriers of cystic fibrosis;\n       Whereas one out of every 3,900 babies in the United States \n     is born with cystic fibrosis;\n       Whereas approximately 30,000 people in the United States, \n     many of whom are children, have cystic fibrosis;\n       Whereas the average life expectancy of an individual with \n     cystic fibrosis is 32 years;\n       Whereas prompt, aggressive treatment of the symptoms of \n     cystic fibrosis can extend the lives of those who have this \n     disease;\n       Whereas recent advances in cystic fibrosis research have \n     produced promising leads in gene, protein, and drug \n     therapies; and\n       Whereas education can help inform the public of the \n     symptoms of cystic fibrosis, which will assist in early \n     diagnoses, and increase knowledge and understanding of this \n     disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of October 13, 2002, through \n     October 19, 2002, as ``National Cystic Fibrosis Awareness \n     Week'';\n       (2) commits to increasing the quality of life for \n     individuals with cystic fibrosis by promoting public \n     knowledge and understanding in a manner that will result in \n     earlier diagnoses, more fund raising efforts for research, \n     and increased levels of support for those with cystic \n     fibrosis and their families; and\n       (3) requests the President to issue a proclamation calling \n     on the people of the United States to observe the week with \n     appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution \nrecognizing October 13, 2002, through October 19, 2002, as National \nCystic Fibrosis Awareness Week. I am pleased to be joined by my \ncolleagues Senators DeWine and Kerry in submitting this resolution. We \nare hopeful that greater awareness of cystic fibrosis, CF, will lead to \na cure.\n  Cystic fibrosis is one of the most common fatal genetic diseases in \nthe United States and there is no known cure. It affects approximately \n30,000 children and adults in the United States. There are about 1,000 \nnew cases of CF diagnosed each year. While most of these individuals \nare diagnosed by the age of three, others are not recognized as having \nCF until they are age 18 years, or older. Today, the life expectancy \nfor someone with CF is 32 years. I believe we must do what we can to \nchange these statistics.\n  While there is no cure, early detection and prompt treatment can \nsignificantly improve and extend the lives of those with CF. My home \nState of Colorado was one of the first States to require CF screening \nfor newborns. Happily, more States are now performing this simple test.\n  And, since the discovery of the defective CF gene in 1989, CF \nresearch has greatly accelerated. I am proud that Colorado is home to \nthe University of Colorado Health Sciences Center and Children's \nHospital, both of which are actively involved in CF research and care. \nChildren's Hospital is one of eight innovative Therapeutics Development \nCenters performing cutting edge clinical research to develop new \ntreatments for CF.\n  Currently, the CF Foundation oversees more than 25 CF clinical \ntrials. In addition, small pilot trials are carried out in the 115 \nCystic Fibrosis Foundation-accredited care centers across the United \nStates. And, organizations such as the Cystic Fibrosis Research, Inc. \nalso sponsor studies for treatment of the disease. Efforts such as \nthese throughout the nation are providing a greater quality of life for \nthose who have CF. I applaud these efforts.\n  While I am encouraged by the CF research in Colorado and elsewhere, \nmore needs to be done. I believe we can increase the quality of life \nfor individuals with Cystic Fibrosis by promoting public knowledge and \nunderstanding of the disease in a manner that will result in earlier \ndiagnoses, more fund raising efforts for research, and increased levels \nof support for those who have CF and their families.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to act on this resolution so we can \nmove another step closer to eradicating this disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/05/15/senate-section/article/S4406-2", "month": "05", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 111--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n  HARRIET TUBMAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN PAID A PENSION FOR HER SERVICE AS A \n     NURSE AND SCOUT IN THE UNITED STATES ARMY DURING THE CIVIL WAR\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Armed Services:\n\n                            S.

TRADE REMEDY FOR CANADIAN WHEAT.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Agricultural Trade Fairness Act of 2002''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Government of Canada grants the Canadian Wheat \n     Board special monopoly rights and privileges which \n     disadvantage United States wheat farmers and undermine the \n     integrity of the trading system.\n       (2) The Canadian Wheat Board is able to take sales from \n     United States farmers, because it--\n       (A) is insulated from commercial risks;\n       (B) benefits from subsidies;\n       (C) has a protected domestic market and special privileges; \n     and\n       (D) has competitive advantages due to its monopoly control \n     over a guaranteed supply of wheat.\n       (3) The Canadian Wheat Board is insulated from commercial \n     risk because the Canadian Government guarantees its financial \n     operations, including its borrowing, credit sales to foreign \n     buyers, and initial payments to farmers.\n       (4) The Canadian Wheat Board benefits from subsidies and \n     special privileges, such as government-owned railcars, \n     government-guaranteed debt, and below market borrowing costs.\n       (5) The Canadian Wheat Board has a competitive advantage \n     due to its monopoly control over a guaranteed supply of wheat \n     that Canadian farmers are required to sell to the Board, and \n     monopoly control to export western Canadian wheat which \n     allows the Canadian Wheat Board to enter into forward \n     contracts without incurring commercial risks.\n       (6) Canada's burdensome regulatory scheme controls the \n     varieties of wheat that can be marketed and restricts imports \n     of United States wheat.\n       (7) The wheat trade problem with Canada is long-standing \n     and affects the entire United States wheat industry by \n     depressing prices and displacing sales of United States wheat \n     domestically and in foreign markets.\n       (8) The acts, policies, and practices of the Government of \n     Canada and the Canadian Wheat Board are unreasonable and \n     burden or restrict United States wheat commerce.\n       (9) Since entering into the Canada-United States Free Trade \n     Agreement, United States wheat producers have been \n     continuously threatened by the unfair practices of the \n     Canadian Wheat Board.\n       (10) The United States Department of Agriculture figures \n     confirm that--\n       (A) United States wheat farmers have lost domestic market \n     share to Canadian Wheat Board imports consistently since the \n     implementation of the Canada-United States Free Trade \n     Agreement;\n       (B) the price of wheat has dropped sharply since the 1996 \n     peak;\n       (C) although almost half of the United States wheat crop is \n     exported, United States wheat exports have shown little \n     increase since 1996 and 1997; and\n       (D) the number of farms growing wheat in the United States \n     continues to decline.\n       (11) United States wheat producers are faced with low \n     prices as a result of the Canadian Wheat Board's unfair \n     pricing in domestic and third country markets. United States \n     wheat producers have experienced a steep decline in farm \n     income, have increasing carry-over stock, face indebtedness, \n     and have been forced to rely on Government support.\n       (c) Response to Unfair Trade Practices by Canadian Wheat \n     Board.--Since the United States Trade Representative made a \n     positive finding that the practices of the Canadian Wheat \n     Board involved subsidies, protected domestic market, and \n     special benefits and privileges that disadvantage United \n     States wheat farmers and infringe on the integrity of a \n     competitive trading system, the President shall implement the \n     finding and shall--\n       (1) initiate a dispute settlement case against the Canadian \n     Wheat Board in the World Trade Organization;\n       (2) initiate action under title VII of the Tariff Act of \n     1930 with respect to countervailing duty and antidumping \n     petitions against Canada;\n       (3) in the newly launched round of the World Trade \n     Organization, pursue permanent reform of the Canadian Wheat \n     Board through the development of new disciplines and rules on \n     State trading enterprises that export agricultural goods \n     which include--\n       (A) ending exclusive export rights to ensure private sector \n     competition in markets controlled by single desk exports;\n       (B) establishing World Trade Organization requirements for \n     identifying acquisition costs, export pricing, and other \n     sales information for single desk exporters; and\n       (C) eliminating the use of Government funds or guarantees \n     to support or ensure the financial viability of single desk \n     exporters; and\n       (4) the Secretary of Agriculture shall target not less than \n     $100,000,000 from the Export Enhancement Program (title III \n     of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978 (7 U.S.C. 5651 et \n     seq.)) to offset the unfair practices of the Canadian Wheat \n     Board in foreign and domestic markets where United States \n     wheat producers have suffered lost markets due to the \n     Canadian Wheat Board's predatory pricing practices.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 3422.

effective operation of \n     the rule of law by trading partners of the United States.\n       (5) To oppose any attempts to weaken in any respect the \n     trade remedy laws of the United States.\n       (6) To increase public access to international, regional, \n     and bilateral trade organizations in which the United States \n     is a member by developing such organizations and their \n     underlying agreements in ways that make the resources of such \n     organizations more accessible to, and their decisionmaking \n     processes more open to participation by, workers, farmers, \n     businesses, and nongovernmental organizations.\n       (7) To ensure that the dispute settlement mechanisms in \n     multilateral, regional, and bilateral agreements lead to \n     prompt and full compliance.\n       (8) To ensure that the benefits of trade extend broadly and \n     fully to all segments of society.\n       (9) To pursue market access initiatives that benefit the \n     world's

trade \n     liberalization, such as trade in environmental technologies, \n     that also promote protection of the environment.\n       (15) To ensure that existing and new rules of the WTO and \n     of regional and bilateral trade agreements support \n     sustainable development, protection of endangered species, \n     and reduction of air and water pollution.\n       (16) To ensure that existing and new rules of the WTO and \n     of regional and bilateral agreements are written, \n     interpreted, and applied in such a way as to facilitate the \n     growth of electronic

(1) Reciprocal trade in agriculture.--The principal \n     negotiating objective of the United States with respect to \n     agriculture is to obtain competitive opportunities for United \n     States exports of agricultural commodities in foreign markets \n     equal to the competitive opportunities afforded foreign \n     exports in United States markets and to achieve fairer and \n     more open conditions of trade in bulk, specialty crop, and \n     value-added commodities by doing the following:\n       (A) Reducing or eliminating, by a date certain, tariffs or \n     other charges that decrease market opportunities for United \n     States exports, giving priority to those products that are \n     subject to significantly higher tariffs or subsidy regimes of \n     major producing countries and providing reasonable adjustment \n     periods for import sensitive products of the United States, \n     in close consultation with the Congress.\n       (B) Eliminating disparities between applied and bound \n     tariffs by reducing bound tariff levels.\n       (C) Enhancing the transparency of tariff regimes.\n       (D) Tightening disciplines governing the administration of \n     tariff rate quotas.\n       (E) Eliminating export subsidies.\n       (F) Eliminating or reducing trade distorting domestic \n     subsidies.\n       (G) When negotiating reduction or elimination of export \n     subsidies or trade distorting domestic subsidies with \n     countries that maintain higher levels of such subsidies than \n     the United States, obtaining reductions from other countries \n     to United States subsidy levels before agreeing to reduce or \n     eliminate United States subsidies.\n       (H) Preserving United States market development programs, \n     including agriculture export credit programs that allow the \n     United States to compete with other foreign export promotion \n     efforts.\n       (I) Maintaining bona fide food aid programs.\n       (J) Allowing the preservation of programs that support \n     family farms and rural communities but do not distort trade.\n       (K) Eliminating state trading enterprises, or, at a \n     minimum, adopting rigorous disciplines that ensure \n     transparency in the operations of such enterprises, including \n     price transparency, competition, and the end of \n     discriminatory policies and practices, including policies and \n     practices supporting cross-subsidization, price \n     discrimination, and price undercutting in export markets.\n       (L) Eliminating practices that adversely affect trade in \n     perishable or seasonal products, while improving import \n     relief mechanisms to recognize the unique characteristics of \n     perishable and seasonal agriculture. Before commencing \n     negotiations with respect to agriculture, the Trade \n     Representative, in consultation with the Congress, shall seek \n     to develop a position on the treatment of perishable and \n     seasonal food products to be employed in the negotiations in \n     order to develop an international consensus on the treatment \n     of such products in antidumping, countervailing duty, and \n     safeguard actions and in any other relevant area.\n       (M) Taking into account whether a party to the negotiations \n     has failed to adhere to the provisions of already existing \n     trade agreements with the United States or has circumvented \n     obligations under those agreements.\n       (N) Taking into account whether a product is subject to \n     market distortions by reason of a failure of a major \n     producing country to adhere to the provisions of already \n     existing trade agreements with the United States or by the \n     circumvention by that country of its obligations under those \n     agreements.\n       (O) Taking into account the impact that agreements covering \n     agriculture to which the United States is a party, including \n     NAFTA, have had on the agricultural sector in the United \n     States.\n       (P) Ensuring that countries that accede to the WTO have \n     made meaningful market liberalization commitments in \n     agriculture.\n       (Q) Treating the negotiation of all issues as a single \n     undertaking, with implementation of early agreements in \n     particular sectors contingent on an acceptable final package \n     of agreements on all issues.\n       (2) Trade in services.--The principal negotiating objective \n     of the United States with respect to trade in services is to \n     further reduce or eliminate barriers to, or other distortions \n     of, international trade in services by doing the following:\n       (A) Pursuing agreement by WTO members to extend their \n     commitments under the General Agreement on Trade in Services \n     (in this section also referred to as ``GATS'') to--\n       (i) achieve maximum liberalization of market access in all \n     modes of supply, including by removing restrictions on the \n     legal form of an investment or on the right to own all or a \n     majority share of a service supplier, subject to national \n     security exceptions;\n       (ii) remove regulatory and other barriers that deny \n     national treatment, or unreasonably restrict the \n     establishment or operations of service suppliers in foreign \n     markets;\n       (iii) reduce or eliminate any adverse effects of existing \n     government measures on trade in services;\n       (iv) eliminate additional barriers to trade in services, \n     including restrictions on access to services distribution \n     networks and information systems, unreasonable or \n     discriminatory licensing requirements, the administration of \n     cartels or toleration of anticompetitive activity, \n     unreasonable delegation of regulatory powers to private \n     entities, and similar government acts, measures, or policies \n     affecting the sale, offering for sale, purchase, \n     distribution, or use of services that have the effect of \n     restricting access of services and service suppliers to a \n     foreign market; and\n       (v) grandfather existing concessions and liberalization \n     commitments.\n       (B) Strengthening requirements under GATS to ensure that \n     regulation of services and service suppliers in all respects, \n     including by rulemaking, license-granting, standards-setting, \n     and through judicial, administrative, and arbitral \n     proceedings, is conducted in a transparent, reasonable, \n     objective, and impartial manner and is otherwise consistent \n     with principles of due process.\n       (C) Continuing to oppose strongly cultural exceptions to \n     obligations under GATS, especially relating to audiovisual \n     services and service providers.\n       (D) Preventing discrimination against a like service when \n     delivered through electronic means.\n       (E) Pursuing full market access and national treatment \n     commitments for services sectors essential to supporting \n     electronic commerce.\n       (F) Broadening and deepening commitments of other countries \n     relating to basic and value added telecommunications, \n     including by--\n       (i) strengthening obligations and the implementation of \n     obligations to ensure competitive, nondiscriminatory access \n     to public telecommunication networks and services for \n     Internet service providers and other value-added service \n     providers; and\n       (ii) preventing anticompetitive behavior by major \n     suppliers, including service suppliers that are either \n     government owned or controlled or recently government owned \n     or controlled.\n       (G) Broadening and deepening commitments of other countries \n     relating to financial services.\n\n[[Page S4410]]\n\n       (3) Trade in manufactured and nonagricultural goods.--The \n     principal negotiating objectives of the United States with \n     respect to trade in manufactured and nonagricultural goods \n     are the following:\n       (A) To eliminate disparities between applied and bound \n     tariffs by reducing bound tariff levels.\n       (B) To negotiate an agreement that includes reciprocal \n     commitments to eliminate duties in sectors in which tariffs \n     are currently approaching zero.\n       (C) To eliminate tariff and nontariff disparities remaining \n     from previous rounds of multilateral trade negotiations that \n     have put United States exports at a competitive disadvantage \n     in world markets, especially tariff and nontariff barriers in \n     foreign countries in those sectors where the United States \n     imposes no significant barriers to imports and where foreign \n     tariff and nontariff barriers are substantial.\n       (D) To obtain the reduction or elimination of tariffs on \n     value-added products that provide a disproportionate level of \n     protection compared to that provided to raw materials.\n       (E) To eliminate additional

and to require that such briefs be made \n     available to the public, providing appropriate exceptions for \n     only that information included in the briefs which is \n     classified on the basis of national security or that is \n     business confidential.\n       (H) To strengthen rules protecting against conflicts of \n     interest by members of dispute settlement panels and the \n

a sanitary \n     or phytosanitary measure does not in itself create a \n     presumption of inconsistency with the Agreement on the \n     Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, and that \n     the initial burden of proof rests with the complaining party, \n     as set forth in the determination of the Appellate Body in\n     EC Measures Concerning Meat and\n     Meat Products (Hormones), AB-1997-4,\n     WT/DS26/AB/R, January 16, 1998.\n       (ii) Reaffirming that WTO members may take provisional \n     sanitary or phytosanitary measures where the relevant \n     scientific evidence is insufficient, so long as such measures \n     are based on available pertinent information, and members \n     taking such provisional measures seek to obtain the \n     additional information necessary to complete a risk \n     assessment within a reasonable period of time.

standards.\n       (9) Trade-related aspects of intellectual property \n     rights.--The principal negotiating objectives of the United \n     States with respect to trade-related aspects of intellectual \n     property rights are the following:\n       (A) To oppose extension of the date by which WTO members \n     that are developing countries must implement their \n     obligations under the Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of \n     Intellectual Property Rights (in this section also referred \n     to as the ``TRIPs Agreement''), pursuant to paragraph 2 of \n     Article 65 of that agreement.\n       (B) To oppose extension of the moratorium on the \n     application of subparagraphs 1(b) and 1(c) of Article XXIII \n     of the GATT 1994 to the settlement of disputes

technological means to \n     control the use of their works through the Internet and other \n     global communication media, and to prevent the unauthorized \n     use of their works.\n       (E) To prevent misuse of reference pricing classification \n     systems by developed countries as a way to discriminate \n     against innovative pharmaceutical products and innovative \n     medical devices, without challenging legitimate reference \n     pricing systems not used as a disguised restriction on trade.\n       (F)(i) To clarify that under Article 31 of the TRIPs \n     Agreement WTO members are able to adopt measures necessary to \n     protect the public health and to respond to situations of \n     national emergency or extreme urgency, including by taking \n     actions that have the effect of increasing access to \n     essential medicines and medical technologies.\n       (ii) In situations involving infectious diseases, to \n     encourage WTO members that take actions described under \n     clause (i) to also implement policies--\n       (I) to address the underlying causes necessitating the \n     actions, including, in the case of infectious diseases, \n     encouraging practices that will prevent further transmission \n     and infection;\n       (II) to take steps to stimulate the development of the \n     infrastructure necessary to deliver adequate

technologies involved; and\n       (IV) to make reasonable efforts to address the problems of \n     supply of the essential medicines and medical technologies \n     involved (other than by compulsory licensing), consistent \n     with the obligation set forth in Article 31 of the TRIPs \n     Agreement.\n       (iii) To encourage members of the Organization for Economic \n     Cooperation and Development and the private sectors in their \n     countries to work with the United Nations, the World Health \n     Organization, and other\n\n[[Page S4411]]\n\n     relevant international organizations, including humanitarian \n     relief organizations, to assist least-developed and \n     developing countries, in all possible ways, in increasing \n     access to essential medicines and medical technologies \n     including through donations, sales at cost, funding of global \n     medicines trust funds, and developing and implementing \n     prevention efforts and health care infrastructure projects.\n       (10) Transparency.--The principal negotiating objectives of \n     the United States with respect to transparency are the \n     following:\n

any other WTO member affected by the \n     proceeding reasonable notice, in accordance with domestic \n     procedures, of when the proceeding is initiated, including a \n     description of the nature of the proceeding, a statement of \n     the legal authority under which the proceeding is initiated, \n     and a general description of any issues in controversy;\n       (II) gives such persons a reasonable opportunity to present \n     facts and arguments in support of their positions prior to \n     any final administrative action, when time, the nature of the \n     proceeding,

\n     administrative tribunals (impartial and independent of the \n     office or authority entrusted with administrative \n     enforcement) or procedures for the purpose of the prompt \n     review and, where warranted, correction of final \n     administrative actions regarding matters covered by any of \n     the WTO Agreements;\n       (II) to ensure that, in such tribunals or procedures, \n     parties to the proceeding are afforded a reasonable \n     opportunity to support or defend their respective positions; \n     and\n       (III) to ensure that such tribunals or procedures issue \n     decisions based on the evidence and submissions of record or, \n     where required by domestic law, the record compiled by the \n     office or authority entrusted with administrative \n     enforcement.\n\n       (B) To pursue a commitment by all WTO members to improve \n     the public's understanding of and access to the WTO and its \n     related agreements by--\n       (i)

that country of its obligations under those \n     agreements.\n       (M) Taking into account the impact that agreements covering \n     agriculture to which the United States is a party, including

that the \n     standards in an agreement do not require use of the least \n     trade restrictive regulatory alternative;\n       (vii) providing an exception for actions taken in \n     accordance with obligations under a multilateral \n     environmental agreement agreed to by both countries involved \n     in the dispute;\n       (viii) providing meaningful procedures for resolving \n     investment disputes;\n       (ix) ensuring that--\n\n       (I) no claim by an investor directly against a state may be \n     brought unless the investor first submits the claim for \n     approval to the home government of the investor;\n       (II) such approval is granted for each claim which the \n     investor demonstrates is meritorious;\n       (III) such approval is considered granted if

independent decisionmaker to determine whether the standard \n     for approval has been satisfied; and\n\n       (x) providing a standing appellate mechanism to correct \n     erroneous interpretations of law.\n       (B) To ensure the fullest measure of transparency in the \n     dispute settlement mechanism established, by--\n       (i) ensuring that all requests for dispute settlement are \n     promptly made public, to the extent consistent with the need \n     to protect information that is classified or business \n     confidential;\n       (ii) ensuring that--\n\n

 delivered goods and services ensures the most liberal trade \n     treatment possible.\n       (E) Where legitimate policy objectives require domestic \n     regulations that affect electronic commerce, to obtain \n     commitments that any such regulations are nondiscriminatory, \n     transparent, and promote an open market environment.\n       (F) To pursue a regulatory environment that

Mr. President, throughout all of my adult life, I \nhave traveled frequently to Israel. I have had the honor of knowing \nalmost all of Israel's principal leaders. As many Americans though I am \nof the Christian faith, I have always felt a strong identity with the \nstruggle of the Jewish people and the survival of the Jewish State.\n  I believe the American relationship with Israel is complex: Our sense \nthat Israel represents the edges of Western civilization; the identity \nof a struggling people simply desiring to survive; the sense of \nhumanity's obligation to the Jewish people who have survived the \nHolocaust; and, of course, an inevitable American identity with a \ndemocracy, a pluralist state that shares our most basic value.\n  Through this association, I have witnessed Israel in many struggles. \nYears ago, all Americans marveled at Israel's ability to overcome \nextraordinary military adversity in the 1967 war facing overwhelming \nconventional arms against them. In 1973, a similar array of armed \nforces having entered the very heart of Israel and being turned back \nwas a demonstration of remarkable courage and sacrifice by the Israeli \npeople. In the years that followed, there was the conventional conflict \nin which Israel's triumph was matched by her ability to stand down \nmounting strategic armaments from the Syrians, the launching of limited \nmissiles from Lebanon.\n  In each of these conflicts, courage, determination, guile, and skill \nallowed Israel to survive. None of these things, however, would have \nprepared any of us for the conflict in which Israel is now engaged. \nPrevious generations overcoming strategic weapons and conventional \nweapons and the guerrilla warfare of the war of independence are in \nsome ways little preparation for what the current generation of \nIsraelis are experiencing. It is the ultimate test of any Western \nsociety. It goes to the heart of the ability of any country to be able \nto endure when terrorism strikes the center of our cities, destroys our \nfamilies, interrupts our means of transportation, denies the ability of \nour economies to function, our democracies to vibrantly engage in \ndebate in the prospect of such terror.\n\n  It is a conflict not simply between two sides but two centuries, two \nconcepts of life, two abilities to organize society.\n  I felt confident in Israel's previous wars, despite the odds, the \noverwhelming weapons, or the disparity of manpower because courage and \nintellect would dictate the result. There is no amount of courage, no \namount of intellect that can face down a terrorist bombing. This is a \ndifferent war. It is dangerous.\n  My concern is amplified by the voices in Asia and Europe that were \nonce so sympathetic to the struggling Jewish State that are now at best \nsilent and often giving comfort to Israel's enemies. Those Europeans \nwhich shared American responsibility for the children of the Holocaust \nsomehow have forgotten. Those in Europe who admired the courage of the \nIsraelis in building a democracy are silent. Those Europeans who in \nevery case would reach out to another democratic society with an \nidentification, a brotherhood of pluralist democracies, now seem to \nfail to find any identity in Israel.\n  There are so many emotions that this brings forward for Americans. It \nshould thus be said at the outset, if in this struggle Israel and \nAmerica must stand alone, then Israel and America never stood in better \ncompany.\n  In this struggle, victory will not be by the numbers. We will not be \nintimidated by the coalitions or silenced by the critics. This is a \nfight about principle. And the strength of the Jewish cause in Israel \nmay best be defined by its objectives. Jews want to survive in their \nown homeland. This is not a struggle about conquest or wealth or \nnational pride; it is survival. Jews stay in Israel or they die with \ntheir backs to the sea. That is what the struggle is about.\n  I recognize that many of our European friends, for their own economic \nor political reasons, may no longer identify with Israel. They may have \nmade their arrangements elsewhere.\n  History has a short memory. To them, the obligations of the Holocaust \nor the promise to the Jewish people of their homeland may be a distant \nmemory. Maybe Israel and America will fight alone, but it should not be \nforgotten that we may fight alone, but this is not our fight alone.\n  If terrorism succeeds in Israel, who among us would doubt that its \nnext battlefield will be Europe? Certainly no\n\n[[Page S4425]]\n\none in my State of New Jersey doubts that it will be America. We have \nseen terrorism.\n  Woodrow Wilson once said that America's two best friends were the \nAtlantic and the Pacific. They have become very little friends. \nTerrorism in another part of the world, halfway around the globe, \noffers no comfort to any American by its distance; it can be here \ntomorrow.\n  The fight for Israel's security is the fight for the security of \nevery free nation, whether they are aligned with Israel, whether they \nwish Israel well. She fights our fight, and her fate is our fate.\n  There are many obstacles to a peaceful resolution in the Middle East. \nI believe profoundly that there will never be a military answer to the \nconflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis. These are two \npeople of some common ancestry who live in a shared land. Both will \nlearn to live together.\n  As profoundly as I believe in a peace process, I am also convinced \nthat unless the Palestinian Authority understands that terrorism will \nnot succeed, that there is no military answer, and that at all costs \nIsrael will survive, no negotiated settlement is possible.\n\n  There are those who may think that their military operations at the \nmoment give them advantage in negotiations. There are others who \nbelieve their military operations hold not the promise of the West Bank \nand Gaza as a Palestinian State, but the destruction of the Jewish \nState in its entirety. To them, there is not a Palestinian State \nenvisioned in the West Bank and Gaza, but in Haifa and Tel Aviv and \nJerusalem.\n  I have never represented any cause in the Middle East other than a \nnegotiated settlement. I believe profoundly in the peace process as \nessential to the survival of Israel and in the interest of the \nPalestinian people, but I refuse to counsel Israel that it should \nnegotiate with people bent on its destruction, or that it is of any \nvalue to engage in peace negotiations as long as their adversaries \nbelieve that a military victory is possible and Israel's entire \ndestruction conceivable.\n  It is almost axiomatic to declare that peace negotiations and peace \nsettlements are historically nothing but a reflection of the realities \non the battlefield. The reality that Americans and Israelis see is two \npeople in a common land who need their own homelands. That makes peace \nnegotiations by Americans or Israelis not only possible but inevitable. \nBut no nation can negotiate with itself, nor can peace be unilaterally \ndeclared.\n  Unless the Palestinians, and not simply the Palestinian Authority but \nimportant elements of the society, recognize that such military \noutcomes are impossible, only then will peace negotiations be \nmeaningful.\n  There are those in America who genuinely believe that by pressuring \nIsrael not to respond militarily, not to seek terrorists in their own \nterritory, we are giving good advice to the Israeli Government.\n  It is a difficult argument to understand in an American context. Who \nin this Senate would be counseling the U.S. Government, after a \nterrorist attack, to exercise restraint? Which Member of the Senate \nwould suggest to our own military, if Chicago or Miami or Los Angeles \nwere to fall victim to a terrorist attack, that we should not respond? \nWhich part of the American arsenal would you withhold if it were \nAmerican cities experiencing bombings, American buses being destroyed, \nAmerican children losing their limbs?\n  I dare to say there is not a Member of this Senate who would urge \nrestraint or withhold a single weapon in our arsenal. The Palestinians \nmay believe there is little for them to be grateful for today. Their \ncities are being destroyed. The Israeli Army has occupied parts of the \nWest Bank. Gaza awaits an invasion. There is something, however, for \nwhich they should be grateful. If it were the United States of America \nthat endured these attacks and not Israel, the response they have \nexperienced from the Israeli Army would be a small shadow of the \nproblems that would be visited upon them.\n  Finally, there are those in the Senate who wonder, with Israelis \nhaving to respond with their lives, the Israeli economy in shambles, \nwhat is it any American can do? How is it that in this moment of crisis \nwe can exercise true fidelity with Israel in its fight for survival? \nOur words are important. So is our presence in Israel.\n  Nothing would demonstrate more our commitment to Israel than Members \nof Congress, like the American people themselves, being present, \nexhibiting courage, showing our commitment.\n  In this Senate, we 100 have a different opportunity. The fight for \nIsrael's survival is not only militarily decided, it is also \neconomically decided. The Clinton administration 18 months ago, after \nthe withdrawal from Lebanon, pledged Israel $450 million for \nsupplemental assistance. It was to compensate for the withdrawal, to \nhelp recreate a security zone in the north of Israel, and for missile \ndefense.\n  That money was never provided. Regrettably, the Bush administration \nnever even included it in its recommendations for the Congress this \nyear. At a time when Israelis look across the sea to America for \nconfidence of their own survival, broken American promises are not \nhelpful. Indeed, they are troubling. The first thing this Congress can \ndo is ensure that every commitment is kept, all resources are given. In \nthe current stage of this fight against terrorism, despite all the \nsacrifices of September 11 and the courage of our soldiers in \nAfghanistan, at this moment most Americans are not asked to sacrifice \nwith their lives. We have experienced that before. It may come again. \nAt this moment, the sacrifice is Israeli. The least we can do is help \nthem with the means to win this war.\n  All of us look for the words telegraphed around the world to those \nwho believe that the Jewish state was both created and will die in a \nsingle generation, words to put at rest those who are committing their \nenergy and their resources to this war on terrorism against Israel. \nHere are mine: Israel is forever. As long as there is a United States \nof America, there will be an Israel. It took 2,000 years for the Jewish \npeople to get home. They have been there for a single generation. They \nare not leaving. Those in Europe who would counsel or comfort her \nenemies, those in the Middle East who are bent on her destruction, \nwould do best to accept that reality.\n  There is land enough for all peoples to decide their own governments \nand design their own futures.
