Mr. President, for the third time in as many weeks, \nSenator Graham and some of his Democrat colleagues have announced a \nmostly partisan Medicare prescription drug plan.\n  When it comes to prescription drug plans, it seems like Senator \nGraham and his friends have tried everything.\n  They tried sunsets. They tried fixed copayments. They even tried \nlimiting coverage for many brand name drugs seniors rely on. They tried \nspending $800 billion. They tried spending $600 billion. Each time they \ntried, they failed.\n  Today, to the tune of $400 billion, they're trying something else \nentirely.\n  Despite their earlier calls for a universal, comprehensive benefit, \nSenator Graham and his Democrat colleagues are trying to cut out the \nbulk of seniors altogether by covering only those with low incomes and \nextremely high drug costs.\n  This proposal is the same as the first two from Senator Graham, \nexcept that it eliminates the prescription drug benefit for the 75 \npercent of Medicare beneficiaries with average incomes who will have \nspending less than $4,000 in 2005.\n  This means that the average senior, who will spend $3,059 on \nprescription drugs in 2005, according to CBO, gets nothing, no coverage \nat all.\n  That's quite a coverage gap. Or, to use a phrase that's become \ncommonplace around here, that's quite a ``donut.'' In fact, that lack \nof coverage--from $0 to $4,000 for most beneficiaries--is the biggest \n``donut'' of them all.\n  I find this last fact especially ironic since it was these very same \nDemocrats who last week said they wanted a comprehensive, universal \nprescription drug benefit in Medicare without any coverage gaps.\n  Besides having the biggest gap of them all, today's plan from Senator \nGraham will still cost the taxpayers more than $400 billion, even \nthough it provides no basic coverage at all for the average senior.\n  And the latest try from Senator Graham still requires the government \nto decide which medicines to make available to the few seniors who \nqualify for coverage.\n  It is often said that the third try's a charm. I'm sorry to say that \nin this case, it isn't. It isn't even close.\n  Now, you might wonder whether there is another alternative that can \nget affordable coverage to all seniors, regardless of income.\n  I am happy to report that there is.\n  For $30 billion less than the latest plan from Senator Graham, it is \npossible to have a far better drug benefit that helps all seniors based \non the tripartisan approach.\n  The tripartisan proposal costs only $370 billion, including \nimprovements to Medicare besides a meaningful drug benefit.\n  The tripartisan proposal lowers prices for all drug purchases due to \nnegotiated discounts, and provides 50% coinsurance after a $250 \ndeductible, up to $3,450 in drug spending.\n  It also provides catastrophic protection above $3,700 in spending--\nbetter protection than in the more expensive Democrat plan before us \ntoday. All this is possible while spending billions less.\n  The tripartisan proposal also strengthens and improves Medicare by \nadding a voluntary, enhanced fee-for-service option. The new option \nprovides protection against serious illness costs--something missing \nfrom Medicare today.\n  The new option also provides better protection against \nhospitalization costs and free preventive benefits. And seniors who \nwant to keep the same basic Medicare they have today can do so if they \nwish. Everyone has access to affordable prescription drug coverage.\n  The bottom line is, the tripartisan proposal, at an official cost of \n$370 billion, provides more generous prescription drug coverage for all \nseniors at a lower cost to taxpayers then the current Democrat plan, \nwhich leaves half of seniors with nothing at all at a cost of $400 \nbillion.\n  I will close by saying against that none of these attempts would have \nbeen necessary, had the Finance Committee been given the right to work \nits bipartisan will on a prescription drug proposal of its own.\n  If the committee process had been followed, we could have built \nbipartisan consensus and presented the Senate with a compromise \nproposal that could get 60 votes.\n  Instead, Senator Graham, along with some of the Democrat caucus, has \ncome to the floor time and time again this month with partisan \nproposals that get worse by the minute and that stand no chance of \nattracting bipartisan support.\n  In that regard, today's proposal is not different from the others. \nIt's another partisan poison pill.\n  This pill, however, is more dangerous than those before it. It leaves \nmost of our seniors out in the cold, does nothing to contain increasing \ndrug costs, and carries an all too expensive pricetag. I urge my \ncolleagues to reject it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, on June 25, a little over a month ago, I \nspoke on the Senate floor about the issue of the United Nations \nPopulation Fund. At that time, I called on the President to release the \nfunding for this organization. This is funding we had appropriated in \nthe Congress last December.\n  I was extremely disappointed to learn that the Bush administration \nhas now decided to eliminate the funding for the U.N. Population Fund. \nOnce again, the administration has chosen to approach an issue \nunilaterally instead of to cooperate internationally with our allies. \nOnce again, the administration has chosen domestic politics over the \nhealth and safety of women around the world.\n  The administration's decision is contrary to the finding of the \nadministration's own expert panel. The administration did set up a \npanel and asked them to look into the issue to determine whether or not \nthere was a problem that should prevent them from making this funding \navailable.\n  That panel determined not only that the UNFPA, the United Nations \nPopulation Fund, does not condone or support in any way the violations \nof human rights or internationally agreed upon standards for family \nplanning, it further found that the Fund is a force for progress, and \nthat is a sentiment with which Secretary Powell himself publicly and \nwholeheartedly agreed when the panel came out with their announcement.\n  The United Nations Population Fund works in over 150 countries. They \nhelp to give women around the world access to reproductive health care \nand family planning services, as well as services to ensure safe \npregnancy and delivery.\n  The U.N. Population Fund has been working in China and around the \nworld to encourage nations to expand the availability of voluntary \nfamily planning information and services so that people everywhere have \nthe right to decide freely and responsibly the number and the spacing \nof their children. The Fund is also a leader in the global effort to \nprevent the spread of HIV/AIDS.\n  From everything I have been able to read, it is clear that the U.N. \nPopulation Fund does not perform or support performing abortions in any \nway. Anyone who says that Fund does support that activity just has not \nlooked into the issue as this expert panel has.\n  The U.N. Population Fund is a United Nations organization governed by \nthe governments that make up the United\n\n[[Page S7447]]\n\nNations. Many of these governments fundamentally oppose abortion, and \nthey would never let the United Nations Population Fund be involved in \nsupplying abortions. The UNFPA is simply a tool of the member nations \nthat is designed to implement their will, and that will is to help the \nmost desperate women and their families in some of the poorest \ncountries in the world who are suffering every day in very terrible \nways.\n  The $34 million we are discussing that has been denied by the \nadministration to be used as the Congress intended would directly \ncontribute to effective modern contraception for over 1 million \ncouples. This $34 million would prevent over 100,000 unwanted \npregnancies. It would prevent a quarter of a million unwanted births. \nIt would help women avoid over 200,000 abortions and prevent thousands \nof maternal and child deaths in the same effort.\n  Further, the Fund's policies of constructive engagement in China have \nbeen shown to result in much-needed progress and a reduction in some of \nthe worst violations of human rights in that country.\n  The administration's decision is another affront to the world's \nwomen. It follows on the administration's decision to impose the global \ngag rule on family planning providers, and also it follows upon the \nadministration's unwillingness to champion the international treaty on \nthe rights of women.\n  I hope that the Senate, when we consider the foreign operations \nappropriations bill--and I assume we will either this week or shortly, \nwhen we return in September--will have broad support for the $50 \nmillion that hopefully will be included for the United Nations \nPopulation Fund in this upcoming fiscal year.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I am glad to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Byrd has given a number of speeches in recent days \non and off the floor about separation of powers; that we, the \nlegislative branch, do something and the power is taken away by the \nexecutive branch of the Government. This is a perfect example; would \nthe Senator agree?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I do agree this is a perfect example. \nThis is a case where the Congress made a very clear decision to provide \nassistance to this United Nations Population Fund. It did give the \nadministration discretion to look into the question of whether there \nwere human rights problems, and the administration looked into it, and \nits own panel determined there were not. Yet in spite of that, the \nadministration made a decision to withhold the funds. So I agree \nentirely with the statement of the Senator from Nevada that this is a \ncase where the administration is acting contrary to the clear intent of \nthe Congress.\n  Mr. REID. I so appreciate the statement of the Senator from New \nMexico for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that it seems \nthose who oppose abortion the most are those who fight against us for \nthese moneys; is that not a fair statement?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, again, let me respond by saying that is \nmy clear impression as well. The estimates which I have given in my \nfloor statement are that there will be in the range of 200,000 \nabortions performed as a result of our Government, our administration, \nwithholding this money.\n  I think those who are opposed to abortion are finding an odd way to \npursue that goal by trying to keep these funds from being expended.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask my friend, it is also true, is it not, \nthat the 200,000 abortions are for a year's period of time? Over the \nyears when we have been prevented, as we have on other occasions by \nRepublican administrations, from letting this money go forward, \nhundreds of thousands of abortions each year are performed that would \nnot have to be performed but for our not having this money; is that \nright?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, in response, I say that is right. \nObviously, the work of an organization such as this United Nations \nPopulation Fund can only be effective if they can put in place programs \nthey can then sustain over a period of years and actually do some \neducational efforts in these underdeveloped countries. That is what is \nso unfortunate about the decision of the administration to withhold \nfunds this year. We will have a chance, once again, to appropriate \nadditional funds for the new fiscal year, but this year has been lost, \nand unfortunately there are other years, previous years, where our \nopportunity to help solve these problems has been squandered.\n  Mr. REID. I also ask my friend: It is true, is it not, that these \nprograms are voluntary in nature, educational in nature, people are \nlearning how to prevent pregnancies? Is that one of the programs that \nis involved?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. In response to my friend's question, that is clearly \nthe main thrust of this funding. It is to provide much-needed \ninformation to desperately poor women in these countries so they can \nmake voluntary decisions about what they want to do, how many children \nthey want to have, and what their options are as they move ahead. These \nare all voluntary programs by definition.\n  Mr. REID. Would my friend also acknowledge that these programs \ninvolve in various places well-baby programs to teach women how to take \ncare of babies, and also prenatal care, which is such an important \npart, to countries outside the United States where these monies could \ngo? Is that true?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Again, let me respond by saying that is very true. The \nthrust of these efforts is to reduce the incidents of mothers dying \nwhile giving birth, reduce the incidents of child deaths, infant \ndeaths. Clearly, that is the main thrust of what we are trying to \naccomplish with these funds.\n  Mr. REID. Finally, I ask my friend, so I understand the numbers, as a \nresult of this political ideology, just for this year alone, there are \ngoing to be 500,000 unwanted pregnancies; there will be 250,000 \nunwanted births, for lack of a better way to describe it, and some \n200,000 abortions; is that a fair summary of the numbers?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. In response, those are the right numbers. I will go \nthrough them once more. The estimate we have is that this $34 million \nthe Congress appropriated last December, it was intended to provide \neffective, modern contraception for over a million couples to prevent \nover 500,000 unwanted pregnancies, to prevent a quarter of a million \nunwanted births and to help women avoid over 200,000 abortions. So that \nis what we estimate that funding would be able to accomplish. Now, \nobviously, none of that will be accomplished during this fiscal year.\n  Mr. REID. I said I had one last question, and this will be the last \nquestion: One of the programs involved, by virtue of what they are \ndoing, would also prevent the spread of HIV; is that true?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. In response to my friend from Nevada, that is the major \nthrust of this effort. As good information is given to parents, to \nmothers, about these issues, good education and information can also be \nprovided about how to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, which is an \nenormous problem, a terrible tragedy afflicting many of the undeveloped \ncountries in the world.\n  Mr. REID. Which is costing American taxpayers money; is that also \ntrue?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. That is exactly right. We are spending a very \nsubstantial amount in trying to deal with the problem of HIV/AIDS in \nthe world. We are being called upon by many of the world's leaders to \nspend substantially more, and, frankly, I think the drumbeat for us to \nspend more and more to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS will continue to \ngrow.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. I appreciate very much the statement of the Senator from \nNew Mexico. He is right on point with the critical issue facing the \nworld, and it is a relatively small amount of money we are talking \nabout with all the other monies being spent. This is one that will \nbring back dividends to our country. And even if it did not--which it \nwill--it is the right thing to do.\n  As I have said, for political ideology, for the people who cry out \nagainst abortion, they are the ones who are opposing what we are trying \nto do to prevent abortions. This is hard for me to comprehend. It is \nwrong, and I hope people in the administration will weigh in.\n  I was very disappointed in Secretary of State Powell for making this \nannouncement when in the past he had said what a great program this was \nwe had going, and then, because of others, I guess, who have more power \nthan he, he came out and gave this wishy-washy\n\n[[Page S7448]]\n\nstatement about this program money being cut. I do not think his heart \nwas in it, and I am certain his head was not, but I guess there are \ncertain things one has to do. I hope he will not be doing other things \nlike this that appear on the surface so wrong and something he \napparently disagrees with so vehemently.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the call of the \nquorum, which I would suggest, the time be charged equally against both \nsides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will visit for a few minutes about \nmedical malpractice, which we will deal with tomorrow. Part of the bill \noriginally had to do with pharmaceuticals. We have had a hard time \nfocusing on pharmaceuticals. The amendment I will discuss expands \nhealth care access and has to do with the additional cost brought about \nby the difficulty arising with lawsuits and medical liability. We need \nsome reform in this area.\n  In my State of Wyoming, the Wyoming Medical Society has been very \nconcerned. Insurers have been pulling out of the markets or increasing \npremiums that are above affordable levels. It is a substantial problem. \nThe crisis is now in Casper, WY. Of course, it is all over the country \nas well. We are beginning to lose some of the practitioners. That is \ndifficult, particularly in an underserved area.\n  I rise today to support the McConnell amendment on medical \nmalpractice tort reform. The Senate passed this exact language in 1995. \nThere is little reason we should not pass it again. Physicians alone \nspent $6.3 billion in malpractice insurance premiums last year. This \ndoes not include what other providers such as hospitals have paid. This \namendment is a good step in the right direction to reduce or limit the \ncost of health care to all persons.\n  The McConnell amendment does a number of things, all of which are \nvery important and necessary. It limits punitive damages to two times \nthe sum of compensatory damages. The amendment only allows punitive \ndamages in cases where the award has been by clear and convincing \nevidence. It also places limits on attorney's fees, limiting lawyers to \ncollecting a third of the first $150,000 of an award and 25 percent of \nthe award for amounts above $150,000. It requires lawsuits be filed \nwithin 2 years of the claimant's discovery of the injury. It encourages \nStates to develop alternative dispute resolution mechanisms to help \nresolve issues before the court.\n  It seems to me it is a step in the right direction in doing something \nabout these costs. Some of the premiums that physicians are required to \npay to practice are amazing. The result is many retreat from practice \nare particularly those in Medicare where relatively low fees are being \npaid.\n  Median malpractice awards increased by 43 percent in 2002 to $1 \nmillion; 52 percent of all jury awards are now over $1 million. These \nexcessive awards only contribute to the overall costs of health care \nfor all Americans. Since awards drive up malpractice premiums and \nphysicians must pass that on to their consumers, health insurance \npremiums for everyone continue to go up.\n  Many Americans are not now able to afford health insurance. They are \ncurrently 40 million uninsured Americans.\n  Recent reports show that medical malpractice is responsible for 7 \npercent or $5 billion of the overall increases in health care costs. \nLast year, one of the largest physician insurers in the Nation stopped \nits medical malpractice business. As a direct result, some doctors and \nhospitals see their premiums rising 20 to 100 percent. Some specialists \nare paying over $100,000 a year in premiums. Obstetrics is a particular \nproblem. Hospitals in two rural counties in West Virginia have stopped \ndelivering babies; half of 93 obstetricians in Clark County no longer \naccept new patients. One Nevada obstetrician closed her 10-year \npractice after her malpractice premiums went from $37,000 to $150,000. \nAll of this, of course, must come from the patients.\n  It is clear something needs to be done to address this growing \ncrisis. According to the American Medical Association, 12 States are in \ncrisis now; 30 are showing signs of being in crisis; 8 are currently \nOK.\n  I hope as we talk about this tomorrow, we can do some things that \nstart us moving in the right direction. The cost of health care is \ncertainly an important issue to all of us. We have to deal with it in \npharmaceutical costs. We have sought to deal with it by getting \nphysicians into underserved areas by various means. But one of the ways \nthat is important and has changed is the matter of the cost of medical \nmalpractice tort reform. I hope we can deal with it tomorrow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING President pro tempore.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak about \nthe gallant men, nine miners from Somerset County in my State of \nPennsylvania, who went through a most extraordinary ordeal--77 hours \ntrapped in a mine. The eyes and ears of the world were on Somerset \nCounty, people wondering if it was possible for men in an underground \nmine shaft, immersed in water reportedly 4 feet to 5 feet high, no \nfood, no communication with the outside world--people wondered whether \nthose men could survive. Almost in a miraculous way, finally, through \nthe extraordinary efforts of Federal, State, and local rescuers, those \nnine men were rescued at 2:44 a.m. on Sunday, just yesterday. Their \nordeal started on Wednesday, July 24, at 9 p.m., and ended on Sunday \nmorning, July 28 at 2:44 a.m.\n  People are in amazement around the world, at their successful \nrescues. It is very unusual, very odd to say the least, that a small \ncounty in western Pennsylvania, more than 50 miles southeast of \nPittsburgh, would be the focus of so much international attention.\n  Last September 11, as we all know, a flight crashed into Somerset, \none of the four hijacked by terrorists on September 11, the flight \nwidely believed to be headed to this building, the Capitol of the \nUnited States. No one can be sure--some have speculated it might have \nbeen headed to the White House--but the speculation was that the plane \nwhich crashed into the Pentagon was headed to the White House.\n  In any event, Somerset County was the site of an international \ntragedy less than a year ago. It is more than lightning, but to have \nlightning, so to speak, strike twice in such a small county in western \nPennsylvania is unusual. But this time, instead of tragedy, instead of \nthe loss of lives, these men were rescued.\n\n  In an era where there is so much bad news around the world, so much \ndifficulty with terrorism around the world, the problems with the \nPalestinian terrorists against Israel, the grave difficulties between \nIndia and Pakistan over Kashmir, the differences and fighting between \nthe North Koreans and South Koreans and all the problems of Africa--and \nthat litany could be the subject of a lengthy conversation--to find a \nbright spot, find a success, find a rescue, is certainly more than a \nbreath of fresh air for the entire world but especially, of course, for \nthe miners who were involved: Mr. Randy Fogle, Mr. Harry Blaine \nMayhugh, Mr. Thomas Foy, Mr. John Unger, Mr. John Phillippi, Mr. Ronald \nHileman, Mr. Dennis Hall, Jr., Mr. Robert Pugh, and Mr. Mark Popernack.\n  Representing Pennsylvania, as I have for some 22 years now, I have \nobviously been intimately connected with the issue of the coal miners, \nwith some 30 billion tons of bituminous in western Pennsylvania and 7 \nbillion tons of anthracite in northeastern Pennsylvania and the mining \nindustries being struggling industries, this industry has taken up a \ngreat deal of time--not only of mine, but of the entire Pennsylvania \ndelegation, really beyond the Pennsylvania delegation.\n\n[[Page S7449]]\n\n  I have had occasion to go underground. I must say it is an eerie, \ndesolate feeling to take one of those elevators down about 20 stories \nand then hunch over, in the miner's gear with a little light on your \ncap, and lean backwards in a rail car which moves several miles \nunderground because you can't sit up straight, there isn't sufficient \nroom. I have marveled at the courage and the tenacity of the miners who \ngo into those deep mines, day after day after day, risking life and \nlimb.\n  There was a time not too long ago when a thousand miners a year were \nkilled there. Fortunately, with mine safety, that situation has \nimproved materially, but it is still a very risky line of work.\n  I got through today to Mr. Ron Hileman who lives in Gray, PA, and \ntalked to him about his experiences. As you might imagine, he is a real \nhero. When I said to Mr. Hileman that he was a hero, he dissented, but \nthat is the way heroes are. They do not acknowledge being heroes.\n  We talked about being in that enclosed area with 60 million gallons \nof water pouring in. A miner of 27 years with a wife and two children, \nof course, the joy in the Hileman family was overwhelming. Mr. Hileman \nexpressed his own very deep gratitude.\n  I asked him what had happened. I asked him if the maps might have \nforetold the problem.\n  He said no because the maps did the best they could. But when other \nminers came in adjacent, as Mr. Hileman put it, some of the miners \nwould snatch a little extra coal--go a little extra distance and go \nbeyond the line which they had and into another area. Then, when the \nminers went down there last week, they ran into an old mine shaft. The \nold mine shaft had caused the enormous problem with the flooding.\n  I want to pay tribute to Pennsylvania's Governor, Mark Schweicker, an \ninternational figure, a hero in his own right--and for good cause--on \nthe job, persevering, leading Federal, State, and local officials, \nmeeting with the families. I talked to him over the weekend and he was \nthere, on the job, and certainly deserves the commendation, not only of \nPennsylvania but the commendation of the Nation, the commendation of \nthe world.\n  This accident points up the need for greater concern for miners' \nsafety as they are performing very important work, providing energy, \nproviding coal, providing a resource in our effort to try to free \nourselves from the dominance of OPEC oil. With progress in clean coal \ntechnology, as I have said on this floor on many occasions, the coal \nindustry across America, Pennsylvania, West Virginia to Wyoming and \nbeyond, could provide that alternative source of energy.\n  When I look over what we have done on the subcommittee for the \nDepartment of Labor appropriations going back to September of 1981, \nthere were efforts to reduce the mine surface inspections from twice a \nyear to once a year. Many of us resisted, and that was stopped.\n  We had a mining hearing August 1991 where there were operators who \nwere tampering with coal mine dust devices. Then there have been \nefforts made to cut the Mine Safety and Health Administration \nrepeatedly.\n  This body, the U.S. Senate, and Senator Harkin, as ranking member in \n1995 when I took over the chairmanship, and now Senator Harkin as \nchairman, on a bipartisan approach has maintained the safety funding so \nthat where there have been efforts to cut, we have resisted. We \nmaintain the black lung clinics.\n  I believe that this is a good day for the United States and the U.S. \nSenate to pay tribute to the coal miners of America for what they are \ndoing for the Nation by providing needed energy for domestic purposes \nand also for national security.\n  Especially thanks for the rescue of the nine mine workers; and we pay \ntribute to those men and their families and to the heroic rescuers led \nby Governor Schweiker that brought them to safety.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, how much time remains on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Seven minutes 43 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you. I have a more extensive speech, but I will limit \nmy remarks so that the Senator from North Dakota will have his full \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/29/senate-section/article/S7449-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7449-S7450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FOREST MANAGEMENT\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I just returned from a normal weekend. On \nFridays, my wife and I usually go to Wyoming, and we come back on \nSunday night, which actually turns out to be Monday morning by the time \nwe make the trip. This time I was able to concentrate a little bit of \ntime in the area just outside Yellowstone Park, on the east side of \nYellowstone Park between Cody and the park. I was there last year.\n  There was a fire inside Yellowstone Park. I wanted to see how the new \nfire plan was working. I got a very extensive and excellent tour. It \nwas educational, but it pointed out some problems that need to be taken \ncare of in the West.\n  Of course, those problems wouldn't be quite as extensive except for \nthe drought we are having. This is the third year of the drought in \nWyoming. One of our lakes in the northern part of the State that drains \nup into Montana is dropping almost 2 feet a week. It is down 125 feet \nfrom its normal level. Most lakes in the Nation would be dry if they \nwere down 125 feet. This one still has some water, but it doesn't have \nboating anymore. That not only affects recreation in the area; it \naffects the communities in the area because they do not get the \nrevenues they would normally get from tourism and visitors.\n  Ranchers are having to sell off there herds. They don't have any \ngrazing because of the drought. This is the third year they have had to \ndiminish their herds. Most of them are completely wiped out from that \naspect.\n  We have another little problem. That is the way the Tax Code is \narranged. The Tax Code says if you have to do an emergency sale and you \nhave some revenue in the next 2 years you can apply that so you don't \nhave to pay taxes. They have been wiped out with the herds, and they \nare going to have to pay taxes because there is no revenue to take it \nagainst.\n  There are many peripheral issues that happen with the drought.\n  We need to concentrate in this body on fire prevention in our \nforests. This is what some of the forests look like right now--just \ntremendous blazes. You can see the way the tinder lays up in layers. It \nforms a chimney, and it goes to the top of really big trees. When it \ngets to the top of the trees, the fire itself creates a wind. The wind \nwill sway the trees, and the trees throw the crown a half mile away to \nstart another fire. Once a fire starts, it can be very extensive.\n  We have a new plan that says put it out as soon as you can. That is \nhelping tremendously. We used to let it burn. We tried to do some of \nwhat they call natural foresting. When natural foresting was actually \nnatural foresting, there weren't people inhabiting those areas.\n  In this particular area near Yellowstone, there is a huge pine needle \nforest because of pine bores. They bore into the trees when they are \nyoung. They eat a circle around the tree, and it kills the tree. Then \nthe tree looks rusty. The next year and the year after, all the needles \nare gone, and it is just a standing dead pine tree.\n  Of course, the best time for it to burn is when it is all rusty. When \nthe needles are dried out and they burn, they form a chimney effect, \ngoing up to the top of the tree. That is how huge parts of the forests \nare between Yellowstone Park and Cody, WY, right now.\n  Those trees need to be taken out. If they are not taken out, a Boy \nScout camp, 12 lodges, and 68 homes will go up in smoke.\n  Last year, when there was a fire in the park, they pointed out the \npine needle forest and the need to get those trees taken out. I have \nbeen working on that since then. We haven't been able to get it done. \nThere are a few very easy court actions that can prohibit that sort of \nthing from happening. But it is absolutely essential.\n\n  Those lodges have post-evacuation plans. As the fire starts, they \nhave to call all their guests in and explain how they are going to be \nable to get out of this valley to keep from being trapped by the fires, \nfires such as these where\n\n[[Page S7450]]\n\nyou can see the animals are having a little bit of concern about how \nthey could be trapped by the fire.\n  That cuts into the tourism. People don't go home and tell about the \ngreat experience they had. They go home and tell about the extreme \npressure they were under with fires. Consequently, they spread the \nadvertising in a very negative way. We want it to be in a positive way.\n  There are things that can be done and that should be done. I will be \ntaking some more time to explain what they are and steps that are being \ntaken by the Forest Service at the moment. But more extensive steps \nneed to be taken.\n  Senator Daschle has an amendment on a supplemental spending bill to \ntake care of some of the problems bordering Wyoming in the Black Hills. \nIt very explicitly allows them to go in and cut down those trees, which \nwill reduce the amount of tinder. There are some ways that we can do \nthat.\n  I introduced a bill, S. 2811, the Emergency Forest Rescue Act of \n2002. That gives the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior the \nability to recognize emergency conditions that exist in the forests and \nallows the land managers to act to protect them from the extreme threat \nof fire, specifically those suffering from drought and high tree \nmortality. Those two circumstances have to be present. It also requires \nthe approval of the Council on Environmental Quality.\n  I have some protections built in and some ability to move forward \nquickly so we don't burn up huge valleys and extend the fire into \nYellowstone Park, which is one of our great natural treasures. In fact, \nall of our forests should be national treasures. Present conditions do \nnot make them as usable as they could be or as pretty as they could be.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in the coming days I assume there will be \na lot of suspender-snapping, back-thumping, chortling, and crowing \nabout the new fast track trade agreement that was announced in the \nweekend press.\n  There was a conference in the House and Senate. They came out with a \nnew trade agreement. The moniker is trade promotion authority. It is a \nfancy way of saying fast-track trade authority for President Bush.\n  I didn't support fast track trade authority for President Clinton, \nand I don't support it for President Bush. This is not a victory for \nour country.\n\n  I assume, this week, because the conference report has passed the \nHouse, it will come to the Senate. We will have speeches by people \nwearing dark suits who talk about how wonderful this is for our \ncountry, what a wonderful thing it is that we now have fast-track trade \nauthority. So some of our trade negotiators can go overseas somewhere, \ngo into a room, close the door, lock it, keep the public out, and \nnegotiate in secret a new trade agreement, and then come back to the \nCongress and say: Here it is. Take it or leave it. No amendments. Up or \ndown. No changes.\n  The people who apparently believe in this do not believe in the first \nlaw of holes; that is, when you find yourself in a hole, stop digging. \nThey believe, if you find yourself in a hole, keep digging, look for \nmore shovels.\n  Let me talk for a moment about where we are with our trade deficits. \nThis chart shows the record trade deficits we have seen over the past \ndecade. When the year 2002 figures are posted, they will be way off the \nchart up here: about a $480 billion trade deficit in goods. That is \nmoney we owe to others, money we owe to people outside this country. \nThey will have a future claim on America's income. This is very serious \nfor our country. Yet we have people walking around here saying: We just \nneed to do more of the same.\n  One of the more recent trade agreements we did was NAFTA. They \npromised us hundreds of thousands of new jobs, if we melded the \neconomies of the United States and Mexico, for trade purposes. I have a \nchart that shows what has happened as a result of NAFTA: 700,000 jobs \nlost.\n  Incidentally, prior to NAFTA, we had a very small trade surplus with \nMexico. After NAFTA, we turned that small surplus into a huge deficit. \nWe had a modest trade deficit with Canada. It turned into a very large \ndeficit. So we have this very large trade deficit now with Canada and \nMexico, and people say: Gosh, that is wonderful; isn't it? No, it is \nnot wonderful. It is moving in the wrong direction.\n  It is not that I don't believe in the global economy and the ability \nof nations and businesses to exchange goods and services back and \nforth. I studied economics, taught economics for a while, and \nunderstand the doctrine of comparative advantage: Doing that which you \ndo best, and trading with others who do what they do best. All of that \nmakes sense to me.\n  But I also think the rules have to be fair, and open markets have to \nbe opened. The rules have to be transparent and fair. And they are not.\n  If I might just give some examples of these rules and the problems \nwith the rules.\n  I use, often, the example of automobile trade with Korea. Korea is a \ngood friend of the United States. South Korea has been an ally of ours \nfor some long while. We have a trading relationship with Korea. But let \nme show you what has happened between the United States and Korea in \none area of trade.\n  Last year, the Koreans shipped 618,000 cars into the United States--\nHyundais, Daewoos--Korean cars. So 618,000 Korean cars came here from \nKorea, and we were able to ship Korea 2,800 cars; in other words, 217 \nto 1. Is it because our cars are bad cars? No, that is not it. It is \nbecause if you try to ship a Ford Mustang to Korea, they will throw up \nall kinds of trade barriers. They just do not want United States cars \nshipped to Korea. They want only for Korean cars to access the American \nmarketplace.\n  Is that fair? No, it is not fair. Does anybody in this country have \nthe backbone and nerve to stand up to another country and say to them: \nLook, we like you a lot. You are allies of ours. We are good friends. \nBut I will tell you what. In international trade, we have a notion of \nfairness. Open your markets to us, and we will open our markets to you. \nBut if you close your markets to the United States, ship your cars to \nNigeria or perhaps Iran, and see how quickly they sell.\n\n  Let's talk about beef exports to Europe. Go to Europe. The Presiding \nOfficer has been in Europe. Pick up a newspaper in Europe--I have been \nthere this year--and you read about European trade restrictions on U.S. \nbeef, allegedly because of hormones. The way they picture it, it is as \nif we are shipping them beef that came from cows with two heads. That \nis the way it is portrayed in the European press. They keep United \nStates beef out of Europe.\n  So our country actually tried to do something about that. We said: \nLook, you either allow United States beef into Europe or we are going \nto take action against you. So, finally, a little bit of backbone from \nour trade representatives, right? Finally, we have some nerve. Finally, \nwe have the good old American spirit and we are going to stand up for \nour producers. We couldn't get beef into Europe, so we took action.\n  Our trade representatives filed a case at the WTO against the \nEuropeans for their restrictions on our beef. The WTO actually ruled on \nit, which itself is a surprise. The WTO said: Europe, you are wrong. \nYou must allow United States beef into Europe. Europe said: It doesn't \nmatter. We are not going to do it. So our trade negotiators said: We \nare going to take action against the Europeans. Do you know what we are \ngoing to do? We are going to retaliate by imposing tariffs on European \ntruffles, goose livers, and Roquefort cheese.\n\n[[Page S7451]]\n\n  Now, that will strike fear in any country, won't it? They will not \nallow our beef in Europe, but we are going to make it tough for them. \nWe are going to take action against truffles, goose livers, and \nRoquefort cheese. Good for us.\n  When, on Earth, will we have the nerve to say to other countries, we \ndemand--we insist--on fair trade?\n  Twelve years ago we reached an agreement with Japan on beef. All the \ntrade negotiators celebrated as if they just won the 100-yard dash in \nthe Olympics, as if they were all wearing gold medals because we \nreached a trade agreement with Japan on beef. But 12 years later, every \nsingle pound of American beef going into Japan still bears a 38.5-\npercent tariff.\n  Try to send T-bones to Tokyo, a 37.5-percent tariff--every pound of \nbeef. We have a $60 to $70 billion trade deficit with Japan, yet we \ncannot get beef into Japan without a tariff near 40 percent. It doesn't \nmake any sense to me.\n  This issue goes on and on. In my part of the country, we face an \navalanche of unfairly subsidized Canadian grain coming in from a \nmonopoly called the Canadian Wheat Board. We can't do a thing about it \nbecause the last trade agreement that came through here limited our \nremedies under section 301. We don't do a thing about it, so this grain \nfloods into our country from Canada. It is unfair.\n  Our Canadian friends, they are good friends of ours, but they are not \nplaying fair with respect to trade and grain. So U.S. wheat producers, \nfamily farmers, put together the information to file a complaint. They \nwon the complaint. The U.S. Trade Representative judged that the \nCanadians, through the Canadian Wheat Board, are engaged in unfair \ntrade.\n  What is the remedy? Well, apparently, according to our trade \nambassador, the remedy is just to say that the Canadians ought to \nreally watch it. No tariffs. No effective actions. No sanctions. Just: \nYou had better watch it. That is not the way to deal with international \ntrade.\n  When this so-called fast-track authority agreement was reached in \nconference, the committee of jurisdiction issued a memorandum \ndescribing what they did in conference and what a terrific deal it is.\n  Trade adjustment assistance: They tripled it. That provides \nassistance with health insurance for displaced workers. So if you lose \nyour job because of these trade agreements, guess what? We are going to \nexchange for your job some health insurance for you. Boy, that is quite \na deal, isn't it?\n  We are going to expand coverage to secondary workers who are affected \nby a firm moving overseas. These trade agreements make it easier to \nmove a firm overseas, so if you lose your job, and if you are not a \nprimary worker but a secondary worker, we are going to cover you for \nthe first time. That is going to make you feel really good as you go \nhome and tell your family: I have lost my job. But guess what. I am a \nsecondary worker, and I think I am covered with some health insurance \nfor a while. I think I am going to get a little health insurance here.\n  There is a pilot program for providing wage insurance for older \nworkers, realizing the difficulty for older workers to change careers. \nWhy would you to have change a career? Because your job just went to \nSri Lanka or Bangladesh or Indonesia, where they are going to do for 20 \ncents an hour what you did for a living wage in this country.\n  There is a new benefit for farmers and ranchers who have been losing \nmoney hand over fist because of price collapses. If they lose money now \nbecause of these new trade agreements, there is a little help for them. \nSomebody takes their market away, we give them just a little bit of \nhelp in trade adjustment assistance. Lose your job? Lose your farm? \nLose your ranch? Guess what. We will help you out a little.\n  The issue, according to these folks, is not about fair trade. The \nfight is about how can we provide assistance to Americans who are going \nto lose their jobs.\n  For me, the question is this: What are the elements of fair trade? \nWhat is price for admission to the American marketplace? We fought for \na century about fair labor standards, about not having children go down \nin coal mines, and not having children work in factories, about \nrequiring safe workplaces, about a minimum wage, about the right to \norganize. Then some companies decided: We can skip all of that. We can \npole vault over all those things. We can hire someone in Indonesia and \npay them 24 cents an hour to make shoes. We don't have to worry about \nall those things we had to worry about in the United States.\n  When we in the Senate were debating the current fast track bill in \nMay, the Presiding Officer offered an amendment which I cosponsored, \nthe Dayton-Craig amendment. It said: If in the next negotiation, there \nis any attempt to weaken the remedies for American producers, \ncountervailing duties, any number of remedies to take action against \nunfair trade, if that is the case, there is going to be a separate vote \nin the Congress on that. The amendment passed in the Senate by a wide, \nbipartisan vote. Sixty one Senators voted for it. But when the bill got \nto conference, the provision got dropped, just got dropped. Instead, we \ngot the right to do a sense-of-the-Senate vote. Well, thank you very \nmuch. You could do that before, and the new provision does nothing to \ndefend our trade laws. It doesn't mean anything. If you just like to be \nhere and put your suit and necktie on to vote for the heck of it, be \nour guest, come and do it, but this doesn't mean anything. They dropped \nan effective provision from the Senate version of the trade bill, one \nthat would have helped producers in this country.\n  They also dropped my amendment that said on investor dispute \nresolutions in NAFTA, proceedings must be open, they must be \ntransparent. The door must be open. The public must see it. Now it is \ndone in secrecy.\n  They dropped my amendment. They dropped anything that was good. Then \nthey put a sort of chocolate coating on things that were bad, sent it \nout here, and said: Hope that tastes good. Well, it doesn't taste good. \nThis doesn't make any sense to us.\n  It is interesting, there is only one view of trade that you can \nembrace these days. We have the largest trade deficit in history; last \nmonth over $41 billion--last month alone. A lot of major papers won't \nrun a piece on the trade deficit on their op-ed page because there is \nonly one view on their op-ed pages: You are either for global trade or \nyou are against it. If you are against it, you are some sort of \nxenophobic isolationist stooge who just doesn't get it. Everybody else \nsees over the horizon. Those who oppose fast track don't.\n  That is one of the most thoughtless approaches to a trade debate I \ncan imagine. We will have a lengthier discussion on this, this week. I \nwill have much more to say.\n  Let me say again, I believe expanded trade is helpful to this country \nprovided expanded trade is fair trade. We have been victimized in so \nmany ways by so many trade agreements--recently, NAFTA and the WTO. You \nname it, I will show you the trade agreement that has expanded our \ntrade deficit, hurt our producers, moved our jobs overseas, and nobody \nseems to care very much. Do you hear one peep on the floor of the \nSenate about the largest trade deficit in history? Just one? I don't \nhear a thing. Yet it hurts this country. It is going to cause this \ncountry serious economic problems in the future.\n  I have so much more to say today, and so little time to say it. I \nwant the Senator from Alaska to have the opportunity to speak for the \nlast 5 minutes. So when this legislation comes to the floor of the \nSenate, I will speak at greater length later in the week. In the \nmeantime, suffice it to say, some of us don't celebrate as much as \nothers when they talk about the ingredients of this conference report \non fast track. This is not advancing our country's interest. It is it \nnot fair to producers and to workers.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. I thank Senator Dorgan for his courtesy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/29/senate-section/article/S7451-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7451-S7452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   COMMEMORATING THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE UNITED STATES EUROPEAN \n                          COMMAND HEADQUARTERS\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I, along with General Joe Ralston, the \nSupreme Allied Commander Europe,\n\n[[Page S7452]]\n\ncommend the past success and continued contributions of those men and \nwomen of our Armed Services who comprise the United States European \nCommand.\n  This Thursday, August 1, the U.S. European Command will celebrate its \n50th anniversary. Over the last 50 years the European Command has \nplayed a critical part in the successful preservation of peace and \nstability in and around Europe, and they continue to do so today.\n  For more than 35 years during the cold war, the primary mission of \nthe European Command Headquarters, established in Frankfurt, Germany in \n1952, was to fulfill United States treaty obligations to NATO by \nproviding combat ready forces to counter the Soviet threat and ensure \npeace in Europe, Africa and portions of the Middle East.\n  With the collapse of the Soviet empire, the responsibilities of the \nEuropean Command changed dramatically. Since that time, it has engaged \nin a wide spectrum of security cooperation activities that have helped \nensure stability and promote Democratic and market-oriented governments \nin countries emerging from Communism and other authoritarian regimes.\n  Simultaneously, it has conducted numerous operations to end regional \nwars, reduce ethnic conflict and limit the suffering caused by man-made \nand natural disasters.\n  Our European Command continues to make valuable contributions today. \nTo conduct security cooperation activities and respond to regional \nthreats to our national interests, The Command typically has \napproximately 117,000 service members, or about eight percent of the \nU.S. active duty military. This is a small investment by any measure \nfor such a vast range of responsibilities across Europe, the Middle \nEast and two-thirds of Africa.\n  As I speak, the European Command is involved in five on-going combat \noperations. Its forces are patrolling the skies over the northern no-\nfly zone to enforce United Nations Security Council Resolutions against \nIraq as part of Operation Northern Watch.\n  In Bosnia and Kosovo, the European Command contributes with our NATO \nallies in Operations Joint Forge and Joint Guardian respectively, to \nensure security, promote stability and allow those fragmented societies \nto rebuild their civil institutions and restore the rule of law.\n  In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, it is providing on-call \nsupport to the international community's monitors working there as part \nof Operation Amber Fox. And, U.S. European Command is making \nsubstantial contributions to Operation Enduring Freedom and to the \nglobal war on terrorism in general. Most recently, it deployed a small \nforce to the Republic of Georgia to train and equip their forces to \nmore effectively protect their own territorial integrity.\n  The invaluable contributions of our military men and women working at \nthe Headquarters--today located in Stuttgart, Germany--have continued \nwithout interruption.\n  The legacy of their service, dedication and accomplishments is to be \nhighly commended, and the importance of their continued contributions \nto future regional peace and to the preservation of our national \ninterests cannot be overstated.\n  On the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the U.S. European \nCommand, it is fitting that we honor the millions of dedicated American \nmen and women who have served, and continue to serve our Nation \noverseas.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, with today's vote, the Senate will confirm \nthe 12th judge to our Federal courts of appeals and our 61st judicial \nnominee since the change in Senate majority last summer. In little more \nthan 1 year, the Senate Judiciary Committee has already voted on 75 of \nthis President's judicial nominees, including 15 nominees to the courts \nof appeals. This is more circuit and district court nominees than in \nany of the previous 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control. In fact, we \nhave given votes to more judicial nominees than in 1996 and 1997 \ncombined, as well as in 1999 and 2000 combined.\n  Despite the partisan din about blockades and stalls and inaction as \nwell as absurd claims that judicial nominees are being held \n``hostage''--the fact is that since the change in majority last summer \nthe Senate, and in particular the Judiciary Committee, has been working \nat a much faster rate than in the 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control. \nWith respect to courts of appeals nominees, we confirmed the first of \nPresident Bush's nominees last July 20 and today we confirm the 12th. \nThat is a confirmation rate of approximately one circuit court nominee \nconfirmed per month. By contrast, in the 76 months in which Republicans \nwere in charge, only 46 courts of appeals judges were confirmed, at a \nrate closer to one every two months. Thus, despite the additional \nobstacles and roadblocks that the partisan practices of the new \nadministration have created and the partisan rhetoric of our critics, \nwe are actually achieving almost twice as much as our Republican \ncounterparts did. With a little cooperation from the administration and \nthe nomination of more moderate, mainstream candidates, we would be \neven further along.\n  During the 76 months under the Republican control before the \nJudiciary Committee was allowed to reorganize, vacancies on the Federal \ncourts rose from 63 to 110. Vacancies on the Courts of Appeals more \nthan doubled from 16 to 33. That is the situation created by Republican \ninaction and that is the situation we inherited. Since the change in \nmajority, confirmations have gone up and vacancies have been going \ndown.\n  Courts of Appeals vacancies are being decreased rather than \ncontinuing to increase, despite the high level of attrition since the \nshift in Senate majority last summer.\n  Indeed, in the last year the Judiciary Committee held the first \nhearing on a Fifth Circuit nominee in 7 years, the first hearing on a \nTenth Circuit nominee in 6 years, the first hearing on a Sixth Circuit \nnominee in almost 5 years, the first hearing on a Fourth Circuit \nnominee in 3 years, the first hearing on a Ninth Circuit nominee in 2 \nyears. This week we held hearings on a third nominee to the Fifth \nCircuit in less than a year. This contrasts with the lack of any \nconfirmation hearing on any of President Clinton's nominees to the \nFifth Circuit in the last 5\\1/2\\ years of Republican control of the \nconfirmation process, despite three qualified nominees to vacancies \nthere.\n  The nominee being considered today is the first nominee to the Sixth \nCircuit to be given a vote by the Senate since 1997.\n  After that, the Republican majority locked the gates and despite a \nnumber of well-qualified nominees sent to the Senate by President \nClinton between 1995 and 2001, none were allowed to receive a hearing \nor a vote for all of 1998, 1999, 2000 and the first 3 months of 2001. \nMost of the vacancies that exist on the Sixth Circuit arose during the \nClinton administration and before the change in majority last summer.\n\n[[Page S7453]]\n\n  Yet not one of the Clinton nominees to those current vacancies on the \nSixth Circuit received a hearing by the Judiciary Committee under \nRepublican leadership.\n  The Sixth Circuit vacancies are a prime and unfortunate legacy of the \npast partisan obstructionist practices under Republican leadership and \none of a number of examples of circuits in which the vacancies were \npreserved rather than filled by the former Republican majority in the \nSenate.\n  That is what created the problem that we are now trying to correct. \nVacancies on the Sixth Circuit were perpetuated during the last several \nyears of the Clinton administration when the Republican majority \nrefused to hold hearings on the nominations of Judge Helene White, \nKathleen McCree Lewis, and Professor Kent Markus to those vacancies in \nthe Sixth Circuit.\n  One of those seats has been vacant since 1995, the first term of \nPresident Clinton. Judge Helene White of the Michigan Courts of appeals \nwas nominated in January 1997 and did not receive a hearing on her \nnomination during the more than 1,500 days before her nomination was \nwithdrawn by President Bush in March of last year.\n  Judge White's nomination may have set one or a number of unfortunate \nrecords for obstruction established during the years 1996-2001. Her \nnomination was pending without a hearing before this committee for over \n4 years 51 months.\n  She was first nominated in January 1997 and renominated and \nrenominated through March of last year when President Bush chose to \nwithdraw her nomination.\n  This was at a time when the committee averaged hearings on only nine \ncourts of appeals nominees a year and, in 2000, held only five hearings \non courts of appeals nominees all year. In contrast, Judge Gibbons was \nthe 11th courts of appeals nominees voted on by the committee during \nthe first 10 months of a Democratic majority.\n  As of today, the Democratic-led Judiciary Committee has held hearings \nfor 17 of President Bush's courts of appeals nominees in less than 13 \nmonths, and we will hold our 18th hearing for a courts of appeals \nnominee this week.\n  Kathleen McCree Lewis, a distinguished lawyer from a prestigious \nMichigan law firm, also did not receive a hearing on her 1999 \nnomination to the Sixth Circuit during the years it was pending before \nit was withdrawn by President Bush in March 2001. She is the daughter \nof Wade McCree, a former Solicitor General of the United States and \nformer Sixth Circuit judge.\n  Professor Kent Markus, another outstanding nominee to a vacancy on \nthe Sixth Circuit that arose in 1999, never received a hearing on his \nnomination before his nomination was returned to President Clinton \nwithout action in December 2000.\n  While Professor Markus' nomination was pending, his confirmation was \nsupported by individuals of every political stripe, including: 14 past \npresidents of the Ohio State Bar Association; more than 80 Ohio law \nschool deans and professors; prominent Ohio Republicans, including Ohio \nSupreme Court Chief Justice Thomas Moyer, Ohio Supreme Court Justice \nEvelyn Stratton, Congresswoman Deborah Pryce, and Congressman David \nHobson; the National District Attorneys Association; and virtually \nevery major newspaper in the State.\n  Professor Markus summarized his experience as a Federal judicial \nnominee in testimony this May in a hearing before Senator Schumer. Here \nare some of things he said:\n\n       On February 9, 2000, I was the President's first judicial \n     nominee in that calendar year. And then the waiting began. . \n     . . At the time my nomination was pending, despite lower \n     vacancy rates than the 6th Circuit, in calendar year 2000, \n     the Senate confirmed circuit nominees to the 3rd, 9th and \n     Federal Circuits. . . . No 6th circuit nominee had been \n     afforded a hearing in the prior two years. Of the nominees \n     awaiting a Judiciary Committee hearing, there was no circuit \n     with more nominees than the 6th Circuit.\n       With high vacancies already impacting the 6th Circuit's \n     performance, and more vacancies on the way, why, then, did my \n     nomination expire without even a hearing? To their credit, \n     Senator DeWine and his staff and Senator Hatch's staff and \n     others close to him were straight with me.\n       Over and over again they told me two things: No. (1) There \n     will be no more confirmations to the 6th Circuit during the \n     Clinton Administration, and No. (2) This has nothing to do \n     with you; don't take it personally it doesn't matter who the \n     nominee is, what credentials they may have or what support \n     they may have--see item number 1. . . .\n       The fact was, a decision had been made to hold the \n     vacancies and see who won the presidential election. With a \n     Bush win, all those seats could go to Bush rather than \n     Clinton nominees.\n\n  As Professor Markus identified, some on the other side of the aisle \nheld these seats open for years for another President to fill, instead \nof proceeding fairly on the consensus nominees pending before the \nSenate. Republicans were unwilling to move forward, even knowing that \nretirements and attrition would create four additional seats that would \narise naturally for the next President. That is why there are now eight \nvacancies on the Sixth Circuit and why it is half empty.\n  Long before some of the recent voices of concern were raised about \nthe vacancies on that court, Democratic Senators in 1997, 1998, 1999, \nand 2000 implored the Republican majority to give the Sixth Circuit \nnominees hearings. Those requests, made not just for the sake of the \nnominees but for the sake of the public's business before the court, \nwere ignored. Numerous articles and editorials urged the Republican \nleadership to act on those nominations, to no avail.\n  Fourteen former presidents of the Michigan State Bar pleaded for \nhearings on those nominations.\n  The former chief judge of the Sixth Circuit, Judge Gilbert Merritt, \nwrote to the Judiciary Committee chairman years ago to ask that the \nnominees get hearings and that the vacancies be filled.\n  The chief judge noted that, with four vacancies--the four vacancies \nthat arose in the Clinton administration--the Sixth Circuit ``is \nhurting badly and will not be able to keep up with its work load due to \nthe fact that the Senate Judiciary Committee has acted on none of the \nnominations to our Court.''\n  He predicted: ``By the time the next President is inaugurated, there \nwill be 6 vacancies on the Courts of appeals. Almost half of the Court \nwill be vacant and will remain so for most of 2001 due to the \nexigencies of the nomination process. Although the President has \nnominated candidates, the Senate has refused to take a vote on any of \nthem.'' Nonetheless, no Sixth Circuit hearings were held in the last 3 \nyears of the Clinton administration, despite these pleas. Not one. \nSince the shift in majority last summer, the situation has been \nexacerbated further as two additional vacancies have arisen.\n  The committee's April 25th hearing on the nomination of Judge Gibbons \nto the Sixth Circuit was the first hearing on a Sixth Circuit \nnomination in almost 5 years, even though three outstanding, fair-\nminded individuals were nominated to the Sixth Circuit by President \nClinton and were pending before the committee for anywhere from 1 year \nto over 4 years. We have not stopped there but have proceeded to hold a \nhearing on a second Sixth Circuit nominee, Professor John Rogers of \nKentucky, and the Judiciary Committee has acted on that nomination, as \nwell.\n  Large numbers of vacancies continue to exist on many courts of \nappeals, in large measure because the recent Republican majority was \nnot willing to hold hearings or vote on more than half--56 percent--of \nPresident Clinton's courts of appeals nominees in 1999 and 2000 and was \nnot willing to confirm a single judge to the courts of appeals during \nthe entire 1996 session. As I have noted, from the time the Republicans \ntook over majority control of the Senate in 1995 until the \nreorganization of the committee last July, circuit vacancies increased \nfrom 16 to 33, more than doubling.\n  Democrats have broken with the Republican majority's history of \ninaction. I certainly understand the frustration of Senator Levin and \nSenator Stabenow. I know first hand the efforts they have made to solve \nthe problems in their circuit. I know that many of us have suggested \nways to the White House to break through and resolve the impasse. As \nthe chairman of the Judiciary Committee, despite my personal doubts and \nreservations about this nominee due to some of her decisions as a \nFederal district court judge, I will vote to confirm her, due to her \noverall record, her testimony before the committee and the strong \nsupport of Senator Thompson.\n\n[[Page S7454]]\n\n  I respect the effort and views of Senator Thompson and want to send \nwhat help we can to the Sixth Circuit. Far from payback for Republican \nactions in the recent past, this action is being taken in spite of \nthose wrongs and to begin solving the problems that they have created.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nominations of \nthree excellent Federal court judges, Judge Julia Smith Gibbons, Joy \nFlowers Conti, and John E. Jones.\n  Judge Gibbons, nominated to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals last \nfall, is a jurist with a find legal mind, a strong work ethic, and a \nwidely admired judicial temperament. I have reviewed few records of \npublic service and personal accomplishment more outstanding than hers. \nIt seems to me that it was for good reason that in 2000 she received a \nrecognition called Heroine for Women in the Law Award.\n  But that is just one of her accomplishments. Judge Gibbons graduated \nmagna cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Vanderbilt University and then \nwith honors from the University of Virginia School of Law, where she \nwas an editor for the Law Review. She went on to clerk for the late \nHonorable William E. Miller on the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, \nwhere we now hope she will soon return after a distinguished career \nwhich has included service as deputy counsel for Governor Lamar \nAlexander and Tennessee State court judge. Since 1983 she has served as \nU.S. District Court Judge for the Western District of Tennessee, \nsitting with the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals several times. Notably \nshe was the first female Federal judge in Tennessee and one of the \nyoungest Federal judges in history.\n  Judge Gibbons exemplifies the qualities of the nominees the President \nhas sent us--superbly accomplished, fully devoted to public service, \nand well prepared for the Federal bench. Judge Gibbons enjoys the \nsupport of Democrats and Republicans and everyone who knows her work. \nShe is backed by her home State legislators. Senator Thompson says she \nis ``an outstanding person and jurist . . .  [who will] serve the court \nwith dignity and distinction.'' Senator Frist has described her a \n``trailblazer for women in the legal profession [who] exemplifies in \nboth her professional and personal life the character that makes us a \ngreat Nation.'' Democratic Congressman Harold Ford, Jr., has noted that \nJudge Gibbons has ``earned a solid reputation of applying the law in a \nmanner consistent with our nation's commitment to equal protection \nunder the law.''\n  Judge Gilbert S. Merritt, whose seat on the Sixth Circuit Judge \nGibbons will occupy, calls her a ``very able and distinguished Federal \njudge'' and adds that he would be ``very happy to be replaced by her on \nour court.''\n  Members of the Memphis, TN, legal community have added their own high \npraise. For example, Pat Arnoult, president of the Memphis Bar \nAssociation, cites her ``keen mind'' and ``good work ethic.'' Charles \nBurson, former chief of staff and legal counsel to former Vice \nPresident Gore and Tennessee attorney general, cites with first hand \nexperience her intellect, knowledge, evenhandedness, and exceptional \njudicial temperament. Judge Gibbons has won the respect and bipartisan \nsupport of legislators, attorneys, Federal judges, and Tennessee \ncitizens.\n  Judiciary Committee unanimously approved Judge Gibbon's nomination on \nMay 2 after a hearing that raised no issues of concern. We have waited \ntoo long to act on her nomination on the Senate floor. With a 50 \npercent vacancy rate in the Sixth Circuit, we cannot afford to delay \nany longer.\n  The two Pennsylvania district court nominees currently on the floor \nalso deserve our full support. Joy Flowers Conti, nominated to the \nWestern District of Pennsylvania, possesses years of civil litigation \nexperience and years of meaningful service and leadership in her \ncommunity. After graduation from Duquesne University School of Law, \nwhere she graduated summa cum laude and finished first in her class, \nMs. Conti clerked for Justice Louis Manderino of the Supreme Court of \nPennsylvania.\n  For the following two years, Ms. Conti worked with the Pittsburgh \nfirm of Kirkpatrick & Lockhart, where she focused on business \nbankruptcy, commercial finance, and other corporate law matters. She \nthen joined the faculty of Duquesne School of Law as a professor, \nteaching classes on civil procedure, corporate finance, corporate \nreadjustments and reorganizations, corporations and creditors' and \ndebtors' rights.\n  In 1982, Ms. Conti returned to her former firm, Kirkpatrick & \nLockhart, and was named a partner in 1983. She again concentrated her \npractice in business bankruptcy. She remained with the firm until 1996, \nwhen she joined her current firm, Buchanan Ingersoll, to handle \nbusiness bankruptcy cases, health care matters, and nonprofit \ncorporation issues.\n  While serving as cochair of the Pennsylvania Bar Association's Task \nForce for the Poor, she has helped with efforts to improve access to \nlegal services for indigent residents. She also initiated a program \nproving employment for disadvantaged high school students in local \nlegal offices, donating approximately 200 ours to the cause.\n  John E. Jones, our nominee to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania, is similarly distinguished jurist. Mr. Jones \nearned his undergraduate and law degrees from Dickinson College. After \ngraduation, he joined the Pottsville law firm of Dolbin & Cori as an \nassociated and worked part time as a clerk for Judge Guy A. Bowe of the \nSchuylkill County Court of Common Pleas. After 2 years, Mr. Jones \nbecame a partner at Dolbin & Cori.\n  In 1984, Mr. Jones began an 11-year association as a part-time \nassistant public defender with the Schuylkill County Public Defender's \nOffice. His caseload included defending capital murder and criminal \nhomicide cases. Mr. Jones now works for his own firm, concentrating on \nbankruptcy, personal injury, family, real estate, and corporate law.\n  In 1995, Mr. Jones was appointed and confirmed to the office of \nchairman of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board. The Control Board is \nresponsible for the sale and regulation of all alcohol products in \nPennsylvania. The Control Board also runs the State's Alcohol Education \nProgram. As chairman, Mr. Jones has utilized his skills and experience \nas a practicing attorney to change the State's liquor licensing \nprocedures. As head of the State's Alcohol Education Program, he has \nbeen a tireless advocate against drunk driving and underage drinking. \nIn November 2000, Mr. Jones received the Government Leadership Award \nfrom the National commission Against Drunk Driving in Washington, DC. \nIn May 1999, he was renominated and confirmed for a second 4-year term \nas Control Board's Chairman.\n  I am confident that these three Federal court nominees-Julia Smith \nGibbons, Joy F. Conti, and John E. Jones--will each make fine additions \nto the Federal judiciary. They deserve our swift confirmation\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Julia Smith Gibbons, of Tennessee, to be United States Circuit Judge \nfor the Sixth Circuit?

Mr. President, I rise today to thank my colleagues for the \nconfirmation of Julia Smith Gibbons to the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Sixth Circuit. I am also grateful to President Bush for his \nnomination of this outstanding judge whose distinguished life is an \nexample of the American dream.\n  Raised in Pulaski, TN, Judge Gibbons has been a trailblazer for women \nin the legal profession, and exemplifies in both her professional and \npersonal life the character that makes us a great nation--active in her \nchurch and community, a supportive and loving wife to her husband, \nBill, for 29 years, and a proud mother of two wonderful children, Carey \nand Will. A product of small town America and the solid values that her \nfamily instilled in her, as valedictorian of her senior class at Giles \nCounty High School, Julia was obviously poised to accomplish great \nthings.\n  With an outstanding record of achievement at Vanderbilt University \nand the University of Virginia Law School, Judge Gibbons headed home to \nTennessee to begin her legal career. She served then-Governor Lamar \nAlexander as his legal advisor, and in 1981, she became the first \nfemale trial judge of a court of record in Tennessee. President Reagan \nrecognized her talent and skill, and just 2 years later, in 1983, she \nwas confirmed by the Senate as a U.S. District Judge in the Western \nDistrict of Tennessee. At that time, Julia became the first female \nFederal judge in Tennessee, and was the youngest person on the Federal \nbench in the country, and the second youngest in the Nation's history \never appointed to a district court judgeship. Despite her tender years, \nher legal acumen and human touch soon made her one of the brightest \nstars in our Federal judicial system.\n  Judge Gibbons is known for being bright, industrious, thorough, even-\nhanded and someone who truly loves the law. She is everything anyone \ncould want in a judge, and will continue to serve our country with \ndistinction on the Sixth Circuit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/29/senate-section/article/S7455-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7455-S7457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NOMINATION OF JOY FLOWERS CONTI, OF PENNSYLVANIA, TO BE UNITED STATES \n        DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes for debate equally divided prior to the vote on Executive \nCalendar No. 827, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Joy Flowers Conti, of \nPennsylvania, to be United States District Judge for the Western \nDistrict of Pennsylvania.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, with today's votes on these judicial \nnominations to the Federal district courts in Pennsylvania, the \nDemocratic-led Senate will have confirmed 63 judicial nominees since \nthe change in Senate majority a little more than 1 year ago. I commend \nMajority Leader Daschle for having worked through the problems created \nby the White House's refusal to proceed in a bipartisan way with \nnominations to bipartisan boards and commissions and for having worked \nwith Senator McCain to get to this point.\n  I understand Senator McCain's frustration with the White House and \nhow it is treating nominations but thank him for allowing us to proceed \nwith these judicial nominations at this time. In fact, this majority \nleader has worked hard to bring these nominations to the floor and his \nefforts have included having to proceed by way of cloture on three \nnominees in the last few weeks. He has gone the extra mile and that \nshould be acknowledged.\n  Similarly, the Judiciary Committee continues to make efforts that \nwere not made by the Republican leadership.\n  We have held hearings on a record number of nominees and reported a \nrecord number of nominees. Seventy-five judicial nominees have been \nvoted on by the Judiciary Committee since the change in majority last \nsummer. This week we will hold a hearing for the 82nd, 83rd, 84th and \n85th judicial nominees, including our 18th circuit court nominee. We \nhave proceeded with nominees to fill vacancies even though Republicans \nheld up moderate nominees by President Clinton to those same vacancies. \nWe have confirmed new judges for the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuit \ncourts of appeals for the first time in three, six and five years, \nrespectively. So much for the partisan critics who scream about a \nblockage of President Bush's nominees by Democrats in the Senate. The \nfacts are that we have been fairer to President Bush's nominees than \nthe Republicans were to President Clinton's.\n  Today is another example. The Senate has acted quickly on these \nnominations to the district courts in Pennsylvania. Joy Flowers Conti \nparticipated in a hearing in May, within weeks of her paperwork being \ncomplete. I know that Senator Specter strongly supports Ms. Conti's \nnomination, as well as Mr. Jones, and he specifically requested that \nshe be accorded a hearing as soon as possible. Likewise John Jones \nreceived a hearing in May, shortly after his paperwork was completed.\n  With today's votes on two Pennsylvania nominees, the Judiciary \nCommittee will have held hearings for 10 district court nominees from \nthat State, including Judge Davis, Judge Baylson, and Judge Rufe, who \nwere confirmed in April, and Judge Conner, who was just confirmed last \nFriday. Those confirmations illustrate the progress being made under \nDemocratic leadership and the fair and expeditious way this President's \nnominees are being treated.\n  With today's confirmations, there is no State in the Union that has \nhad more Federal judicial nominees confirmed by this Senate than \nPennsylvania. I think that the Senate Judiciary Committee and the \nSenate as a whole have done well by Pennsylvania. Contrast this with \nthe way vacancies in Pennsylvania were left unfilled during Republican \ncontrol of the Senate, particularly regarding nominees in the western \nhalf of the State.\n  Despite the best efforts and diligence of my good friend from \nPennsylvania, Senator Specter, to secure confirmation of all of the \njudicial nominees from every part of his home State, there were seven \nnominees by President Clinton to Pennsylvania vacancies that never got \na hearing or a vote.\n  A good example of the contrast is the nomination of Judge Legrome \nDavis. He was first nominated to the position of U.S. District Court \nJudge for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania by President Clinton on \nJuly 30, 1998.\n  The Republican-controlled Senate took no action on his nomination and \nit was returned to the President at the end of 1998. On January 26, \n1999, President Clinton renominated Judge Davis for the same vacancy. \nThe Senate again failed to hold a hearing for Judge Davis and his \nnomination was returned after 2 more years.\n  Under Republican leadership, Judge Davis' nomination languished \nbefore the committee for 868 days without a hearing. Unfortunately, \nJudge Davis was subjected to the kind of inappropriate partisan rancor \nthat befell so many other nominees to the district courts in \nPennsylvania during the Republican control of the Senate.\n  The lack of Senate action on Judge Davis's initial nominations is in \nno way attributable to a lack of support from the senior Senator from \nPennsylvania. Far from it. In fact, I give Senator Specter full credit \nfor getting President Bush to renominate Judge Davis earlier this year \nand commended him publicly for all he has done to support this \nnomination from the outset.\n  This year we moved expeditiously to consider Judge Davis, and he was \nconfirmed in just 84 days.\n  The saga of Judge Davis recalls for us so many nominees from the \nperiod of\n\n[[Page S7456]]\n\nJanuary 1995 through July 10, 2001, who never received a hearing or a \nvote and who were the subject of secret anonymous holds by Republicans \nfor reasons that were never explained.\n  In contrast, the hearing we had earlier this year for Ms. Conti was \nthe very first hearing on a nominee to the Western District of \nPennsylvania since 1994, in almost a decade, despite President \nClinton's qualified nominees. No nominee to the Western District of \nPennsylvania received a hearing during the entire period that \nRepublicans controlled the Senate in the Clinton administration.\n  One of the nominees to the Western District, Lynette Norton, waited \nfor almost 1,000 days, and she was never given the courtesy of a \nhearing or a vote. Unfortunately, Ms. Norton died earlier this year, \nhaving never fulfilled her dream of serving on the Federal bench. \nToday's confirmation vote on Ms. Conti will be the first on a nominee \nto the Western District of Pennsylvania in almost 8 years, since Judge \nMcLaughlin and Judge Cindrich were confirmed in October of 1994. \nDespite this history of poor treatment of President Clinton's nominees, \nwe continue to move forward fairly and expeditiously.\n  Large numbers of vacancies continue to exist, in large measure \nbecause the recent Republican majority was not willing to hold hearings \nor vote on more than 50 of President Clinton's judicial nominees, many \nof whom waited for years and never received a vote on their nomination. \nIt is Democrats who have broken with that history of inaction from the \nRepublican era of control, delay, and obstruction.\n  With today's confirmations of Judge Conti and Judge Jones to the \nFederal district courts in Pennsylvania, the Senate will have confirmed \n51 district court nominees and 63 judges overall since the change in \nmajority last summer. Contrast this with the Republican average, during \ntheir past 6\\1/2\\ years on control, of 31 district court judges a year \nand 38 judges a year overall. I congratulate the nominees and their \nfamilies on their confirmations today and commend Senator Specter and \nMajority Leader Daschle for all they have done to bring us to this day.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I had no intention of bringing up the topic \nof judicial nominations today, but I feel I must respond to the \ncomments made just now.\n  Curently there are 92 empty seats in the Federal judiciary, a 10.7 \npercent vacancy rate--one of the highest in modern times. This means \nthat 10.7 percent of all Federal courtrooms are presided over by an \nempty chair.\n  There are currently 22 nominees pending who are slated to fill \npositions which have been declared judicial emergencies by the \nAdministrative Office of the Courts. Of those, 13 are courts of appeals \nnominees.\n  During President Clinton's second year in office, the Senate \nconfirmed 100 of his judicial nominees. I would expect the Senate \nDemocrats to do the same for President Bush. But they are not doing so.\n  Only 4 of President Bush's first 11 nominees--nominated on May 9, \n2001--have had hearings. In other words, the Judiciary Committee has \ntaken no action whatsoever on nearly two-thirds of the circuit court \nnominations that have been pending for over 14 months. There is no \nreason for this other than stall tactics. All of these nominees \nreceived qualified or well-qualified ratings from the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  There were 31 vacancies in the Federal courts of appeals on May 9, \n2001, and there are 30 today. The Senate Democrats are trying to create \nan illusion of movement by creating great media attention and \ncontroversy concerning a small handful of nominees in order to make it \nlook like progress. But we are hardly making any progress in filling \ncircuit vacancies.\n  President Bush has responded to the vacancy crisis in the appellate \ncourts by nominating a total of 31 top-notch men and women to these \nposts--but the Senate is simply stalling them. Over the past year, the \nSenate has confirmed only nine. There are still 22 circuit court \nnominees pending in committee. By comparison, at the end of President \nClinton's second year in office, we had confirmed 19 circuit judges and \nhad 15 circuit court vacancies.\n  Mr. President, the comparison does not end there. There were only two \nCircuit Court nominees left pending in Committee at the end of \nPresident Clinton's first year in office. In contrast, there were 23 of \nPresident Bush's circuit court nominees pending in committee at the end \nof last year.\n\n  Mr. President, some try to blame the Republicans for the vacancy \ncrisis, but that is bunk. At the end of the 106th Congress when I was \nchairman, we had 67 vacancies in the Federal judiciary. During the past \n9 months, the vacancy rate has been hovering right around 100. Today it \nis at 92.\n  The real story here, Mr. President, is that the Senate's Democratic \nleadership is treating President Bush unfairly when it comes to \njudicial nominees. Some would justify this unfair treatment of \nPresident Bush as tit for tat, or business as usual, but the American \npeople should not accept such a smokescreen. What the Senate leadership \nis doing is unprecedented.\n  Historically, a President can count on seeing all of his first 11 \ncircuit court nominees confirmed. Presidents Reagan, Bush and Clinton \nall enjoyed a 100 percent confirmation rate on their first 11 circuit \ncourt nominees. In stark contrast, 8 of President Bush's first 11 \nnominations are still pending now for over 1 whole year.\n  History also shows that Presidents can expect almost all of their \nfirst 100 nominees to be confirmed swiftly. Presidents Reagan, Bush, \nand Clinton got 97, 95 and 97, respectively, of their first 100 \njudicial nominations confirmed. But the Senate has confirmed only 57 of \nPresident Bush's first 100 nominees.\n  In sum, Mr. President, I think that the American people deserve \nbetter, President Bush deserves better, and the Judicial Branch of our \nGovernment deserves better. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. Who \nyields time?\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, it is a proud moment for me to speak on \nbehalf of Joy Flowers Conti. I had the privilege of practicing with her \nas a lawyer in Pittsburgh. She is an outstanding litigator and \noutstanding person in the community, and I am very grateful that her \nnomination is coming to the Senate floor.\n  The next vote will be on John E. Jones for the Middle District, \nanother outstanding litigator and someone who is going to be a credit \nto the court. We still have six district court judges in Pennsylvania \nwho have yet to be confirmed in the Senate and two third circuit--\nPennsylvania positions that need to be filled. I am hopeful those \nnominations will also make their way to the floor quickly.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. SANTORUM. I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back. The question is on \nthe confirmation of the nomination.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

Madam President, I thank the distinguished assistant \nmajority leader and would note that Senator Specter also wanted to \naddress the Senate, but since he is not here, I will go ahead with my \nremarks.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, on June 13 the United States officially \nwithdrew from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile, ABM, Treaty, closing a \nchapter in U.S.-Soviet relations, and beginning another with Russia. \nThe lapsing of the ABM Treaty, combined with the Senate's defeat of the \nComprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1999 and the signing of a new type of \nnuclear reduction treaty with Russia in May, represent a fundamental \nshift in the way the United States approaches strategic security. We \nhave moved away from reliance on traditional arms control treaties \ntoward a reliance on our own capabilities--namely missile defenses and \na credible nuclear deterrent.\n  Proponents of the ABM Treaty were convinced that it was the \n``cornerstone of strategic stability,'' and that U.S. withdrawal would \ndamage the improving U.S.-Russia relationship, spark a new arms race, \nand even lead, as one of my colleagues remarked, to ``Cold War II.'' \nThose predictions were wrong. Yet some still cling to the notion that \narms control is the key elements in U.S. national security.\n  Over the past 6 months, I have addressed the Senate on the strategic \njustification for U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, the question of \nhow much a missile defense system will cost, and the President's \nconstitutional authority to exercise the right of withdrawal without \nlegislative consent. And, today, in response to those who continue to \nbelieve in the utopian aims of traditional arms control agreements, I \nrise to address the President's decision to abrogate the ABM Treaty, \nthis time\n\n[[Page S7458]]\n\nin the broader context of the utility of such measures as a means to \nprotect U.S. security interests.\n  The past 10 years have completely changes the Cold War strategic \nenvironment that gave rise to the ABM Treaty and other traditional arms \nlimitation and arms reduction agreements. First, the United States and \nRussia have moved beyond enmity toward a more cooperative relationship. \nSecond, the threats we face today are far more numerous and complex \nthan those we faced during the Cold War.\n  The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction has become one of \nour most pressing national security challenges. As many as three dozen \ncountries now have or are developing ballistic missiles. Used by once \nbetween 1945 and 1980, such weapons have become an increasingly common \ncomponent in regional conflicts. In fact, thousands of shorter range \nmissiles have been used in at least six conflicts since 1980. And, as a \nrecent National Intelligence Estimate NIE, on foreign ballistic missile \ndevelopments warned, ``The probability that a missile with a weapon of \nmass destruction will be used against U.S. forces or U.S. interests is \nhigher today than during most of the Cold War, and it will continue to \ngrow as the capabilities of potential adversaries mature.''\n  Iran, for example, continues to place much emphasis on its missile \nactivities. According to the recent NIE, that country's ``longstanding \ncommitment to its ballistic missile program . . . is unlikely to \ndiminish.'' In early May, Tehran conducted a successful test of its \n1,300 km-range Shahab-3 missile--capable of reaching Israel, as well as \nU.S. troops deployed in the Middle East and South Asia--and some press \nreports indicate that Iran is now set to begin domestic production of \nthe missile. Additionally, on May 7, the Associated Press, citing an \nadministration official, reported that Iran is continuing development \nof a longer-range missile, the Shahab-4. With an estimated range of \n2,000 km, the Shabab-4 will be able to reach well into Europe.\n  North Korea's missile programs are also of great concern. That \ncountry has extended its moratorium of testing its intercontinental-\nrange Taepo Dong missiles until 2003; however, its surprise August 1998 \ntest flight over Japan of the Taepo Dong 1 missile should serve as a \nclear indication of its intent to develop missiles with \nintercontinental ranges. Indeed, Pyongyang is continuing its \ndevelopment of the longer-range Taepo Dong 2 missile, capable of \nreaching parts of the United States with a nuclear weapon-sized \npayload. According to the NIE:\n\n       The Taepo Dong 2 in a two-stage ballistic missile \n     configuration could deliver a several-hundred kg payload up \n     to 10,000 km--sufficient to strike Alaska, Hawaii, and parts \n     of the continental United States. If the North uses a third \n     stage similar to the one used on the Taepo Dong 1 in 1998 in \n     a ballistic missile configuration, then the Taepo Dong 2 \n     could deliver a several hundred kg payload up to 15,000 km--\n     sufficient to strike all of North America.\n\n  In Iraq, Saddam Hussein continues to obstruct the international \nverification of commitments made to the United Nations, and still fails \nto comply with arms control agreements he accepted at the end of the \ngulf war. The recent NIE concluded that, ``Despite U.N. resolutions \nlimiting the range of Iraq's missiles to 150 km, Baghdad has been able \nto maintain the infrastructure and expertise to develop longer range \nmissile systems.'' And Iraq's ability to surprise us in the past with \nthe scale of its missile, nuclear, chemical, and biological programs \nshould serve as a warning. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld recently \ndiscussed Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction capabilities, stating:\n\n       They have them, and they continue to develop them, and they \n     have weaponized chemical weapons. They've had an active \n     program to develop nuclear weapons. It's also clear that they \n     are actively developing biological weapons. I don't know what \n     other kinds of weapons fall under the rubric of weapons of \n     mass destruction, but if there are more, I suspect they're \n     working on them, as well.\n\n  China presents an even more complex case. While not a member of the \naxis of evil, that country's exceedingly belligerent attitude toward \nthe United States and our longstanding, democratic ally Taiwan requires \na clear-eyed approach to our relationship with the communist government \nin Beijing. China currently has about 20 intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles capable of reaching the United States, and is in the midst of \na long-running modernization program to expand the size of its \nstrategic nuclear arsenal and to develop road-mobile and submarine-\nlaunched ICBMs. According to the NIE, by 2015, ``Chinese ballistic \nmissile forces will increase several-fold.'' Additionally, by that \ntime, ``Most of China's strategic missile force will be mobile.'' As \nSecretary Rumsfeld stated on September 6 in reference to China's \nstrategic missile modernization and buildup, ``It is a long pattern \nthat reflects a seriousness of purpose about the People's Republic of \nChina with respect to their defense establishment.''\n  President Bush's fresh approach to strategic security with Russia--\ncalled the ``New Strategic Framework''--takes into account these \nchanged circumstances. The President's framework entails unilateral \nreductions in offensive nuclear weapons and the development and \ndeployment of defensive systems to deter and protect against missile \nattacks. President Bush outlined this approach before his election, and \nupon taking office, immediately began to develop a plan for action.\n  The central component of that framework is the development of missile \ndefenses, critical to which is U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty \nwhich totally prohibits deployment of a national missile defense. \nIndeed, our withdrawal represents a fundamental shift away from \nreliance on consensual vulnerability, perpetuated by arms control \ntreaties, and a move toward prudent defensive measures.\n  The ABM Treaty was a classic example of arms control--promising much \nmore than it was ever able to deliver. The theory was that by ensuring \nmutual vulnerability to nuclear missile attack, the incentive to build \nincreasing numbers of offensive forces would be removed. History proved \nthat theory wrong. Between the treaty's signing in 1972 and 1987, the \nSoviet Union's inventory of strategic nuclear warheads grew from around \n2,000 to about 10,000; and the U.S. arsenal grew from around 3,700 to \n8,000. In fact, strategic nuclear forces expanded not just \nquantitatively, but also qualitatively. The decade following the ABM \nTreaty's signing witnessed the introduction into the Soviet arsenal of \nentire generations of new long-range missiles, not just in \ncontradiction of the intent of the ABM Treaty, but in contravention of \nthe accompanying SALT I accord as well. Clearly, deliberate \nvulnerability did not promote arms control; rather, it fueled the arms \nrace.\n  It is important to reiterate the history of the ABM Treaty because \nthose who purport that it was the ``cornerstone of strategic \nstability'' seem to misunderstand the original impetus for it. The \ntruth is that the United States gave up the right to field defensive \nsystems because the Nixon administration was faced, in 1971, with a \nCongress that refused to fund more than two of the original 12 sites \nthat the Administration had proposed in 1969. This, in addition to a \nrapid Soviet offensive buildup, caused the Nixon administration to \nacquiesce in the negotiation of the ABM Treaty, to be coupled with the \nSALT agreement. And I should note that, two years after the ABM Treaty \nwas negotiated, it was amended to limit to one the number of sites \nallowed because Congress did not even continue to fund the second site.\n  Thus, making necessity a virtue, political theorists embraced the \nnotion that, in order to deter a nuclear attack, the threatened \nresponse had to be the murder of millions of innocent civilians. \nPresident Reagan once referred to this philosophy, named Mutual Assured \nDestruction, as ``a sad commentary on the human condition.'' And, in my \nview, its acronym ``M-A-D'' describes it well.\n  It is debatable whether that theory explains the absence of a nuclear \nexchange in the second half of the 20th century. Whatever the case, \nthis idea certainly seems mad today, when we have friendly relations \nwith Russia, and are confronted with an entirely different set of \nthreats. It simply does not make sense to remain deliberately \nvulnerable to the increasing threat of a ballistic missile attack, \nespecially when alternatives, such as missile defenses, now exist.\n  Surely a sign of the changed times, President Bush returned from \nRussia in May having signed a new treaty under which both sides intend \nto reduce strategic warheads to 1,700-2,200. Just three pages long, \nthis treaty\n\n[[Page S7459]]\n\nmerely states what both sides intend to do. There are no interim \nlimits, no sub-limits, or verification schemes. More importantly, the \ntreaty simply affirms what the United States had already decided were \nits strategic requirements--President Bush announced that we were \nunilaterally going to this level of warheads last November. This is \nimportant enough to repeat: this treaty memorialized what President \nBush determined were our strategic requirements. Thus, this treaty is a \ncomplete break with the arms control orthodoxy of the past, which made \neach side's limitations or reductions dependent on the other, required \ndifficult verification and enforcement provisions, and artificially \npre-determined our strategic levels.\n  Recognizing that we no longer live in a bipolar world, we must shift \nour attention to the threat to our security from a number of rogue \nstates that already have, or are seeking to obtain, weapons of mass \ndestruction capabilities. Despite the existence of a plethora of \nmultilateral arms control agreements, the threat to the United States \nand its allies from chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons has not \nbeen limited. The fundamental flaw of such measures lies in the fact \nthat they focus on weapons, rather than on the real problem: the \ndangerous regimes that possess them. And whether they've signed these \ntreaties or not, the rogue regimes cannot be trusted to comply.\n  Historians have traced that flawed approach back to the Catholic \nChurch's attempt to ban the crossbow--the terrible new weapon of the \n1100s--in 1139. That endeavor proved as ineffective as the arms control \nefforts that followed in later centuries. Perhaps there is no better \nexample of this futility than the attempts after World War I to outlaw \nwar altogether. The 1928 Kellog-Briand Pact, to which the Senate \nprovided its advice and consent on January 25, 1929 by a vote of 85 to \n1, was signed by all of the major countries. It renounced war as ``an \ninstrument of national policy.'' It also paved the way for other arms \ncontrol treaties and negotiations that left the Western democracies \nunprepared to fight and unable to deter World War II, a mere decade \nlater.\n  Indeed, in looking back at the arms control efforts of the 1920s and \n1930s, Walter Lippman, the celebrated historian who championed the \nagreements when they were signed, wrote that, ``The disarmament \nmovement was, as the event has shown, tragically successful in \ndisarming the nations that believed in disarmament. The net effect was \nto dissolve the alliance among the victors of the first World War, and \nto reduce them to almost disastrous impotence on the eve of the second \nWorld War.''\n  Mr. Lippman's assessment offers an important lesson. Arms control \nworks best where it is needed least--among honorable, morally \nupstanding nations. It does not work where it is needed most--against \nrogue nations. Countries that act clandestinely and in bad faith will \nsimply ignore the legal requirements of arms control agreements when it \nsuits their interests. Moreover, morally-upstanding nations depending \nupon these agreements for security and stability have often lacked the \nwill to respond forcefully to violations. Even when evidence is clear, \nthere are almost always overriding diplomatic reasons for overlooking \nor treading lightly on the violating parties.\n  The international community's response to Iraq's use of chemical \nweapons is a prime example. When that country used chemical weapons \nagainst Iran in the 1980's in violation of the 1925 Geneva Protocol \nbanning the use of such weapons, the U.N. Security Council passed a \nresolution calling for both sides in the conflict to exercise \nrestraint. After Saddam Hussein again used chemical weapons--this time \nagainst his own Kurdish population--the Security Council again passed a \nresolution of condemnation that failed even to mention the use of \nchemical weapons. International resolve was so weak that when the \nUnited States proposed a resolution at the U.N. Human Rights Commission \nin 1989 condemning Iraq's use of those weapons against the Kurds, the \ninitiative was defeated by a vote of 17 to 13.\n  Unwilling to enforce the existing Geneva Protocol when Iraq had, \nwithout dispute, violated its terms, the international community, in an \neffort to demonstrate its commitment to arms control, agreed upon a new \nban on the possession of chemical weapons. Yet possession is inherently \nharder to verify than  already-banned use. This new ban--the Chemical \nWeapons Convention, CWC-- unrealistically aims to control states that \nare confident that they can violate its terms without detection and \nwithout punishment. And while the United States is destroying its \nchemical deterrent under the requirements of the CWC, chemical weapons \nprograms in other states that have signed the treaty--like Iran--have \nnot been curbed. Still others, like Iraq, North Korea, Libya, and Syria \nhave not even joined the convention.\n\n  There is no moral equivalence between Western democracies and rogue \nregimes like those in place in Iran, Iraq, and North Korea. Yet arms \ncontrol treaties like the Biological Weapons Convention BWC and the CWC \nassume that all participants operate with the same objectives in mind. \nThey place under one umbrella--under a unitary set of constraints--\nstates that are certain to comply and those that are certain to cheat. \nAnd therein lies their failure to serve any meaningful purpose. As \nRichard Perle, former Assistant Secretary of Defense, stated in a 1999 \nspeech, ``The failure to distinguish guns in the hands of cops and guns \nin the hands of robbers is not just a practical absurdity, it is a \nprofound moral failure.''\n  Other arms control efforts like the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty \nNPT, while more realistic in terms of their objectives, have also had \nquestionable success. Under the terms of the NPT, the five declared \nnuclear weapons states--the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, \nFrance, and China--agreed ``not in any way to assist'' any nonweapons \nstate to acquire nuclear weapons. Other parties to the treaty agree not \nto develop nuclear weapons and to allow the International Atomic Energy \nAgency, IAEA to inspect their nuclear facilities.\n  Just a brief examination of the records of parties to the treaty \nillustrates that its objectives are not supported equally by all.\n  The United States intelligence community suspects that Russia and \nChina, despite their NPT obligations, may be providing assistance to \nthe nuclear weapons programs of certain states.\n  North Korea--despite the optimism of some that the 1994 Agreed \nFramework would curb that country's nuclear weapons program--continues \nto evade certain IAEA inspections needed to ensure that country is in \nfull compliance with the NPT and the Framework. And yet, the United \nStates continues to support the Agreed Framework with U.S. taxpayer \ndollars.\n  The U.S. intelligence community suspects that Russian nuclear-related \nassistance to Iran--ostensibly for Tehran's civilian nuclear program \nmay, indeed, be contributing to Iran's nuclear ambitions.\n  And the full extent of Iraq's covert nuclear programs, after years \nwithout inspections, is not fully known. In fact, even when inspectors \nwere in the country, Saddam made use of information provided by Iraqi \nIAEA inspectors to evade detection.\n  It is clear that multilateral arms control agreements have not \ndelivered on their promise to make the world a safer place. As such, \nprudence demands that we take steps to ensure the safety of the \nAmerican people--this will involve a combination of defense and \ndeterrence.\n  Though the ABM Treaty was bilateral agreement between the United \nStates and the Soviet Union, President Bush's decision to withdraw the \nUnited States was, in fact, necessitated by our need to deal with other \nstates that are developing ballistic missiles. Deterrence is simply \ninadequate in dealing with rogue dictators. To depend on nuclear \ndeterrence alone with a dictator like Saddam Hussein, for instance--a \nman who used chemical weapons against his own people--would be to place \nAmerican lives in the hands of a madman. As Winston Churchill warned in \nhis 1955 ``Balance of Terror'' speech, ``The deterrent does not cover \nthe case of lunatics or dictators in the mood of Hitler when he found \nhimself in his final dugout.''\n  The alternative--which will be permitted now that we have withdrawn \nfrom the ABM Treaty--is to develop and deploy missile defenses. A \nmissile\n\n[[Page S7460]]\n\ndefense system will give us more flexible options in a crisis. First, \ndefenses against missiles will help the United States to avoid nuclear \nblackmail, intended to freeze us into inaction by the very threat of a \nmissile attack. Imagine the impact on our decision to go to war against \nSaddam Hussein in 1991 had he been able to threaten the United States \nor our allies with nuclear missiles. Additionally, missile defense will \nreduce the incentive for ballistic missile proliferation by de-valuing \noffensive missiles. Finally, missile defenses, in a worst-case \nscenario, will save American lives.\n\n  The development of missile defenses and the end of the superpower \nrivalry does not obviate the need for traditional deterrence, however. \nAs the world's remaining superpower, we need to maintain maximum \nflexibility and the ability to play the ultimate trump card if need be. \nDeterrence and defenses--with neither, of course, being 100 percent \nfail-safe--will be mutually reinforcing. The prudence of maintaining a \nnuclear deterrent was shown during the Gulf War when we hinted that we \nmight draw on that capability if Iraq attacked allied troops with \nchemical or biological agents. As then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney \nwarned during a visit to the Middle East on December 23, 1991: ``Were \nSaddam Hussein foolish enough to use weapons of mass destruction, the \nU.S. response would be absolutely overwhelming, and it would be \ndevastating.'' Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz acknowledged several \nyears later that Iraq did not attack the forces of the U.S.-led \ncoalition with chemical weapons because such warnings were interpreted \nas meaning nuclear retaliation.\n  Of course, with the end of the U.S.-Soviet standoff, we can maintain \nour deterrent at lower levels--thus President Bush's decision to \nunilaterally reduce our arsenal. But lower levels require greater \nattention to the safety and reliability of our remaining arsenal. This \nwill, I believe, require renewed testing of that arsenal at some point.\n  Thankfully, this body defeated the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, \nCTBT--which would have obligated the United States to give up for all \ntime the option of testing our nuclear weapons--in October 1999. The \nBush administration has made it clear that it strongly opposes the \ntreaty. While it has no plans to do so, the administration has retained \nthe option of nuclear testing to assure the safety and reliability of \nour nuclear arsenal. It is also moving to improve the test readiness \nposture. As Assistant Secretary of Defense J.D. Crouch stated during a \nbriefing on the Nuclear Posture Review, NPR, the ``NPR does state . . . \nthat we need to improve our readiness posture to test from its current \ntwo to three year period to something substantially better.'' I am \npleased that the House version of the Defense authorization bill \ncontains a provision that requires the Department of Energy to reduce \nto one year the time between the Presidential decision to conduct a \nnuclear test and the test itself, and I hope that the Senate will \nultimately choose to include such a provision, as well.\n  The threats to the United States today are more complex and difficult \nto predict than those we faced during the cold war. Recognizing their \ninherent limitations, it is therefore time to move beyond traditional \narms control treaties as a means to protect American lives from these \nthreats. President Bush has committed to do just that. He has set the \nUnited States on a course that unequivocally places faith not in \ntraditional arms control, but in the time-honored philosophy that led \nto the West's victory without war over the Soviet Empire: Peace through \nstrength. As a result, we will be able to pursue the development of \nmissile defenses and maintain a credible nuclear deterrent. These \ndemonstrations of strength, coupled, of course, with the maintenance of \nrobust conventional capabilities--not more pieces of paper--are what \nwill keep this nation secure.\n  President Bush's overall security strategy rightly focuses on the \nroot of the problem--the dangerous regimes that possess the weapons. As \nMargaret Thatcher once stated, ``. . . the fundamental risk to peace is \nnot the existence of weapons of particular types. It is the disposition \non the part of some states to impose change on others by resorting to \nforce.'' The heart of the matter is that our strategy should seek to \nchange the regimes themselves, whether through military, diplomatic, or \neconomic means. The United States has made clear its intention to \npursue that objective, and I have no doubt that our efforts will lead \nto success.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/29/senate-section/article/S7460-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7460-S7461]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               FTC REPORT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, my staff just attended a non-embargoed \nbriefing conducted by the Federal Trade Commission. It is our \nunderstanding that tomorrow the FTC will transmit to the Congress and \nthe American people a copy of its comprehensive study of the \npharmaceutical industry with respect to litigation involving the two \nmajor components of the pending legislation: first, the report examined \nthe use and abuses of the statutory 30-month stay. Second, the report \nexamines how the 180-day marketing exclusivity rule has been the source \nof collusive arrangements between pioneer and generic firms.\n  I will be very interested to study the full report when it released \ntomorrow morning.\n  Let me say this tonight. First, I want to commend Chairman Muris and \nthe other FTC Commissioners for undertaking this important study. I \nwould also like to acknowledge the efforts of the FTC staff including, \nMaryann Kane, Mike Wroblenski and Sarah Browers for their work on this \nreport.\n  It is my understanding that the key recommendations contained in the \nreport are somewhat at odds with the legislation on the floor.\n  It is my understanding the first FTC recommendation, consistent with \nthe position that I took at the Health Committee hearing May 8 and my \nfloor statements the past two weeks, will basically say that there \nshould only be one automatic 30-month stay per drug product per ANDA to \nresolve challenges to patents listed in the FDA Orange Book prior to \nthe filing date of the generic drug application.\n  Senator Gregg took this position in the HELP Committee and I commend \nhim for his work to strengthen the bill.\n  Clearly, as I have laid out in some detail in earlier speeches, the \nEdwards-Collins substitute delves into areas way beyond this \nrecommendation.\n  I also understand the second FTC recommendation, which touches upon \nthe so-called reverse payment agreements whereby generic firms are paid \nnot to market generic drugs, will suggest that the Congress pass \nlegislation to require brand-name companies and first generic \napplicants to provide copies of certain agreements to the FTC.\n  This is exactly what Senator Leahy's bill, S. 754, the Drug \nCompetition Act, requires. As I discussed in my previous statements, I \nvoted for Senator Leahy's bill in the Judiciary Committee and worked \nwith him to refine the final language. In my view, S. 754 contains a \nmuch more measured--and certainly more comprehensible--approach than \ndoes the Edwards-Collins substitute.\n  Because the staff briefing just occurred and the full report will be \nissued tomorrow, I am not prepared tonight to give you my full \nevaluation of the FTC report. But I can say that the major \nrecommendations of the FTC appear to be somewhat at odds with key \nprovisions of the legislation that is pending on the floor, the \nEdwards-Collins substitute to S. 812.\n  I look forward to examining the data collected by the FTC and \nanalyzing the report's two major recommendations and its several \nsubsidiary recommendations.\n  Frankly, I think that it would be appropriate for the relevant \ncommittees, the Judiciary Committee, the Commerce Committee, and HELP \nCommittee, to have the opportunity to examine this comprehensive study \nbefore we adopt legislation in this area.\n  I will be interested to learn if the sponsors of the bill on the \nfloor would be open to a process that will allow a careful evaluation \nof what the FTC study reveals and will not just act to ram this \nlegislation through in the last week before August recess.\n  I have lodged my concerns about the way this bill so hastily was \nadopted by the committee and appeared on the floor, and urged that we \ntake the time necessary to get this legislation right.\n\n[[Page S7461]]\n\n  The Hatch-Waxman Act is an important consumer bill that has helped \nsave about $8 billion to $10 billion each year since 1984. So we should \nnot be playing around with this bill, especially without the benefit of \ncarefully studying this this soon-to-be-released FTC report.\n  Once again, I urge my colleagues to do the right thing and give us an \nadequate opportunity to factor in this FTC study.\n  It would be advisable to spend the time before the recess to adopt \ntrade promotion authority rather than to continue to struggle with the \nhastily crafted and not fully vetted Edward-Collins substitute.\n  In that regard, I pay specific tribute to our colleague, Senator \nBaucus, who represented the Senate so well in the trade conference that \noccurred Thursday evening and early Friday morning. I was a member of \nthe conference committee. Senator Baucus did himself proud, did our \nbody proud, did a very good job, as did Chairman Thomas. Those two \nworked very well together to come up with what is landmark legislation \nto help our economy move forward. It is one of the reasons I think the \nstock market turned around today. It is not the only reason. I think we \nwould have another reason if we would treat the Hatch-Waxman language \nwith the care and treatment it deserves before we go off half cocked to \nenact a bill before we examine the FTC study and its recommendations.\n  I am grateful I serve on the Finance Committee with Senator Baucus \nand Senator Grassley, both of whom did a good job in this last \nconference on trade promotion authority. I also am very pleased one of \nmy long-term friends in the Congress has been Chairman Bill Thomas in \nthe House. It is a tough job being chairman of the Ways and Means \nCommittee. It is a very divided committee in many respects; yet it \nworks very well. There is no one in this Congress who does a better job \non health care issues than Chairman Thomas.\n  All of them deserve credit, as do the ranking members, Charlie \nRangel, without whom this agreement probably could not have come to \npass, a man for whom I have tremendous respect; and, of course, Senator \nGrassley in our body who has worked so well with Senator Baucus on so \nmany pieces of legislation that mean so much to our economy and our \ncountry.\n  These are important issues. I have given some rather lengthy speeches \non the Hatch-Waxman issue and even some lengthy speeches on the trade \npromotion authority. I was one of those in the Finance Committee who \npushed very hard to get the trade promotion bill on the floor and get \nus to conference. I express my regard for all concerned. I hope we can \nresolve this matter on the floor this week, but I believe trade \npromotion authority deserves even greater precedence than what we are \ntrying to do in the underlying bill S. 812. If we act on the underlying \nbill, it ought to be done in a thoughtful fashion. It should not be \ndone just politically. We ought to pay attention to the experts at FTC \nand elsewhere who have spent so much time on the issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/29/senate-section/article/S7461-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7461-S7462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak about \nthree nominees from Pennsylvania who have been confirmed by the Senate. \nIt is a very happy day, indeed. We will have a judge to the western \ndistrict of Pennsylvania and two judges to the middle district of \nPennsylvania, both districts being in dire need of assistance. These \nthree individuals were recommended by a bipartisan nominating \ncommission which Senator Santorum and I have established, where there \nis independent review in each of the districts. These individuals were \nrecommended to Senator Santorum and myself and then, in turn, we \nrecommended them to the President. They have passed the examinations of \nthe American Bar Association with flying colors, the FBI check, the \nJudiciary Committee hearing, and finally have been voted upon by the \nSenate.\n  Earlier today, the Senate confirmed Ms. Joy Flowers Conti for the \nUnited States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. \nMs. Conti brings an outstanding academic record to the bench: Her \nbachelor of arts degree from Duquesne University in 1970; her law \ndegree also from Duquesne in 1973; summa cum laude, the highest honors; \nand she was the first woman to serve as editor in chief of the Duquesne \nLaw Journal. She has had an outstanding career in private practice. She \nhas been associated with the distinguished Pittsburgh law firm, \nBuchanan, Ingersoll, from 1974 until the present time; served as a \nprofessor of law at Duquesne from 1976 to 1982; has worked as a \njudicial officer, hearing examiner for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania \nin the Department of State Bureau of Occupational and Professional \nAffairs.\n  She received a ``well qualified'' rating by the American Bar \nAssociation's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, has served \nin the House of Delegates of the American Bar Association, and is \ncurrently serving in the Pennsylvania Bar Association's House of \nDelegates.\n  She received the Pennsylvania Bar Association's Anne X. Alpern Award, \na very distinguished award named for the first woman supreme court \njustice in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania--Justice Alpern, whom I \nknew and practiced before many years ago when I was chief of the \nappeals division in Philadelphia's Attorney General's office. Mrs. \nConti brings the highest credentials to the western district, a court \nvery much in need of additional judicial manpower, or in this case \nwoman power.\n  Also confirmed earlier today was a distinguished lawyer from \nPottsville, PA, John E. Jones. Mr. Jones has an outstanding academic \nrecord from Dickinson College, 1977, and the Dickinson School of Law in \n1980. He has been engaged in the active practice of law in Pottsville \nfor the past 21 years.\n  I have personally known Mr. Jones for 15 years. Just earlier today I \nwas talking to the former Governor of Pennsylvania, Tom Ridge, now \nserving as President Bush's homeland security adviser, and we compared \nnotes on Mr. Jones and agree that he has outstanding credentials.\n  His background includes being the assistant public defender in \nSchuylkill County from 1985 until 1985. That is a part-time job. But \nthe defender's office will give him a good background and balance, \nlooking at the defense side of the bar. He served as Pennsylvania's \nState attorney general for the Drug Abuse Resistance Education Program, \nand more recently has been chairman of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control \nBoard, having been appointed there in May of 1995.\n  In Pennsylvania, that is a major board, quasi-judicial, and serving \nas chairman gives one very extensive administrative responsibilities. \nIn that capacity, he has simplified the procedures there in a context \nof some 20,000 licensees, so that he has a very extensive background to \ngive diversity to the middle district.\n  On Friday, the Senate confirmed another distinguished lawyer, \nChristopher C. Conner, from Harrisburg, PA. Mr. Connor is chair of the \nlitigation department of Mette, Evans and Woodside, one of the largest \nlaw firms in Pennsylvania.\n  He, too, brings excellent academic credentials, being a graduate of \nCornell University in 1979 and the Dickinson Law School in 1982, where \nhe was editor of the National Appellate Moot Court Team.\n  He has been active in bar association affairs, taking on the vice \npresidency of the Pennsylvania bar, coauthoring a Law Review article on \n``Partisan Elections, the Albatross of the Pennsylvania Appellate \nJudiciary.''\n  Interestingly, with the Supreme Court of the United States recently \ndeclaring that candidates for judicial office are now free to campaign, \nthat may be a great impetus to take judges out of elective office; \nsomething which I believe should have been done years ago in \nPennsylvania and something I urged as long ago as 1968 when we were \npreparing Pennsylvania's constitution, which was adopted in 1969.\n  Mr. Connor has also served as adjunct professor at the Widner \nUniversity School of Law on the Harrisburg campus where he taught \npretrial procedure. So he brings a very diversified background and an \nexcellent background to the middle district.\n\n[[Page S7462]]\n\n  I am pleased to note that the majority leader is going to go right \ndown the list on nominees and has stated earlier today that we would \nconsider the nomination of Judge Brooks Smith, who is the chief judge \nof the Western District of Pennsylvania. The Third Circuit being in \ndire need of additional judicial manpower.\n  Chief Judge Edward R. Becker, one of the most distinguished judges in \nthe United States, has commented about the serious state of affairs \nthere, and I am anxious to see District Court Judge Brooks Smith \nreceive his vote tomorrow. I am confident that he will be confirmed.\n  Judge Smith was reported out of the Judiciary Committee on a vote of \n12 to 7, with three Democrats--Senator Biden, Senator Kohl, and Senator \nEdwards--voting for Judge Smith.\n  It is my hope that we will soon establish a protocol to eliminate the \npartisan differences which have plagued the Federal judicial nominating \nprocess for many years.\n  Now, with a Republican President, President Bush, and a Senate \ncontrolled by the Democrats, there have been delays which I believe are \nexcessive. But I have to say at the same time that when President \nClinton, a Democrat, was in the White House, and the Senate was \ncontrolled by Republicans, similarly the delays were excessive.\n  It is my view that the Federal judgeships are too important to be \nembroiled in partisan politics or payback or delay. I have proposed a \nprotocol which would establish a timetable: So many days after a \nnominee is submitted by the President there ought to be a Judiciary \nCommittee hearing. So many days later there ought to be action by the \nJudiciary Committee, voted up or down; and, if voted up, so many days \nlater there ought to be floor consideration for confirmation by the \nentire Senate--with that not being an ironclad schedule. If cause is \nshown, at the discretion of the chairman of the committee on \nnotification to the ranking member there could be a reasonable delay. \nSimilarly, with the majority leader upon notice to the minority leader, \nthere could be a reasonable delay on the vote before the Senate.\n  But I believe the American people generally are sick and tired of \npartisan politics. They want to see the Senate work together and \nnowhere is that more important than in the selection of Federal judges.\n  So I am pleased to speak about these three distinguished lawyers who \nhave been confirmed by the Senate and will be sworn in soon. I am also \nlooking forward to the addition of Judge Brooks Smith to the Court of \nAppeals of the Third Circuit, which is very much in need of his \nservices.\n  I thank the Chair. In the absence of any other Senator seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I support the nomination of \nJulia Smith Gibbons and would have voted aye to confirm her nomination \nto the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Mr. THOMPSON. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be here today as \nthe Senate takes up for consideration the nomination of Judge Julia \nSmith Gibbons to be a U.S. Circuit Judge for the Sixth Circuit. I am \ngrateful to my colleagues for their unanimous vote on Friday in support \nof cloture on this nomination to allow it to come to a vote today.\n  I support this nomination, and I am confident my colleagues will do \nso as well when they learn of Judge Gibbons's background and \nqualifications. Judge Gibbons will be a welcome addition to the Sixth \nCircuit. Before I address Judge Gibbons's qualifications, I want to let \nmy colleagues know of the problems confronting the Sixth Circuit.\n  Today, 29 of the 179 U.S. Circuit Court judgeships remain unfilled. \nEight of those 29 vacancies are in the Sixth Circuit. Let me put that \ninto perspective: 28 percent of all of the vacant circuit judgeships in \nthe country occur in just one of the 13 Circuits.\n  These 8 vacancies constitute one-half of the 16 judgeships allocated \nto the Sixth Circuit, which is twice the number of vacancies in any \nother circuit. Meanwhile, the court's caseload continues to rise.\n  Not surprisingly, the Sixth Circuit is also the slowest appellate \ncourt in the Federal system. According to the Chief Judge of the Sixth \nCircuit, the average time from filing to decision is 2 years, some 6 \nmonths slower than the next slowest circuit.\n  We must also recognize that the vacancy rate does not only affect the \nSixth Circuit and litigants before that court. In order to fill its \nannual need for over 160 three-judge panels to hear cases, the Sixth \nCircuit must bring in visiting judges from other circuits or from \ndistrict courts. Last fiscal year, visiting judge handled almost 20 \npercent of the Sixth Circuit's workload, and the Court relied on \nvisiting judges twice as often as any other circuit.\n  While some of these visiting judges are senior judges, many are \nactive circuit and district judges. These judges maintain a full docket \nthemselves, in addition to pitching in to assist the Sixth Circuit. As \ndistrict judges spend more time handling appellate cases, they must put \noff acting on their own dockets. The ripple effect caused by the \nvacancy rate on the Sixth Circuit is therefore much broader than we \nmight suppose. According to a recent witness before the Judiciary \nCommittee, the demands being made on district judges within the Sixth \nCircuit to fill seats on three-judge panels are so burdensome, that \nmany district judges are now refusing what had been considered a \nprestigious assignment.\n  The vacancy rate on the Sixth Circuit is placing a significant burden \non the entire Federal judiciary, which would be overburdened even if \nevery vacancy were filled.\n  Some of the adverse impacts of the vacancy rate on the Sixth Circuit \nare not so readily discernible or can be quantified. For instance, \nvisiting judges from outside the circuit or from the district courts \nmay not be as familiar with Sixth Circuit law as the judges of the \nSixth Circuit themselves. The court's reliance on such a large \ncontingent of visiting judges increases the risk of intra-circuit \nconflict among different panels of the court, making en\n\n[[Page S7463]]\n\nbanc review by the full Sixth Circuit more frequent. And en banc review \nplaces greater burdens on the court by requiring that all active \njudges, rather than just a portion of them, give the case their \nattention.\n  I am not seeking to lay blame. I am just pointing out that we must \novercome the differences that have led us to the quagmire in which we \nfind ourselves. And I believe it is fair for me to do so. During \nPresident Clinton's administration, I did all I could to get the \nPresident's nominees to the district courts in Tennessee confirmed \nquickly. I also shepherded through the Senate the nomination of the \nlast judge confirmed to the Sixth Circuit, Ronald Gilman.\n  I hope that the fact that the Senate is moving to take up the \nnomination of Judge Gibbons bodes well for our willingness to take up \nother nominations to the Sixth Circuit.\n  Let me turn now to the specific nomination before us. Despite her \nrelative youth for such a position, Judge Julia Smith Gibbons been a \njudge for over 20 years. I am confident that the Senate will not \nconsider any more highly qualified nominee this year.\n  Judge Gibbons was born and raised in Pulaski, TN, which is a small \ntown in south-central Tennessee less than 20 miles from Lawrenceburg, \nwhere I grew up. She attended Vanderbilt University in Nashville, from \nwhich she received her B.A. magna cum laude in 1972 and where she was \nelected to membership in Phi Beta Kappa, the national honor society.\n  Judge Gibbons then left Tennessee to attend law school in our \nneighbor to the east at the University of Virginia Law School, where \nshe was a member of the editorial board of the law review and was \nelected to the Order of the Coif, the national legal honor society.\n  Upon graduating from law school, she returned to Tennessee to clerk \nfor Judge William Miller of the Sixth Circuit, the court to which Judge \nGibbons has been nominated. In 1976, Judge Gibbons became an associate \nwith a Memphis law firm.\n  After 3 years practicing law, Judge Gibbons joined the administration \nof Governor Lamar Alexander as the Governor's legal advisor in 1979. In \n1981, Governor Alexander appointed Judge Gibbons to the Tennessee \nCircuit Court for the Fifteenth Judicial Circuit, which covers Memphis \nand Shelby County, and she was elected to a full term in 1982.\n  In 1983, Judge Gibbons was appointed United States District Judge for \nthe Western District of Tennessee by President Reagan, the first woman \nto hold such a position in Tennessee. At the time, she was the youngest \nFederal judge in the Nation. From 1994 to 2000, she served as Chief \nJudge of the court.\n  She is very highly regarded by the bar as an exceptional trial judge. \nWhile she was being considered for this appointment and since her \nnomination, I have heard from many lawyers who have practiced before \nher extolling her virtues as a trial judge.\n  Her reputation is national and has been recognized by the Chief \nJustice, who has appointed her to the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict \nLitigation, the Judicial Resources Committee of the Judicial \nConference, and the Judicial Officer Resources Working Group.\n  Despite her heavy judicial workload, Judge Gibbons has remained \nactive in her church and community, serving as an elder of the Idlewild \nPresbyterian Church and as a former president of the Memphis Rotary \nClub.\n  In sum, I am confident that Judge Gibbons will be an outstanding \nmember of the Sixth Circuit, as she has been an outstanding trial \njudge.\n  Before I yield, let me thank Chairman Leahy and his staff, and \nSenator Hatch and his staff for their cooperation and assistance in \nmoving this nomination forward. I hope our action today on Judge \nGibbons bodes well for getting the remaining Sixth Circuit vacancies \nfilled expeditiously.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to support the nomination \nof Judge Julia Smith Gibbons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/29/senate-section/article/S7463-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7463]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my dear friend \nRoy Estess on his well deserved retirement, to thank him for his many \nyears of dedicated service to our nation, and to wish him the very best \nas he pursues other interests and enjoys what I hope will be many fine \nyears of health and happiness with his family.\n  Roy S. Estess, a native of Tylertown, MS, is retiring as director of \nNASA's John C. Stennis Space Center in south Mississippi. As director \nof Stennis Space Center for more than 13 years, Roy has been \nresponsible for accomplishing the center's current NASA missions, \nrocket propulsion testing and remote sensing applications. Other \nresponsibilities have included managing the Space Shuttle Main Engine \ntest program; planning and accomplishing advanced propulsion test \nactivities for NASA, some Department of Defense projects, and certain \nindustry propulsion development and launch vehicle development \nprograms; conducting research and technology development in earth and \nenvironmental sciences; commercializing remote sensing technology in \ncooperation with industry and government; developing technology for use \nin propulsion test and launch operations; and managing the overall \ncenter. Roy's vision and leadership have directly lead to Stennis Space \nCenter becoming a unique Federal city that is home to more than 30 \nFederal, State, academic and private organizations.\n  Roy Estess graduated from Mississippi State University with a degree \nin aerospace engineering. He also has accomplished various graduate \nlevel studies, including completion of the advanced management program \nat the Harvard Graduate Business School. He is a registered \nprofessional engineer in the State of Mississippi and is a member and \npast chairman of the advisory committee to the College of Engineering \nat Mississippi State University. Roy is also a member of several \nprofessional societies, some of which include Tau Beta Pi; the American \nInstitute of Aeronautics and Astronautics; the Mississippi Academy of \nSciences; and the National Space Club.\n  Roy has held various engineering and management positions during his \n42 years of service in the United States government. He began his \ncareer as a civilian employee in the United States Air Force at \nBrookley Field in Alabama, and later at Robbins Air Force Base in \nGeorgia. Roy came to the NASA Stennis Space Center in 1966 as a \npropulsion test engineer, working on perhaps the greatest technological \nachievement of all time, the Apollo missions to the moon. Roy worked on \ntesting the second stage of the Saturn V moon vehicle during those \nexciting times. Working his way up through the ranks, he later served \nas head of the Applications Engineering Office, deputy of the Earth \nResources Laboratory and director of the Regional Applications Program. \nFrom 1980 through 1988, Roy served as deputy director of Stennis Space \nCenter and was named director in January, 1989. From 1992 to 1993, he \nwas temporarily assigned to NASA Headquarters in Washington, D.C. as a \nspecial assistant to two consecutive NASA Administrators. From \nFebruary, 2001 to April, 2002, Roy was temporarily assigned as acting \ndirector of the Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX.\n  Roy Estess has been named the recipient of numerous awards and \nhonors, some of which include: the Presidential Distinguished Service, \ntwice, and Meritorious Senior Executive Awards; NASA's Distinguished \nExceptional Service, Equal Opportunity and Outstanding Leadership \nMedals; the National Distinguished Executive Service Award for Public \nService; and the Alumni Fellow of Mississippi State University; as well \nas Citizen of the Year in his home town.\n  Roy has served Mississippi and the nation in numerous ways outside of \nhis professional career. In 1969, when south Mississippi was hit by the \ndevastating hurricane Camille, Roy served on the Gulf coast disaster \nrecovery team, making extraordinary efforts to help save lives and \nproperty in our state. An Eagle Scout himself, Roy has long been an \nactive supporter of the Boy Scouts of America, including serving as \nScout\n\n[[Page S7464]]\n\nMaster of Troop 87 of Picayune from 1966 to 1978. Roy has also served \nas a Deacon at his church, the First Baptist Church in Picayune.\n  Roy and his wife, Zann, reside in Pearl River County, MS. They have \ntwo children, Andy and Mauri, and two grandchildren, Conner and Drew.\n  I know my colleagues will join me in appreciation of Roy Estess for \nhis extraordinary career of service to the nation and his community and \nin wishing him and his family the very best in all of their plans for \nthe future. I am proud to call Roy Estess my friend. God bless you, \nRoy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/29/senate-section/article/S7464-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       21ST CENTURY MEDICARE ACT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, our health care system has increased the \nlifespan and quality of life of our citizens. Our population is aging; \npeople with chronic conditions are living longer. The number of \nMedicare beneficiaries is increasing and will continue to increase as \nbaby boomers retire.\n  As I have listened to the debate over the last two weeks, I think we \ncan all agree on one thing, the seniors in this Nation deserve the best \npossible health care, of which prescription drug coverage is a vital \ncomponent. All of us want to provide Medicare beneficiaries with \nprescription drug coverage this year. Unfortunately we do not agree on \nhow this coverage should be provided.\n  I support the Tripartisan bill for several simple reasons. The \nTripartisan bill operates on the fundamental principles of efficiency, \nquality, and choice. It balances all of the issues and provides a \npermanent solution--all of which result in cost savings and \naffordability. Balance is a key point here.\n  We do not offer a plan that cannot be sustained, resulting in bigger \nproblems down the road. We do not offer a plan that ends abruptly. We \ndo not offer a plan offering everything to everyone, knowing full well \nthat it cannot work, as the Graham-Kennedy bill does. We provide \nMedicare beneficiaries with four key elements: First; Choice. Giving \nseniors the right to choose a plan and the right to choose a particular \nmedication is the greatest benefit we can offer Medicare beneficiaries. \nUnder the Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill, seniors can only get a government \nrun prescription drug plan. The Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill forces \nseniors and their physicians into government run formularies. This is \nnot what we want for our seniors and their doctors; Second; Quality. I \ndo not believe that the Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill has any incentive to \nimprove quality--over and over, we have seen how government run \nprograms have failed our health care system. Our Tripartisan bill makes \na concerted effort to improve and modernize Medicare, by offering \nseniors choice not only in prescription drug coverage but for overall \nmedical coverage as well; Third; Efficiency and Cost containment. The \nTripartisan bill fosters competition, based on quality and cost. The \nGraham-Miller-Kennedy bill does not. The Graham-Miller-Kennedy bill \ncannot deliver drugs efficiently by making the government the sole \nregulator of Medicare drug coverage. The Tripartisan bill guarantees \nthat at least two plans will compete in each region, giving seniors the \nright and choice to pick the plans that best suit their needs; and \nFourth; Balance. The Tripartisan bill balances the needs of seniors \nwith benefits. We improve coverage for the sickest, poorest seniors by \nhelping needy seniors meet their health care costs through generous \nsubsidies. We use an assets test to determine who needs assistance. \nWhat is so wrong with this? All we are doing is applying asset testing \ncriteria for prescription drug coverage. I do want to make a correction \nto my statement from 7/22/02, The Family Opportunity Act does not have \nan assets test as I indicated. Rather it has an income and disability \ntest.\n  In conclusion, I believe the model of the Tripartisan bill is the \nonly workable, long lasting, and fair plan for our seniors and \ntaxpayers. The Tripartisan bill model is the only way to achieve a \nlong-term solution to provide prescription drug coverage to Medicare \nbeneficiaries and, at the same time, give seniors, their families, and \ndoctors choice. It is not a quick fix to get immediate support for \nsomething that is not going to last, like the Graham-Miller-Kennedy \nbill.

Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleagues in \nthe Senate in cosponsoring S. 1022, the Federal Employees Health \nInsurance Premium Conversion Act. This legislation will enable Federal \nand military retirees to take advantage of premium conversion, which \nwould allow individual retirees to pay their health insurance premiums \nwith pre-tax dollars. In 2000, this tax benefit was extended to current \nFederal employees under a Presidential directive, and it is a benefit \navailable to many private sector employees, and State and local \ngovernment employees. It only makes sense to bring equity to the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Program.\n  Furthermore, this legislation will allow uniformed services retiree \nbeneficiaries, their family members and survivors to pay the TRICARE \nPrime enrollment fees and TRICARE Standard supplemental insurance \npremiums with pre-tax dollars.\n  I am happy to join my colleagues by supporting this critical \nlegislation and to show my continued support of these Federal civilian \nand military retirees for their dedicated service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/29/senate-section/article/S7464-3", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 24, 1994 \nin New York, NY. Two gay men were assaulted by four men who made anti-\ngay remarks. The assailants, John Gorman and Kevin Shout, both 22, \nMichael Higgins, 21, and James Shout 27, were charged with assault and \naggravated harassment in connection with the incident.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation and changing \ncurrent law, we can change hearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/29/senate-section/article/S7464-4", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE IN EGYPT\n\n Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the news from Egypt this morning \nis both disappointing and disheartening. Egyptian democracy activist \nand academic Saad Eddin Ibrahim was sentenced to 7 years in jail \nfollowing a retrial for charges, according to the BBC, ``of tarnishing \nthe country's image abroad and other offenses.''\n  Many believe that the case against Mr. Ibrahim, who is a dual \nEgyptian-American citizen, is politically motivated and a not-so-veiled \neffort to stifle political debate in that country. Unfortunately, \ntoday's verdict only underscores that the rule of law and democratic \ninstitutions continue to be weak and non-functioning in Egypt.\n  It is my hope and expectation that Secretary Powell will clearly, \npublicly and forcefully register the concerns of the United States with \nMr. Ibrahim's case to senior Egyptian leaders. I would offer that it is \nnot Mr. Ibrahim but the Egyptian government--and its weak judiciary, \nirresponsible and anti-Semitic media, and questionable ties with North \nKorean missile technicians--that consistently tarnishes the country's \nimage abroad.\n  To put it simply, the United States must expect more from its ally in \nthe Middle East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/29/senate-section/article/S7464-5", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7464-S7465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MADE IN THE U.S.A.\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I proudly rise today to celebrate \na truly remarkable milestone in the American automobile industry. \nToday, Toyota Motor North America will produce its 10 millionth North \nAmerican-built vehicle. This notable achievement will take place at the \nToyota production facility located in Georgetown KY.\n\n[[Page S7465]]\n\n  I am extremely pleased that the more than 8,000 employees at the \nGeorgetown facility will have the unique and historical opportunity to \nproduce the 10 millionth Toyota to say Made in America. On a personal \nnote, I myself bought a Camry last November, born and bred at the \nGeorgetown facility in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n  Today, Toyota's dedicated team members annually build over 900,000 \nAvalons, Camrys, Corollas, Sequoias, Seinnas, Tacomas, and Tundras in \nthe United States; in fiscal year 2001, Toyota sold nearly 2 million \nvehicles in North America. This means that nearly all of the cars sold \nin America are made here as well. Nothing gives me more pride than to \nsee a product stamped with made in the U.S.A. especially when that \nmeans made in Kentucky.\n  Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky began production in Georgetown \nin 1988. Today, the Georgetown production facility is Toyota's largest \nproduction plant in all of North America due largely to their selfless \nand committed workforce. With two vehicle production lines and a \npowertrain engine and axle facility, more than 8,000 team members build \naround 500,000 vehicles and nearly 400,000 engines each and every year. \nKentucky's skilled production team has been the key to the facility's \nextraordinary success, and I can personally vouch for the quality of \nKentucky craftsmanship.\n  To celebrate their many accomplishments, Toyota is donating 20 Sienna \nminivans in communities where facilities are located. In Georgetown, \nminivans will be donated to the Salvation Army and Senior Citizens of \nGeorgetown/Scott County. Also, Toyota Motor Manufacturing North America \nhas announced a $1 million gift to the children of Toyota's \nmanufacturing team members through a college scholarship fund.\n  I would like to congratulate everyone involved with Toyota for \nreaching such a prestigious mark in the auto industry. Specifically, I \nwould like to thank the employees in Georgetown for all that they do \nfor Toyota and the local business community. These hard-working men and \nwomen deserve praise for their dedication and commitment to excellence. \nThey represent the spirit of capitalism and embody the American working \nman and woman.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/29/senate-section/article/S7465-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LINDA JACKSON\n\n Mr. BURNS.

A bill to improve the financial and environmental \nsustainability of the water programs of the United States; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining \nmy colleagues on the Environment and Public Works Committee to \nintroduce the Water Quality Investment Act of 2002. When I because \nChairman of the Committee in 1999, one of my top priorities was a \nrenewed commitment to our Nation's water systems and the Americans \nserved by them. Senator Crapo, as Chairman of the Fisheries, Wildlife \nand Water Subcommittee shared my commitment and made this issue a focus \nof his subcommittee.\n  Earlier this year, I joined with Chairmen Jeffords and Graham, as \nwell as Senator Crapo, to introduce S. 1961, the Water Investment Act. \nThis was a strong bipartisan bill that took compromise by all four \nmembers to achieve. Unfortunately, the bill that was reported out of \nCommittee was a partisan proposal that added several provisions that \nwill prevent the bill from moving forward. Our majority colleagues \ninsisted on changing the principled funding formula included in S. 1961 \nfor a politically driven one that has no hope of surviving the lengthy \nlegislative process while also compromising the needs of the country's \nsmall States. Further, they added Davis Bacon, an onerous labor \nprovision that continues to divide the Senate and only serves to cloud \nthe future of an otherwise strong bill.\n  While I can no longer support S. 1961, clean water remains one of my \ntop priorities as the Ranking Republican on the EPW Committee. \nTherefore, I join Senators Inhofe and Crapo today in introducing a \nstreamlined bill that is free of the controversies that now plague S. \n1961.\n  I am a strong advocate of limited government and when it comes to \nwater infrastructure, I do not believe the primary responsibility of \nfinancing local water needs lies with the Federal Government. I am \nequally adamant, however, that the Federal Government should not place \nunfunded mandates on our local communities. This bill strikes a \nresponsible balance between meeting Federal obligations and maintaining \nlocal responsibility and state flexibility.\n  So much of our Nation's water infrastructure is aging and in \ndesperate need of replacement. Coupled with the aging problem is the \ncost burden that local communities face in order to comply with ever \nincreasing State and Federal clean water mandates. This bill addresses \nthese problems and makes structural changes to ensure that we avoid a \nnational crisis now and in the future.\n  The legislation authorizes $35 billion over the next 5 years in \nFederal contribution to the total water infrastructure need to help \ndefray the cost of the mandates placed on communities. This is a \nsubstantial increase in Federal commitment, but not nearly as high as \nsome would have preferred.\n  This commitment does not come without additional responsibilities. \nWhen the Clean Water Act was amended by Congress in 1987, a debate I \nremember well, we set up a revolving fund so more Federal money would \nnot be required. The fund would continually revolve providing a \ncontinual pool of money for water needs. Unfortunately, appropriations \nhave not kept pace with the Federal share and the funds have not been \nable to revolve at levels necessary to meet the increasing need. \nFurther, as more Federal mandates have been imposed on local \ncommunities, facilities have exhausted their useful life while local \nofficials have found raising water rates unpalatable. Thus, what was \nnot to be\n\n[[Page S7471]]\n\nFederal responsibility became a Federal necessity. Now we are faced \nwith a near crisis situation.\n\n  This bill makes certain that we do not go down that road again. The \nFederal government will help to defray the costs of Federal mandates, \nbut with the new money comes a new requirement that all utilities do a \nbetter job of managing their funds and plan for future costs. The bill \nrequires utilities to assess the condition of their facility and pipes \nand develop a plan to pay for the long-term repair and replacement of \nthese assets. That plan will include Federal assistance, but it will be \nlimited assistance.\n  We also make additional structural changes to the law both to address \nfinancial concerns and to help achieve improved management of these \nwater systems. One such change to the Clean Water Act is to incorporate \na Drinking Water Act provision that allows States, at their discretion, \nto provide principal forgiveness on loans and to extend the repayment \nperiod for loans to disadvantaged communities. This flexibility will \nprovide help to communities struggling with high combined sewer \noverflow cost to secure additional financial help. This bill also \npromotes other important cost saving measures that many communities are \nalready experimenting with throughout the country. It will also provide \nmuch needed information and planning tools to communities across the \ncountry who are experiencing a months-long drought.\n  Again, I am disappointed I could not maintain my support for S. 1961, \nthe Water Investment Act. However, the bill that passed the Committee \ntook several steps in the wrong direction by including not only a \nformula but new mandates and regulatory requirements that will prevent \nthe bill from moving forward. Clean water should be a priority for \nevery member of the Senate. We need to come together around a bill that \ncan go forward. S. 1961 is no longer that bill.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the Water \nQuality Investment Act this year and commemorate the 30th Anniversary \nof the Clean Water Act with a renewed commitment to the nation's \nwaterways and the people who depend on them.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague, Senator Bob \nSmith, to introduce the Water Quality Investment Act of 2002. We are \nintroducing this legislation to reinvigorate the debate on investing in \nour Nation's water and wastewater infrastructure.\n  When I became Chairman of the Fisheries, Wildlife, and Water \nSubcommittee, I began the long process of assessing the performance of \nour water and wastewater infrastructure statutes and exploring needed \nimprovements to address outstanding problems. With the able partnership \nof Senator Smith, over the past 3 years, I convened many hearings and \nmeeting with the stakeholders and agency officials to better understand \nhow to address the problems of communities with unmet water and \nwastewater infrastructure needs.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Smith and I joined with Senator Bob Graham \nand Senator Jim Jeffords to introduce S. 1961, the Water Investment \nAct. As introduced, this measure represented a strong and principled \nbipartisan measure. The major facets of the bill, heightened investment \nlevels in our infrastructure, increased flexibility to states, and \nstrong accountability by utilities, reflect the commonalities of need \nand recommendations by stakeholders, experts, and communities. I \ncommend my colleagues for their hard work and the partnership we \nestablished in putting together a model bill, which was closely \nfollowed by our colleagues in the House of Representatives.\n  I am proud of the overwhelming support that bill generated. As \nintroduced, S. 1961 represented the collaboration and hard work of many \nwho recognize that the goal of assisting communities should be our \nguiding principle. Too many communities are waiting for the assistance \nthis bill will provide to see the legislation brought down by \ndifficult, unnecessary proposals.\n  While by no means perfect, I hoped the committee process would not \nturn this legislation into a vehicle for individual proposals and \ncontroversial concepts. Against my hope, S. 1961 started to unravel as \nsome worked to undermine the compromise and the bipartisan nature of \nthe legislation. As you are well aware, the markup for S. 1961 was \ncontentious and divisive. It was unfortunate that S. 1961, which \nstarted out as a bipartisan effort between the four principals, ended \nup in partisan votes. Despite many warnings, some felt it necessary to \nbring this legislation down simply to advance narrow agendas.\n  I have welcomed the opportunity to work again with committed \nstakeholders and others to craft this carefully-balanced measure. This \nnew bill builds upon the foundations of S. 1961 as introduced and adds \nimportant refinements brought forward by the affected communities and \nstakeholders. It is a proposal that serves the critical needs of our \nnation's water and wastewater infrastructure in a cost-effective and \nresponsible manner.\n  I look forward to the Senate's consideration of a sound, balanced, \nand carefully-deliberated bill to address the water and wastewater \nneeds of the Nation. I believe all of us share that goal and we should \nall rally around the Water Quality Investment Act as the means to \nachieve that goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Roberts, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Johnson, \n        and Mr. Brownback):\n  S. 2814.

Mr. President, today, along with Senators Roberts, \nConrad, Johnson and Brownback, I am introducing legislation to clarify \nCongressional intent regarding minor oilseed loan rates in the Farm \nSecurity and Rural Investment Act, FSRIA, of 2002.\n  In early June, the United States Department of Agriculture \nincorrectly interpreted the intent of the new farm bill when the Farm \nService Agency arbitrarily announced a wide range of minor oilseed loan \nrates. For some crops, the loan rate increased substantially, while for \nothers, the rates plunged.\n  Not once during the farm bill debate was there ever discussion of \nsplitting apart minor oilseed loan rates. In fact, the minor oilseed \nindustry and farmers alike anticipated a county-level increase in loan \nrates from $9.30 to $9.60/cwt. The announcement by the Farm Service \nAgency caught virtually everyone in the agriculture community by \nsurprise.\n  This legislation is intended to correct this misinterpretation of the \nnew farm bill, and to prevent what will certainly be extreme acreage \nshifts among these crops in the coming years should these rates be \nallowed to stand. These acreage shifts will destroy segments of the \nminor oilseed industry that have been painstakingly developed over a \nnumber of years.\n  For instance, already, users of the oil derived from oil sunflowers \nanticipate supply shortages next year and have indicated they may \nremove sunflower oil from their product mix. Conversely, incentives \ncaused by the much higher confectionery sunflower loan rate could \ndeluge USDA with massive loan forfeitures of low quality confectionery \nsunflowers if farmers simply grow for the loan rate rather than a \nquality crop that has a market.\n  The legislation amends the new farm bill by simply--and redundantly--\nlisting each minor oilseed's loan rate separately. The legislation also \nreinstates the crambe and sesame seed loan rates that were eliminated \nby USDA.\n  This legislation should not be needed. USDA could easily repeal the \ncurrent announcement of minor oilseed loan rates in favor of rates \nconsistent with this legislation and the new farm bill, as I and my \ncolleagues have asked in recent letters on this issue.\n  I request unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2814\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to reduce air pollution \nthrough expansion of cap and trade programs, to provide an alternative \nregulatory classification for units subject to the cap and trade \nprograms, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, today, at the request of \nthe President of the United States, I am introducing his proposal to \naddress power plant pollution in the Nation. Introduction of his bill \nis an important step forward in the long progress of amending the Clean \nAir to ensure that we are both improving air quality and building upon \nthe most successful environmental program in Federal law, the Acid Rain \nProgram.\n  One of the first goals that I announced when I became Chairman of the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee in 1999 was to craft a multi-\nemissions bill for the utility sector. It was a new idea at the time, \nand we have had to work hard since then to build support for the \nconcept. Recently the Environment and Public Works Committee held a \nmarkup during which four separate legislative approaches to a multi-\npollutant system were considered, one of those was a complete \nsubstitute that I presented to my colleagues.\n  Today the President offers us a fifth option for our consideration. \nEach of these legislative drafts contain worthy and groundbreaking \nideas as to how we can move forward on the difficult area of reducing \nair pollution without harming our economy. None is exactly like the \nothers, and there are some clear policy differences among them. I am \nobviously partial to my own approach, but all five should be discussed. \nI am confident that the Senate can, if we work together in a bipartisan \nfashion, find a consensus approach that will be acceptable to a \nmajority of Senators.\n  I look forward to that process, and I welcome the President to that \ndebate.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a summary of the \nPresident's legislation that was provided by the Administration, and \nthat the text of the bill also be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Summary of Clear Skies Act of 2002\n\n       The Clear Skies Act of 2002 (Clear Skies Act) amends Title \n     IV of the Clean Air Act to establish new cap-and-trade \n     programs requiring reductions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen \n     oxides, and mercury emissions from electric generating \n     facilities and amends Title I of the Clean Air Act to provide \n     an alternative regulatory classification for units subject to \n     the cap and trade programs.\n       Common Provisions: The Clear Skies Act establishes a new \n     Part A, which contains the program elements shared by the \n     sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury programs. A cap-\n     and-trade program will be implemented for each pollutant. \n     Common definitions, allowance system procedures, monitoring, \n     permitting and compliance requirements, penalties for non-\n     compliance, and auction procedures apply to the new trading \n     programs and are modeled largely after the existing Acid Rain \n     Program.\n       Under Section 403, the Administrator must establish an \n     allowance system for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and \n     mercury that is essentially the same as in the existing Acid \n     Rain Program but that provides for safety valve, i.e., a \n     direct sale of allowances by the Administrator at a fixed \n     price for use in meeting the requirement to hold allowances \n     at least equal to annual emissions.\n       Under Section 404, the new trading programs must be \n     reflected in Title V permits. This is similar to the \n     permitting provisions of the existing Acid Rain Program.\n       Under Section 405, affected units must meet essentially the \n     same type of continuous emission monitoring and reporting \n     requirements under the new trading programs as under the Acid \n     Rain Program.\n       Under Section 406, a graduated, automatic excess emissions \n     penalty replaces the existing single, automatic penalty under \n     the Acid Rain Program.\n       Under Section 407, fossil-fuel fired boilers, turbines, and \n     integrated gasification combined cycle plants that are not \n     otherwise subject to the new sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, \n     and mercury trading programs may opt into these program if \n     certain requirements are met. Once a unit opts into the new \n     trading programs, it cannot withdraw.\n       Section 409 requires the Administrator to promulgate \n     regulations for auctions of allowances under the new sulfur \n     dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury trading programs. All \n     auction proceeds will go to the general Treasury.\n       Section 410 establishes criteria and the process by which \n     the Administrator may recommend to Congress adjustment of the \n     total amounts of allowances available (whether through \n     allocation or auction) starting in 2018 under the new sulfur \n     dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury trading programs.\n       Sulfur Dioxide Emissions Reductions: The Clear Skies Act \n     establishes Part B, which retains in Sections 411-419, with \n     few changes, the relevant requirements of the existing Acid \n     Rain Program through December 31, 2009 and contains in \n     Sections 421-434 the new, lower annual caps on total sulfur \n     dioxide emissions and new allocation procedures starting \n     January 1, 2010.\n       Under Section 421, the new sulfur dioxide trading program \n     covers units in the U.S. and its territories. The program \n     includes existing fossil fuel-fired electricity generating \n     boilers and turbines and integrated gasification combined \n     cycle plants with generators having a nameplate capacity of \n     greater than 25 MW with certain exceptions for cogeneration \n     units. The program also includes new fossil fuel-fired \n     electricity generating boilers and turbines and integrated \n     gasification combined cycle plants regardless of size, except \n     for gas-fired units serving one or more generators with \n     total nameplate capacity of 25 MW of less and certain new \n     cogeneration units. In addition, solid waste incineration \n     units and units for treatment, storage, or disposal of \n     hazardous waste are exempted.\n       Under Section 422, compliance with the requirement to hold \n     allowances covering sulfur dioxide emissions in the new \n     trading program will be determined on a facility-wide basis. \n     The owner or operator must hold allowances for all the \n     affected units at a facility at least equal to the total \n     sulfur dioxide emissions for those units during the year.\n       Under Section 423, annual sulfur dioxide emissions for \n     affected units are capped at 4.5 million tons starting in \n     2010 and 3.0 million tons starting in 2018. During the first \n     year of the program, 99 percent of the allowances will be \n     allocated to affected units with an auction for the remaining \n     1 percent. Each subsequent year, an additional 1 percent of \n     the allowances for twenty years, and then an additional 2.5 \n     percent thereafter, will be auctioned until eventually all \n     the allowances are auctioned.\n\n[[Page S7473]]\n\n       Under Section 424, allowances are allocated to affected \n     units previously receiving allowances under the Acid Rain \n     Program based on their proportion of the total post-2009 Acid \n     Rain sulfur dioxide allowances currently recorded in their \n     Acid Rain Program allowance accounts. Units that received no \n     allocations under the Acid Rain Program are allocated \n     allowances based on the product of their baseline heat input \n     and a standard emission rate reflective of fuel type. If the \n     Administrator does not promulgate final allocations on a \n     timely basis a default provision takes effect that allocates \n     allowances to Acid Rain Program units based on heat input \n     data collected under that program and auctions other \n     allowances.\n       Under Section 425, once the Administrator places sulfur \n     dioxide allowances under the new trading program into \n     accounts in the Allowance Tracking System, all year 2010 and \n     later allowances allocated under the Acid Rain Program will \n     be removed from the accounts. All pre-2010 allowances under \n     the Acid Rain Program that have not been used will remain in \n     accounts and may be used to meet the requirement to hold \n     allowances in the new trading program.\n       Under Section 426, a reserve of 250,000 allowances is \n     established for affected units that combusted bituminous and \n     that, before 2008, install and operate sulfur dioxide control \n     technology and continue to combust such coal. The procedure \n     established for submission of applications by owners and \n     operators and approval of applications and award of \n     allowances by the Administrator is designed to ensure that \n     approval of those projects will result in the largest amount \n     of sulfur dioxide emission reductions achieved per allowance \n     awarded.\n       Under Sections 431-434, a separate emission limitation and \n     cap-and-trade program are provided for the States in the \n     Western Regional Air Partnership (WRAP). The cap-and-trade \n     program for the WRAP States goes into effect the third year \n     after the year 2018 or later when sulfur dioxide emissions \n     for these units exceed 271,000 tons. This cap-and-trade \n     program is analogous to the new nation-wide sulfur dioxide \n     trading program but establishes a second sulfur dioxide \n     emission limitation only for these WRAP units, which will be \n     subject to both the regional and the nationwide programs.\n       Nitrogen Oxides Emissions Reductions: The Clear Skies Act \n     establishes Part C, which retains in Sections 431-432 the \n     requirements of the existing Acid Rain Program for nitrogen \n     oxides and in Sections 461-465 the requirements of the \n     existing NOX State Implementation (SIP) call under \n     Section 110 of the Clean Air Act through December 31, 2007; \n     and contains in Sections 451-454 the new, annual caps on \n     total allowances and new, allocation procedures starting \n     January 1, 2008.\n       Under Section 451, the new nitrogen oxides trading program \n     covers the same units in the U.S. and its territories as the \n     new sulfur dioxide trading program, but separate cap-and-\n     trade systems are established for Zone 1 (largely the \n     eastern and part of the central portions of the U.S.) and \n     Zone 2 (the remainder of the U.S. and territories).\n       Under Section 452, compliance with the requirement to hold \n     allowances covering nitrogen oxides emissions will be \n     determined on a facility-wide basis, analogous to the way \n     compliance is determined under the new sulfur dioxide trading \n     programs. Only allowances issued for the zone in which the \n     facility is located can be used for compliance for that \n     facility.\n       Under Section 453, annual NOX emissions for \n     affected units in Zone 1 are capped at 1.562 million tons \n     starting in 2008 and 1.162 million tons starting in 2010. \n     Zone 2 annual emissions are capped at 538,000 tons. Each \n     year, the percentages of allowances allocated and auctioned \n     each year are the same as under the new sulfur trading \n     program.\n       Under Section 454, allowances are allocated to affected \n     units based on the proportionate share of their baseline heat \n     input to total heat input of the units in their respective \n     zone. If the Administrator does not promulgate final \n     allocations on a timely basis, a default provision, like that \n     under the new sulfur dioxide trading program, takes effect.\n       Sections 461-456 contains provisions that codify the \n     emission reduction requirements of the NOX SIP \n     Call that covers the eastern U.S. The SIPs are required to be \n     consistent with the NOX emission budgets \n     established under the NOX SIP Call. SIPs must be \n     submitted for certain full States and for certain portions of \n     some States as determined proposed by the Administrator in \n     the rulemaking that commenced February 22, 2002.\n       Mercury Emission Reductions: The Clear Skies Act \n     establishes Part D, which contains the new, annual caps on \n     total mercury allowances and new, allocation procedures \n     starting January 1, 2010.\n       Under Section 471, the new mercury trading program covers \n     coal-fired units that are covered by the new sulfur dioxide \n     and nitrogen oxides trading programs.\n       Under Section 472, compliance with the requirement to hold \n     allowances covering mercury emissions will be determined on a \n     facility-wide basis, analogous to the way compliance is \n     determined under the new sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides \n     trading programs.\n       Under Section 473, annual mercury emission are capped at 26 \n     tons starting in 2010 and 15 tons starting in 2018. Each \n     year, the percentages of allowances allocated and auctioned \n     each year are the same as under the new sulfur and nitrogen \n     oxides trading programs.\n       Under Section 474, allowances are allocated to affected \n     units based on the proportionate share of their baseline heat \n     input to total heat input of all affected units. For purposes \n     of allocating the allowances, each unit's baseline heat input \n     is adjusted to reflect the types of coal combusted by the \n     unit during the baseline period. If the Administrator does \n     not promulgate final allocations on a timely basis, a default \n     provision, like that under the new sulfur dioxide and \n     nitrogen oxides trading programs, takes effect.\n       Performance Standards for New Sources: To ensure that all \n     new affected units have appropriate controls, Part E \n     establishes, in section 481, performance standards for all \n     new boilers, combustion turbines, and integrated gasification \n     combined cycle plants (IGCCs) covered under the Act.\n       ``New'' units are those that commence construction or \n     reconstruction after the date of enactment. The standards \n     also apply to ``modified'' units that opt to meet the \n     applicable performance standard in lieu of case-specific \n     BACT.\n       These statutory performance standards include emission \n     limits for four pollutants: nitrogen oxides (NOX); \n     sulfur dioxide (SO2); mercury (Hg); and \n     particulate matter (PM). The Hg emission limit applies only \n     to coal. In addition, a PM emission limit is established for \n     existing oil-fired boilers to ensure reductions of nickel \n     from such units. All units subject to a performance standard \n     must monitor emissions using CEMS and use averaging times \n     similar to current NSPS.\n       Boilers and IGCCs are subject to a SO2 emission \n     limit of 2.0 lb/MWh; a NOX emission limit of 1.0 \n     lb/MWh; and a PM emission limit of 0.20 lb/MWh. Coal-fired \n     boilers and IGCCs are subject to a Hg emission limit of 0.015 \n     lb/GWh; however, alternative standards would apply in some \n     circumstances. Coal-fired combustion turbines are subject to \n     the same NOX, SO2, PM, and Hg emission \n     limits as boilers and IGCCs. Oil-fired combustion turbines \n     are subject to NOX emission limits ranging from \n     0.289 lb/MWh to 1.01 lb/MWh, an SO2 emission limit \n     of 2.0 lb/MWh, and a PM emission limit of 0.20 lb/MWh. Gas-\n     fired combustion turbines are subject to NOX \n     emission limits ranging from 0.084 lb/MWh to 0.56 lb/MWh. \n     Existing oil-fired boilers are subject to a PM emission limit \n     of 0.30 lb/MWh.\n       Research, Environmental Monitoring, and Assessment: Section \n     482 contains provisions for evaluating and reporting the \n     efficacy of the new sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and \n     mercury trading programs; and providing information \n     concerning whether the total amounts of allowances under \n     these programs starting in 2018 should be adjusted under \n     Section 410.\n       Exemption from Major Source Reconstruction Review \n     Requirements and Best Available Retrofit Control Technology \n     Requirements: Section 483 exempts units from the requirements \n     of New Source Review (NSR). The section also exempts these \n     sources from the requirement to install best available \n     retrofit technology (BART). These exemptions are created by \n     excluding affected sources from being ``major stationary \n     sources'' for purposes of Part C and D of the Clean Air Act.\n       Affected units constructed after enactment of the Clear \n     Skies Act must meet the performance standards for \n     NOX, SO2, PM, and CO specified in \n     Section 481, but a case-by-case review of the appropriate \n     control technology such as BACT or LAER is no longer \n     required. Similarly, modifications at existing affected units \n     must either comply with the performance standards for \n     NOX, SO2, PM, and CO established in \n     section 481 or comply with BACT. However, to qualify for this \n     exemption from NSR, an existing sources must either commit \n     within three years to meet the existing NSPS limit for PM of \n     0.03 lb/MMbtu in the future, or have begun to properly \n     operate any existing control technology to reduce PM \n     emissions or otherwise minimize PM emissions according to \n     best operational practices. To qualify for the exemption, an \n     existing source must also use good combustion practices to \n     minimize emissions of carbon monoxide. Permits issued in the \n     past to comply with the requirements of Parts C and D, \n     however, will remain in effect.\n       To ensure that national parks and other Class I areas are \n     protected, affected units located within 50 km of such an \n     area will remain subject to the requirements in Part C for \n     the protection of such areas.\n       States must ensure that the construction of new or modified \n     affected units will not cause or contribute to a violation of \n     the NAAQS or interfere with the programs to assure that the \n     NAAQS are met. States also must provide the public with an \n     opportunity to comment on the impact of the affected unit on \n     the NAAQS, or on any Class I areas within 50 km of the \n     facility.\n       For affected units, the definition of modification is \n     defined to mean changes that increases the hourly emissions \n     of any air pollutant.\n\n                                S. 2815\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

With regard to sulfur \n     dioxide allowances, the Administrator shall implement this \n     subsection under 40 CFR part 73 (2001), amended as \n     appropriate by the Administrator. With regard to nitrogen \n     oxides allowances and mercury allowances, the Administrator \n     shall implement this subsection by promulgating regulations \n     not later than twenty-four months after the date of enactment \n     of the Clear Skies Act of 2002. The regulations under this \n     subsection shall establish the allowance system prescribed \n     under this section, including, but not limited to, \n     requirements for the allocation, transfer, and use of \n     allowances under this title. Such regulations shall prohibit \n     the use of any allowance prior to the calendar year for which \n     the allowance was allocated or auctioned and shall provide, \n     consistent with the purposes of this title, for the \n     identification of unused allowances, and for such unused \n     allowances to be carried forward and added to allowances \n     allocated in subsequent years, except as otherwise \n     provided in section 425. Such regulations shall provide, \n     or shall be amended to provide, that transfers of \n     allowances shall not be effective until certification of \n     the transfer, signed by a responsible official of the \n     transferor, is received and recorded by the Administrator.\n       (c) Allowance Tracking System.--The Administrator shall \n     promulgate regulations establishing a system for issuing, \n     recording, and tracking allowances, which shall specify all \n     necessary procedures and requirements for an orderly and \n     competitive functioning of the allowance system. Such system \n     shall provide, by January 1, 2008, for one or more facility-\n     wide accounts for holding sulfur dioxide allowances, nitrogen \n     oxides allowances, and, if applicable, mercury allowances for \n     all affected units at an affected facility. With regard to \n     sulfur dioxide allowances, the Administrator shall implement \n     this subsection under 40 CFR part 73 (2001), amended as \n     appropriate by the Administrator. With regard to nitrogen \n     oxides allowances and mercury allowances, the Administrator \n     shall implement this subsection by promulgating regulations \n     not later than twenty-four months after the date of enactment \n     of the Clear Skies Act of 2002. All allowance allocations and \n     transfers shall, upon recordation by the Administrator, be \n     deemed a part of each unit's or facility's permit \n     requirements pursuant to section 404, without any further \n     permit review and revision.\n       (d) Nature of Allowances.--A sulfur dioxide allowance, \n     nitrogen oxides allowance, or mercury allowance allocated, \n     auctioned, or sold by the Administrator under this title is a \n     limited authorization to emit one ton of sulfur dioxide, one \n     ton of nitrogen oxides, or one ounce of mercury, as the case \n     may be, in accordance with the provisions of this title. Such \n     allowance does not constitute a property right. Nothing in \n     this title or in any other provision of law shall be \n     construed to limit the authority of the United States to \n     terminate or limit such authorization. Nothing in this \n     section relating to allowances shall be construed as \n     affecting the application of, or compliance with, any other \n     provision of this Act to an affected unit or facility, \n     including the provisions related to applicable National \n     Ambient Air Quality Standards and State implementation plans. \n     Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a \n     change of any kind in any State law regulating electric \n     utility rates and charges or affecting any State law \n     regarding such State regulation or as limiting State \n     regulation (including any prudency review) under such a State \n     law. Nothing in this section shall be construed as modifying \n     the Federal Power Act or as affecting the authority of the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under that Act. Nothing \n     in this title shall be construed to interfere with or impair \n     any program for competitive bidding for power supply in a \n     State in which such program is established. Allowances, once \n     allocated or auctioned to a person by the Administrator, may \n     be received, held, and temporarily or permanently transferred \n     in accordance with this title and the regulations of the \n     Administrator without regard to whether or not a permit is in \n     effect under title V or section 404 with respect to the unit \n     for which such allowance was originally allocated and \n     recorded.\n       (e) Prohibition.--(1) It shall be unlawful for any person \n     to hold, use, or transfer any allowance allocated, auctioned, \n     or sold by the Administrator under this title, except in \n     accordance with regulations promulgated by the Administrator.\n       (2) It shall be unlawful for any affected unit or for the \n     affected units at a facility to emit sulfur dioxide, nitrogen \n     oxides, and mercury, as the case may be, during a year in \n     excess of the number of allowances held for that unit or \n     facility for that year by the owner or operator as provided \n     in sections 412(c), 422, 432, 452, and 472.\n       (3) The owner or operator of a facility may purchase \n     allowances directly from the Administrator to be used only to \n     meet the requirements of sections 422, 432, 452, and 472, as \n     the case may be, for a specified year. Not later than thirty-\n     six months after the date of enactment of the Clear Skies Act \n     of 2002, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations \n     providing for direct sales of sulfur dioxide allowances, \n     nitrogen oxides allowances, and mercury allowances to an \n     owner or operator of a facility. The regulations shall \n     provide that--\n       (A) such allowances may be used only to meet the \n     requirements of section 422, 432, 452, and 472, as the case \n     may be, for such facility and for a year specified by the \n     Administrator,\n       (B) each such sulfur dioxide allowance shall be sold for \n     $4,000, each such nitrogen oxides allowance shall be sold for \n     $4,000, and each such mercury allowance shall be sold\n\n[[Page S7476]]\n\n     for $2,187.50, with such prices adjusted for inflation based \n     on the Consumer Price Index on the date of enactment of the \n     Clear Skies Act of 2002 and annually thereafter,\n       (C) the proceeds from any sales of allowances under \n     subparagraph (B) shall be deposited in the United States \n     Treasury.\n       (D) the allowances directly purchased for use for a \n     specified year shall be taken from, and reduce, the amount of \n     sulfur dioxide allowances, nitrogen oxides allowances, or \n     mercury allowances, as the case may be, that would otherwise \n     be auctioned under section 423, 453, or 473 starting for the \n     year after the specified year and continuing for each \n     subsequent year as necessary.\n       (E) if an owner or operator does not use any such allowance \n     in accordance with paragraph (A),\n       (i) the owner or operator shall hold the allowance for \n     deduction by the Administrator and\n       (ii) the Administrator shall deduct the allowance, without \n     refund or other form of recompense, and offer it for sale in \n     the auction from which it was taken under subparagraph (D) or \n     a subsequent relevant auction as necessary.\n       (F) if the direct sales of allowances result in the removal \n     of all sulfur dioxide allowances, nitrogen oxides allowances, \n     or mercury allowances, as the case may be, from auctions \n     under section 423, 453, or 473 for three consecutive years, \n     the Administrator shall conduct a study to determine whether \n     revisions to the relevant allowance trading program are \n     necessary and shall report the results to the Congress.\n       (4) Allowances may not be used prior to the calendar year \n     for which they are allocated or auctioned. Nothing in this \n     section or in the allowance system regulations shall relieve \n     the Administrator of the Administrator's permitting, \n     monitoring and enforcement obligations under this Act, nor \n     relieve affected facilities of their requirements and \n     liabilities under the Act.\n       (f) Competitive Bidding for Power Supply.--Nothing in this \n     title shall be construed to interfere with or impair any \n     program for competitive bidding for power supply in a State \n     in which such program is established.\n       (g) Applicability of the Antitrust Laws.--\n       (1) Nothing in this section affects--\n       (A) the applicability of the antitrust laws to the \n     transfer, use, or sale of allowances, or\n       (B) the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission under any provision of law respecting unfair \n     methods of competition or anticompetitive acts or practices.\n       (2) As used in this section, ``antitrust laws'' means those \n     Acts set forth in section 1 of the Clayton Act (15 U.S.C. \n     12), as amended.\n       (h) Public Utility Holding Company Act.--The acquisition or \n     disposition of allowances pursuant to this title including \n     the issuance of securities or the undertaking of any other \n     financing transaction in connection with such allowances \n     shall not be subject to the provisions of the Public Utility \n     Holding Company Act of 1935.\n       (i) Interpollutant Trading.--Not later than July 1, 2009, \n     the Administrator shall furnish to the Congress a study \n     evaluating the environmental and economic consequences of \n     amending this title to permit trading sulfur dioxide \n     allowances for nitrogen oxides allowances.\n       (j) International Trading.--Not later than 24 months after \n     the date of enactment of the Clear Skies Act of 2002, the \n     Administrator shall furnish to the Congress a study \n     evaluating the feasibility of international trading of sulfur \n     dioxide allowances, nitrogen oxides allowances, and mercury \n     allowances.\n\n     SEC. 404. PERMITS AND COMPLIANCE PLANS.\n\n       (a) Permit Program.--The provisions of this title shall be \n     implemented, subject to section 403, by permits issued to \n     units and facilities subject to this title and enforced in \n     accordance with the provisions of title V, as modified by \n     this title. Any such permit issued by the Administrator, or \n     by a State with an approved permit program, shall prohibit--\n       (1) annual emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, \n     and mercury in excess of the number of allowances required to \n     be held in accordance with sections 412(c), 422, 432, 452, \n     and 472,\n       (2) exceedances of applicable emissions rates under section \n     441.\n       (3) the use of any allowance prior to the year for which it \n     was allocated or auctioned, and\n       (4) contravention of any other provision of the permit.

Where an \n     affected facility consists of more than one affected unit, \n     such plan shall cover all such units, and such facility shall \n     be considered a ``facility'' under section 502(c). Nothing in \n     this section regarding compliance plans or in title V shall \n     be construed as affecting allowances.\n       (1) submission of a statement by the owner or operator, or \n     the designated representative of the owners and operators, of \n     a unit subject to the emissions limitation requirements of \n     sections 412(c), 413, 414, and 441, that the unit will meet \n     the applicable emissions limitation requirements of such \n     sections in a timely manner or that, in the case of the \n     emissions limitation requirements of sections 412(c), 413, \n     and 414, the owners and operators will hold sulfur dioxide \n     allowances in the amount required by section 412(c), shall be \n     deemed to meet the proposed and approved compliance planning \n     requirements of this section and title V, except that, for \n     any unit that will meet the requirements of this title by \n     means of an alternative method of compliance authorized under \n     section 413 (b), (c), (d), or (f), section 416, and section \n     441 (d) or (e), the proposed and approved compliance plan, \n     permit application and permit shall include, pursuant to \n     regulations promulgated by the Administrator, for each \n     alternative method of compliance a comprehensive description \n     of the schedule and means by which the unit will rely on one \n     or more alternative methods of compliance in the manner and \n     time authorized under subpart 1 of part B or subpart 1 of \n     part C.\n       (2) Submission of a statement by the owner or operator, or \n     the designated representative, of a facility that includes a \n     unit subject to the emissions limitation requirements of \n     sections 422, 432, 452, and 472 that the owner or operator \n     will hold sulfur dioxide allowances, nitrogen oxide \n     allowances, and mercury allowances, as the case may be, in \n     the amount required by such sections shall be deemed to meet \n     the proposed and approved compliance planning requirements of \n     this section and title V with regard to subparts A through D.\n       (3) Recordation by the Administrator of transfers of \n     allowances shall amend automatically all applicable proposed \n     or approved permit applications, compliance plans and \n     permits.\n       (c) Permits.--The owner or operator of each facility under \n     this title that includes an affected unit subject to title V \n     shall submit a permit application and compliance plan with \n     regard to the applicable requirements under sections 412(c), \n     422, 432, 441, 452, and 472 for sulfur dioxide emissions, \n     nitrogen oxide emissions, and mercury emissions from such \n     unit to the permitting authority in accordance with the \n     deadline for submission of permit applications and compliance \n     plans under title V. The permitting authority shall issue a \n     permit to such owner or operator, or the designated \n     representative of such owner or operator, that satisfies the \n     requirements of title V and this title.\n       (d) Amendment of Application and Compliance Plan.--At any \n     time after the submission of an application and compliance \n     plan under this section, the applicant may submit a revised \n     application and compliance plan, in accordance with the \n     requirements of this section.\n       (e) Prohibition.--It shall be unlawful for an owner or \n     operator, or designated representative, required to submit a \n     permit application or compliance plan under this title to \n     fail to submit such application or plan in accordance with \n     the deadlines specified in this section or to otherwise fail \n     to comply with regulations implementing this section.\n       (2) It shall be unlawful for any person to operate any \n     facility subject to this title except in compliance with the \n     terms and requirements of a permit application and compliance \n     plan (including amendments thereto) or permit issued by the \n     Administrator or a State with an approved permit program. For \n     purposes of this subsection, compliance, as provided in \n     section 504(f), with a permit issued under title V which \n     complies with this title for facilities subject to this title \n     shall be deemed compliance with this subsection as well as \n     section 502(a).\n       (3) In order to ensure reliability of electric power, \n     nothing in this title or title V shall be construed as \n     requiring termination of operations of a unit serving a \n     generator for failure to have an approved permit or \n     compliance plan under this section, except that any such unit \n     may be subject to the applicable enforcement provisions of \n     section 113.\n       (f) Certificate of Representation.--No permit shall be \n     issued under this section to an affected unit or facility \n     until the designated representative of the owners or \n     operators has filed a certificate of representation with \n     regard to matters under this title, including the holding and \n     distribution of allowances and the proceeds of transactions \n     involving allowances.\n\n     SEC. 405. MONITORING, REPORTING, AND RECORDKEEPING \n                   REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Applicability.--(1)(A) The owner and operator of any \n     facility subject to this title shall be required to install \n     and operate CEMS on each affected unit subject to subpart 1 \n     of part B or subpart 1 of part C at the facility, and to \n     quality assure the data, for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen \n     oxides, opacity, and volumetric flow at each such unit.\n       (B) The Administrator shall, by regulations, specify the \n     requirements for CEMS under subparagraph (A), for any \n     alternative monitoring system that is demonstrated as \n     providing information with the same precision, reliability, \n     accessibility, and timelines as that provided by CEMS, and \n     for recordkeeping and reporting of information from such \n     systems. Such regulations may include limitations on the use \n     of alternative compliance methods by units equipped with an \n     alternative monitoring system as may be necessary to preserve \n     the orderly functioning of the allowance system, and which \n     will ensure the emissions reductions contemplated by this \n     title. Where 2 or more units utilize a single stack, a \n     separate CEMS shall not be required for each unit, and for \n     such units the regulations shall require that the owner or \n     operator collect sufficient information to permit reliable \n     compliance determinations for each such unit.\n       (2)(A) The owner and operator of any facility subject to \n     this title shall be required to\n\n[[Page S7477]]\n\n     install and operate CEMS to monitor the emissions from each \n     affected unit at the facility, and to quality assure the data \n     for--\n       (i) sulfur doxide, opacity, and volumetric flow for all \n     affected units subject to subpart 2 of part B at the \n     facility,\n       (ii) nitrogen oxides for all affected units subject to \n     subpart 2 of part C at the facility, and\n       (iii) mercury for all affected units subject to part D at \n     the facility.\n       (B)(i) The Administrator shall, by regulations, specify the \n     requirements for CEMS under subparagraph (A), for any \n     alternative monitoring system that is demonstrated as \n     providing information with the same precision, reliability, \n     accessibility, and timeliness as that provided by CEMS, for \n     recordkeeping and reporting of information from such systems, \n     and if necessary under section 474, for monitoring, \n     recordkeeping, and reporting of the mercury content of fuel.\n       (ii) Notwithstanding the requirements of clause (i), the \n     regulations under clause (i) may specify an alternative \n     monitoring system for determining mercury emissions to the \n     extent that the Administrator determines that CEMS for \n     mercury with appropriate vendor guarantees are not \n     commercially available.\n       (iii) The regulations under clause (i) may include \n     limitation on the use of alternative compliance methods by \n     units equipped with an alternative monitoring system as may \n     be necessary to preserve the orderly functioning of the \n     allowance system, and which will ensure the emissions \n     reductions contemplated by this title.\n       (iv) Except as provided in clausse (v), the regulations \n     under clause (i) shall not require a separate CEMS for each \n     unit where two or more units utilize a single stack and shall \n     require that the owner or operator collect sufficient \n     information to permit reliable compliance determinations for \n     such units.\n       (v) The regulations under clause (i) may require a separate \n     CEMS for each unit where two or more units utilize a single \n     stack and another provision of the Act requires data under \n     subparagraph (A) for an individual unit.\n       (b) Deadlines.--(1). Upon commencement of commercial \n     operation of each new utility unit under subpart I of part B, \n     the unit shall comply with the requirements of subsection \n     (a)(1).\n       (2) By the later of January 1, 2009 or the date on which \n     the unit commences operation, the owner or operator of each \n     affected unit under subpart 2 of part B shall install and \n     operate CEMS, quality assure the data, and keep records \n     and reports in accordance with the regulations issued \n     under paragraph (a)(2) with regard to sulfur dioxide, \n     opacity, and volumetric flow.\n       (3) By the later of January 1 of the year before the first \n     covered year or the date on which the unit commences \n     operation, the owner or operator of each affected unit under \n     subpart 3 of part B shall install and operate CEMS, quality \n     assure the data, and keep records and reports in accordance \n     with the regulations issued under paragraph (a)(2) with \n     regard to sulfur dioxide and volumetric flow.\n       (4) By the later of January 1, 2007 or the date on which \n     the unit commences operation, the owner or operator of each \n     affected unit under subpart 2 of part C shall install and \n     operate CEMS, quality assure the data, and keep records and \n     reports in accordance with the regulations issued under \n     paragraph (a)(2) with regard to nitrogen oxides, and\n       (5) By the later of January 1, 2009 or the date on which \n     the unit commences operation, the owner or operator of each \n     affected unit under part D shall install and operate CEMS, \n     quality assure the data, and keep records and reports in \n     accordance with the regulations issued under paragraph (a)(2) \n     with regard to mercury.\n       (c) Unavailability of Emissions Data.--If CEMS data or data \n     from an alternative monitoring system approved by the \n     Administrator under subsection (a) is not available for any \n     affected unit during any period of a calendar year in which \n     such data is required under this title, and the owner or \n     operator cannot provide information, satisfactory to the \n     Administrator, on emissions during that period, the \n     Administrator shall deem the unit to be operating in an \n     uncontrolled manner during the entire period for which the \n     data was not available and shall, by regulation, prescribe \n     means to calculate emissions for that period. The owner or \n     operator shall be liable for excess emissions fees and \n     offsets under section 406 in accordance with such \n     regulations. Any fee due and payable under this subsection \n     shall not diminish the liability of the unit's owner or \n     operator for any fine, penalty, fee or assessment against the \n     unit for the same violation under any other section of this \n     Act.\n       (d) With regard to sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, \n     opacity, and volumetric flow, the Administrator shall \n     implement subsections (a) and (c) under 40 CFR part 75 \n     (2001), amended as appropriate by the Administrator. With \n     regard to mercury, the Administrator shall implement \n     subsections (a) and (c) by issuing regulations not later than \n     January 1, 2008.\n       (e) Prohibition.--It shall be unlawful for the owner or \n     operator of any facility subject to this title to operate a \n     facility without complying with the requirements of this \n     section, and any regulations implementing this section.\n\n     SEC. 406. EXCESS EMISSIONS PENALTY; GENERAL COMPLIANCE WITH \n                   OTHER PROVISIONS; ENFORCEMENT\n\n       (a) Excess Emissions Penalty.--(1) The owner or operator of \n     any unit subject to the requirements of section 441 that \n     emits nitrogen oxides for any calendar year in excess of the \n     unit's emissions limitation requirement shall be liable for \n     the payment of an excess emissions penalty, except where such \n     emission were authorized pursuant to section 110(f). That \n     penalty shall be calculated on the basis of the number of \n     tons emitted in excess of the unit's emissions limitation \n     requirement multiplied by $2,000.\n       (2) The owner or operator of any unit subject to the \n     requirements of section 412(c) that emits sulfur dioxide for \n     any calendar year before 2008 in excess of the sulfur dioxide \n     allowances the owner or operator holds for use for the unit \n     for that calendar year shall be liable for the payment of \n     an excess emissions penalty, except where such emissions \n     were authorized pursuant to section 110(f). That penalty \n     shall be calculated as follows:\n       (A) the product of the unit's excess emissions (in tons) \n     multiplied by the clearing price of sulfur dioxide allowances \n     sold at the most recent auction under section 417, if within \n     thirty days after the date on which the owner or operator was \n     required to hold sulfur dioxide allowances--\n       (i) the owner or operator offsets the excess emissions in \n     accordance with paragraph (b)(1); and\n       (ii) the Administrator receives the penalty required under \n     this subparagraph.\n       (B) if the requirements of clause (A)(i) or (A)(ii) are not \n     met, three hundred percent of the product of the unit's \n     excess emissions (in tons) multiplied by the clearing price \n     of sulfur dioxide allowances sold at the most recent auction \n     under section 417.\n       (3) If the units at a facility that are subject to the \n     requirements of section 412(c) emit sulfur dioxide for any \n     calendar year after 2007 in excess of the sulfur dioxide \n     allowances that the owner or operator of the facility holds \n     for use for the facility for that calendar year, the owner or \n     operator shall be liable for the payment of an excess \n     emissions penalty, except where such emissions were \n     authorized pursuant to section 110(f). That penalty shall be \n     calculated under paragraph (4)(A) or (4)(B).\n       (4) If the units at a facility that are subject to the \n     requirements of section 422, 432, 452, or 472 emit sulfur \n     dioxide, nitrogen oxides, or mercury for any calendar year in \n     excess of the sulfur dioxide allowances, nitrogen oxides \n     allowances, or mercury allowances, as the case may be, that \n     the owner or operator of the facility holds for use for the \n     facility for that calendar year, the owner or operator shall \n     be liable for the payment of an excess emissions penalty, \n     except where such emissions were authorized pursuant to \n     section 110(f). That penalty shall be calculated as follows:\n       (A) the product of the units' excess emissions (in tons or, \n     for mercury emissions, in ounces) multiplied by the clearing \n     price of sulfur dioxide allowances, nitrogen oxides \n     allowances, or mercury allowances, as the case may be, sold \n     at the most recent auction under section 423, 453, or 473, if \n     within thirty days after the date on which the owner or \n     operator was required to hold sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides \n     allowance, or mercury allowances as the case may be--\n       (i) the owner or operator offsets the excess emissions in \n     accordance with paragraph (b)(1); and\n       (ii) the Administrator receives the penalty required under \n     this subparagraph.\n       (B) if the requirements of clause (A)(i) or (A)(ii) are not \n     met, three hundred percent of the product of the units' \n     excess emissions (in tons or, for mercury emissions, in \n     ounces) multiplied by the clearing price of sulfur dioxide \n     allowances, nitrogen oxides allowances, or mercury \n     allowances, as the case may be, sold at the most recent \n     auction under section 423, 453, or 473.\n       (5) Any penalty under paragraph 1, 2, 3, or 4 shall be due \n     and payable without demand to the Administrator as provided \n     in regulations issued by the Administrator. With regard to \n     the penalty under paragraph 1, the Administrator shall \n     implement this paragraph under 40 CFR 77 (2001), amended as \n     appropriate by the administrator. With regard to the penalty \n     under paragraphs 2, 3, and 4, the Administrator shall \n     implement this paragraph by issuing regulations no later \n     than twenty-four months after the date of enactment of the \n     Clear Skies Act of 2002. Any such payment shall be \n     deposited in the United States Treasury. Any penalty due \n     and payable under this section shall not diminish the \n     liability of the unit's owner or operator for any fine, \n     penalty or assessment against the unit for the same \n     violation under any other section of this Act.\n       (b) Excess Emissions Offset.--(1) The owner or operator of \n     any unit subject to the requirements of section 412(c) that \n     emits sulfur dioxide during any calendar year before 2008 in \n     excess of the sulfur dioxide allowances held for the unit for \n     the calendar year shall be liable to offset the excess \n     emissions by an equal tonnage amount in the following \n     calendar year, or such longer period as the Administrator may \n     prescribe. The Administrator shall deduct sulfur dioxide \n     allowances equal to the excess tonnage from those held for \n     the facility for the calendar year, or succeeding years \n     during which offsets are required, following the year in \n     which the excess emissions occurred.\n       (2) If the units at a facility that are subject to the \n     requirements of section 412(c) emit sulfur dioxide for a year \n     after 2007 in excess of the sulfur dioxide allowances that \n     the owner or operator of the facility holds for\n\n[[Page S7478]]\n\n     use for the facility for that calendar year, the owner or \n     operator shall be liable to offset the excess emissions by an \n     equal amount of tons in the following calendar year, or such \n     longer period as the Administrator may prescribe. The \n     Administrator shall deduct sulfur dioxide allowances equal to \n     the excess emissions in tons from those held for the facility \n     for the year, or succeeding years during which offsets are \n     required, following the year in which the excess emissions \n     occurred.\n       (3) If the units at a facility that are subject to the \n     requirements of section 422, 432, 452, or 472 emit sulfur \n     dioxide, nitrogen oxides, or mercury for any calendar year in \n     excess of the sulfur dioxide allowances, nitrogen oxides \n     allowances, or mercury allowances, as the case may be, that \n     the owner or operator of the facility holds for use for the \n     facility for that calendar year, the owner or operator shall \n     be liable to offset the excess emissions by an equal amount \n     of tons or, for mercury, ounces in the following calendar \n     year, or such longer period as the Administrator may \n     prescribe. The Administrator shall deduct sulfur dioxide \n     allowances, nitrogen oxide allowances, or mercury allowances, \n     as the case may be, equal to the excess emissions in tons or, \n     for mercury, ounces from those held for the facility for the \n     year, or succeeding years during which offsets are required, \n     following the year in which the excess emissions occurred.\n       (c) Penalty Adjustment.--The Administrator shall, by \n     regulation, adjust the penalty specified in subsection (a)(1) \n     for inflation, based on the Consumer Price Index, on November \n     15, 1990 and annually thereafter.\n       (d) Prohibition.--It shall be unlawful for the owner or \n     operator of any unit or facility liable for a penalty and \n     offset under this section to fail--\n       (1) to pay the penalty under subsection (a) or\n       (2) to offset excess emissions as required by subsection \n     (b).\n       (e) Savings Provision.--Nothing in this title shall limit \n     or otherwise affect the application of section 113, 114, 120, \n     or 304 except as otherwise explicitly provided in this title.\n       (f) Except as expressly provided, compliance with the \n     requirements of this title shall not exempt or exclude the \n     owner or operator of any facility subject to this title from \n     compliance with any other applicable requirements of this \n     Act. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Act, no State \n     or political subdivision thereof shall restrict or interfere \n     with the transfer, sale, or purchase of allowances under this \n     title.\n       (g) Violation by any person subject to this title of any \n     prohibition of, requirement of, or regulation promulgated \n     pursuant to this title shall be a violation of this Act.

DEFINITIONS.\n\n       For purposes of this subpart--\n       (1) the term ``actual 1985 emission rate'', for electric \n     utility units means the annual sulfur dioxide or nitrogen \n     oxides emission rate in pounds per million Btu as reported in \n     the NAPAP Emissions Inventory, Version, 2 National Utility \n     reference File. For nonutility units, the term ``actual 1985 \n     emission rate'' means the annual sulfur dioxide or nitrogen \n     oxides emission rate in pounds per million Btu as reported in \n     the NAPAP Emission Inventory, Version 2.\n       (2) The term ``allowable 1985 emissions rate'' means a \n     federally enforceable emissions limitation for sulfur dioxide \n     or oxides of nitrogen, applicable to the unit in 1985 or the \n     limitation applicable in such other subsequent year as \n     determined by the Administrator if such a limitation for 1985 \n     does not exist. Where the emissions limitation for a unit is \n     not expressed in pounds of emissions per million Btu, or the \n     averaging period of that emissions limitation is not \n     expressed on an annual basis, the Administrator shall \n     calculate the annual equivalent of that emissions\n       (3) The term ``alternative method of compliance'' means a \n     method of compliance in accordance with one or more of the \n     following authorities:\n       (A) a substitution plan submitted and approved in \n     accordance with subsections 413(b) and (c); or\n       (B) a Phase I extension plan approved by the Administrator \n     under section 413(d), using qualifying phase I technology as \n     determined by the Administrator in accordance with that \n     section.\n       (4) The term ``baseline'' means the annual quantity of \n     fossil fuel consumed by an affected unit, measured in \n     millions of British Thermal Units (``mmBtu's''), calculated \n     as follows:\n       (A) For each utility unit that was in commercial operation \n     prior to January 1, 1985, the baseline shall be the annual \n     average quantity of mmBtu's consumed in fuel during calendar \n     years 1985, 1986, and 1987, as recorded by the Department of \n     Energy pursuant to Form 767. For any utility unit for which \n     such form was not filed, the baseline shall be the level \n     specified for such unit in the 1985 National Acid \n     Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP) Emissions Inventory, \n     Version 2, National Utility Reference File (NURF) or in a \n     corrected data base as established by the Administrator \n     pursuant to paragraph (3). For non-utility units, the \n     baseline in the NAPAP Emissions Inventory, Version 2. The \n     Administrator, in the Administrator's sole discretion, may \n     exclude periods during which a unit is shutdown for a \n     continuous period of four calendar months or longer, and make \n     appropriate adjustments under this paragraph. Upon petition \n     of the owner or operator of any unit, the Administrator may \n     make appropriate baseline adjustments for accidents that \n     caused prolonged outages.\n       (B) For any other nonutility unit that is not included in \n     the NAPAP Emissions Inventory, Version 2, or a corrected data \n     base as established by the Administrator pursuant to \n     paragraph (3), the baseline shall be the annual average \n     quantity, in mmBtu consumed in fuel by that unit, as \n     calculated pursuant to a method which the Administrator shall \n     prescribe by regulation to be promulgated not later than \n     eighteen months after November 15, 1990.\n       (C) The Administrator shall, upon application or on his own \n     motion, by December 31, 1991, supplement data needed in \n     support of this subpart and correct any factual errors in \n     data from which affected Phase II units' baselines or actual \n     1985 emission rates have been calculated. Corrected data \n     shall be used for purposes of issuing allowances under this \n     subpart. Such corrections shall not be subject to judicial \n     review, nor shall the failure of the Administrator to correct \n     an alleged factual error in such reports be subject to \n     judicial review.\n       (5) The term ``basic Phase II allowance allocations'' \n     means:\n       (A) For calendar years 2000 through 2009 inclusive, \n     allocations of allowances made by the Administrator pursuant \n     to section 412 and subsections (b)(1), (3), and (4); (c)(1), \n     (2), (3), and (5); (d)(1), (2), (4), and (5); (e); (f); (g) \n     (1), (2), (3), (4), and (5); (h)(1); (i) and (j) of section \n     414.\n       (B) For each calendar year beginning in 2010, allocations \n     of allowances made by the Administrator pursuant to section \n     412 and subsections (b)(1), (3), and (4); (c)(1), (2), (3), \n     and (5); (d)(1), (2), (4) and (5); (e); (f); (g)(1), (2), \n     (3), (4), and (5); (h)(1) and (3); (i) and (j) of section \n     414.\n       (6) The term ``capacity factor'' means the ratio between \n     the actual electric output from a unit and the potential \n     electric output from that unit.\n       (7) The term ``commenced'' as applied to construction of \n     any new electric utility unit means that an owner or operator \n     has undertaken a continuous program of construction or that \n     an owner or operator has entered into a contractual \n     obligation to undertake and complete, within a reasonable \n     time, a continuous program of construction.\n       (8) The term ``commenced commercial operation'' means to \n     have begun to generate electricity for sale.\n       (9) The term ``construction'' means fabrication, erection, \n     or installation of an affected unit.\n       (10) The term ``existing unit'' means a unit (including \n     units subject to section 111) that commenced commercial \n     operation before November 15, 1990.

ALLOWANCE ALLOCATION.\n\n       (a)(1) Except as provided in sections 414(a)(2), 415(a)(3), \n     and 416, beginning January 1, 2000, the Administrator shall \n     not allocate annual missions of sulfur dioxide from utility \n     units in excess of 8.90 million tons except that the \n     Administrator shall not to take into account unused \n     allowances carried forward by owners and operators of \n     affected units or by other persons holding such allowances, \n     following the year for which they were allocated. If \n     necessary to meeting he restrictions imposed in the preceding \n     sentence, he Administrator shall reduce, pro rata, the basic \n     Phase II allowance allocations for each unit subject tot he \n     requirements of section 414. Subject to the provisions of \n     section 417, the Administrator shall allocate allowances for \n     each affected until at an affected source annually, as \n     provided in paragraphs (2) and(3) and section 404. Except as \n     provided in sections 416, the removal of an existing affected \n     unit or source from commercial operation at any time after \n     November 15, 1990 (whether before or after January 1, 1995, \n     or January 1, 2000) shall not terminate or otherwise affect \n     the allocation of allowances pursuant to section 413 or 414 \n     to which the unit is entitled. Prior to June 1, 1998, the \n     Administrator shall publish a revised final statement of \n     allowance allocations, subject to the provisions of section \n     414(a)(2).\n       (b) New Utility Units.--(1) After January 1, 2000 and \n     through December 31, 2007, it shall be unlawful for a new \n     utility unit to emit an annual tonnage of sulfur dioxide in \n     excess of the number of allowances to emit held for the unit \n     by the unit's owner or operator.\n       (2) Starting January 1, 2008, a new utility unit shall be \n     subject to the prohibition in subsection (c)(3).\n       (3) New utility units shall not be eligible for an \n     allocation of sulfur dioxide allowances under subsection \n     (a)(1), unless the unit is subject to the provisions of \n     subsection (g)(2) or (3) of section 414. New utility units \n     may obtain allowances from any person, in accordance with \n     this title. The owner or operator of any new utility unit in \n     violation of subsection (b)(1) or subsection(c)(3) shall be \n     liable for fulfilling the obligations specified in section \n     406.\n       (c) Prohibitions.--(1) It shall be unlawful for any person \n     to hold, use, or transfer any allowance allocated under this \n     subpart, except in accordance with regulations promulgated by \n     the Administrator.\n       (2) For any year 1995 through 2007, it shall be unlawful \n     for any affected unit to emit sulfur dioxide in excess of the \n     number of allowances held for that unit for that year by the \n     owner or operator of the unit.\n       (3) Starting January 1, 2008, it shall be unlawful for the \n     affected units at a source to emit a total amount of sulfur \n     dioxide during the year in excess of the number of allowances \n     held for the source for that year by the owner or operator of \n     the source.\n       (4) Upon the allocation of allowances under this subpart, \n     the prohibition in paragraphs (2) and (3) shall supersede any \n     other emission limitation applicable under this subpart to \n     the units for which such allowances are allocated.\n       (d) In order to insure electric reliability, regulations \n     establishing a system for issuing, recording, and tracking \n     allowances under section 403(b) and this subpart shall not \n     prohibit or affect temporary increases and decreases in \n     emissions within utility systems, power pools, or utilities \n     entering into allowance pool agreements, that result from \n     their operations, including emergencies and central dispatch, \n     and such temporary emissions increases and decreases shall \n     not require transfer of allowances among units nor shall it \n     require recordation. The owners or operators of such units \n     shall act through a designated representative. \n     Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the total tonnage of \n     emissions in any calendar year (calculated at the end \n     thereof) from all units in such a utility system, power pool, \n     or allowance pool agreements shall not exceed the total \n     allowances for such units for the calendar year concerned, \n     including for calendar years after 2007, allowances held for \n     such units by the owner or operator of the sources where the \n     units are located.\n       (e) Where there are multiple holders of a legal or \n     equitable title to, or a leasehold interest in, an affected \n     unit, or where a utility or industrial customer purchases \n     power from an affected unit (or units) under life-of-the-\n     unit, firm power contractual arrangements, the certificate of \n     representation required under section 404(f) shall state (1) \n     that allowances under this subpart and the proceeds of \n     transactions involving such allowances will be deemed to be \n     held or distributed in proportion to each holder's legal, \n     equitable, leasehold, or contractual reservation or \n     entitlement, or (2) if such multiple holders have expressly \n     provided for a different distribution of allowances by \n     contract, that allowances under this subpart and the proceeds \n     of transactions involving such allowances will be deemed to \n     be held or distributed in accordance with the contract. A \n     passive lessor, or a person who has an equitable interest \n     through such lessor, whose rental payments are not based, \n     either directly or indirectly, upon the revenues or income \n     from the affected unit shall not be deemed to be a holder of \n     a legal, equitable, leasehold, or contractual interest for \n     the purpose of holding or distributing allowances as provided \n     in this subsection, during either the term of such leasehold \n     or thereafter, unless expressly provided for in the leasehold \n     agreement. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, \n     where all legal or equitable title to or interest in an \n     affected unit is held by a single person, the certification \n     shall state that all allowances under this subpart received \n     by the unit are deemed to be held for that person.\n\n     SEC. 413. PHASE I SULFUR DIOXIDE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Emission Limitations.--(1) After January 1, 1995, each \n     source that includes one or more affected units listed in \n     table A is an affected source under this section. After \n     January 1, 1995, it shall be unlawful for any affected unit \n     (other than an eligible phase I unit under section 413(d)(2)) \n     to emit sulfur dioxide in excess of the tonnage limitation \n     stated as a total number of allowances in table A for phase \n     I, unless (A) the emissions reduction requirements applicable \n     to such unit have been achieved pursuant to subsection (b) \n     or (d), or (B) the owner or operator of such unit holds \n     allowances to emit not less than the unit's total annual \n     emissions, except that, after January 1, 2000, the \n     emissions limitations established in this section shall be \n     superseded by those established in section 414. The owner \n     or operator of any unit in violation of this section be \n     fully liable for such violation including, but not limited \n     to, liability for fulfilling the obligations specified in \n     section 406.\n       (2) Not later than December 31, 1991, the Administrator \n     shall determine the total tonnage of reductions in the \n     emissions of sulfur dioxide from all utility units in \n     calendar\n\n[[Page S7482]]\n\n     year 1995 that will occur as a result of compliance with the \n     emissions limitation requirements of this section, and shall \n     establish a reserve of allowances equal in amount to the \n     number of tons determined thereby not to exceed a total of \n     3.50 million tons. In making such a determination, the \n     Administrator shall compute for each unit subject to the \n     emissions limitation requirements of this section the \n     difference between:\n       (A) the product of its baseline multiplied by the lesser of \n     each unit's allowable 1985 emissions rate and its actual 1985 \n     emissions rate, divided by 2,000, and\n       (B) the product of each unit's baseline multiplied by 2.50 \n     lbs/mmBtu divided by 2,000, and sum the computations. The \n     Administrator shall adjust the foregoing calculation to \n     reflect projected calendar year 1995 utilization of the units \n     subject to the emissions limitations of this subpart that the \n     Administrator finds would have occurred in the absence of the \n     imposition of such requirements. Pursuant to subsection (d), \n     the Administrator shall allocate allowances from the reserve \n     established hereinunder until the earlier of such time as all \n     such allowances in the reserve are allocated or December 31, \n     1999.\n       (3) In addition to allowances allocated pursuant to \n     paragraph (1), in each calendar year beginning in 1995 and \n     ending in 1999, inclusive, the Administrator shall allocate \n     for each unit on Table A that is located in the States of \n     Illinois, Indiana, or Ohio (other than units at Kyger Creek, \n     Clifty Creek and Joppa Steam), allowances in an amount equal \n     to 200,000 multiplied by the unit's pro rata share of the \n     total number of allowances allocated for all units on Table A \n     in the 3 States (other than units at Kyger Creek, Clifty \n     Creek, and Joppa Steam) pursuant to paragraph (1). Such \n     allowances shall be excluded from the calculation of the \n     reserve under paragraph (2).\n       (b) Substitutions.--The owner or operator of an affected \n     unit under subsection (a) may include in its section 404 \n     permit application and proposed compliance plan a proposal to \n     reassign, in whole or in part, the affected unit's sulfur \n     dioxide reduction requirements to any other unit(s) under the \n     control of such owner or operator. Such proposal shall \n     specify--\n       (1) the designation of the substitute unit or units to \n     which any part of the reduction obligations of subsection (a) \n     shall be required, in addition to, or in lieu of, any \n     original affected units designated under such subsection;\n       (2) the original affected unit's baseline, the actual and \n     allowable 1985 emissions rate for sulfur dioxide, and the \n     authorized annual allowance allocation stated in table A;\n       (3) calculation of the annual average tonnage for calendar \n     years 1985, 1986, and 1987, emitted by the substitute unit or \n     units, based on the baseline for each unit, as defined in \n     section 411(4), multiplied by the lesser of the unit's actual \n     or allowable 1985 emissions rate;\n       (4) the emissions rates and tonnage limitations that would \n     be applicable to the original and substitute affected units \n     under the substitution proposal;\n       (5) documentation, to the satisfaction of the \n     Administrator, that the reassigned tonnage limits will, in \n     total, achieve the same or greater emissions reduction than \n     would have been achieved by the original affected unit and \n     the substitute unit or units without such substitution; and\n       (6) such other information as the Administrator may \n     require.\n       (c) Administrator's Action on Substitution Proposals.--(1) \n     The Administrator shall take final action on such \n     substitution proposal in accordance with section 404(c) if \n     the substitution proposal fulfills the requirements of this \n     subsection. The Administrator may approve a substitution \n     proposal in whole or in part and with such modifications or \n     conditions as may be consistent with the orderly functioning \n     of the allowance system and which will ensure the emissions \n     reductions contemplated by this title. If a proposal does not \n     meet the requirements of subsection (b), the Administrator \n     shall disapprove it. The owner or operator of a unit listed \n     in table A shall not substitute another unit or units without \n     the prior approval of the Administrator.\n       (2) Upon approval of a substitution proposal, each \n     substitute unit, and each source with such unit, shall be \n     deemed affected under this title, and the Administrator shall \n     issue a permit to the original and substitute affected source \n     and unit in accordance with the approved substitution plan \n     and section 404. The Administrator shall allocate allowances \n     for the original and substitute affected units in accordance \n     with the approved substitution proposal pursuant to section \n     412. It shall be unlawful for any source or unit that is \n     allocated allowances pursuant to this section to emit sulfur \n     dioxide in excess of the emissions limitation provided for in \n     the approved substitution permit and plan unless the owner or \n     operator of each unit governed by the permit and approved \n     substitution plan holds allowances to emit not less than the \n     unit's total annual emissions. The owner or operator of any \n     original or substitute affected unit operated in violation of \n     this subsection shall be fully liable for such violation, \n     including liability for fulfilling the obligations specified \n     in section 406. If a substitution proposal is disapproved, \n     the Administrator shall allocate allowances to the original \n     affected unit or units in accordance with subsection (a).\n       (d) Eligible Phase I Extension Units.--(1) The owner or \n     operator of any affected unit subject to an emissions \n     limitation requirement under this section may petition the \n     Administrator in its permit application under section 404 for \n     an extension of 2 years of the deadline for meeting such \n     requirement, provided that the owner or operator of any such \n     unit holds allowances to emit not less than the unit's total \n     annual emissions for each of the 2 years of the period of \n     extension. To qualify for such an extension, the affected \n     unit must either employ a qualifying phase I technology, or \n     transfer its phase I emissions reduction obligation to a unit \n     employing a qualifying phase I technology. Such transfer \n     shall be accomplished in accordance with a compliance plan, \n     submitted and approved under section 404, that shall govern \n     operations at all units included in the transfer, and that \n     specifies the emissions reduction requirements imposed \n     pursuant to this title.\n       (2) Such extension proposal shall--\n       (A) specify the unit or units proposed for designation as \n     an eligible phase I extension unit;\n       (B) provide a copy of an executed contract, which may be \n     contingent upon the Administrator approving the proposal, for \n     the design engineering, and construction of the qualifying \n     phase I technology for the extension unit, or for the unit or \n     units to which the extension unit's emission reduction \n     obligation is to be transferred;\n       (C) specify the unit's or units' baseline, actual 1985 \n     emissions rate, allowable 1985 emissions rate, and projected \n     utilization for calendar years 1995 through 1999;\n       (D) require CEMS on both the eligible phase I extension \n     unit or units and the transfer unit or units beginning no \n     later than January 1, 1995; and\n       (E) specify the emission limitation and number of \n     allowances expected to be necessary for annual operation \n     after the qualifying phase I technology has been installed.\n       (3) The Administrator shall review and take final action on \n     each extension proposal in order of receipt, consistent with \n     section 404, and for an approved proposal shall designate the \n     unit or units as an eligible phase I extension unit. The \n     Administrator may approve an extension proposal in whole or \n     in part, and with such modifications or conditions as may be \n     necessary, consistent with the orderly functioning of the \n     allowance system, and to ensure the emissions reductions \n     contemplated by the subpart.\n       (4) In order to determine the number of proposals eligible \n     for allocations from the reserve under subsection (a)(2) and \n     the number of the allowances remaining available after each \n     proposal is acted upon, the Administrator shall reduce the \n     total number of allowances remaining available in the reserve \n     by the number of allowances calculated according to \n     subparagraph (A), (B) and (C) until either no allowances \n     remain available in the reserve for further allocation or all \n     approved proposals have been acted upon. If no allowances \n     remain available in the reserve for further allocation before \n     all proposals have been acted upon by the Administrator, any \n     pending proposals shall be disapproved. The Administrator \n     shall calculate allowances equal to.\n       (A) the difference between the lesser of the average annual \n     emissions in calendar years 1988 and 1989 or the projected \n     emissions tonnage for calendar year 1995 of each eligible \n     phase I extension unit, as designated under paragraph (3), \n     and the product of the unit's baseline miltipled by an \n     emission rate of 2.50 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000;\n       (B) the difference between the lesser of the average annual \n     emissions in calendar years 1988 and 1989 or the projected \n     emissions tonnage for calendar year 1996 of each eligible \n     phase I extension unit, as designated under paragraph (3), \n     and the product of the unit's baseline multiplied by an \n     emission rate of 2.50 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000; and\n       (C) the amount by which (i) the product of each unit's \n     baseline multiplied by an emission rate of 1.20 lbs/mmBtu, \n     divided by 2,000, exceeds (ii) the tonnage level specified \n     under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (2) of this subsection \n     multiplied by a factor of 3.\n       (5) Each eligible Phase I extension unit shall receive \n     allowances determined under subsection (a)(1) or (c) of this \n     section. In addition, for calendar year 1995, the \n     Administrator shall allocate to each eligible Phase I \n     extension unit, from the allowance reserve created pursuant \n     to subsection (a)(2), allowances equal to the difference \n     between the lesser of the average annual emissions in \n     calendar years 1988 and 1989 or its projected emission \n     tonnage for calendar year 1995 and the product of the unit's \n     baseline multiplied by an emission rate of 2.50 lbs/mmBtu, \n     divided by 2,000. In calendar year 1996, the Administrator \n     shall allocate for each eligible unit, from the allowance \n     reserve created pursuant to subsection (a)(2), allowances \n     equal to the difference between the lesser of the average \n     annual emissions in calendar years 1988 and 1989 or its \n     projected emissions tonnage for calendar year 1996 and the \n     product of the unit's baseline multiplied by an emission \n     rate of 2.50 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000. It shall be \n     unlawful for any source or unit subject to an approved \n     extension plan under this subsection to emit sulfur \n     dioxide in excess of the emissions limitations provided \n     for in the permit and approved extension plan, unless the \n     owner or operator of each unit governed by the permit and \n     approved plan holds allowances to emit not less than the \n     unit's total annual emissions.\n       (6) In addition to allowances specified in paragraph (4), \n     the Administrator shall allocate for each eligible Phase I \n     extension unit\n\n[[Page S7483]]\n\n     employing qualifying Phase I technology, for calendar years \n     1997, 1998, and 1999, additional allowances, from any \n     remaining allowances in the reserve created pursuant to \n     subsection (a)(2), following the reduction in the reserve \n     provided for in paragraph (4), not to exceed the amount by \n     which (A) the product of each eligible unit's baseline times \n     an emission rate of 1.20 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000 exceeds \n     (B) the tonnage level specified under subparagraph (E) of \n     paragraph (2) of this subsection.\n       (7) After January 1, 1997, in addition to any liability \n     under this Act, including under section 406, if any eligible \n     phase I extension unit employing qualifying phase I \n     technology or any transfer unit under this subsection emits \n     sulfur dioxide in excess of the annual tonnage limitation \n     specified in the extension plan, as approved in paragraph (2) \n     of this subsection, the Administrator shall, in the calendar \n     year following such excess, deduct allowances equal to the \n     amount of such excess from such unit's annual allowance \n     allocation.\n       (e)(1) In the case of a unit that receives authorization \n     from the Governor of the State in which such unit is located \n     to make reductions in the emissions of sulfur dioxide prior \n     to calendar year 1995 and that is part of a utility system \n     that meets the following requirements:\n       (A) the total coal-fired generation within the utility \n     system as a percentage of total system generation decreased \n     by more than 20 percent between January 1, 1980, and December \n     31, 1985; and (B) the weighted capacity factor of all coal-\n     fired units within the utility system averaged over the \n     period from January 1, 1985, through December 31, 1987, was \n     below 50 percent, the Administrator shall allocate allowances \n     under this paragraph for the unit pursuant to this \n     subsection. The Administrator shall allocate allowances for a \n     unit that is an affected unit pursuant to section 414 (but is \n     not also an affected unit under this section) and part of a \n     utility system that includes 1 or more affected units under \n     section 414 for reductions in the emissions of sulfur dioxide \n     made during the period 1995-1999 if the unit meets the \n     requirements of this subsection and the requirements of the \n     preceding sentence, except that for the purposes of applying \n     this subsection to any such unit, the prior year concerned as \n     specified below, shall be any year after January 1, 1995 but \n     prior to January 1, 2000.\n       (2) In the case of an affected unit under this section \n     described in subparagraph (A), the allowances allocated under \n     this subsection for early reductions in any prior year may \n     not exceed the amount which (A) the product of the unit's \n     baseline multiplied by the unit's 1985 actual sulfur dioxide \n     emission rate (in lbs. per mmBtu), divided by 2,000 exceeds \n     (B) the allowances specified for such unit in Table A. In the \n     case of an affected unit under section 414 described in \n     subparagraph (A), the allowances awarded under this \n     subsection for early reductions in any prior year may not \n     exceed the amount by which (i) the product of the quality of \n     fossil fuel consumed by the unit (in mmBtu) in the prior year \n     multiplied by the lesser of 2.50 or the most stringent \n     emission rate (in lbs. per mmBtu) applicable to the unit \n     under the applicable implementation plan, divided by 2,000 \n     exceeds (ii) the unit's actual tonnage of sulfur dioxide \n     emission for the prior year concerned. Allowances \n     allocated under this subsection for units referred to in \n     subparagraph (A) may be allocated only for emission \n     reductions achieved as a result of physical changes or \n     changes in the method of operation made after November 15, \n     1990, including changes in the type or quality of fossil \n     fuel consumed.\n       (3) In no event shall the provisions of this paragraph be \n     interpreted as an event of force majeure or a commercial \n     impractibility or in any other way as a basis for excused \n     nonperformance by a utility system under a coal sales \n     contract in effect before November 15, 1990.\n\nTABLE A.--AFFECTED SOURCES AND UNITS IN PHASE I AND THEIR SULFUR DIOXIDE\n                            ALLOWANCES (TONS)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Phase I\n          State                  Plant name        Generator  allowances\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlabama.................

For electric utilities not subject to the \n     jurisdiction of a State regulatory authority such plan shall \n     be approved by the entity with rate-making authority for such \n     utility.\n       (iv) In the case of qualified energy conservation measures \n     undertaken by a State regulated electric utility, the \n     Secretary of Energy certifies that the State regulatory \n     authority with jurisdiction over the electric rates of such \n     electric utility has established rates and charges which \n     ensure that the net income of such electric utility after \n     implementation of specific cost effective energy conservation \n     measures is at least as high as such net income would have \n     been if the energy conservation measures had not been \n     implemented. Upon the date of any such certification by the \n     Secretary of Energy, all allowances which, but for this \n     paragraph, would have been allocated under subparagraph (B) \n     before such date, shall be allocated to the electric utility. \n     This clause is not a requirement for qualified renewable \n     energy.\n       (v) Such utility or any subsidiary of the utility's holding \n     company owns or operates at least one affected unit.\n       (C) Period of applicability.--Allowances under this \n     subsection shall be allocated only with respect to kilowatt \n     hours of electric energy saved by qualified energy \n     conservation measures or generated by qualified renewable \n     energy after January 1, 1992 and before the earlier of (i) \n     December 31, 2000, or (ii) the date on which any electric \n     utility steam generating unit owned or operated by the \n     electric utility to which the allowances are allocated \n     becomes subject to this subpart (including those sources that \n     elect to become affected by this title, pursuant to section \n     417).\n       (D) Determination of avoided emissions.--\n       (i) Application.--In order to receive allowances under this \n     subsection, an electric utility shall make an application \n     which--\n       (I) designates the qualified energy conservation measures \n     implemented and the qualified renewable energy sources used \n     for purposes of avoiding emissions,\n       (II) calculates, in accordance with subparagraphs (F) and \n     (G), the number of tons of emissions avoided by reason of the \n     implementation of such measures or the use of such renewable \n     energy sources; and\n       (III) demonstrates that the requirements of subparagraph \n     (B) have been met. Such application for allowances by a \n     State-regulated electric utility shall require approval by \n     the State regulatory authority with jurisdiction over such \n     electric utility. The authority shall review the application \n     for accuracy and compliance with this subsection and the \n     rules under this subsection. Electric utilities whose retail \n     rates are not subject to the jurisdiction of a State \n     regulatory authority shall apply directly to the \n     Administrator for such approval.\n       (E) Avoided emissions from qualified energy conservation \n     measures.--For the purposes of this subsection, the emission \n     tonnage deemed avoided by reason of the implementation of \n     qualified energy conservation measures for any calendar year \n     shall be a tonnage equal to the product of multiplying--\n       (i) the kilowatt hours that would otherwise have been \n     supplied by the utility during such year in the absence of \n     such qualified energy conservation measures, by\n       (ii) 0.004, and dividing by 2,000.\n       (F) Avoided emissions from the use of qualified renewable \n     energy.--The emissions tonnage deemed avoided by reason of \n     the use of qualified renewable energy by an electric utility \n     for any calendar year shall be a tonnage equal to the product \n     of multiplying--(i) the actual kilowatt hours generated by, \n     or purchased from, qualified renewable energy, by (ii) 0.004, \n     and dividing by 2,000.\n       (G) Prohibitions.--\n       (i) No allowances shall be allocated under this subsection \n     for the implementation of programs that are exclusively \n     informational or educational in nature.\n       (ii) No allowances shall be allocated for energy \n     conservation measures or renewable energy that were \n     operational before January 1, 1992.\n       (3) Savings provision.--Nothing in this subsection \n     precludes a State or State regulatory authority from \n     providing additional incentives to utilities to encourage \n     investment in demand-side resources.\n       (4) Regulations.--The Administrator shall implement this \n     subsection under 40 CFR part 73 (2001), amended as \n     appropriate by the Administrator. Such regulations shall list \n     energy conservation measures and renewable energy sources \n     which may be treated as qualified energy conservation \n     measures and qualified renewable energy for purposes of \n     this subsection. Allowances shall only be allocated if all \n     requirements of this subsection and the rules promulgated \n     to implement this subsection are complied with. The \n     Administrator shall review the determinations of each \n     State regulatory authority under this subsection to \n     encourage consistency from electric utility and from State \n     to State in accordance with the Administrator's rules. The \n     Administrator shall publish the findings of this review no \n     less than annually.\n       (g) Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve.--The \n     Administrator shall establish a Conservation and Renewable \n     Energy Reserve under this subsection. Beginning on January 1, \n     1995, the Administrator may allocate from the Conservation \n     and Renewable Energy Reserve an amount equal to a total of \n     300,000 allowances for emissions of sulfur dioxide pursuant \n     to section 411. In order to provide 300,000 allowances for \n     such reserve, in each year beginning in calendar year 2000 \n     and until calendar year 2009, inclusive, the Administrator \n     shall reduce each unit's basic Phase II allowance allocation \n     on the basis of its pro rata share of 30,000 allowances. \n     Nothwithstanding the prior sentence, if allowances remain in \n     the reserve one year after the date of enactment of the Clear \n     Skies Act of 2002, the Administrator shall allocate such \n     allowances for affected units under section 414 on a pro rata \n     basis. For purposes of this subsection, for any unit subject \n     to the emissions limitation requirements of section 414, the \n     term ``pro rata basis'' refers to the ratio which the \n     reductions made in such unit's allowances in order\n\n[[Page S7485]]\n\n     to establish the reserve under this subsection bears to the \n     total of such reductions for all such units.\n       (h) Alternative Allowance Allocation for United in Certain \n     Utility Systems With Optional Baseline.--\n       (1) Optional baseline for units in certain systems.--In the \n     case of a unit subject to the emissions limitation \n     requirements of this section which (as of November 15, \n     1990)--\n       (A) has an emission rate below 1.0 lbs/mmBtu,\n       (B) has decreased its sulfur dioxide emissions rate by 60 \n     percent or greater since 1980, and\n       (C) is part of a utility system which has a weighted \n     average sulfur dioxide emissions rate for all fossil fueled-\n     fired units below 1.0 lbs/mmBtu, at the election to the owner \n     or operator of such unit, the unit's baseline may be \n     calculated\n       (i) as provided under section 411, or\n       (ii) by utilizing the unit's average annual fuel \n     consumption at a 60 percent capacity factor. Such election \n     shall be made no later than March 1, 1991.\n       (2) Allowance allocation.--Whenever a unit referred to in \n     paragraph (1) elects to calculate its baseline as provided in \n     clause (ii) of paragraph (1), the Administrator shall \n     allocate allowances for the unit pursuant to section 412(a), \n     this section, and section 414 (as Basic Phase II allowance \n     allocations) in an amount equal to the baseline selected \n     multiplied by the lower of the average annual emission rate \n     for such unit in 1989, or 1.0 lbs./mmBtu. Such allowance \n     allocation shall be in lieu of any allocation of allowances \n     under this section and section 414.\n\n     SEC. 414. PHASE II SULFUR DIOXIDE REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Applicability.--(1) After January 1, 2000, each \n     existing utility unit as provided below is subject to the \n     limitations or requirements of this section. Each utility \n     unit subject to an annual sulfur dioxide tonnage emission \n     limitation under this section is an affected unit under this \n     subpart. Each source that includes one or more affected units \n     is an affected source. In the case of an existing unit that \n     was not in operation during calendar year 1985, the emission \n     rate for a calendar year after 1985, as determined by the \n     Administrator, shall be used in lieu of the 1985 rate.

on a Btu basis, at a 65 \n     percent capacity factor multiplied by the lesser of 1.20 lbs/\n     mmBtu or the unit's allowable 1987 sulfur dioxide emissions \n     rate, divided by 2,000, unless the owner or operator of such \n     unit has obtained allowances equal to its actual \n     emissions or, for a year after 2007, unless the owner or \n     operator of the source that includes such unit holds \n     allowances to emit not less than the total annual \n     emissions of all affected units at the source.\n       (6)(A) Unless the Administrator has approved a designation \n     of such facility under section 417, the provisions of this \n     subpart shall not apply to a ``qualifying small power \n     production facility'' or ``qualifying cogeneration facility'' \n     (within the meaning of section 3(17)(C) or 3(18)(B) of the \n     Federal Power Act) or to a ``new independent power production \n     facility'' if, as of November 15, 1990,\n       (i) an applicable power sales agreement has been executed;\n       (ii) the facility is the subject of a State regulatory \n     authority order requiring an electric utility to enter into a \n     power sales agreement with, purchase capacity from, or (for \n     purposes of establishing terms and conditions of the electric \n     utility's purchase of power) enter into arbitration \n     concerning, the facility;\n       (iii) an electric utility has issued a letter of intent or \n     similar instrument committing to purchase power from the \n     facility at a previously offered or lower price and a power \n     sales agreement is executed within a reasonable period of \n     time; or\n       (iv) the facility has been selected as a winning bidder in \n     a utility competitive bid solicitation.\n       (h) Oil and Gas-fired Units Less Than 10 Percent Oil \n     Consumed.--(1) After January 1, 2000, it shall be unlawful \n     for any oil- and gas-fired utility unit whose average annual \n     fuel consumption during the period 1980 through 1989 on a Btu \n     basis exceeded 90 percent in the form of natural gas to \n     exceed an annual sulfur dioxide tonnage limitation equal to \n     the product of the unit's baseline multiplied by the unit's \n     actual 1985 emissions rate divided by 2,000 unless the owner \n     or operator of such unit holds allowances to emit not less \n     than the unit's total annual emissions or, for a year after \n     2007, unless the owner or operator of the source that \n     includes such unit holds allowances to emit not less than the \n     total annual emissions of all affected units at the source.\n       (2) In addition to allowances allocated pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) and section 412(a) as basic Phase II allowance \n     allocations, beginning January 1, 2000, and for each calendar \n     year thereafter until and including 2009, the Administrator \n     shall allocate annually for each unit subject to the \n     emissions limitation requirements of paragraph (1) allowances \n     from the reserve created pursuant to subsection (a)(2) in an \n     amount equal to the unit's baseline multiplied by 0.050 lbs/\n     mmBtu, divided by 2,000.\n       (3) In addition to allowances allocated pursuant to \n     paragraph (1) and section 412(a), beginning January 1, 2010, \n     the Administrator shall allocate annually for each unit \n     subject to the emissions limitation requirements of paragraph \n     (1) allowances in an amount equal to the unit's baseline \n     multiplied by 0.050 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000.\n       (i) Units in High Growth States.--(1) In addition to \n     allowances allocated pursuant to this section and section \n     412(a) as basic Phase II allowance allocations, beginning \n     January 1, 2000, the Administrator shall allocate annually \n     allowances for each unit, subject to an emissions limitation \n     requirement under this section, and located in a State that--\n       (A) has experienced a growth in population in excess of 25 \n     percent between 1980 and 1988 according to State Population \n     and Household Estimates, With Age, Sex, and Components of \n     Change: 1981-1988 allocated by the United States Department \n     of Commerce, and\n       (B) had an installed electrical generating capacity of more \n     than 30,000,000 kw in 1988, in an amount equal to the \n     difference between (A) the number of allowances that would be \n     allocated for the unit pursuant to the emissions limitation \n     requirements of this section applicable to the unit \n     adjusted to reflect the unit's annual average fuel \n     consumption on a Btu basis of any three consecutive \n     calendar years between 1980 and 1989 (inclusive) as \n     elected by the owner or operator and (B) the number of \n     allowances allocated for the unit pursuant to the \n     emissions limitation requirements of this section: \n     Provided, That the number of allowances allocated pursuant \n     to this subsection shall not exceed an annual total of \n     40,000. If necessary to meeting the 40,000 allowance \n     restriction imposed under this subsection the \n     Administrator shall reduce, pro rata, the additional \n     annual allowances allocated to each unit under this \n     subsection.\n       (2) Beginning January 1, 2000, in addition to allowances \n     allocated pursuant to this section and section 403(a)(1) as \n     basic Phase II allowance allocations, the Administrator shall \n     allocate annually for each unit subject to the emissions \n     limitation requirements of subsection (b)(1), (A) the lesser \n     of whose actual or allowable 1980 emissions rate has declined \n     by 50 percent or more as of November 15, 1990, (B) whose \n     actual emissions rate is less than 1.2 lbs/mmBtu as of \n     January 1, 2000, (C) which commenced operation after January \n     1, 1970, (D) which is owned by a utility company whose \n     combined commercial and industrial kilowatt-hour sales have \n     increased by more than 20 percent between calendar year 1980 \n     and November 15, 1990, and (E) whose company-wide fossil-fuel \n     sulfur dioxide emissions rate has declined 40 percent or more \n     from 1980 to 1988, allowances in an amount equal to the \n     difference between (i) the number of allowances that would be \n     allocated for the unit pursuant to the emissions limitation \n     requirements of subsection (b)(1) adjusted to reflect the \n     unit's annual average fuel consumption on a Btu basis for any \n     three consecutive years between 1980 and 1989 (inclusive) as \n     elected by the owner or operator and (ii) the number of \n     allowances allocated for the unit pursuant to the emissions \n     limitation requirements of subsection (b)(1): Provided, That \n     the number of allowances allocated pursuant to this paragraph \n     shall not exceed an annual total of 5,000. If necessary to \n     meeting the 5,000 allowance restriction imposed in the last \n     clause of the preceding sentence the Administrator shall \n     reduce, pro rata, the additional allowances allocated to each \n     unit pursuant to this paragraph.\n       (j) Certain Municipally Owned Power Plants.--Beginning \n     January 1, 2000, in addition to allowances allocated pursuant \n     to this section and section 412(a) as basic Phase II \n     allowance allocations, the Administrator shall allocate \n     annually for each existing municipally owned oil and gas-\n     fired utility unit with nameplate capacity equal to, or less \n     than, 40 MWe, the lesser of whose actual or allowable 1985 \n     sulfur dioxide emission rate is less than 1.20 lbs/mmBtu, \n     allowances in an amount equal to the product of the unit's \n     annual fuel consumption on a Btu basis at a 60 percent \n     capacity factor multiplied by the lesser of its allowable \n     1985 emission rate or its actual 1985 emission rate, divided \n     by 2,000.\n\n     SEC. 415. ALLOWANCES FOR STATES WITH EMISSIONS RATES AT OR \n                   BELOW 0.80 LBS/MMBTU.\n\n       (a) Election of Governor.--In addition to basic Phase II \n     allowance allocations, upon the election of the Governor of \n     any State, with a 1985 state-wide annual sulfur dioxide \n     emissions rate equal to or less than, 0.80 lbs/mmBtu, \n     averaged over all fossil fuel-fired utility steam generating \n     units, beginning January 1, 2000, and for each calendar year \n     thereafter until and including 2009, the Administrator shall \n     allocate, in lieu of other Phase II bonus allowance \n     allocations, allowances from the reserve created pursuant \n     to section 414(a)(2) to all such units in the State in an \n     amount equal to 125,000 multiplied by the unit's pro rata \n     share of electricity generated in calendar year 1985 at \n     fossil fuel-fired utility steam units in all States \n     eligible for the election.\n       (b) Notification of Administrator.--Pursuant to section \n     412(a), each Governor of a State eligible to make an election \n     under paragraph (a) shall notify the Administrator of such \n     election. In the event that the Governor of any such state \n     fails to notify the Administrator of the Governor's \n     elections, the Administrator shall allocate allowances \n     pursuant to section 414.\n       (c) Allowances After January 1, 2010.--After January 1, \n     2010, the Administrator shall allocate allowances to units \n     subject to the provisions of this section pursuant to section \n     414.\n\n     SEC. 416. ELECTION FOR ADDITIONAL SOURCES.\n\n       (a) Applicability.--The owner or operator of any unit that \n     is not, nor will become, an affected unit under section \n     412(b), 413, or 414, that emits sulfur dioxide, may elect to \n     designate that unit or source to become an affected unit and \n     to receive allowances under this subpart. An election shall \n     be submitted to the Administrator for approval, along with a \n     permit application and proposed compliance plan in accordance \n     with section 404.\n\n[[Page S7488]]\n\n     The Administrator shall approve a designation that meets the \n     requirements of this section, and such designated unit shall \n     be allocated allowances, and be an affected unit for purposes \n     of this subpart.\n       (b) Establishment of Baseline.--The baseline for a unit \n     designated under this section shall be established by the \n     Administrator by regulation, based on fuel consumption and \n     operating data for the unit for calendar years 1985, 1986, \n     and 1987, or if such data is not available, the Administrator \n     may prescribe a baseline based on alternative representative \n     data.\n       (c) Emission Limitations.--(1) For a unit for which an \n     election, along with a permit application and compliance \n     plan, is submitted to the Administrator under paragraph (a) \n     before January 1, 2002, annual emissions limitations for \n     sulfur dioxide shall be equal to the product of the baseline \n     multiplied by the lesser of the unit's 1985 actual or \n     allowable emission rate in lbs/mmBtu, or if the unit did not \n     operate in 1985, by the lesser of the unit's actual or \n     allowable emission rate for a calendar year after 1985 (as \n     determined by the Administrator), divided by 2,000.\n       (2) For a unit for which an election, along with a permit \n     application and compliance plan, is submitted to the \n     Administrator under paragraph (a) on or after January 1, \n     2002, annual emissions limitations for sulfur dioxide shall \n     be equal to the product of the baseline multiplied by the \n     lesser of the unit's 1985 actual or allowable emission rate \n     in lbs/mmBtu, or, if the unit did not operate in 1985, by the \n     lesser of the unit's actual or allowable emission rate for a \n     calendar year after 1985 (as determined by the \n     Administrator), divided by 4,000.\n       (d) Allowances and Permits.--The Administrator shall issue \n     allowances to an affected unit under this section in an \n     amount equal to the emissions limitation calculated under \n     subsection (c), in accordance with section 412. Such \n     allowance may be used in accordance with, and shall be \n     subject to, the provisions of section 412. Affected sources \n     under this section shall be subject to the requirements of \n     sections 404, 405, 406, and 412.\n       (e) Limitations.--Any unit designated under this section \n     shall not transfer or bank allowances produced as a result of \n     reduced utilization or shutdown, except that, such allowances \n     may be transferred or carried forward for use in subsequent \n     years to the extent that the reduced utilization or shutdown \n     results from the replacement of thermal energy from the unit \n     designated under this section, with thermal energy \n     generated by any other unit or units subject to the \n     requirements of this subpart, and the designated unit's \n     allowances are transferred or carried forward for use at \n     such other replacement unit or units. In no case may the \n     Administrator allocate to a source designated under this \n     section allowances in an amount greater than the emissions \n     resulting from operation of the source in full compliance \n     with the requirements of this Act. No such allowances \n     shall authorize operation of a unit in violation of any \n     other requirements of this Act.\n       (f) Implementation.--The Administrator shall implement this \n     section under 40 CFR part 74 (2001), amended as appropriate \n     by the Administrator.\n\n     SEC. 417 AUCTIONS, RESERVE.\n\n       (a) Special Reserve of Allowances.--For purposes of \n     establishing the Special Allowance Reserve, the Administrator \n     shall withhold--\n       (1) 2.8 percent of the allocation of allowances for each \n     year from 1995 through 1999 inclusive; and\n       (2) 2.8 percent of the basic Phase II allowance allocation \n     of allowances for each year beginning in the year 2000\n\n     which would (but for this subsection) be issued for each \n     affected unit at an affected source. The Administrator shall \n     record such withholding for purposes of transferring the \n     proceeds of the allowance sales under this subsection. The \n     allowances so withheld shall be deposited in the Reserve \n     under this section.\n       (b) Auction Sales.--(1) Subaccount for auctions.--The \n     Administrator shall establish an Auction Subaccount in the \n     Special Reserve established under this section. The Auction \n     Subaccount shall contain allowances to be sold at auction \n     under this section in the amount of 150,000 tons per year for \n     each year from 1995 through 1999, inclusive and 250,000 tons \n     per year for each year from 2000 through 2009, inclusive.\n       (2) Annual auctions.--Commencing in 1993 and in each year \n     thereafter until 2010, the Administrator shall conduct \n     auctions at which the allowances referred to in paragraph (1) \n     shall be offered for sale in accordance with regulations \n     promulgated by the Administrator. The allowances referred to \n     in paragraph (1) shall be offered for sale at auction in the \n     amounts specified in table C. The auction shall be open to \n     any person. A person wishing to bid for such allowances shall \n     submit (by a date set by the Administrator) to the \n     Administrator (on a sealed bid schedule provided by the \n     Administrator) offers to purchase specified numbers of \n     allowance sat specified prices. Such regulations shall \n     specify that the auctioned allowances shall be allocated and \n     sold on the basis of bid price, starting with the highest-\n     priced bid and continuing until all allowances for sale at \n     such auction have been allocated. The regulations shall not \n     permit that a minimum price be set for the purchase of \n     withheld allowances. Allowances purchased at the auction may \n     be used for any purpose and at any time after the auction, \n     subject to the provisions of this subpart and subpart 2.\n\n          TABLE C.--NUMBER OF ALLOWANCES AVAILABLE FOR AUCTION\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                           Spot auction       Advance\n              Year of sale                  (same year)       auction\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1993....................................          50,000         100,000\n1994....................................          50,000         100,000\n1995....................................          50,000         100,000\n1996....................................         150,000         100,000\n1997....................................         150,000         100,000\n1998....................................         150,000         100,000\n1999....................................         150,000         100,000\n2000....................................         125,000         125,000\n2001....................................         125,000         125,000\n2002....................................         125,000         125,000\n2003-2009...............................         125,000               0\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n       (3) Proceeds.--(A) Notwithstanding section 3302 of title 31 \n     of the United States Code or any other provision of law, \n     within 90 days of receipt, the Administrator shall transfer \n     the proceeds from the auction under this section, on a pro \n     rata basis, to the owners or operators of the affected units \n     at an affected source from whom allowances were withheld \n     under subsection (b). No funds transferred from a purchaser \n     to a seller of allowances under this paragraph shall be held \n     by any officer or employee of the United States or treated \n     for any purpose as revenue to the United States or the \n     Administrator.\n       (B) At the end of each year, any allowances offered for \n     sale but not sold at the auction shall be returned without \n     charge, on a pro rata basis, to the owner or operator of the \n     affected units from whose allocation the allowances were \n     withheld. With 170 days after the date of enactment of the \n     Clear Skies Act of 2002, any allowance withheld under \n     paragraph (a)(2) but not offered for sale at an auction shall \n     be returned without charge, on a pro rata basis, to the owner \n     or operator of the affected units from whose allocation the \n     allowances were withheld.\n       (4) Recording by EPA.--The Administrator shall record and \n     publicly report the nature, prices and results of each \n     auction under this subsection, including the prices of \n     successful bids, and shall record the transfers of allowances \n     as a result of each auction in accordance with the \n     requirements of this section. The transfer of allowances at \n     such auction shall be recorded in accordance with the \n     regulations promulgated by the Administrator under this \n     subpart.\n       (c) Changes in Auctions and Withholding.--Pursuant to \n     rulemaking after public notice and comment the Administrator \n     may at any time after the year 1998 (in the case of advance \n     auctions) and 2005 (in the case of spot auctions) decrease \n     the number of allowances withheld and sold under this \n     section.\n       (d) Termination of Auction.--The Administrator shall \n     terminate the withholding of allowances and the auction sales \n     under this section on December 31, 2009. Pursuant to \n     regulations under this section, the Administrator may be \n     delegation or contract provide for the conduct of sales or \n     auctions under the Administrator's supervision by other \n     departments or agencies of the United States Government or by \n     nongovernmental agencies, groups, or organizations.\n       (e) The Administrator shall implement this section under 40 \n     CFR part 73 (2001), amended as appropriate by the \n     Administrator.\n\n     SEC. 418. INDUSTRIAL SO2 EMISSIONS.\n\n       (a) Report.--Not later than January 1, 1995 and every 5 \n     years thereafter, the Administrator shall transmit to the \n     Congress a report containing an inventory of national annual \n     sulfur dioxide emissions from industrial sources (as defined \n     in section 411(11)), including units subject to section \n     414(g)(2), for all years for which data are available, as \n     well as the likely trend in such emission over the following \n     twenty-year period. The reports shall also contain estimates \n     of the actual emission reduction in each year resulting from \n     promulgation of the diesel fuel desulfurization regulations \n     under section 214.\n       (b) 5.60 Million Ton Cap.--Whenever the inventory required \n     by this section indicates that sulfur dioxide emissions from \n     industrial sources, including units subject to section \n     414(g)(2), and may reasonably be expected to reach levels \n     greater than 5.60 million tons per year, the Administrator \n     shall take such\n\n[[Page S7489]]\n\n     actions under the Act as may be appropriate to ensure that \n     such emissions do not exceed 5.60 million tons per year. Such \n     actions may include the promulgation of new and revised \n     standards of performance for new sources, including units \n     subject to section 414(g)(2), under section 111(b), as well \n     as promulgation of standards of performance for existing \n     sources, including units subject to section 414(g)(2), under \n     authority of this section.

NITROGEN OXIDES EMISSION REDUCTION PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Applicability.--On the date that a coal-fired utility \n     unit becomes an affected unit pursuant to sections 413 or \n     414, or on the date a unit subject to the provisions of \n     section 413(d), must meet the SO2 reduction \n     requirements, each such unit shall become an affected unit \n     for purposes of this section and shall be subject to the \n     emission limitations for nitrogen oxides set forth herein.\n       (b) Emission Limitations.--\n       (1) The Administrator shall by regulation establish annual \n     allowable emission limitations for nitrogen oxides for the \n     types of utility boilers listed below, which limitations \n     shall not exceed the rates listed below: Provided, That the \n     Administrator may set a rate higher than that listed for any \n     type of utility boiler if the Administrator finds that the \n     maximum listed rate for that boiler type cannot be achieved \n     using low NOX burner technology. The Administrator \n     shall implement this paragraph under 40 CFR Sec. 76.5 (2001). \n     The maximum allowable emission rates are as follows:\n       (A) for tangentially fired boilers, 0.45 lb/mmBtu;\n       (B) for dry bottom wall-fired boilers (other than units \n     applying cell burner technology), 0.50 lb/mmBtu. After \n     January 1, 1995, it shall be unlawful for any unit that is an \n     affected unit on that date and is of the type listed in this \n     paragraph to emit nitrogen oxides in excess of the emission \n     rates set by the Administrator pursuant to this paragraph.\n       (2) The Administrator shall, by regulation, establish \n     allowable emission limitations on a lb/mmBtu, annual average \n     basis, for nitrogen oxides for the following types of utility \n     boilers:\n       (A) wet bottom wall-fired boilers;\n       (B) cyclones;\n       (C) units applying cell burner technology;\n       (D) all other types of utility boilers.\n       The Administrator shall base such rates on the degree of \n     reduction achievable through the retrofit application of the \n     best system of continuous emission reduction, taking into \n     account available technology, costs and energy and \n     environmental impacts; and which is comparable to the costs \n     of nitrogen oxides controls set pursuant to subsection \n     (b)(1). The Administrator may revise the applicable emission \n     limitations for tangentially fired and dry bottom, wall-fired \n     boilers (other than cell burners) to be more stringent if the \n     Administrator determines that more effective low \n     NOx burned technology is available: Provided, \n     That, no unit that is an affected unit pursuant to section \n     413 and that is subject to the requirements of subsection \n     (b)(1), shall be subject to the revised emission limitations, \n     if any. The Administrator shall implement that paragraph \n     under 40 CFR Sec. Sec. 76.6 and 76.7 (2001).\n       (c) Alternative Emission Limitations.--The permitting \n     authority shall, upon request of an owner or operator of a \n     unit subject to this section, authorize an emission \n     limitation less stringent than the applicable limitation \n     established under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) upon a \n     determination that--\n       (1) a unit subject to subsection (b)(1) cannot meet the \n     applicable limitation using low NOx burner \n     technology; or\n       (2) a unit subject to subsection (b)(2) canot meet the \n     applicable rate using the technology on which the \n     Administrator based the applicable emission limitation.\n\n[[Page S7492]]\n\n       The permitting authority shall base such determination upon \n     a showing satisfactory to the permitting authority, in \n     accordance with regulations established by the Administrator, \n     that the owner or operator--\n       (1) has properly installed appropriate control equipment \n     designed to meet the applicable emission rate;\n       (2) has properly operated such equipment for a period of \n     fifteen months (or such other period of time as the \n     Administrator determines through the regulations), and \n     provides operating and monitoring data for such period \n     demonstrating that the unit cannot meet the applicable \n     emission rate; and\n       (3) has specified an emission rate that such unit can meet \n     on an annual average basis. The permitting authority shall \n     issue an operating permit for the unit in question, in \n     accordance with section 404 and title V--\n       (i) that permits the unit during the demonstration period \n     referred to in subparagraph (2) above, to emit at a rate in \n     excess of the applicable emission rate;\n       (ii) at the conclusion of the demonstration period to \n     revise the operating permit to reflect the alternative \n     emission rate demonstrated in paragraphs (2) and (3) above.\n       Units subject to subsection (b)(1) for which an alternative \n     emission limitation is established shall not be required to \n     install any additional control technology beyond low \n     NOx burners. Nothing in this section shall \n     preclude an owner or operator from installing and operating \n     an alternative NOx control technology capable of \n     achieving the applicable emission limitation. The \n     Administrator shall implement this subsection under 40 CFR \n     part 76 (2001), amended as appropriate by the Administrator.\n       (d) Emissions Averaging.--In lieu of complying with the \n     applicable emission limitations under subsection (b)(1), (2), \n     or (c), the owner or operator of two or more units subject to \n     one or more of the applicable emission limitations set \n     pursuant to these sections, may petition the permitting \n     authority for alternative contemporaneous annual emission \n     limitations for such units that ensure that (1) the actual \n     annual emission rate in pounds of nitrogen oxides per million \n     Btu averaged over the units in question is a rate that is \n     less than or equal to (2) Btu-weighted average annual \n     emission rate for the same units if they had been operated, \n     during the same period of time, in compliance with \n     limitations set in accordance with the applicable emission \n     rates set pursuant to subsections (b)(1) and (2).\n       If the permitting authority determines, in accordance with \n     regulations issued by the Administrator that the conditions \n     in the paragraph above can be met, the permitting authority \n     shall issue operating permits for such units, in accordance \n     with section 404 and title V, that allow alternative \n     contemporaneous annual emission limitations. Such emission \n     limitations shall only remain in effect while both units \n     continue operation under the conditions specified in their \n     respective operating permits. The Administrator shall \n     implement this subsection under 40 CFR part 76 (2001), \n     amended as appropriate by the Administrator.\n\n     SEC. 442.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve \ntax equity for military personnel, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Foreign and \nArmed Services Tax Fairness Act of 2002, FAST Fairness, that will not \nonly correct inequities in the current tax code our military men and \nwomen are subject to, but it will also provide incentives for our \ndedicated forces to continue their service to America.\n  On July 9, 2002, the House passed unanimously a bill, H.R. 5063, that \nprovided limited relief to military personnel. The bill would provide a \nspecial rule for members of the armed forces in determining the \nexclusion of gain from the sale of a principal residence and would \nrestore the tax-exempt status of death gratuity payments to members of \nthe armed forces. I support the efforts of the House, but believe we \ncan go farther.\n  These are the men and women that put their lives on the line for our \nfreedom on a daily basis. We need to ensure that laws that we here in \nCongress pass do not negatively impact them. We should also develop \nsound policy that serves as an incentive for our youth to follow in the \nsteps of the men and women that went before them to defend our country.\n  It is with these principles in mind that I move forward with this \nmilitary tax package and incorporate additional provisions already \nintroduced by my colleagues. I would now like to describe the \nprovisions that I have chosen to include in this critical piece of \nlegislation:\n  On July 24, 2002, Senator Carnahan introduced S. 2783, which would \nrestore the tax exempt status of all death gratuity payments. This \nproposal is similar to the provision included in H.R. 5063.\n  Why is this provision so important? Under current law, death gratuity \nbenefits are excludable from income only to the extent that they were \nas of September 9, 1986. In 1986, the death gratuity benefit was \n$3,000. In 1991, the benefit was increased to $6,000, but the tax code \nwas never adjusted to exclude the additional $3,000 from income. \nBecause of this oversight, the U.S. government has been taxing families \nfor the death of a family member who died in combat. This is just \nwrong.\n  I support the provisions of H.R. 5063 and S. 2783, therefore I have \nincluded them in this piece of legislation.\n  In 1997, Congress passed legislation revising the taxation of capital \ngains on the sale of a person's principal residence. The new rule is \nthat up to $250,000, $500,000 per couple, is excluded on that sale of a \nprincipal residence if the individual has lived in the house for at \nleast two of the previous five years.\n  However, when enacted, Congress failed to provide a special rule for \nmilitary and Foreign Service personnel who are required to move either \nwithin the U.S. or abroad. Senators McCain and Graham both have \nintroduced legislation to address this oversight.\n  I agree that we should adjust the rule for our service men and women. \nWe shouldn't penalize them for choosing to serve our country. My \nproposal would permit service personnel and members of the Foreign \nService to suspend the five-year period while away on assignment, \nmeaning those years would count toward neither the two years nor the \nfive year periods. This is a also similar to provisions on H.R. 5063.\n  The Department of Defense provides payments to members of the Armed \nServices to offset diminution in housing values due to military base \nrealignment or closure. For example, if a house near a base was worth \n$180,000 prior to the base closure and $100,000 after the base closure, \nDOD may provide the owner with a payment to offset some, but not all of \nthe $80,000 diminution in value. Under current law, those amounts are \ntaxable as compensation.\n  There will be another round of base closures in the near future. That \nfate was decided in the FY2002 Defense Authorization bill. We should \nensure that those men and women losing value in their homes due to a \nfederal government decision are not adversely affected financially. The \nproposal would provide that payments for lost value are not includible \ninto income. Recently, Senator Cleland introduced a package that \nincluded this provision. I thank him for his unending pursuit to \nprovide military personnel with the best quality of life available. \nAnd, I'm happy to include this provision in my legislation.\n  Under current law, military personnel in a combat zone are afforded \nan extended period for filing tax returns. However, this does not apply \nto contingency operations. This proposal would extend the same benefits \nto military personnel assigned to contingency operations.\n  It can't be easy trying to figure out our complicated tax system \nwhile you are overseas and protecting our nation's freedom. Those men \nand women that have been sent to uphold freedom in other countries are \nconfronted with similar circumstances, such as in Operation Just Cause \nin Panama, 1989, or in Operation Restore Hope in Somalia in 1992 and \n1993, or in Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti, 1994. Contingency \noperations are just as demanding as combat zone deployment, although \nnot always in the same manner. I would like to thank Senator Johnson \nfor introducing S. 2785. It is important that we support all our troops \nwhen they are overseas.\n\n[[Page S7499]]\n\n  Some reservists who travel one weekend per month and two weeks in the \nsummer for reserve duty incur significant travel and lodging expenses. \nUnder current law, these are deductible as itemized deductions but must \nexceed 2 percent of adjusted gross income. For lower income reservists, \nthis deduction does not provide a benefit, because they do not itemize. \nFor higher income reservists, the 2 percent floor limits the amount of \nthe benefit of the deductions.\n  In my home state of Montana, we have approximately 3500 reservists, \n800 of which travel each month across the State for their training. \nThese 800 reservists pay out of their own pocket the expense for \ntravel, and hotel rooms. In Montana we rank 48th in the Nation for per \ncapita personal income. I know it can't be easy for Montanans to incur \napproximately $200 in expenses each and every month. Yet, they continue \nselflessly to provide their services to our country at their own \nexpense. For those reservists that travel out of State for their \ntraining, this expense is higher on average. This proposal would \nprovide an above the line deduction for overnight travel costs and \nwould be available for all reservists and members of the National \nGuard.\n\n  This issue is currently addressed in S. 540, which Senator DeWine \nintroduced back in March of 2001. I can't tell you just how many people \nhave contacted our office in support of this bill. I support what this \nbill does and I am glad that we can include some of its provisions in \nmy military tax package.\n  Recently, Senator Harkin introduced S. 2789, which would expand the \nmembership for Veteran's organizations. Currently, qualified veterans' \norganizations under section 501(c)(19) of the tax code are both tax-\nexempt and contributions to the organization are tax-deductible. In \norder to qualify under 501(c)(19), the organization must meet several \ntests, including 75 percent of the members must be current or former \nactive military, and substantially all of the members must be either \ncurrent or former active military or widows of former active military. \nThe proposal would permit lineal descendants and ancestors to qualify \nfor the ``substantially all'' test.\n  It is important that our veterans' organizations continue the good \nwork that they do. But, as the organizations age, they are in danger of \nlosing their tax-exempt status. I support Senator Harkin's bill, as \ndoes the American Legion. I have included it in my tax package.\n  Finally, I want to ensure that women in the military can continue \ntheir dedicated service even once they have entered motherhood knowing \nthat their children are being well taken care of. The military provides \nextensive childcare benefits to its employees. DOD employees at DOD-\nowned facilities provide childcare services while other areas contract \nout their childcare.\n  When Congress passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986, we included a \nprovision stating that qualified military benefits are excluded from \nincome. It is not absolutely clear whether child care provisions are \ncovered under this provision. The proposal would clarify that any \nchildcare benefit provided to military personnel would be excludable \nfrom income. Senator Landrieu has introduced S. 2807, a similar \nmeasure. I support this measure and am proud to include it in this \npiece of legislation.\n  It is my intention to mark-up this legislation soon in hopes that we \ncan move it through the Senate quickly. It is important that we \ncontinue to show members of the armed forces our support and solidarity \nduring this time of conflict. The War on Terrorism has brought to light \nthe essential role the armed services play in upholding freedom \nthroughout the world. I would like to see a military tax equity bill \nsigned into law by the President before the end of the year.\n  Mr. President, I ask consent that the text of the bill be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2816\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize appropriations for fiscal years 2003, \n2004, 2005, 2006, and 2007 for the National Science Foundation, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the \nNational Science Foundation Doubling Act. This important legislation \nhas been crafted with the extensive cooperation of Senator Hollings, \nChairman of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond, the respective Chair \nand Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and \nIndependent Agencies. I commend each of them for their leadership in \nfederal support for the sciences .\n  The National Science Foundation, NSF, has two key missions, and it \ncarries both of them out well. It supports basic research and \ndevelopment in math, science, engineering, and technology, and it \npromotes math and science learning at every level, from K-12 through \npost-graduate education.\n  NSF has funded basic research leading to the creation of speech \nrecognition software, MRI machines, and even World Wide Web browsers \nsuch as Netscape and Microsoft's Internet Explorer. In education, NSF \ninitiatives of the late 1980s were the forerunners of the standards-\nbased school reform movement embraced throughout the Nation today.\n  We can and should build on NSF's distinguished record in improving \nthe lives of millions of Americans. The 20th Century was the era of the \nindustrial age, and the 21st Century will be the era of information \ntechnology and the life sciences. With the leadership of Senator Harkin \nand others, we have doubled the budget of the National Institutes of \nHealth over the last five years. We should do the same for NSF. We \nshould double our support for research and development in theoretical \nmathematics and the physical sciences, because they support advances in \nthe health sciences and because they are also valuable in their own \nright.\n  As former Senator Glenn has pointed out so frequently, we need to do \nmuch more to interest young minds in math and science and recruit \ntomorrow's scientists and engineers. Over the next 10 years, the number \nof jobs requiring technical skills will grow by 50 percent. \nUnfortunately, high school student performance on math and science \nexams is alarmingly low. The number of American students studying the \nsciences at the post-secondary level is flat. Too many women and \nminorities continue to shy away from the sciences.\n  The bill we are introducing today authorizes a doubling of the NSF \nbudget over the next five years. It makes sense to match the growth of \nNIH. As we enhance research and development in the life sciences, we \nshould also be strengthening research and development in the physical \nsciences.\n  This legislation also builds on NSF's Systemic Initiatives by \nsupporting a Secondary School Systemic Initiative to develop models to \nimprove high school student math and science performance and \npreparation for college-level or technical work.\n  The bill supports model Math and Science Partnerships between \ninstitutions of higher education and local school districts to improve \nthe knowledge and teaching techniques of current math and science \nteachers.\n  The bill supports institutions of higher education in increasing the\n\n[[Page S7501]]\n\nnumber of students, particularly women and minorities, who study toward \nand obtain degrees in science, math, engineering, and technology.\n  Finally, the bill reforms NSF's program on major research and \nfacilities equipment, to help prioritize projects and guard against \ncost overruns and non-merit reviewed proposals.\n  Scientific discovery and development continues to set America apart \nfrom other Nations and is one of our enduring legacies. The National \nScience Foundation Doubling Act is a solid piece of legislation \nbuilding on our Nation's history in the sciences and promoting a better \nfuture. It deserves to be considered quickly, and I believe favorably, \nby the United States Senate.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, Senator Kennedy, \nand Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond, in introducing this bill to \nauthorize the National Science Foundation through FY 2007. My friends \nand I represent three Committees with a strong interest in NSF, and we \nchose a straightforward title for the name of this bill, the NSF \nDoubling Act, because our intentions our simple and straightforward. \nCongress's intent is to double NSF's budget by fiscal year 2007. NSF is \nthe Nation's premier federal science agency that invests in basic \nresearch across all disciplines that is on the frontiers of science. In \n1945, Vannevar Bush's report for President Roosevelt led to the \nestablishment of the National Science Foundation. Since then, this \nnation has been on a path of solid investment in the scientific \nresearch that underlies our future economic health and well being. It's \nno mistake that Alan Greenspan and other important economists have \nnoted that more than one-half of our Nation's economic growth since \nWorld War I has stemmed from technology driven by science.\n  By next year, we in Congress will have succeeded in our goal to \ndouble the budget of the National Institutes of Health. I applaud that \neffort. But as scientific disciplines have become fundamentally \ninterdependent, advances in the health sciences necessarily depend on \nadvances in math, computer science, and engineering. NSF is the only \nFederal agency specifically charged with ensuring a broad and deep base \nof fundamental knowledge across disciplines. This mission is critical \nto technological innovation, our economy, and our general health and \nwelfare as a Nation.\n  I have said that our intentions are simple and straightforward. So \nlet me set out three simple reasons why this doubling is vital to our \nfuture:\n  The first concerns our security. Not only does NSF fund areas, such \nas cyber security, that are critical to protecting our nation, but NSF \nis the agency that takes the lead in ensuring that this country has \nsufficient human capital to ensure our continued world leadership in \nscience and technology. The Hart-Rudman Commission on National Security \nwarned that our failure to invest in science and to reform math and \nscience education was the second biggest threat to our national \nsecurity, only the threat of a weapon of mass destruction in an \nAmerican city was a greater danger. NSF invests in math and science \neducation from kindergarten all the way through to the post-doctoral \nlevel and beyond. This bill allows the Foundation to increase that \ninvestment, while reaffirming our commitment to women, minorities, and \npeople with disabilities. These underrepresented groups, together, make \nup more than half of our Nation's work force and are only increasing. \nLetting these groups fall by the wayside would not only threaten our \neconomic competitiveness, but also our national security.\n  Second pertains to our economy. I have already talked about science \nand technology driving our economic growth. Let me give just one \nexample of how NSF's investments can spur our economy. NSF is the \nleading agency in the National Nanotechnology Initiative. \nNanotechnology, which is the science of manipulating matter at the \natomic and molecular level, will cut across every scientific \ndiscipline, including materials and manufacturing, healthcare and \nmedicine, energy and the environment, agriculture, biotechnology, \ninformation technology, and national security. Worldwide, the market \nfor nanotechnology is expected to be $1 trillion annually within 10 to \n15 years. NSF's cross-disciplinary approach, which includes \ngroundbreaking research into the way society and this new technology \nwill interact, will help this nation take advantage of Nanotechnology \nsooner, better, and with greater confidence.\n  The third involves basic research. NSF is responsible for the overall \nhealth and well-being of the research enterprise in this country. One \nway NSF does this is through continued support for the EPSCoR program. \nEPSCoR supports the development of the science and technology resources \nof individual States like South Carolina, through partnerships that \ninvolve the State's universities, industry, government, and the Federal \nresearch and development enterprise. For example, NSF supports an \nEngineering Research Center focused on advanced fibers and films at \nClemson University that, through partnerships and continued investment \nover the next 10 years, will make Clemson the national leader in \nadvanced fibers and films technologies.\n  I think these arguments are solid, simple, and straightforward. We \ncan talk about NSF's past outstanding contributions to science. We can \ntalk about the future and the importance of science and technology to \nour economy. But, where the rubber meets the road, we have to stop \ntalking and invest, with real money, in the science and engineering \nenterprise that will guaranty the health, economic viability, and \nsecurity of our future. I, for one, appreciate the hard work that NSF \nhas done over the past 52 years promoting the progress of science, and \nI urge my Senate colleagues to support me in providing this agency the \nresources needed to conquer tomorrow.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support \nfor the National Science Foundation Doubling Act of 2002. As an \noriginal co-sponsor, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senators \nKennedy, Hollings, and Mikulski in introducing this important \nlegislation that will strengthen the long-term economic competitiveness \nand health of our Nation. As an appropriator and as an authorizer of \nNSF, I have a special interest in NSF and the basic science research it \nsupports. I believe this bill underscores the critical role NSF plays \nin the economic and intellectual growth and well-being of this Nation.\n  As many of my colleagues know, Senator Mikulski and I have led a \nbipartisan, bi-cameral effort to double NSF's budget and this \nreauthorization bill further supports our doubling effort over a five-\nyear period. NSF is funding innovative and cutting-edge research in \nnanotechnology, plant biotechnology, and information technology. \nDoubling NSF's funding is not only important for these research \nprograms but also in the area of education. NSF plays a valuable role \nin supporting math and science education and developing the Nation's \nsupply of scientists and engineers in this country.\n  Unfortunately, despite our efforts on the appropriations committee, \nthe Federal Government has not provided adequate support to NSF and the \nphysical sciences in general. I believe the lack of adequate support \nfor the physical sciences puts our Nation's capabilities for scientific \ninnnovation at risk and, equally important, at risk of falling behind \nother industrial nations.\n  Further, doctors throughout Missouri and the country have told me \nthat despite the tremendous support we have provided for the life \nsciences, their research in the biomedical field will stagnate without \nadequate government support of the physical sciences that NSF supports. \nMany medical technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging, \nultrasound, digital mammography and genomic mapping could not have \noccurred, and cannot improve to the next level of proficiency, without \nNSF-supported work in biology, physics, chemistry, mathematics, \nengineering, and computer sciences. Simply put: supporting NSF supports \nNIH.\n  The high-tech industry also in concerned about NSF funding because \nthey are struggling to find qualified homegrown engineers and \nscientists and becoming more reliant on foreign nationals to fill their \npositions. Many notable researchers in the high-tech industry have told \nme that the significant shortages of trained American engineers and \nscientists have limited the growth potential of the electronics and \nsoftware industries and allowed foreign\n\n[[Page S7502]]\n\ncompetitors to catch up to U.S. industry capabilities.\n\n  To address the development of tech talent in this country, NSF \nprovides a wide array of support to preK-12, undergraduate, and \ngraduate level schools. One new important tool is the Math and Science \npartnership program--a new joint program between NSF and the Department \nof Education. This program encourages partnerships among local school \nsystems, higher education entities, and other organizations to improve \nstudent outcomes in math and science for all students.\n  Another important tool that I support is the tech talent program. \nThis program was initiated at the urging of me and my Senate \ncolleagues--Senators Lieberman, Frist, Mikulski, and Domenici. Last \nyear, we introduced S. 1549, the Tech Talent Act to improve \nundergraduate education in math, science, engineering, and technology. \nWe provided $5 million in the Fiscal Year 2002 VA-HUD and Independent \nAgencies Appropriations Act to jumpstart this important initiative and \nanother $20 million was added in the fiscal year 2003 bill that passed \nthe Appropriations Committee last week. NSF has already received 177 \napplications requesting an aggregate sum of almost $60 million.\n  Lastly, I am very supportive of efforts to improve the accountability \nof NSF's programs and activities--especially those projects funded \nthrough the major research equipment and facilities construction \naccount. The bill includes a number of provisions to ensure that \nfunding decisions on large research facilities are done in a rationale \nand understandable manner.\n  Before the bill reaches the floor, I hope to work with my colleagues \non addressing other issues related to the National Science Board. As \nthe budget for NSF grows, it is important that the Board has the tools \nit needs to fulfill its statutory responsibilities. Specifically, we \nneed to provide the chairman of the Board the authority to hire its own \nstaff to support the Board's oversight and policy-making \nresponsibilities and to ensure that it can provide the Congress and the \nPresident with independent science policy advice. These tools will also \nensure that the Board is not a ``rubber stamp'' for the Director of \nNSF.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I understand that some of \nmy colleagues have concerns about the bill, but I believe that overall, \nthis is a good bill. I look forward to working with my colleagues in \nthe Senate and the House in moving a strong bipartisan NSF \nreauthorization bill and in advancing our effort to double NSF's \nbudget.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/07/29/senate-section/article/S7502-1", "month": "07", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n                      committee on indian affairs\n\n  Mr. INOUYE.
