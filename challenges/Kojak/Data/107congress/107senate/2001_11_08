Mr. President, I am pleased this morning to welcome a \ngood friend and distinguished North Dakotan, Francis Cree, to the \nSenate. I thank him for his moving and inspirational prayer.\n  Francis Cree is the Spiritual Leader and Tribal Elder of the Turtle \nMountain Band of Chippewa of North Dakota. He is the official Pipe \nCarrier for the Tribe, a position of honor and leadership. He led the \ntribe as chairman in the 1950s and served several terms on the Tribal \nCouncil.\n  Francis spends countless hours teaching young tribal members about \nChippewa culture and traditions. Last year, he even made an award-\nwinning CD called, ``The Elders Speak.''\n  Francis is married to Rose Cree, a well-known artist who makes \nbeautiful willow and birchbark baskets, several of which are displayed \nin my office. They were recently featured at the Smithsonian's Festival \nof American Folk Life on the Mall here in our Nation's Capital.\n  Francis and Rose have 14 children, and, according to Rose, ``too many \ngrandchildren and great-grandchildren to count, but there are well over \na hundred.'' In May, Rose and Francis will celebrate 63 years of \nmarriage.\n  Congratulations to you both.\n  I am very pleased to welcome Francis Cree to the Senate this morning. \nI thank him for being here and for sharing his inspiring message with \nus.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend from North Dakota leaves \nthe Chamber, and before Spiritual Leader and Tribal Elder Cree leaves \nthe Chamber, I say, I never had the opportunity in the Senate Chamber \nto say this to anyone who would understand it, but the Senator from \nNorth Dakota and the tribal leader will: I am a Pipe Carrier for the \nPyramid Paiute Tribe in northern Nevada. I have been through the \nceremony. It was very dignified and impressive. It was a ceremony I \nwill never forget.\n  So I am very happy we have had this very time-honored tradition now \ndone in opening the Senate in prayer. I congratulate the Senator from \nNorth Dakota in bringing one of the most-renowned citizens of his State \nto the U.S. Capitol.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank my colleague from Nevada.\n  My colleague, Senator Dorgan, is chairing a hearing in another part \nof the Capitol complex and will come to the Chamber later today to also \nmemorialize this occasion. I do not want this moment to pass without \nindicating Senator Dorgan was here earlier but had to leave to chair a \nmeeting of his subcommittee elsewhere in the Capitol complex or else he \nwould be here as well.\n  I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/08/senate-section/article/S11567-7", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11567-S11568]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNITION OF THE ACTING MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, with my friend and colleague, Senator \nShelby, I bring to the Senate S. 1428, the Intelligence Authorization \nAct for the fiscal year 2002.\n  The tragic events of the past months and the reality that our Nation \nis engaged in a war against global terrorism make this year's \nintelligence authorization bill especially important. We all realize \nthat good and timely intelligence is our first and sometimes our only \nline of defense against terrorism.\n  It is not enough for us to attempt to determine who was the culprit \nand to bring that culprit to justice. What the American people want \nmost is the capability to prevent acts of terrorism, which necessitates \nthe best intelligence information on a timely basis so that actions to \ninterrupt terrorist activities can take place before more Americans are \nattacked.\n  To accomplish this prevention of terrorism strategy, we must provide \nour intelligence community with the resources and the authorities it \nneeds to meet the expectations of the American people.\n  Many of those authorities were contained in the antiterrorism act \nwhich the President signed the last Friday of October. Today we are \ngoing to be talking about the resources that will give life to those \nauthorities and to the ongoing activities of the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  Our Select Committee on Intelligence marked up this bill on September \n6, submitted it to the Armed Services Committee, and the Armed Services \nCommittee has now reported the bill as submitted.\n  Even though we took legislative action before September 11, we noted \nat the time that international terrorism was not a crisis--with it, the \nconnotation that it is a short-term passing phenomenon--rather, \ninternational terrorism is a condition with which we will have to deal \non a long-term basis.\n  The committee strongly encouraged the intelligence community to \norient itself accordingly by implementing policies under the control of \nthe Director of Central Intelligence for regulating the various roles \nof the elements of the intelligence community that participate in the \nfight against terrorism. To that end, our legislation authorizes \nactivities that will rebuild the foundation of our intelligence \ncommunity so we can meet our long-term challenges.\n  In the process of preparing this year's intelligence authorization \nbill, the committee spent considerable time reviewing the current \nstatus of the intelligence community.\n  At this point, I recognize our vice chairman, Senator Shelby. He, of \ncourse, had been the chairman of this committee for a considerable \nperiod of time and started much of this process of in-depth review of \nthe intelligence community which then put us in a position to take \nadvantage of that work to provide what today will be some of the \nprescriptions based on the diagnosis of the problems. I particularly \nrecognize Senator Shelby and the work in which he led the committee and \nour staff for many months.\n  As a result of this review, we concluded that the intelligence \ncommunity has been underfunded over the past decade--basically, the \ndecade since the fall of the Berlin Wall--and its ability to conduct \ncertain core missions had deteriorated.\n  In order to correct these deficiencies, the committee identified four \npriorities to receive special emphasis in this year's bill: One, \nrevitalization of the National Security Agency; two, correcting \ndeficiencies in human intelligence; three, addressing the imbalance \nbetween collection and analysis; and four, providing sufficient funding \nfor a robust research and development series of initiatives. These four \npriorities underpin the work of the intelligence committee in all \nareas, including counterterrorism.\n\n  The committee believes that providing additional resources in these \npriorities is critical to assuring that the intelligence community is \ncapable of providing our political and military decisionmakers with the \naccurate and timely intelligence they require to make the best \ndecisions in the interest of the American people.\n  By providing proper resources and attention to these four priorities, \nwe will be able to support effectively the requirements placed on the \nintelligence community, including fighting global terrorism, but also a \nlist of other challenging responsibilities: countering the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery system; \nstopping the flow of illicit narcotics; and understanding the \ncapabilities, potential, and intentions of potential adversaries and \nforeign powers.\n  It is important to note that the committee recognizes that a \nconsistent and predictable funding stream is necessary to rebuild and \nmaintain these priority areas.\n  In preparing this year's legislation, the committee outlined a 5-year \nplan for each of these priorities. We believe this plan is consistent \nwith the capacity of the various agencies within the\n\n[[Page S11571]]\n\nintelligence community to absorb these additional funds and use them \neffectively, and that will result in a substantial new foundation under \nour intelligence community over the next 5 years in order to meet the \nchallenges of the next decades. We know that our commitment to rebuild \nour intelligence community must be sustained over the long-term or our \nefforts this year will be wasted.\n\n  Let me briefly explain what we are doing in each of these four \npriority areas.\n  First, we are continuing the revitalization of the National Security \nAgency, or the NSA. The committee, under the leadership of Senator \nShelby, has been pressing for this revitalization over the past 3 \nyears. The NSA is the agency of our intelligence community that is \nresponsible for assuring the security of United States communications, \nas well as collecting foreign electronic signals. In the parlance of \nintelligence, this is the signals agency.\n  Five years from now, the NSA must have the ability to collect and \nexploit electronic signals in a vastly different communications \nenvironment than that in which we spent most of the second half of the \n20th century. Along with significant investment in technology, this \nmeans closer collaboration with clandestine human collectors.\n  If I could explain briefly, during the Cold War, the United States \nbecame extremely adept at intercepting electronic communications. Our \nsystem was largely based on communications that would move over the \nairwaves. We would put a listening device between the sender and \nreceiver and could absorb massive amounts of information with relative \nimpunity.\n  Today, the computer and telecommunication systems that NSA employees \nwill be attempting to intercept are much more difficult because they do \nnot use the old over-the-airwaves system. To have the same level of \nelectronic surveillance today that we did even 10 years ago is going to \nrequire a significant investment in new technology. I mentioned, also, \nthe linkage to human intelligence. It was relatively easy to eavesdrop \non the old communication technology. The new communication technologies \nwill frequently require a human being to first gain access to the \nmachine that you are trying to surveil, and then have that person who \nhas gained access have sufficient technical capacity to be able to \ninstall the devices that are necessary to gain the information. So we \nare going to have to have a new generation of human intelligence that \nhas a significantly higher component of technical expertise, especially \nin the communications area.\n  The analysts--the ones who take this information that is collected--\nmust have sophisticated software tools to allow them to fully exploit \nthe amount of data that will be available in the future. So our first \nobjective is a continuation of the 3-year effort to revitalize the \nNational Security Agency.\n  Second, we must correct deficiencies in our human intelligence \ncapabilities. In 5 years, our human intelligence collection efforts \nmust be designed to meet the increasingly complex and growing set of \nhuman intelligence collection requirements.\n  Most of the history of our intelligence community is since the Second \nWorld War. During World War II, we established America's first \nprofessional intelligence agency under the direction of the military. \nAs soon as the war was over, it was disbanded. Two years later, \nPresident Truman, recognizing the rise of the Soviet Union, asked the \nCongress to establish a civilian agency and designate a director of \ncentral intelligence. Under that director, there were a number of \nagencies, such as the Central Intelligence Agency. For the next 40 \nyears, we focused on one big target: the Soviet Union and its Warsaw \npact allies.\n  As I indicated, in the area of signals intelligence, we became very \nadept at listening to that big target. People were speaking basically \nin Russian. It was a culture that we understood and with which we had a \nlong association since John Quincy Adams was our Ambassador to the \nczarist court in St. Petersburg.\n  Now, in the post-Berlin Wall period, we are dealing with a wide \ndiversity of targets, not just one. Many of these are targets with \nwhich we have not had a great deal of national history, and they speak \nmany languages. In Afghanistan, for instance, in addition to English \nand Arabic, there are at least six major domestic languages. We are \nvery deficient in our capabilities as a nation in many of these \nlanguages.\n  We must increase the diversity of our human intelligence, our spies. \nWe must recruit more effectively to operate in many places around the \nworld where U.S. interests are threatened. The human intelligence \nsystem must be integrated into our other collection systems, \nparticularly, as I indicated, with our National Security Agency, in \norder to gain effective access to new communications technology.\n  In addition, the Director of Central Intelligence must conduct a \nrigorous analytical review of human intelligence collection \nrequirements in the future so that we can be proactive with the \nresources necessary to meet those requirements. The Director of Central \nIntelligence must implement a performance measurement system to assure \nthat our collection efforts are meeting the highest priority needs of \nour ultimate customers for intelligence--the President and military \ndecisionmakers.\n  Our third priority is addressing the growing imbalance between \ncollection and analysis. Even with the deficiencies that I have \nmentioned in signals intelligence and human intelligence, we are still \ncollecting a massive amount of information on an hourly basis. But the \npercentage of this collected information to that which is analyzed and \nconverted into effective intelligence has been steadily declining since \n1990. Collection systems are becoming more and more capable as our \ninvestment in analysis erodes. This disparity threatens to overwhelm \nour ability to analyze and use the information collected.\n  The nightmare of the review of the events of September 11 would be if \nwe find that there was a wiretap, for instance, on a foreign resident \nwhom we had reason to suspect might be involved in some potential \nterrorist plot against the United States but that wiretap had not been \nlistened to, translated from its foreign language--frequently it is an \nencrypted foreign language--into English and then analyzed in terms of \nwhat did it mean in terms of American security, and then that analysis \nis transferred to an effective law enforcement agency which could do \nsomething about the threat to American security. That nightmare \nunderscores the importance of having the adequate capacity to analyze \nand convert information into intelligence.\n  To address this problem, the committee has added funds for the \nAssistant Director of the Central Intelligence Agency for Analysis and \nProduction to finance promising new analytical initiatives that will be \nbeneficial across the intelligence community.\n  The amount authorized is a downpayment on a 5-year spending profile \nto rebuild the community's all-source analytical capability. The words \n``all-source'' refer to the fact that today there is a growing volume \nof information which is not clandestine, which is available through the \nnewspapers, through other forms of public information, through the \nInternet. The challenge for the analysts of today is to take that open-\nsource information and add to it the clandestine information gathered \nby our variety of sources and then produce a final intelligence \ndocument which will add to the ability of the ultimate decisionmaker, \nwhether it is a military officer planning a combat action or whether it \nis the President of the United States attempting to set a strategic \ndirection for American foreign policy. That decisionmaker will be in a \nbetter position to make an informed judgment to benefit the people of \nAmerica.\n  The committee has also included funding to implement the National \nImagery and Mapping Agency, known as NIMA, which is the agency that \ncollects imagery for intelligence purposes. We will fund internal \nmodernization plans to support this imagery analysis associated with \nthe future imagery architecture of our satellite system.\n  The fourth and final priority for the intelligence community is \nproviding additional funding for a robust research and development \ninitiative. Over history, one of the hallmarks of American intelligence \nhas been its leadership role in world technology. The U-2, which was \ngroundbreaking in terms of aviation technology, was built\n\n[[Page S11572]]\n\nby the CIA in just a matter of weeks when it was recognized that we \nneeded to have an overhead capacity to observe the Soviet Union, \nparticularly during the period that the Soviet Union was accelerating \nits nuclear program.\n  Many of the telecommunications advances we now utilize and take for \ngranted were first developed by the National Security Agency as part of \nour intelligence effort.\n  Over the decade since the fall of the Berlin Wall, it has been stated \nthat the intelligence community has often used its research and \ndevelopment budget as a bill payer for funding shortfalls in other \nprograms and that we have sacrificed the modernization and the \ninnovation of technology in the process.\n  The committee has outlined a plan to reverse the intelligence \ncommunity's declining investment in advanced research and development. \nThe committee's classified annex includes a requirement for a review of \nseveral emerging technologies to determine what will provide the best \nlong-term return on our investment.\n  The committee also encourages a symbiotic relationship between the \nintelligence community and the private sector using innovative \napproaches, such as the CIA's In-Q-Tel. In-Q-Tel is a venture capital \nfund, largely funded by the U.S. intelligence community, to stimulate \nnew technologies through private sector entrepreneurs. It shows great \npromise.\n  I should also mention that there is a fifth priority we have \nidentified but to which we have not yet given the specific emphasis in \nthis year's legislation as we will in the next. This area is referred \nto as MASINT. It is the newest form of intelligence collection; that \nis, the collection of measurements and signatures intelligence.\n  MASINT encompasses a variety of technical and intelligence \ndisciplines that are particularly important in countering the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery system. \nWhile the committee recognizes the importance of this vital area of \nintelligence, we are awaiting the completion of a community-wide review \nof our MASINT capabilities which was required by the fiscal year 2000 \nintelligence authorization bill. This study will include \nrecommendations for building a robust MASINT capability that will meet \nthe challenges of the 21st century.\n\n  Admiral Wilson, the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, is \nleading this effort and has assured the committee this review will be \ncompleted and forwarded to the Congress in time to be considered as we \nprepare next year's authorization bill. We expect that rebuilding our \nMASINT capability will be a priority item in next year's legislation.\n  I am confident we have outlined a 5-year plan that will rebuild and \nreenergize our intelligence community so that it can meet the \nchallenges before it. The events of September 11 have increased the \ncomplexity as well as the quantity of those challenges to our \nintelligence community. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation and help it move to the President's desk as expeditiously \nas possible so that the resources we are authorizing can get to the \ncommunity which needs them.\n  I conclude by thanking some of those who have helped in the \nproduction of this important legislation. First, as I have indicated, \nmuch of this legislation is built on the foundation of the work that \nhas been done over the past several years by our vice chairman, Senator \nRichard Shelby. He has been a valued partner and a good friend as we \nhave worked through this legislation, as well as some of the other \nchallenges the committee has faced this year. The members of the \ncommittee have played an active and constructive role in the \ndevelopment of this legislation.\n  Our staff director, Al Cumming, our deputy director, Bob Filippone, \nand chief counsel, Vicki Divoll, have led the effort to put this bill \ntogether, as have our budget director, Melvin Dubee, chief clerk, \nKathleen McGhee, and security director, Jim Wolfe.\n  I might say, our security director has been especially challenged in \nthe last few weeks as our offices are in the hot zone of the Hart \nBuilding, and we have been evacuated for the past 3 weeks while still \nmaintaining security over a large volume of very sensitive documents.\n  I also thank Senator Shelby's staff director, Bill Duhnke, for his \nwork and assistance in putting this legislation together. This \ncommittee has had a long history of bipartisanship. We do not have a \nDemocratic staff or Republican staff; we have ``a staff,'' and they \nwork together effectively to serve the Senate and the American people.\n  We have faced some unique challenges this year. The shift of control \nin the Senate was handled professionally and smoothly by our members as \nwell as our staff. I again thank Senator Shelby for his great \ncontribution to that effort.\n  The comprehensive review of the defense and intelligence budgets \ncaused us to receive the administration's budget request later than \nnormal. This required our staff to work through the August recess and \nover the Labor Day weekend to prepare for our September 6 markup.\n  The anthrax contamination in the Hart Building has forced us out of \nour offices for an extended period of time. Again, our staff has met \nthe challenge and continues to fulfill its obligations under these \nchallenging circumstances.\n  I thank Mike DeSilvestro and his staff in the Office of Senate \nSecurity who have handed over some of their space and have shared their \noffices with our committee.\n  I also thank Congressman Porter Goss, the chairman of our House \ncounterpart committee, and his staff who have been equally \naccommodating.\n  I am deeply indebted to all of these individuals and to our entire \ncommittee staff for their dedication, professionalism, and commitment \nto public service.\n  I commend to our colleagues in the Senate the legislation which is \nthe Intelligence Authorization Act for this fiscal year and urge its \nadoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, the world is a very different place than \nit was the last time Congress passed an intelligence authorization \nbill. As we all know, we are now at war, but we are not only at war, we \nare in a particular kind of war: A war against global terrorism in \nwhich the lives of thousands of innocent Americans have already been \nlost.\n  This war has turned some of the conventional wisdom on its head. In \npast wars, intelligence agencies served to support the warfighter. In \nthis war, however, the intelligence agencies are on the front lines all \nover the world.\n  Good intelligence has always been critical in wartime, but the war we \nfight today is an intelligence-driven one to a degree we have never \nseen before. This war has no front lines and the field of combat is \nglobal.\n  Wherever terrorists and their supporters can be found, that is the \nbattlefield. Never before have we demanded or have we needed so much \nfrom our intelligence services. I have been privileged to serve as the \nchairman, and now the vice chairman, of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee. I treasure my relationship with the chairman, Senator \nGraham. He has brought great, steady leadership to the committee. He is \na veteran of the committee. He has been there a long time, we have \nworked together on a lot of initiatives, and we are going to continue \nto do that.\n  Some of what I have learned about our intelligence community over the \nlast 7 years that I have been on the committee is very encouraging. It \nhas many truly outstanding people doing very good work. Today it is \nworking, actually right now, to respond vigorously to the unprecedented \ndemands this war places upon it. But our intelligence community has \nchanged far less rapidly than the world around it. In too many \nimportant ways, it remains structured as it was during the cold war.\n  The U.S. intelligence services were crucial to our victory in the \ncold war, but times have changed and they keep changing.\n  Our intelligence system still remains wedded to the institutional \nfiefdoms and information stovepipes of the past. Our intelligence \ncommunity is still too little of a community and too much of a \nfreewheeling federation that lacks effective, centralized control and \nmanagement.\n  We have a nominal Director of Central Intelligence who has and \napparently is resigned to having little authority over the community he \nis supposed to head. Although the press of\n\n[[Page S11573]]\n\nevents since the September 11 events have prompted our agencies to \ncommunicate and to cooperate with each other much better, we still have \na very long way to go before U.S. intelligence can effectively meet \nthis new challenge.\n  Helping our intelligence community overcome these problems will be a \nchallenge for this Congress and the President in the months and years \nahead. This bill before us today embodies the Senate's continued \nsupport for the intelligence community, authorizing its appropriations \nfor the next fiscal year. It also represents a small first step in what \nwill be our role in driving significant reforms in U.S. intelligence, \nby helping set the stage for improved oversight.\n  This bill, for example, increases Congress's ability to evaluate \nallegations of wrongdoing within the Central Intelligence Agency by \nrequiring the CIA Inspector General to notify the Director of credible \ncomplaints against the agency.\n  Building upon the report our committee recently produced on CIA \nactivities in interdicting illegal drug flights in Peru, the bill \nbefore us also requires special reporting and certifications by the \nPresident for such interdiction operations.\n  Additionally, the bill requires that national counterintelligence \nstrategies and threat reports be approved by the President before being \nsubmitted to the Congress.\n  This bill is not a bill to revolutionize the intelligence community. \nThat effort will take time, but I believe it is now inevitable. This is \na bill to keep the intelligence community on an even keel while it \ntries to respond to the challenges it faces today, and while we work to \nhelp it change in the right ways.\n  I have long been a strong supporter of U.S. intelligence, and I am \npleased that we in the Senate continue to support it with special vigor \nin this time of crisis. We have more to do, however, and Congress will \ncontinue its tradition of assertive oversight. It must. Today, more \nthan ever, we need an intelligence community that is able to overcome \nthe tyranny of its conceptual and institutional stovepipes. We need one \nthat does not merely respond to our present emergency by doing more of \nthe same, just with more money and more people. That will not be \nenough. A bigger and better funded status quo is not good enough. The \nstatus quo has not and will not serve us well in a world of increasing \nand more diverse threats.\n\n  I believe we need management that is able and willing to fight for \nthe intelligence community within the administration and to reach out \nto unconventional thinkers. The time for ``steady as you go'' is over, \nand we need leaders who are not afraid to take on the ossified \nbureaucracies.\n  I believe Chairman Graham and I agree that change must come, and it \nwill. Again, I commend Chairman Graham for his efforts in getting this \nbill to the Senate today and managing it in a professional way. Senator \nGraham's steady leadership of our committee has been instrumental \nduring a turbulent period on Capitol Hill and throughout the Nation. I \nthank him again for his efforts and look forward to continuing our \nclose working relationship.\n  At the end of the debate on this bill, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport it. It will permit our intelligence community to continue its \ncurrent operations while we work to lay the foundations for a more \ncapable intelligence community that can meet the challenges ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  I have not had the opportunity while in the Senate to serve on the \nIntelligence Committee. It is a tremendous honor to serve on that \ncommittee. The things worked on in that committee are extremely \nimportant to our country. They always have been, but even more so the \nlast 2 months. I have great admiration and respect for the bipartisan \nmanner in which the Senator from Florida and the Senator from Alabama \nhave handled this committee, especially during these most difficult \ntimes.\n  I read in this morning's paper there are efforts being made to do \nsome consolidation within the intelligence-gathering community in our \ncountry. As someone not on the inside of what goes on in the \nintelligence community, from the outside it looked like a pretty good \nidea. I think one thing that should be done, and I have spoken both to \nthe chairman and the ranking member of the committee, is this country \nneeds to recognize terrorism is here for awhile. We as a country need \nto recognize there are certain things we need to do to better prepare \nto handle what these evil people are doing. As a first step, we need to \nconsolidate the training of our Nation's first responders as well. I \nbelieve the Nevada Test is the best place to do that.\n  I have spoken, as I said, to the two managers of this bill about this \nideas. I have also spoken to Governor Ridge, the terrorism czar, about \nthis idea. I have spoken to the CIA Director.\n  This Nevada Test Site has played an important part in helping our \nnation win the cold war. As you know, I was born and raised in Nevada. \nAs a little boy, I can remember getting up in my town of Searchlight \nbecause we knew an atomic blast was going to go off. We could see this \nbright orange thing in the sky, and then we could feel the force of \nthat blast. We could not always feel it because sometimes it would \nbounce over us, but generally we could. Those nuclear devices were set \noff in the desert north of Las Vegas at the Nevada Test Site.\n  The Nevada Test Site area is larger than the State of Rhode Island. \nThis area has mountains, valleys, dry lakes. It already has a facility \nfor testing chemicals. It has been there for a number of years. It has \nworked extremely well. You have large dormitories and restaurants \nhandle the first responders who will come to train there.\n  The facility also has a network of tunnels through the mountains. \nThey were developed originally to set off nuclear devices and they can \nnow be used as a place where training could be done. Now they can be \nused to simulate hardened underground bunkers like we saw in Iraq.\n  We need a top gun school for training first responders. There is a \ntremendous facility in Alabama at Fort McClellan, but it is limited as \nto what it can handle. We need a facility that can handle all the \ntraining necessary for first responders. The Nevada Test Site can do \nthat. Already, first responders and special operations training is \noccurring there. The energy and water bill we just completed includes \n$10 million to help expand existing capabilities into a national \nantiterrorism center. There is also money in the Commerce-State-Justice \nbill for this.\n  A National Center for Combating Terrorism will offer all the people \nand organizations combating terrorism and the local first responders to \nthe larger Federal resources a place to come together and train for the \nwars taking place today and in the future. It has it all: Caves, \ntunnels, mountains, valleys. It is very cold in the winter, very hot in \nthe summer. The Nevada Test Site, without question, helped us win the \ncold war.\n  I hope we will look at the Nevada Test Site. I have a parochial \ninterest, no question. It is quite obvious. But I haven't heard anyone \ntell me why this idea is wrong. I think it needs to be done. It is a \nfacility that has tremendous potential.\n  The Nevada Test Site served our nation and helped it win the cold \nwar. It can now help us fight the new wars we face today and will face \ntomorrow.\n  I appreciate the consideration the two managers of this bill have \ngiven me in my conversations with them. I certainly stand ready, as do \nthe contractor and the Department of Energy, to make the facility \navailable for those purposes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I appreciate the remarks our colleague from Nevada, \nSenator Reid, has made regarding the contribution the Nevada Test Site \nhas made to our development of weapons that were so critical to our \nsuccess in the cold war and its potential for serving a role in the new \nwar against terrorism. I appreciate the Senator's interest in \nincreasing our capabilities to\n\n[[Page S11574]]\n\nwage and win this war. I assure him our committee will give full \nattention to this opportunity. I very much appreciate the Senator \nhaving brought this to our attention.\n  As the Senator from Nevada mentioned at the beginning of his remarks, \nthis will be a period of some fundamental questions about the future of \nthe intelligence community and how it can be best organized to deal \nwith the new world in which we will be living, as opposed to the world \nin which it has spent most of its life to date, which was the world of \na single enemy that we knew a lot about and that we had considerable \nexperience in attempting to understand and respond to.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield.\n  Mr. REID. The chairman of this committee, the Senator from Florida, \nhas been Governor of one of the biggest States in the United States. \nThe State of Florida is not only large area-wise but has the fourth or \nfifth largest number of people in America. That gives me confidence \nthat the Senator, who has had to administer an extremely large \ngovernment, understands what is happening with our intelligence \ncapability. Forty different entities are gathering intelligence \ninformation.\n  I have significant confidence in the Senator from Florida being \nchair. Because of the Senator's administrative experience, he is a \ngreat legislator, although being a great legislator does not always \nmean being a good administrator. It is extremely important for me to \nhear his thoughts based on experiences as the Governor of the State of \nFlorida, and learning how to consolidate our intelligence information. \nI appreciate the Senator being willing to take the chairmanship of this \nmost important committee. When the Senator took the chairmanship, he \nhad no idea, as any of us, we would be in this war at this time. I look \nforward to improvements being made basically because of our special \nabilities.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I appreciate those kind remarks. We do have a major \nchallenge to see that the architecture of our intelligence agencies \nencourages innovative thinking, that the Senator's idea which he brings \nforward today will stimulate.\n  I, too, was impressed with the article that appeared in today's \nWashington Post about the recommendations being made to the President \nby a man for whom I have great respect, Gen. Brent Scowcroft, which, as \nreported, will call for a closer collaboration among the intelligence \nagencies. That is something that has long been recommended but \ndifficult to achieve because we are asking agencies that have a piece \nof current intelligence jurisdiction to release their hold.\n  However, if we are to do things as suggested by the Senator from \nNevada, new ways of thinking, of training for a new and continuous \nwar--not only a war being fought over there but a war that is being \nfought right here on the homeland of the United States--we are going to \nneed to have new organizational relationships. Eventually it will be \nthe responsibility of the Congress, since it was the Congress which \ncreated the old architecture, to be the principal architect if we are \nto rebuild our intelligence capabilities to deal with the new \nchallenges we face.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Reid, Senator Shelby, and our \ncolleagues in doing that in the most effective way and to be willing to \nput aside old ideas--not because old necessarily means they are bad \nideas but be willing to challenge those ideas with new thinking to \nprepare to deal with new challenges.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to echo the assistant \nmajority leader's comments about the right man who rises to the top for \nthe times.\n  Just to give an example in addition to the one the Senator from \nNevada has already given about our former Governor having that unique \nexperience because of his experience in State government, he \nunderstands now, uniquely, the vulnerability of the 300 deep-water \nports that we have in this Nation because Florida itself has 14 deep-\nwater ports.\n  We have passed out of our Commerce Committee a port security bill. It \nis coming to the floor, hopefully, very soon. Senator Graham and I and \nSenator Hollings will be offering an amendment to significantly \nincrease the Federal grants for security and loan guarantees to the \ntune of some several hundreds of millions of dollars of grants, and to \nthe tune, over a 5-year period, of some $3.3 billion in loan \nguarantees. To do what? To try to make those ports more secure through \nbadging, through sophisticated detection devices, through fencing, \nthrough guards, through gates, in addition to what the Coast Guard is \nalready doing.\n  It is just another example of the leadership offered by the former \nGovernor of Florida, now our senior Senator from Florida, and the \nchairman of the Intelligence Committee.\n  I wanted to add that one comment to the comments of the Senator from \nNevada about the right man for the time. I would only say: Accolades to \nhis ranking Republican on the committee as well, Senator Shelby, who \nhas been a dear personal friend of mine since we came to Congress \ntogether in 1978. I am confident in the leadership of our Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, obviously I am very touched by those kind \nremarks by my friend, colleague, and fellow Floridian, Senator Nelson.\n  To speak to the broader point he made, using the example of seaport \nsecurity, one of the things we as a nation cannot allow ourselves to \nlapse into is a practice of waiting until one of our infinite number of \nvulnerabilities has actually been attacked before we start the process \nof attempting to make it more secure. We have been attacked in the last \n2 months basically in two areas: The conversion of commercial aircraft \ninto weapons of mass destruction, and the use of the Postal Service to \ndistribute anthrax. We don't know yet what the origin of that second \nattack was. We are now responding.\n  We have passed massive economic assistance to the airline industry. \nWe have now in conference legislation passed by both Houses in the area \nof airline and airport security. We will soon have a major bioterrorism \nbill before us, largely in response to the anthrax issue. Our Postal \nService is now moving at the fastest possible pace to install \ntechnologies to check our mail to see that it is safe.\n  While we are doing that, and that is certainly appropriate, we cannot \nforget all these other vulnerabilities. If you had asked me 5 years ago \nwhat I thought was the more likely to be the target of a terrorist, a \ncommercial airline or a container delivered at an American seaport, I \nwould have said the container. Why would I have said that? Because the \nsecurity standards in our seaports are substantially less rigorous than \nat airports and airlines, even before September 11.\n  Just a few statistics. We have 361 seaports, as Senator Nelson has \noutlined. Into those 361 seaports today and every day are delivered an \naverage of 16,000 containers from noncontiguous nations; that is, not \nfrom Mexico or Canada but from the rest of the noncontiguous world. Of \nthose 16,000, less than 3 percent are subject to close inspection. If a \nterrorist wanted to use one of those containers as a weapon of mass \ndestruction, as 757s were used as weapons of mass destruction on \nSeptember 11, frankly his chances of detection would be minimal.\n  I have gotten some criticism making that same statement, suggesting \nthat I am disclosing some confidential information of which the \nterrorists might rush to take advantage. I am certain the terrorists \nare well aware of those statistics because they have been widely \nreported.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article which appeared in yesterday's New York Times, based on their \nanalysis of one relatively moderate-size port in America, the one at \nPortland, ME, and its vulnerabilities.\n  There being no objection, the article ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                [From The New York Times, Nov. 7, 2001]\n\n    The Seaports--On the Dock, Holes in the Security Net Are Gaping\n\n                         (By Peter T. Kilborn)\n\n       Portland, Me., Nov. 3.--The big cargo ships and ships with \n     truck-size containers pull up to docks where no one inspects \n     their contents. Brown tankers from the Middle East steam into \n     the bay, slide under a drawbridge that bisects the Fore River \n     and tie up\n\n[[Page S11575]]\n\n     by terminals, tanks and a pipeline that carries the oil that \n     heats Montreal.\n       In warmer weather, cruise ships like the QE2 and the Royal \n     Empress with up to 3,000 tourists park at piers on busy \n     Commercial Street, right next to Portland's lively downtown.\n       For Portland's officials, the scene, at least before Sept. \n     11, was a point of pride, the sign of a strong economy and a \n     proud maritime heritage. Now it evokes fear and uncertainty. \n     The unscrutinized containers, the bridge, the oil tanks, the \n     dormant but still-radioactive nuclear power plant 20 miles \n     north of the harbor--all form a volatile mix in a time of \n     terrorism.\n       The usual barrier is chain-link fence. ``It keeps out the \n     honest people,'' said Paul D. Merrill, owner of a cargo \n     terminal. ``That's what it comes down to.'' The Port of \n     Portland, Police Chief Michael Chitwood said, ``is a \n     tinderbox.''\n       Remote as it seems on the northeastern ear of the nation, \n     Portland is not particularly exceptional among the nation's \n     361 seaports. The ports of New York and New Jersey, Miami, \n     Long Beach, Calif., and Los Angeles are much bigger and \n     busier. Yet like most ports, the one here is near a \n     population center and it is packed with bridges, power \n     plants, and combustible and hazardous materials.\n       All that makes ports among the country's greatest points of \n     vulnerability.\n       Even so, no national plan exists to thwart attacks against \n     them, to respond if one happens or to organize a community \n     afterward. No federal agency regulates seaports the way the \n     Federal Aviation Administration manages airports. They are \n     managed locally, often by the private businesses that use \n     them. All are overseen by a patchwork of agencies, already \n     stretched thin, some monitoring hundreds of ships a day.\n       Compared with the attention being given to airline \n     security, security at the ports has gone largely unnoticed, \n     even though they handle 95 percent of the cargo that enters \n     from places other than Canada and Mexico. A bill to tighten \n     port security has passed a Senate committee. The full Senate \n     could vote on the bill within two weeks, but the debate has \n     yet to begin in the House of Representatives.\n       ``People in Congress don't have any idea it's a problem,'' \n     said Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, \n     who is chairman of the Commerce Committee and co-sponsor of \n     the bill with Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida. ``I've \n     got folks who don't have ports in their states. It's hard to \n     get it in front of their heads.''\n       Port officials are aware of various threats, like using a \n     tanker or fuel-loaded cruise liner as a bomb, secreting \n     weapons and explosives in containers, hijacking a ship and \n     ramming it into a nuclear plant on the shores of a river or \n     infesting a cargo of grain or seeds with a biological weapon.\n       Given the potential dangers, the security measures in place \n     are far from adequate.\n       ``We're looking for needles in a haystack,'' said Dean \n     Boyd, a spokesman for the United States Customs Service. \n     ``And the haystack has doubled.'' International trade has \n     doubled since 1995 while the number of people to handle \n     inspections has remained roughly constant, he said.\n       The Coast Guard patrols coasts and harbors but little of \n     the land or the cargo. It checks out ships coming in from the \n     open sea but has no way of thoroughly searching everything \n     that comes by.\n       The Customs Service says it can inspect only 2 percent of \n     the 600,000 cargo containers that enter seaports each a day \n     on more than 500 ships. Of the 2 percent, many are not \n     inspected until they reach their final destination, sometimes \n     on the opposite coast, where they travel unguarded by rail, \n     barge and truck.\n       Last year, a government commission on crime and security at \n     seaports found similar weaknesses. The commission surveyed 12 \n     major ports including those of New York and New Jersey, \n     Miami, Los Angeles, New Orleans and Charleston.\n       While withholding their identities for security reasons, \n     the report found that only three of the ports tightly \n     controlled access from the land and that access from the \n     water was completely unprotected at nine of them.\n       The report also emphasized the hazards posed by materials \n     unloaded from ships. ``The influx of goods through U.S. ports \n     provides a venue for the introduction of a host of \n     transnational threats into the nation's infrastructures,'' \n     the report said.\n       A tangled chain of authority further compromised security, \n     the commission said, a point echoed by the authorities in \n     Portland.\n       ``No one's in charge,'' said Jeffrey W. Monroe, director of \n     transportation for the city. ``There's no central guidance.''\n       And ports have a strong economic incentive to limit \n     control. With the taxes that cruise ships, tankers and other \n     businesses pay, ports are the lifeblood of their communities. \n     Port authorities' principal constituencies are private \n     industry and economic development offices, whose mission is \n     growth, not security. ``They win if they move more cargo,'' \n     Senator Hollings said.\n       In Portland, the seaport has been a boon, generating \n     millions of dollars a year in revenues, Mr. Monroe said that \n     in the past year the bulk cargo business grew 10 percent, \n     passenger traffic and oil imports both rose by 20 percent. \n     But the stalling economy and now the cost of heightened \n     security have wiped out nearly all that the seaport and \n     airport contribute to the city budget.\n       In Congress, the Hollings-Graham legislation would help \n     cities meet some of the cost of securing their ports. It \n     would give the Coast Guard regulatory control over ports, \n     require background checks of waterfront workers and provide \n     for 1,500 new Customs agents.\n       Before the September attacks, the seaport industry's \n     principal lobby, the American Association of Port \n     Authorities, fought the legislation, arguing that it would \n     impose one-size-fits-all security systems for all seaports.\n       Though the group now supports many provisions of the bill, \n     it still has questions over the matter of who controls \n     security. Meanwhile, ports have taken their own steps to \n     improve security. In Florida, Gov. Jeb Bush announced he \n     would deploy the National Guard to oversee four of the \n     state's busiest ports. In California, Gov. Gray Davis \n     tightened security around bridges.\n       In Portland, officials and businesses have taken similar \n     steps. Minutes before the drawbridge opens for a tanker, \n     police officers arrive to monitor both sides of the bridge. \n     Fences are being repaired and installed.\n       At the city's International Marine Terminal, where from May \n     to October the Scotia Prince carries 170,000 passengers on \n     11-hour cruises between Portland and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, \n     visitors used to roam freely around the pier. Now only \n     passengers are allowed there, and then only after they and \n     their baggage are cleared by metal detectors and bomb dogs. \n     The pilings below the pier are now illuminated at night.\n       For its part, the Coast Guard now focuses primarily on \n     harbor security. It requires vessels weighing more than 300 \n     tons to notify the port 96 hours before arrival. The big \n     ships also must fax crew lists, said Lt. Cmdr. Wyman W. \n     Briggs, executive officer of the guard's facilities in \n     Portland. The crews of fishing boats must carry picture ID's.\n       For all this, much tighter seaport security may prove \n     impossible. Seaports cannot be secured like airport, said \n     Brian Nutter, administrator for the Maine Port Authority in \n     Augusta. ``You can't fence off the whole state of Maine,'' \n     Mr. Nutter said.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I think what we need to do is, yes, we need to pass the \nSeaport Protection Act and others. But our mentality needs to be one of \nanticipation and prevention, not one of waiting to be hit and then \nrespond. The adoption of the Seaport Protection Act would be an example \nthat we have not lapsed into a defensive mode but that we are on the \noffensive; that we are preparing to protect the American people before \nthey are subject to attack.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. If the Senator will yield, I only underscore \nthe importance of his comments about the vulnerability of our deep-\nwater seaports which are so often co-located with military facilities. \nAs we look at the Port of Jacksonville, there are major military \nfacilities; Pensacola, the same; Port Canaveral, right adjacent to the \nCape Canaveral Air Force Test Station as well as the Trident submarine \nturning base.\n  As Senator Graham has pointed out, we have a real risk. How do we go \nabout determining what is in the container that might have started at \nSingapore, comes to the Port of Lisbon, is transferred around onto a \ndifferent ship, and ultimately comes into one of our American ports?\n  On the reverse we have had quite a bit of success. Indeed, through a \nmachine called a gamma ray machine which was set up initially to try to \nstop the smuggling and stealing--smuggling of stolen automobiles--the \ngamma ray machine takes an x-ray picture of the container without the \nharmful side effects of radiation from x-rays. You can see exactly what \nis in the container as the truck pulls up between two poles. The \npicture is there. The guard can check that against the manifest of what \nis supposed to be in the truck.\n  Lo and behold, on the east coast of Florida there are some four or \nfive gamma ray machines now set up, and it has virtually stopped all of \nthe smuggling of stolen automobiles going out of those ports.\n  If we can do that on the outbound cargo, clearly we have to figure \nout something for the inbound cargo because the vulnerability is there.\n  I appreciate so much the leadership of my senior Senator from \nFlorida. It is a privilege for me to join with him and Senator Hollings \nto try to enhance this legislation as it comes to the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, if I could just conclude with, again, my \nappreciation for the very generous remarks of my friend and colleague, \nand also to relate what he has just said to the subject that is before \nus, which is the intelligence authorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nFlorida.\n\n[[Page S11576]]\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The fact is, even with the sophisticated technology that \nour now-Presiding Officer just described, there is still a tremendous \nburden on intelligence.\n  I visited some time ago in the course of my interest in seaport \nsecurity what is the largest port in the world at Rotterdam, which uses \na very advanced level of technology. But they can only inspect a \nrelatively small percentage of all the containers that come into that \nport. So they must depend upon intelligence information to allow them \nto identify which of those thousands of containers that are arriving \nevery day at Rotterdam are the ones that are the most suspicious and, \ntherefore, need to have this advanced technology applied.\n  While part of the Sea Port Security Act is going to give, hopefully \nas quickly as possible, to all of our ports significantly better \ntechnology, we are still going to be relying on intelligence to focus \non which of those containers to which that technology would need to be \napplied. The legislation before us is a significant step in increasing \nour capability to provide that intelligence to seaports as well as to \nthousands of other American vulnerabilities.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise to support S. 1428, which is \nthe intelligence authorization bill, and to congratulate particularly \nSenator Bob Graham from the State of Florida for his excellent \nleadership on this whole matter.\n  We all know the work of the Intelligence Committee and the work of \nthe intelligence community, more particularly, is incredibly important \nat all times and, obviously, after September 11, it has become a matter \nof national survival in many respects. So this is an extremely \nimportant bill and a very good one.\n  We rely on the people in the intelligence community in every way. We \noften do not think about it, although we have thought about it more in \nthe last couple of months. They support the U.S. military actions in \nAfghanistan; they work with other countries to track down and arrest \nterrorists and disrupt all kinds of attacks which we may not hear about \nbecause they did not occur; they assist law enforcement agencies with \nthe anthrax investigation; they follow the finances of terrorist \norganizations allowing the Department of the Treasury to freeze assets \nwith accurate and proper information, and they are leading the hunt for \nthe leaders of al-Qaida.\n  The intelligence community has surged its efforts to support this \nwar, but it is also now obviously been called on for enormous amounts \nof new resources just to meet the day-to-day requirements they had \nbefore September 11.\n  We continue to collect and analyze counterproliferation, \ncounternarcotics and international organized crime. We collect \nintelligence regarding our traditional state adversaries, such as North \nKorea and Cuba, and we keep a very close eye on hot spots around the \nworld, obviously including places such as the Middle East.\n  There are four priorities in the bill. They should remain our \npriorities. The first is we revitalize the National Security Agency. \nThat was done.\n  We correct deficiencies in human intelligence. That is being \naddressed.\n  We address the imbalance between collection and analysis. We have \ntalked about that for a long time.\n  We provide sufficient funding for research and development. All of \nthose are addressed.\n  As I indicated, we need the resources not just now, but there will be \nprobably more needs in the future. That is being done through the \nsupplemental appropriations process, as it should be, but I just put \nour colleagues on notice this is going to be a continuing situation.\n  This is my first year on the Intelligence Committee. I have to say I \nam extraordinarily impressed by the diligence of the committee, by the \npeople who are on it, including the Presiding Officer, and the vigor \nand emphasis which they bring to their work. It is a committee that not \na lot of people know a great deal about, but it does very important \nwork.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I thank the Presiding \nOfficer, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator \nGraham's bill authorizing appropriations for intelligence for fiscal \nyear 2002.\n  The Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, on which I serve, and \nwhich Senator Graham chairs, is a unique expression of the vital role \nthe United States plays in the critical field of national security. \nMuch of our proceedings are, by necessity, secret, and our committee's \nbusiness is often conducted behind closed doors. That said, I am proud \nof the fact that in this country the activities of the intelligence \nservices, so important to national security, but potentially so \ndangerous to our precious civil liberties, are authorized by the \npeople's representatives in Congress.\n  The bill before us today is the result of that process. Under the \nable leadership of Chairman Graham and Vice Chairman Shelby, the \nIntelligence Committee has delved deeply into the activities of our \nintelligence agencies, reviewing their operational efforts, their \nresource needs, and the legal and regulatory structure within which \nthey operate. This bill was crafted in the light of that inquiry, and I \nbelieve represents a well-conceived and workable plan to support the \ncritical intelligence needs of our country.\n  Many have said that, after the tragic events of September 11, \n``everything changed.'' That is not completely true, for an effective \nand well-supervised intelligence structure was essential to our \nnational security before September 11, and remains so after the \nattacks. What did change, however, is the sense of urgency, and the \ngeneral understanding of the importance of intelligence, particularly \nin the area of terrorism. This bill addresses those needs, and I am \ncertain will provide a framework which will allow the intelligence \ncommunity to work towards protecting our Nation from those who would do \nit harm, whether rogue nations or sub-national terrorist groups.\n  The bill addresses some of the difficult issues that confronted the \ncommittee during the past year with balance and firmness.\n  It contains language that addresses the specific, and systemic, \nshortcomings which led to the tragedy last spring when a civilian \nairplane was accidentally shot down in the course of a CIA-sponsored \ncounterdrug operation. It accomplishes this by requiring the President \nto certify that appropriate safety procedures are in place, adhered to, \nand that the program, should it continue, is necessary to our national \nsecurity.\n  The bill contains language directing the Department of Justice to \nperform a thorough review of current law concerning the unauthorized \ndisclosure of classified information. This will allow the \nadministration to carefully address the pernicious problem of recurring \nunauthorized disclosures in a measured and thoughtful manner. Should it \nbe necessary for the Congress to revisit this issue, our efforts will \nbe assisted by the results of the Department of Justice review.\n  The bill, and its classified annex, authorizes funding appropriate to \nthe extensive, and often expensive, responsibilities we have asked the \nintelligence community to carry out. There has been much said publicly \nabout the size and scope of our intelligence budget, and there remains \nreasonable arguments on both sides as to whether the intelligence \nbudget should remain classified. However, I want to take this \nopportunity to assure my colleagues, and all Americans, that the \nintelligence budget is not created in a shadowy vacuum, but in a \nprocess that allows the legislative branch meaningful insight into, and \nfinal authority on, the intelligence budget.\n  Finally, I look forward to working with my colleagues on the \ncommittee in performing the necessary follow-on to passage of this \nbill--the vigorous oversight of the operational and analytic efforts \nthat will carry out the authorized direction contained in this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the two reported committee \namendments are agreed to.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2114\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Smith] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2114.\n\n\n[[Page S11577]]\n\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide for new procedures for the removal of alien \n     terrorists and the protection of United States citizens from \n                        international terrorism)\n\n       At the appropriate place in the bill, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. ALIEN TERRORIST REMOVAL ACT OF 2001\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Alien \n     Terrorist Removal Act of 2001''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In 1993, international terrorists targeted and bombed \n     the World Trade Center in New York City.\n       (2) In 1996, Congress enacted the Antiterrorism and \n     Effective Death Penalty Act, which established the Alien \n     Terrorist Removal Court for the purpose of removing alien \n     terrorists from the United States based on classified \n     information.\n       (3) On May 28, 1997, the Court adopted ``Rules for the \n     Alien Terrorist Removal Court of the United States'' which \n     was later amended on January 4, 1999.\n       (4) The Court is comprised of 5 United States District \n     Judges who are designated by the Chief Justice of the United \n     States to hear cases in which the United States seeks the \n     removal of alien terrorists.\n       (5) On September 11, 2001, terrorists hijacked 4 civilian \n     aircraft, crashing 2 of the aircraft into the towers of the \n     World Trade Center in the New York City, and a third into the \n     Pentagon outside Washington, D.C.\n       (6) Thousands of innocent Americans and citizens of other \n     countries were killed or injured as a result of these \n     attacks, including the passengers and crew of the 4 aircraft, \n     workers in the World Trade center and in the Pentagon, rescue \n     worker, and bystanders.\n       (7) These attacks destroyed both towers of the World Trade \n     Center, as well as adjacent buildings, and seriously damaged \n     the Pentagon.\n       (8) These attacks were by fair the deadliest terrorist \n     attacks ever launched against the United States and, by \n     targeting symbols of America, clearly were intended to \n     intimidate our Nation and weaken its resolve.\n       (9) As of September 11, 2001, the United States had not \n     brought any cases before the Alien Terrorist Removal Court.\n       (10) The Court has never been used because the United \n     States is required to submit for judicial approval an \n     unclassified summary of the classified evidence against the \n     alien. If too general, this summary will be disapproved by \n     the Judge. If too specific, this summary will compromise the \n     underlying classified information.\n       (11) The notice provisions of the Alien Terrorist Removal \n     Court should be modified to remove the barrier to the Justice \n     Department's effective use of the Court.\n       (c) Alien Terrorist Removal Hearing.--Section 504(e)(3) of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1534(e)(3)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``(A) Use.--''.\n       (2) by striking ``other than through reference to the \n     summary provided pursuant to this paragraph''; and\n       (3) by striking subparagraphs (B) through (F).\n       (d) Reports to Congress.--Beginning 6 months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, and every 6 months thereafter, the \n     Attorney General shall submit a report to Congress on the \n     utilization of the Alien Terrorist Removal Court for the \n     purposes of removing alien terrorists from the United States \n     through the use of classified information.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, this amendment really has \ntwo very simple provisions. There exists now what is called an Alien \nTerrorist Removal Court which was set up to remove alien terrorists \nfrom our country. The problem is no one is using the court. The reason \nfor that is we are required under the law to submit to the terrorists a \nsummary of the intelligence we gathered on him and how we got it. \nObviously, if the terrorist gets that information, then the people who \nprovided that information are going to be killed or their lives will be \nat risk.\n  My amendment provides that an independent Federal judge would take a \nlook at the information and decide that it could not be shared but that \nthe person should be deported.\n  That is the first provision of my amendment.\n  The second one provides that every 6 months we get a report back from \nJustice on how the terrorist court is working, how often the court is \nbeing used, and so forth.\n  That is really all there is.\n  I want everyone to understand that the amendment is quite simple. We \nare trying to work out an agreement on both sides. So far, that has not \noccurred. In view of the fact that we still have not done that, I am \ngoing to ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there is not a significant second.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, in the way of \nintroduction, I applaud the efforts of our intelligence community to \nfight this war against terrorism. Under very difficult circumstances, \nthey are doing an outstanding job. They have a tough assignment, not \nknowing from one day to the next where a terrorist may strike. We know \nthere is a network of terrorists right now in America. There are a lot \nof brave people in the intelligence community who are working night and \nday to make sure the events of September 11 are never repeated. Of \ncourse, we can't make those guarantees. The best way to have a \nsituation where we can see that it doesn't happen again is to provide \nthe support the intelligence community needs to fight this war against \nterrorism.\n  My amendment under the intelligence authorization bill is a \ntremendous tool in that fight against terrorism and to see to it that \naliens are deported--not U.S. citizens, but aliens who are in this \ncountry participating, if you can believe it, in these networks of \nterrorism. All we are asking for is that they be deported--sent back \nhome.\n  That is what the amendment does. It will remove provisions from the \nAlien Terrorist Removal Court that render the court ineffective and \nuseless.\n  Let me repeat again that today under the Alien Terrorist Removal \nCourt, if we gather information that an alien terrorist may be \ncommitting a crime, or is prepared to commit a crime, or is getting \nready to do some terrorist act against the United States, that \nindividual must have the intelligence summary presented to him, which \ncould and many times does compromise the sources and methods of \ngathering intelligence.\n  My amendment would say that a judge would look at that summary, and \nthat judge would say, yes, this would compromise their sources and \nmethods. So we will deport the alien--not a U.S. citizen--based on the \nrecommendation of the judge.\n  The second provision is that we get a report every 6 months on how \noften this court is being used. That will allow us to track the \neffectiveness of how this court is working. Right now it is not working \nat all. We have a court, and no one is using it because the \nintelligence community simply will not compromise their people, nor \nshould they, nor their sources and methods.\n\n  In 1994, to provide a little history, I sponsored legislation to \ncreate this court. The legislation established specific procedures for \nthe removal of alien terrorists without disclosing sensitive \nintelligence data and also protected those sources and methods. I \ndidn't get anywhere with it in 1994. In 1996, I succeeded in getting a \nversion of this legislation added to the Antiterrorism Act. That bill \nbecame law. The court was established.\n  The intent was to set up a Federal court that specialized in the \nidentification and expulsion of aliens who are terrorists from the \nterritories of the United States. But my idea never became reality. We \ncreated the court, and nobody used the court because of this business \nabout the summary having to be provided under the law. We need to go to \nthe next level beyond the court. We created the court. Now let's allow \nthe court to work and allow the intelligence community to do what it \nhas to do to get these people deported.\n  The Alien Terrorist Removal Court is staffed with judges and is \nempowered to prosecute alien terrorists. As you well know, since that \n1996 law was passed there have been zero prosecutions.\n  It is hard to believe, especially today, that this mechanism to fight \nterrorism has yet to be utilized by the Federal Government to prosecute \neven one alien terrorist. That is the part that frustrates me. It is \nnot a comment against the intelligence community. They are put in the \nposition. They come in, and they say, we have this information that \nthis person or that person is going to do something. They are damned if \nthey do and damned if they don't because if they provide the \ninformation, they compromise their own\n\n[[Page S11578]]\n\nsources and methods. If they don't provide it, we can't deport them. So \nthey stay.\n  I believe there are some aliens we have been able to deport. \nPerhaps--who knows. We will never know--some of the ones who committed \nthat heinous act on September 11.\n  But there are legitimate reasons the court has not prosecuted any \ncases. Some of the reasons are from weakening amendments that were made \nprior to the bill becoming law, which also was disturbing. But I don't \nwant to go back and criticize. Hindsight is cheap, and armchair-Monday-\nmorning quarterbacking is not what I want to do. I don't want to go \nback and complain to any Senator or to any Congressman about weakening \nlegislation. But we are in a different world now. The world has \nchanged. September 11 changed us forever. We need to respond to that \nchange and be willing to take a new look, a fresh look at this.\n\n  I am not casting stones at anybody. If we could all predict the \nfuture, we would probably all be doing something other than what we are \ndoing. So I want to make it very clear, this is not about criticizing \nanybody's position in the past or criticizing the intelligence \ncommunity at all.\n  But the most glaring shortfall of the court is that too many \nprocedural protections are given to the accused alien at the expense of \nthe rest of us. These are not U.S. citizens. I make that clear.\n  I have been informed that the notice requirements and other \nprocedural obstacles that force the Federal Government to disclose \nclassified information just basically renders the court useless. The \ncourt can be a very effective tool in our antiterrorism program, \nincluding everything we have been talking about, not only in this bill \nbut in the other legislation that we just passed in the antiterrorism \nbill. We can make it so much more effective with this kind of support.\n  Case in point: I wrote a letter to Attorney General Ashcroft on \nSeptember 17, which, of course, was right after the terrorist attacks, \nand informed him of this whole issue of the Alien Terrorist Removal \nCourt and what was needed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 17, 2001.\n     Hon. John Ashcroft,\n     Attorney General,\n     Washington, D.C. 20530.\n       Dear John: Please accept my heartfelt appreciation for the \n     hard work that you and the rest of the Department are doing \n     to hunt down the terrorists who have attacked our great \n     nation. It is a sincere comfort to me, as I know it is for \n     other Americans, to know that we have such a capable team in \n     place to lead us through this trying time. My prayers are \n     with you.\n       In 1994, I sponsored legislation to create an Alien \n     Terrorist Removal Court. This legislation established \n     specific procedures for the removal of alien terrorists \n     without disclosing sensitive intelligence data to the \n     terrorist and his organization. In 1996, I succeeded in \n     getting a version of this legislation added to the \n     Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (8 U.S.C. 1531-\n     1537). That bill became law and the court was established. My \n     intent was to set up a Federal court to specialize in the \n     identification and expulsion of alien terrorists from the \n     territory of the United States. Unfortunately, my idea never \n     became a reality.\n       The Alien Terrorist Removal Court is staffed with judges \n     and is empowered to prosecute alien terrorists. As you well \n     know, however, in the years since that 1996 law was passed, \n     there have been zero prosecutions by the court. It is hard to \n     believe, especially today, that this mechanism to fight \n     terrorism has yet to be utilized by the Federal government to \n     prosecute one alien terrorist.\n       There are legitimate reasons why this court has never \n     prosecuted one case--many resulting from weakening amendments \n     that were made prior to the bill becoming law. The most \n     glaring shortfall of the court is that too many rights are \n     given to the accused alien terrorist. I have been informed \n     that the notice requirements and other procedural obstacles \n     that force the Federal government to disclose classified \n     information render this court useless. I believe this Court \n     can be an effective tool in our terrorism program, and I want \n     to work with you to remedy any problems with the law, and \n     begin using the Court to rid our nation of terrorists.\n       I would appreciate your suggestions for improvements that \n     would make this court an effective instrument in the fight \n     against terrorism. Again, John, thank you for all of your \n     exemplary work on this issue and I look forward to working \n     with you.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Bob Smith.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Subsequent to that letter, I had a \nconversation with the Attorney General. The Attorney General is \nsupportive of this provision because it will help them to do their \nwork.\n  Republican Leader Lott and I had a colloquy in this Chamber during a \nrecent debate on antiterrorism. We had a conversation in which he \nagreed with me and supported my provision.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that colloquy be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Congressional Record, Oct. 11, 2001]\n\n\n                     alien terrorist removal court\n\n  Mr. Smith of New Hampshire. Mr. President, it had been my intention \nto offer an amendment which would strengthen provisions in the bill to \ndeal with known terrorist aliens. As Senator Lott well remembers, we \nworked in 1996, created the Alien Terrorist Removal Court, to hear \ncases against aliens who were known terrorist and to allow the Justice \nDepartment to deport these aliens without divulging classified \ninformation to the terrorist organization.\n  Mr. Lott. I know the Senator from New Hampshire has been working a \nlong time on this issue. In fact, when he sponsored this legislation \nback in 1995, I was a cosponsor of his bill. He has been a leader on \nthis issue, he passed his legislation, and the Court was created.\n  Mr. Smith of New Hampshire. That is correct. As the leader knows, \nthere are some changes that are needed to improve the law, which is \nwhat my amendment was going to be about.\n  Mr. Lott. I understand, and I agree that the law needs to be \nstrengthened.\n  Mr. Smith of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I would say to my \ncolleagues, all the tools we are giving to the Justice Department in \nthis bill are irrelevant if we cannot deport these terrorist who are \nliving in our country preparing to terrorize American citizens. Page \n162 of the bill says the Attorney General shall place an alien in \nremoval proceedings within 7 days of catching him, or charge him with a \ncriminal act, or else the bill says ``the Attorney General shall \nrelease the alien.'' Mr. President, the problem is that most of these \nterrorist have not committed criminal acts until they are ready to \nattack. Therefore, in most of these cases, the only option is to deport \nthem.\n  Mr. Lott. It is my opinion, that if we can deport known terrorist, we \nshould do it. We cannot let the Justice Department be barred because \nthe evidence was too sensitive to use in Court.\n  Mr. Smith of New Hampshire. That is exactly the problem. Under \ncurrent law, the Justice Department would have to give a declassified \nsummary of all the secret evidence used in the deportation proceedings \nto the terrorist. Now, why would we compromise our intelligence sources \nand methods by revealing sensitive intelligence information to a known \nterrorist? The intelligence community would never allow it, and with \ngood reason. But as a result, the Justice Department has never once \nused the alien terrorist removal court to deport anyone.\n  Mr. Lott. That is my understanding, and it is a serious problem. I am \nin complete agreement with the Senator.\n  Mr. Smith of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I thank the Leader. As I \nsaid, it had been my intention to offer an amendment to resolve this \nproblem by eliminating the requirement for the Attorney General to give \nthis sensitive information to the alien terrorist before deporting him. \nHowever, upon discussions with the Attorney General, who indicated to \nme that he supports this provision, and after discussions with the \nLeader, I have decided in the interest of moving this legislation to \nwithhold my amendment at this time, with the assurance of the Leader \nand the Administration that we will work to solve this problem in \nconference.\n  Mr. Lott. Let me say to the Senator that he can count me as a \ncosponsor of this amendment. It is an excellent amendment, it is \nneeded, and I commit to the Senator that I will do my best to see that \nit is added in conference. I would further say to the Senator that I \nhave also talked about this issue with\n\n[[Page S11579]]\n\nthe Attorney General, and he indicated to me that the Administration \nsupports your amendment and that he will also work to support it in \nconference when we get to that point. So, I appreciate his withholding \nat this time so we can get this bill to conference where we can work to \nget the Smith amendment added to greatly improve this bill.\n  Mr. Smith of New Hampshire. I thank the Leader for his strong \nsupport, and I am pleased that the administration is also supportive. I \nknow how many long hours the Attorney General is putting in on this \nissue, and how committed he is to winning this war on terrorism. I look \nforward to passing this important provision which will be an invaluable \ntool for the Attorney General and the President in this war.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. This court was created in 1996, as I \nsaid, as part of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. \nSince 1996, the Justice Department has used the court, as I said \nbefore, not once--not even one time--to deport any alien terrorist or \nsuspected alien terrorist. Again, the reason is because they have to \ncompromise their sources and methods to do it. They do not want to do \nthat and I don't blame them. Therefore, the alien stays here, and we \nhave to wait until he commits a crime before we can then arrest him or \ndeport him, whatever the courts chose to do.\n  So, again, this amendment that I am offering strikes the provision of \nexisting law that allows an alien terrorist to get access to a summary \nof classified information.\n  It is interesting because you will hear some critics of my amendment \nsay: A summary is OK. We can take a summary and we can modify it, and \nwe can take out sources and methods. We can do all these necessary \nthings to make this good.\n  I submit to you, in some cases summaries are acceptable. We get them \nall the time. I know that the Senator from Florida, the chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee, gets them. We see summaries. Sometimes you can \ntake a summary and get enough information. Oftentimes, Senators look at \nsummaries of intelligence. We do not see the raw intelligence and that \nis fine.\n  But in this case, it is not fine because, let's say, for example--and \nthis is a totally fictitious example--there is a conversation taking \nplace between four people, and one of those people is a U.S. \nintelligence agent, and the three others are in a terrorist network. If \nwe reference any of that conversation, even in a summary, the others \nare going to know that one of the four is a U.S. agent. If they know \nthat, then a bin Laden might wipe everybody out just to be sure we get \nthe suspect here. So it does risk our intelligence personnel, and we \ncannot afford that.\n  So my intent is to prevent the so-called ``sleeper cell'' of alien \nterrorists from committing an act of terrorism. A ``sleeper cell'' \nmeans they are out there; they have not committed an act yet, but we \nknow who they are. Why not deport them. These are not U.S. citizens. We \nare not taking away their rights. We are taking away their visas. They \nare guests in our country. They have visas.\n  Those terrorists who committed those crimes were guests in our \ncountry, if you can believe that. They were guests. So why can't we \ntake their visas and send them back to some other place where, if they \nwant to commit it wherever they came from, fine, but keep them out of \nhere. That is what we need to do. Let the other countries they came \nfrom take care of them and stop them, but don't let them come in here \nwith their visas and do these kinds of horrible things. That is what I \nam trying to do, get at this sleeper cell, the network out there. \nFrankly, we are spying on them. Of course we are. And it is the right \nthing to do. But they are aliens. We do it with good reason--because we \nhave specific information from our intelligence community.\n  The intelligence community gets this, and they cannot act on it \nbecause to act on it would compromise their own people and their \nmethods of collection. To not act on it means they stay here. So that \nis where we are. That is why not one case has been brought to court \nsince my legislation created it in 1996.\n  Who are these sleeper cells? We have seen a lot of them. These are \nguys that took flying lessons in Florida, who seemed to be reputable \npeople, with families, just going about their business. They could be a \nstudent here on a visa. They could be here on a work visa. And they are \nvery careful; they do not break any laws. They do not want to bring any \nattention to themselves. They do not get speeding tickets or rob banks \nor commit murders. They stay nice and cool and stay out of trouble. \nThey are good. They keep their hands clean. Then they focus on the \nhorrible act of terrorism, as we saw on September 11.\n\n  These are smart people. They know what they are doing. And we have \nsmart people who know how to catch them. But we have to give the \nintelligence community the tools to do that.\n  So how does the Government prosecute an alien who is planning an act \nof terrorism--an alien who has committed no criminal act, nor has that \nalien violated his or her visa? How do we get them? Again, with the \nAlien Terrorist Removal Court. They have good Federal judges. Our court \nhas one judge. If somebody wants to make that two or three judges, I do \nnot object to that. I trust that the Federal judge can look at that \nintelligence and say: Whoops, wait a minute, we cannot provide that. We \nhave to get this guy out of Dodge, get him out of here.\n  These sleeper cells are law-abiding. That is the interesting part. \nThey are law-abiding. I want to make sure they are not given access to \nany classified information at that hearing which is going to cause them \nto take the lives of those who have provided that information or \nsomehow compromise the methods of collection.\n  I also want to make sure they do not get to do the terrible things \nthat they are planning to do, as they did on September 11.\n  So my amendment provides for reports to Congress on the Justice \nDepartment's utilization of the court. If we can put a provision in \nthere that says--I want my chairman to understand this because I know \nhe may have a concern or two--if we can say to the court, report back \nto Congress and let us know how you are utilizing the court, if it is \nabused, we are going to know that. If we do not think the alien got the \nright decision from the judge, we are going to hear about that.\n  We are going to be able to monitor this every 6 months. If we can \ntrust Federal judges to enforce our Federal laws in our country, we \nought to be able to trust them to look at a piece of intelligence and \ndecide whether somebody should be removed or not without sharing that \nintelligence. So I am hopeful we can get this done.\n  Let me address the issue of due process because this always comes up. \nI have been criticized for being somebody who wants to take the civil \nliberties from every American. I am not trying to take anybody's \nrights. I am trying to take their visas before they take our lives. Is \nthere anything wrong with that?\n  Let me repeat that because it is very important. I am not taking away \nanybody's due process. I am not taking away their rights. I am taking \ntheir visas. They are guests in our country. They have been law-abiding \npeople who have not committed a crime but are plotting one--as we saw \non September 11, a big crime, a massive crime, a horrible, detestable \nact against innocent Americans.\n  If we had a court--and we don't know that we would have gotten those \npeople--that had the ability, maybe we would have broken up that \nnetwork. I am not saying we would have or could have, but we might \nhave. That is really the issue: Are there any more plans such as this? \nWho can we monitor? How many people are out there who we are watching \nright now that we would like to deport but cannot deport without \ncompromising those methods?\n\n  I think this passes constitutional muster. There will be some who \nwill differ. That is the beauty of the Senate. We have people who \ndiffer on everything. It is like two lawyers. They won't agree on \neverything. They always find something to disagree about. I respect \nthat, but I believe it passes constitutional muster. I believe others \ndo as well and who have said so.\n  Remember, we are talking about a civil and not a criminal matter. We \nare talking about aliens who have no constitutional right to a quasi-\ncriminal\n\n[[Page S11580]]\n\nproceeding to remove that alien if that alien is involved in terrorism. \nThat is important to understand. We are not talking about U.S. \ncitizens. That is another issue. That is another venue, another court, \nanother methodology. That does not apply. Both the fifth and fourteenth \namendments prohibit Government actions which would deprive ``any person \nof life, liberty or property without due process of law.'' The Alien \nTerrorist Removal Court has the necessary procedural safeguards to \nprotect an alien terrorist's due process rights.\n  If life, liberty, or property is at stake, the individual has a right \nto a fair procedure. Again, this is not about his life. This is not \nabout his liberty. This is not about his property. It is about his \nvisa.\n  The interesting irony is that--and I hesitate to use the term ``law-\nabiding citizens''--but these horrible people who did these things on \nSeptember 11, at the time, were law-abiding citizens. They were very \ncareful to keep their noses clean in America until they did what they \ndid. That is why we must deport them when we know they are involved in \nplanning, plotting, thinking about plotting, or are involved in \nmeetings that are plotting, or whatever, terrorist acts.\n  So this court has the necessary procedural safeguards to protect an \nalien's due process. And I am very confident about that.\n  Liberty is freedom of action by physically restraining an \nindividual--deporting or imprisoning--or a denial of a right with \nspecial constitutional protection, such as freedom of speech.\n  From the case Mathews v. Eldridge, 1976, there is a procedural due \nprocess test. There are three factors: No. 1, private interest; No. 2, \nrisk of deprivation of interest; and, No. 3, Government's interest.\n  The Government's interest in these cases is our interest. The \nGovernment has an interest in deporting terrorists who may commit these \ncrimes because the Government's interest is to protects us. That is \nwhat we have a Government for, to protect us, and they cannot because \nthey cannot use the tool that we have given them, which is the court. \nThey cannot use it because they have to compromise their sources and \nmethods to do it.\n  So the Alien Terrorist Removal Court does provide these protections. \nAn alien terrorist gets the evidentiary hearing before a Federal judge. \nEven though he is an alien, he gets an evidentiary hearing. This \nhearing is afforded to the alien terrorist, and the judge is allowed to \nsee all classified information--the judge, not the terrorist. This is \nunder my amendment. But the way it is now, the terrorist gets to see \nthe classified information. Can you believe that? That is true. But \nthey do not see it because the intelligence community does not give it \nto them. Therefore, the terrorist stays in America, and we wait for the \nacts to be committed.\n  The Federal judge, not the alien terrorist, has access to view all \nthe classified information, and he or she can make a determination on \nthe merits of the Government's claim. The Government's interest in not \ndisclosing highly classified and sensitive information is outweighed by \nthe alien terrorist's right to see the evidence. Think about that. Let \nme repeat that: Under current law, the Government's interest in not \ndisclosing highly classified and sensitive information is outweighed by \nthe alien terrorist's right to see the evidence. That shouldn't be. It \nshould be the other way around. The Government's interest should \noutweigh the terrorist's interest. It is the people's interest, not \njust the Government. It is the interest of 260 million American people.\n  When one balances the interest of the alien terrorist versus the \ninterest of the Government to prevent the disclosure of sources and \nmethods to terrorist cells, such as al-Qaeda, and to prevent the \nkilling of human resources by these terrorist organizations, that is \nwhen this should kick in. It is the rights of the terrorist versus the \nrights of the Government and the people. Sometimes they clash. In the \ncase of a person committing or persons wanting to commit a terrorist \nact, they have clashed. It is more important that we protect the \ninformation and err on the side of caution, that we don't cost more \nlives. That is what my amendment is about.\n  I have an article which I ask unanimous consent to print in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From U.S. News, Oct. 1, 2001]\n\n                     Finger-pointing, Fingerprints\n\n\nThe hunt for evidence and, hard on its heels, charges about who screwed \n                                   up\n\n                (By Edward T. Pound and Chitra Ragavan)\n\n       In the spring of 1996, Congress gave law enforcement \n     officials a new and seemingly important tool to combat \n     terrorism. It created the Alien Terrorist Removal Court, \n     assigning the special federal court the task of deporting \n     terrorists operating on American soil. After the World Trade \n     Center bombing in 1993, and the growing suspicion that foot \n     soldiers for Osama bin Laden were slipping into the United \n     States, the establishment of the court seemed an eminently \n     sensible thing to do.\n       But terrorists had nothing to worry about--because the \n     court is a court in name only. In the five years since its \n     creation, U.S. News has learned, the five-judge panel has \n     never deported a single terrorist. For that matter, it has \n     never even heard a case. The Justice Department, the agency \n     principally responsible for monitoring terrorists' movements \n     within the United States, has never filed an application with \n     the court seeking to deport a terrorist.\n       Former Justice Department officials say the agency couldn't \n     use the court because the law requires disclosure of \n     sensitive information to terrorists--evidence, they say, that \n     would compromise intelligence gathering and identify sources. \n     But critics say the government's refusal to bring suspected \n     terrorists before the special court is a glaring example of \n     its inability to use its vast counterterrorism resources \n     effectively. In the past few years, Congress has authorized \n     billions of dollars for new equipment and for thousands of \n     personnel in law enforcement and intelligence agencies. This \n     year alone Congress authorized $10 billion before the \n     attacks for counterterrorism efforts.\n       American law enforcement and intelligence agencies have \n     scored several big wins against terrorists, jailing some and \n     foiling the plots of others, Michael Cherkasky, a former New \n     York state prosecutor who investigated terrorist activities, \n     says federal agents have known for years that suicide bombers \n     had changed their habits, living seemingly normal lives here, \n     but says agents failed to understand the terrorists' deadly \n     intentions.\n       Cherkasky cites the evidence introduced in a recent \n     terrorist trial in New York--a training manual from bin \n     Laden's al Qaeda terrorist network. ``The al Qaeda manual \n     says you have to act nonreligious,'' Cherkasky explains, \n     ``shave your beards, fit in as middle class.''\n       But it wasn't just behavior, it was targets that went \n     undetected. The government was caught flat-footed in several \n     major terrorist attacks, current and former intelligence \n     official say. Among them; the bombing of the USS Cole last \n     year, the bombings of the two East African embassies in 1998, \n     and the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and \n     the Pentagon. A review of the government's efforts against \n     international terrorism shows that they have been hobbled by \n     bungled investigations and poor intelligence analysis--or, in \n     some cases, no analysis at all of critical documents \n     accumulated by investigators.\n       That disturbs several former senior Justice Department and \n     FBI officials who were actively involved in counterterrorism \n     investigations during their careers. They believe that U.S. \n     intelligence agencies may have had sufficient information to \n     prevent the deadly attacks on the World Trade Center and the \n     Pentagon--if only they had understood what they had. John \n     Martin, the former top national security prosecutor for the \n     Justice Department, says the government eventually will get \n     to the bottom of why intelligence and law enforcement \n     agencies did not prevent the attack. And, he thinks, they \n     will conclude that government agencies ``were collecting the \n     intelligence, they were deciphering it, but they were sending \n     it to the field late and in muddled, ambiguous terms.'' Jamie \n     Gorelick, the No. 2 Justice Department official in President \n     Clinton's first term, sounds a similar theme. ``We have a \n     very robust intelligence collection effort,'' she says. ``But \n     we don't have a commensurate analytical capability. I am \n     certain that when we are able to digest what we have \n     collected, we will find information which surely could have \n     or might have prevented'' the attacks.\n       Red alert. That may be, and there's growing evidence that \n     Washington should have been better prepared. There were \n     warning signs, say former counterterrorism officials. Court \n     files show that operatives linked to bin Laden or other \n     militants have been planning for some time to make the United \n     States their primary theater of operations. Now the FBI is \n     finding that its failure to analyze the intelligence amassed \n     during earlier investigations is slowing its efforts to \n     locate conspirators or associates of the hijackers.\n       With many leads not producing much, U.S. law enforcement \n     agencies are looking overseas for help. One big break came \n     late last week when an Algerian pilot named Lotfi Raissi, 27, \n     was arrested in London for allegedly lying on his application \n     for a pilot's license in the United States. British \n     authorities say they have linked him to four of the\n\n[[Page S11581]]\n\n     hijackers. A prosecutor told a London court that Raissi's \n     job was to ensure that the hijackers were ``capable and \n     trained.''\n       The United States has the most sophisticated intelligence \n     collection capability in the world, but it appears to have \n     failed utterly in this instance. The supersecret National \n     Security Agency intercepts phone calls and messages thousands \n     of miles from its sprawling complex in suburban Maryland near \n     Washington. Yet there has been no indication from U.S. \n     officials that the NSA intercepted any information on the \n     alleged hijackers who were operating in its shadow, just a \n     few miles away, in the days before the attacks.\n       When the dust settles, Congress undoubtedly will examine \n     what U.S. intelligence and law enforcement agencies knew \n     before the hijackers produced their carnage. The Bush \n     administration says it had no advance warning that the \n     attacks would take place. But it is clear that the FBI and \n     Justice Department had developed information on some of the \n     hijackers before the attacks--just how much isn't known, and \n     the government isn't saying.\n       Three former top intelligence officials say it is clear \n     that some of the hijackers and possible associates were on \n     FBI watch lists prior to the September 11 attacks. There \n     seems to be little doubt of that. On August 23, the CIA sent \n     the FBI the names of two suspected terrorists, Khalid \n     Almihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi. But the bureau was unable to \n     apprehend them before they helped hijack the airliner that \n     crashed into the Pentagon. FBI officials did not respond to \n     several requests for interviews.\n       Officials say the CIA and FBI now are rushing to improve \n     their intelligence capabilities. One intelligence source says \n     the CIA is bringing back retirees to fill the massive demand \n     for qualified help. Meanwhile, the FBI has put out the word \n     that it badly needs people who can translate Arabic, Farsi, \n     and Pashto. ``They are scouting everywhere for translators,'' \n     says a law enforcement involved in the government's massive \n     manhunt. One reason: In the past, the bureau hasn't had \n     sufficient personnel to translate and interpret critical \n     documents, or vast amounts of intelligence, that could have \n     shed light on terrorist plots. In some ways, the FBI must \n     shoulder the blame. The bureau has very few Arab-American \n     agents and translators, and funds intended for hiring \n     translators were diverted to hiring more agents to fight \n     street crime, several former Justice Department officials \n     say. ``The language problem is prodigious,'' says the \n     intelligence source, ``at both the CIA and the FBI.''\n       That's true, too, at other intelligence agencies in the \n     Defense Department, including the NSA. In a report issued \n     last week, the House Intelligence Committee said American spy \n     agencies ``have all admitted they do not have the language \n     talents . . . to fully and effectively accomplish their \n     missions.''\n       Surveillance. Apart from the language needs, Attorney \n     General John Ashcroft now wants Congress--in addition to the \n     $20 billion more in counterterrorism funding it has committed \n     since the attacks--to give law enforcement even more powers \n     to wiretap immigrants and monitor their activities in the \n     United States. At the same time, some lawmakers are pushing \n     the government to use the Washington-based Alien Terrorist \n     Removal Court, composed of sitting judges, to help rid the \n     country of suspected terrorists. Sen. Bob Smith, a \n     Republican from New Hampshire, is spearheading that \n     effort.\n       Under the current law, a suspected terrorist brought before \n     the court must be given an unclassified summary of the \n     deportation charges. Smith plans to introduce a provision \n     this week that would allow the government to use classified \n     information in the court proceeding without sharing any \n     information with the suspect. The proposal is likely to spark \n     a hot debate in Congress, where some members deplore the use \n     of secret evidence and have been trying to outlaw the \n     practice. Smith couldn't care less. ``We need to bring these \n     terrorists to court and deport them,'' he says. Smith \n     persuaded Congress to approve the creation of the court in \n     April 1996. But its powers were weakened, he adds, by \n     amendments requiring suspected terrorists to be given a \n     summary of the charges against them. As a result, the Justice \n     Department never used the court, fearing that disclosure of \n     intelligence would expose sources. Current officials would \n     not comment for this story.\n       Civil libertarians say the department has found it easier \n     to deport or imprison suspected terrorists through other \n     administrative immigration proceedings. Secret evidence, \n     which is anathema to Arab-Americans and civil rights \n     activists, can be used in those proceedings when the \n     government seeks to deport aliens on other grounds, such as \n     ``garden variety'' immigration violations, says a former top \n     immigration official. In the terrorist court, suspects would \n     have more safeguards--the right to counsel and the option to \n     challenge the constitutionality of the secret evidence, says \n     Timothy Edgar, a top lawyer for the American Civil Liberties \n     Union. No such rights are available in immigration court \n     proceedings, he says. Given the choice, he says, the \n     terrorist court is the least distasteful.\n       Immigration officials say that secret evidence is seldom \n     used, perhaps only 10 to 12 times a year out of 300,000 cases \n     in the immigration courts. Steven R. Valentine, a former \n     Justice Department official who oversaw the Office of \n     Immigration Litigation, says the government must deport or \n     detain terrorist suspects--especially in light of the recent \n     tragic attacks. In the past, he says, because of legal \n     challenges, the Justice Department has been unable to deport \n     known terrorists. ``That,'' he adds, ``is insane.''\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. This was written by Ed Pound and Chitra \nRagavan. It is a U.S. News article of a few weeks back.\n  In the article, which is entitled ``Finger-pointing, fingerprints,'' \nMr. Pound goes into a lot of detail and history about the fact that the \ncourt has not been used. I hope my colleagues will read it. It is a \ngood history and a summation.\n  It is pretty simple. This provides that the court we now have created \nto remove alien terrorists can be used. That is what I am hoping.\n  I ask again for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, could the request be restated?\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I asked for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator asked for the yeas and nays on his \namendment. Is there a sufficient second?\n  At the moment, there is not a sufficient second.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nI be allowed to speak for about 5 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Nelson of Florida are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I have listened closely to some aspects \nof this debate, especially the amendment presently pending, raised by \nmy distinguished colleague from my neighboring State of New Hampshire.\n  I had the honor of serving for 8 years on the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, where I was vice chairman. I have enormous regard for the \ncurrent chairman and vice chairman of the committee. I have also served \nas both ranking member and chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n  As I listened to the debate, something sounded familiar. Indeed, this \namendment was raised during the debate in preparation of the \nantiterrorism bill that the Congress passed and the President signed \nlast month. There was no enthusiasm for it from Republicans or \nDemocrats. We looked at it, the White House looked at it, and the \nJustice Department looked at it. None of us were interested in \nincluding it in what became the USA Patriot Act.\n  The idea of having a quasi-secret court, and making only limited \nevidence available to the defendant, as is true under existing law, is \nconstitutionally questionable enough. But to say that we will not tell \nthe defendant any of the evidence against him in the court, as Senator \nSmith proposes, is the kind of thing we rail against when other \ncountries do it. Our government officials have gone all the way to the \nhead of state level to register complaints when Americans have been \nheld in other countries without being informed of the charges against \nthem. Every President I have known has been forced at one time or \nanother to raise such issues with another head of state. We should not \nmake this task more difficult by approving of the amendment Senator \nSmith has offered here.\n\n  Let us look at a little bit of history. The Alien Terrorist Removal \nCourt was created in 1996. It was done largely through the efforts of \nSenators Hatch and Dole. It exists to provide a way for the Government \nto remove terrorist aliens whom it believes it cannot attempt to remove \nthrough public hearings, to balance the Government's need\n\n[[Page S11582]]\n\nto maintain its existing intelligence sources while giving some rights \nto the accused.\n  Under the law as it presently exists, the accused does not see the \nactual evidence against him but does receive an unclassified summary of \nthat evidence. The law states very clearly that that unclassified \nsummary has to be ``sufficient to enable the alien to prepare a \ndefense.''\n  Under the amendment that Senator Smith has presented, an alien \naccused of being a terrorist would receive no information about the \nbasis of the charges against him, not even the limited summary provided \nin existing law.\n  If we were to pass something of this nature, there is no way the \nPresident of the United States or the Secretary of State or the \nAttorney General could go to any other country holding an American on \nundisclosed evidence and demand to see that evidence. That nation could \nsimply say that it is doing what the United States, the country seen as \nthe bulwark of freedom, is doing, the United States that has had a \nwritten Constitution that has survived for all these years. The U.S. \nConstitution, as written and interpreted over the last two centuries, \nmakes it clear that the government cannot bring somebody into a court \nand say: ``We have all this information against you, but we are not \ngoing to tell you what it is. Are you guilty of what we have against \nyou? I am not going to tell you what it is we have against you, but I \nwant to know, are you guilty or not? And, if you are not guilty, then \ndefend yourself against these charges we have brought. Sorry, you can't \nsee the charges. Sorry, you can't hear the evidence. Sorry, we can't \nlet you know what is going on. But we will give you a chance to defend \nyourself.''\n  It doesn't quite work that way. Anybody in this body who has been \neither a prosecutor or defense attorney, on either side, would not want \nthat.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer knows as well as any Senator here \nthe terrible nature of September 11. Her State was impacted in a \nhorrible way, as were the surrounding States of New Jersey and \nConnecticut, just as the State of Virginia has been horribly harmed by \nthe attack on the Pentagon. Nobody has stated the horror, the anger, \nand the feelings left in the wake of the September 11 attacks in a more \narticulate way than the distinguished Presiding Officer. We all share \nthose feelings. But nobody here has ever suggested that we somehow \nabandon all our laws, all our rules, our Constitution and everything we \nstand for, the very democracy that got the terrorists to attack us. In \neffect, we would say, ``We surrender.''\n  The Senator from New York, the Senator from Vermont, the Senator from \nFlorida, all 100 of us--none of us is about to surrender. We understand \nthere is a problem with terrorism. I suspect throughout my lifetime we \nwill face threats. But let's answer the threats in the ways that \ncomport with what our constitutional history and our history as a \nnation.\n\n  The Alien Terrorist Removal Court has not been used, but that is not \nbecause an unclassified summary has to be provided to the defendant. \nThe Justice Department talked to us about why the court is not being \nused, and did not mention this. When the Department was given the \nopportunity to consider this amendment at the time of the terrorism \nbill, it did not want it. I suspect that this lack of interest is \nrelated to concerns within the Justice Department about constitutional \nchallenges to the court itself, as it is formulated under existing law. \nSurely the Justice Department knows that if we approve this amendment \nthose constitutional challenges will basically be irrefutable.\n  We provide substantial new powers to the Justice Department with \nregard to terrorist aliens through the antiterrorism legislation we \njust passed, legislation I voted for, the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Florida voted for, his colleague, the other Senator from Florida \nvoted for; the distinguished Presiding Officer voted for it--98 of us \nvoted for it. That legislation should make it easier for the Justice \nDepartment to use this court.\n  But as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I could never support \nthis amendment, which has already been rejected once by the \nadministration and by Republicans and Democrats who negotiated the \nantiterrorism bill. I certainly could not accept it absent any showing \nof why it is needed.\n  I say to my friend from Florida, the distinguished chairman, that I \nhave no problem calling upon the administration to notify the Judiciary \nCommittee if it really believes a change in the law is needed. The \nadministration did not believe this a couple of weeks ago. But if the \nAttorney General now believes he needs something such as this, I will \nbe glad to hold hearings on the issue and bring his concerns forward. \nBut to do something of such constitutional magnitude in an amendment on \nthe floor, without any hearings in the Judiciary Committee or \nIntelligence Committee, is simply inappropriate.\n  Madam President, we need to go back to basic constitutional law 101 \nhere. The idea of giving the government the ability to bring removal \nproceedings against someone and force him to defend himself without \ntelling him of the evidence against him flies in the face of all of our \nprinciples.\n  We must not tell the rest of the world that the only way we can \ndefend ourselves is to accuse somebody but not tell him what the \nevidence is against him. Back in the 1700s, we fought a revolution to \nensure a much different principle. All of us share the terror of what \nhappened. All of us are opposed to terrorists. All of us want to defend \nthe United States. But we must not let our enthusiasm to defend our \nNation lead us to do things that will hurt us further.\n\n  Frankly, I would be delighted to have the Attorney General take a \nlook at Senator Smith's amendment and see what he thinks. But I tell my \nfriend from Florida that I certainly do not support this amendment, \nbecause the constitutional questions raised are of such enormous \nmagnitude. To do so without any request from the administration and \nwithout any hearings would not be a responsible action for this body to \ntake.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, it is our hope that we will develop a \nsecond-degree amendment to this amendment which essentially would ask \nthe Attorney General to review this legislation that has been part of \nour statute since 1996, which the Senator from New Hampshire has stated \nhas not been effective, and to give us his assessment as to the \neffectiveness of this legislation, if he believes that changes are \nneeded. They might be changes in the law. They might be changes in the \nresources that are devoted to carrying out this law or for any other \nimpediments.\n  I note, as has the Senator from Vermont, that in the antiterrorism \nact which was just signed last Friday of October by President Bush, \nthere are changes in the underlying definition of what constitutes an \nalien terrorist and an alien terrorist activity. Those changes have \nbeen stated to potentially have an effect on the efficacy of this 1996 \nact. That would be another subject on which we would ask the Attorney \nGeneral's opinion.\n  We are today taking up a very major change in our law without the \nkind of prudent, thoughtful consideration for which the Senate is \nestablished to provide. I believe this process of requesting a review \nand then making the judgment based on the response to that request as \nto whether legislative, appropriations, or other activity is called for \nwould be consistent with the history of this body.\n  Speaking of history, I point out that one of the first controversies \nwhich politically helped to establish that we would have a two-party \nsystem was called the Alien and Sedition Acts which was enacted in the \nlate 1790s. I refer to the biography of John Adams. He was the \nPresident when the Alien and Sedition Acts was passed by the Congress. \nHe had not supported the Alien and Sedition Acts, but he signed it into \nlaw as our second President and paid a very heavy price, including his \ndefeat when he ran for reelection in 1800 with this being one of the \nmajor issues used against his reelection.\n\n  This is an issue of how to treat aliens in this country, which has a \nvery long political history. It is an issue about Americans, whether \nthey are citizens or any of the variety of categories that come under \nthe generic term ``alien.'' They might be defined as a permanent \nresident who has been in the country for decades, as well as a refugee \nwho just recently arrived seeking protection against political \npersecution in\n\n[[Page S11583]]\n\ntheir home country. That whole wide range of people come under the \ngeneric term of ``alien.'' How aliens should be treated has a long \nhistory in this country.\n  We are now participating in a debate on the most current topic of \nthat. When it is available, I believe that our second-degree amendment, \nwhich will call for a temperate, thoughtful review of this by the \nhighest legal officer in our executive branch, would be an appropriate \nmanner for those of us who are privileged to serve in the Senate to \nproceed to determine whether, and if so, what changes in this law or \nthe circumstances that surround this law, we should undertake.\n  Awaiting the completion of the drafting of that amendment, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2115 to Amendment No. 2114\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nfor its immediate consideration.\n  The amendment is in the nature of a second-degree amendment to the \namendment of the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham), for himself and Mr. \n     Shelby, proposes an amendment numbere 2115 to amendment No. \n     2114.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the word ``sec'' and insert the following:\n       Section 504 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 \n     U.S.C. 1534) is amended by adding the following subsection \n     after subsection (K):\n       ``(L) No later than 3 months from the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the Attorney General shall submit a report to \n     Congress concerning the effect and efficacy of Alien \n     Terrorist Removal proceedings, including the reasons why \n     proceedings pursuant to this section have not been used by \n     the Attorney General in the past and the effect on the use of \n     these proceedings after the enactment of the U.S.A. PATRIOT \n     Act of 2001.''\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, as I indicated in my preliminary \nremarks, this amendment calls upon the Attorney General, within 3 \nmonths of the enactment of this legislation, to report to the Congress \non the 1996 Alien Act--that is the act that provides the procedure that \nthe Senator from New Hampshire has outlined for the deportation of \naliens--and within that report to indicate what recommendations the \nAttorney General would make to the Congress relative to any changes in \nthe law.\n  It draws particular attention to the fact that we have just enacted a \nmajor antiterrorism act, which contains modifications of the definition \nof ``alien terrorists'' which have in the past been cited as a reason \nwhy this 1996 statute has not been utilized.\n  I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and the vice chairman of \nthe committee, Senator Shelby, and ask for its immediate consideration. \nThe Senator from New Hampshire has remarks he would like to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Madam President, I thank the chairman for \nhis cooperation. I will not take more than a minute or two and will not \nask for any recorded vote.\n  I also thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for making a \ncommitment to me that we can have a hearing on this, if the Attorney \nGeneral chooses to come and talk about the issue after the report comes \nback.\n  To summarize, the amendment I offered dealt with this terrorist \nremoval court which is not being used because of the fact that it would \ncompromise intelligence if we did use it.\n  I had hoped we could pass it to change that court, but given the fact \nthat there is some information coming in on different views as to who \nbelieves what way about this and the issue as to how this court would \nor should work, I am prepared to and will accept the second-degree \nlanguage offered by the Senator from Florida.\n  I hope we can get this done. It is a 3-month report. I am a little \nconcerned about the length of time, but realizing it takes time to do a \nreport, I am also worried about the fact that something else could \nhappen. Given the circumstances, it is good that we now have the \nattention of not only the Senate and the Congress but also the Justice \nDepartment, and I hope we can hear from the intelligence community as \nwell on this issue, which we will do in the hearings when we have them.\n  I thank my colleagues for their cooperation and look forward to \npassage of the amendment and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 2115.\n  The amendment (No. 2115) was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask now for a vote on the underlying \nSmith amendment, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the Smith \namendment No. 2114, as amended.\n  The amendment (No. 2114), as amended, was agreed to.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote on the \nSmith amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2116\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I am not aware of any other amendments \nto be offered to the bill. I have a managers' amendment I offer at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Florida (Mr. Graham) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2116.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Insert at the appropriate place in the bill:\n       The DCI shall provide, prior to conference, any technical \n     modifications to existing legal authorities needed to \n     facilitate Intelligence Community counterterrorism efforts.\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, the purpose of this amendment, which has \nbeen suggested by Senator Kyl, is to assure that if, in light of the \nrapidly changing world in which we are living, there are other \nproposals that need to be considered during the course of the \nconference, the conference committee will have the liberty to do so. I \nurge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 2116) was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Graham has mentioned there are no further \namendments to the bill. I ask that the bill be read a third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 2883, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2883) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2002 for intelligence and intelligence-related \n     activities of the United States Government, the Community \n     Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency \n     Retirement and Disability System, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all after the \nenacting clause of H.R. 2883 is stricken, the text of the Senate bill \nS. 1428, as amended, is inserted in lieu thereof, and the bill is \ndeemed read the third time.\n  Mr. REID. I know the House bill has been read a third time. I ask for \nthe yeas and nays on H.R. 2883, as amended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I further ask unanimous consent that the vote on passage of \nthe\n\n[[Page S11584]]\n\nbill occur at 2 p.m. today, with rule XII, paragraph 4, being waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, as we are locked in this \ndeadlock with the House of Representatives over the question of airport \npassenger screening security, basically the deadlock is the Senate has \npassed a bill 100-0 that would provide for federalizing the screening \nprocess of passengers; that is, attaches to the Justice Department that \nthese would be Federal employees who have specific training in law \nenforcement so we can heighten the feeling of confidence of the \nAmerican flying public that they will be safe when they get in an \nairliner to take their travel.\n  Why is this important? It is obvious the airline industry is one of \nthe important economic components of our national economic engine, and \nas long as people are scared to get into a plane and fly, then we are \nnot going to rev up that economic engine and get it functioning on all \ncylinders as is so necessary.\n  There are parts of this country that are certainly more affected than \nothers by the diminution of airline travel. Clearly, the city of New \nYork, the State of the Presiding Officer, is drastically affected; \nclearly, cities in my State, such as Miami, or Orlando, the No. 1 \ntourist destination in the world. I have talked to the owners of \nhotels--not the business hotels; the business hotels are doing OK, not \ngood but OK--and the tourist-oriented hotels now have an occupancy rate \nin the range of 40 to 45 percent.\n  I talked to the owner of one hotel with 800 rooms; they shut down 600 \nrooms. It does not take a rocket scientist to recognize with that \ndiminished revenue they will not be able to pay mortgage payments, \ntaxes. They have already laid off a significant portion of their staff.\n  We understand what happens as the ripples run through the economy. \nWhat do we do? We want to give a feeling of confidence, of safety, to \nthe American flying public. What better way to do that than for the \npublic to know, when they go through that passenger screening process, \nin fact, if there are people trying to do dastardly things to them by \nsneaking through implements of destruction, they will get caught.\n  The fact is, recently they have not been caught. We heard this rather \nastounding story a couple of days ago about in the Chicago area a \nperson had two knives, got on the plane, and had in their carryon \nluggage other implements of destruction. This is several weeks now, \nafter September 11.\n  We read the story last week about the fellow sitting on the airplane, \nin flight, horrified to suddenly realize someone had given him a pistol \nas a present, and he forgot it was in his carry-on luggage. He had the \npresence of mind to call over the flight attendant in the midst of the \nflight to say what happened. The fact is, airline passenger security \nhad failed again.\n\n  Does this engender confidence in the American flying public? Of \ncourse, it doesn't. We are undercutting the very thing we need to be \ndoing for those desperately needing the airlines back in robust \nbusiness again--the hotel operators, the service personnel, the gift \nstores in the hotels, the restaurants, the tourist destinations, and \nthe multiplicity of industries and businesses, both large and small, \nthat spawn from this wonderful, robust transportation network we have \nhad in the skies.\n  Why am I saying this? It took 4 weeks in the Senate to pass this bill \nbecause people in this Chamber were filibustering it because they \nwanted that passenger security screening operation to continue as it \nis, privately contracted out. That is not going to cut it. Yet we were \nheld up 4 weeks. By the time it got around to the final passage, there \nwas no Senator who was going to vote against it. It was 100-0 in this \nChamber. Now we are at loggerheads with the House of Representatives, \nwhich by a very narrow margin of one or two votes passed a highly \npartisan bill that says it is still going to be contracted out. They \nsay: Don't worry; we will federally oversee the contracting. But if the \nwhole Nation's economy hinges on getting the public to believe it is \nsafe to get back into an airliner and fly, are we not wasting precious \nminutes every day we are at loggerheads with the House of \nRepresentatives? We have a 100-0 vote here; they have virtually a split \nvote of 215 each. Why not look at what is best for the country?\n  How many more newspaper stories do we have to read, as we have in the \nlast couple of days, about the stun guns, the knives, and the box \ncutters getting through security. How much more do we have to read \nbefore it convinces us and convinces the body at the other end of this \nUnited States Capitol that it is time to put aside their philosophical \npositions, their partisan positions, and pass something into law so we \ncan restore the confidence of the American people.\n  I share these thoughts after considering this very important \nintelligence legislation, all of which is very necessary to the \nsecurity of this country, as is the airline security bill important to \nthe security of this country, both economically and as we take on the \nterrorists.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Edwards). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Mr. President, I do not think there is any question \nabout the condition of this country. We are clearly a nation at war. As \nwe look at the instability, the uncertainty of regions of the world, \nregions where many of the nations that want to destroy Israel and the \nU.S. reside, the reality is these particular areas of the world are \nones on which we are growing more dependent all the time.\n  It is no secret to the occupant of the chair that we are now 57 \npercent dependent on imported oil. However, during the 1970s, we were \nabout 34 percent dependent on oil. Some remember the inconvenience of \nthe gas lines around the block. This was at a time of conflict in the \nMideast, the Yom Kippur War. Americans were outraged. They were \nindignant. How could it possibly happen in our Nation that we should be \nso inconvenienced?\n  So there we were, in the 1970s, 33 percent dependent; today we 57 \npercent dependent, and the Department of Energy indicates by the year \n2010 we are going to be somewhere in the area of 66 percent dependent.\n  We are, in my opinion, held hostage by the same interests that seek \nto destroy and uproot Israel. Through our energy policies of \ndependence, we have\n\n[[Page S11585]]\n\ntipped the scales and given tremendous power to extremists in the \nMideast. We are only making Iran, Iraq, and Libya, perhaps, stronger. \nIs that our wish?\n  What happens if the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia fails? There is almost a \nparallel occurring in that country between what happened in Iran 30 \nyears ago with the fall of the Shah. When it occurred, the Shah was one \nof America's greatest allies. What happened was his regime came down as \na consequence of corruption, a concentration of too much wealth in too \nfew hands. That situation is very much evident in Saudi Arabia today.\n  I might add, if we look to bin Laden followers, a number of them have \ncome from Saudi Arabia. As we examine the background of those \nresponsible for the aircraft that went into the Pentagon and the Trade \nCenters, we find they have connections. Some are actually from Saudi \nArabia.\n  Now, I am not condemning Saudi Arabia by any means. I am simply \ndrawing a comparison. As our dependence on imported oil increases, we \nfocus more on Saudi Arabia because that is where the significant supply \nof petroleum in the world exists. We are becoming more vulnerable as \ntheir regime becomes more unstable.\n  Furthermore, we are importing a million barrels of oil a day from \nIraq. Now, what is the uniqueness of Iraq? We happen to enforce a no-\nfly zone over Iraq. We are putting our men's and women's lives at stake \nto ensure that Iraq stays within the constraints of the U.N. sanctions. \nYet we know they have moved beyond those constraints, that they are \nselling oil outside the U.N. oversight, illegally in that sense.\n  So here we are, we are taking their oil and we are enforcing a no-fly \nzone over Iraq. We put the oil in our aircraft and then we go and \nenforce that no-fly zone by taking out some of their targets. We almost \nhad one of our intercepter aircraft shot down a few weeks ago. What \ndoes Saddam Hussein do with the money? He pays his Republican Guards to \nkeep him alive and develops missile capability with biological warheads \naimed at our ally, Israel.\n\n  Is this part of our foreign policy or is it because we have no other \nchoice than to depend on Iraq for a certain amount of our imported oil? \nI am not suggesting we might funnel some of the money for terrorist \nattacks to keep Saddam Hussein in charge, but one has to wonder what \nhis future holds. We must address this dependence with a new sense of \nurgency, a new sense of purpose. To ensure our energy security, we must \nput in place solutions that begin and end at home. In my opinion, the \nsooner the better.\n  There are tremendous resources and ingenuity in this country. Our \nbalanced, bipartisan energy plan puts them to work. It adjusts fuel \neconomy standards; encourages conservation, provides incentives for the \ndevelopment of advanced newer, cleaner alternative fuels, and \nencourages the use of our own energy supplies.\n  I know the occupant of the chair would be disappointed if I didn't \nbring up the issue of ANWR and what kind of a contribution this can \nmake. Clearly, we can open this area safely, effectively, and quickly. \nWhat does it hold? Somewhere between 5.6 and 16 billion barrels--enough \noil to replace what we would import from Saudi Arabia in a 30-year \nperiod of time. All the economic benefits are there. When I say \n``employment,'' perhaps 200,000 jobs.\n  There is the potential of revenue to the Federal Government from \nlease sales amounting to about $2.6 billion. This is a stimulus. It \nwould not cost the Federal Government one red cent.\n  Our President has said energy is one of our two key components to a \nstrong stimulus package necessary to get this economy growing again, \nsomewhat like the old Lee Iacocca ad. If you can find a better economic \nstimulus that adds jobs to our economy, billions to our gross national \nproduct, and will not cost the taxpayer one red cent, go buy it.\n  The problem is reluctance in this body. The House has done its job \nand passed H.R. 4. The Democratic leader has not seen fit to bring this \nbill or schedule this bill before this body. Apparently, there is no \nindication from him as to his intentions. It appears he shut the door \non the Energy Committee actions. I happen to be ranking member. We have \nnot had markup on any bill or any action, with the exception of \nreporting out a nomination or two, for well over a month. The \nDemocratic leader has basically shut down the Energy Committee and the \nprocess associated with the authorization which is the duty of the \nauthorizing committees.\n  Evidently, the writing of the bill is underway, independently, with \nvery little input, if any, from the other side. Republican interests \nwill not be heard. We cannot share with our Democratic colleagues our \ninput.\n  The President has said the Senate must act. As I indicated, the House \nhas done its job. It is certainly not in the national interest to treat \nthis issue for what it is, a critical component of national security. \nOur Achilles' heel in this war is our dependence on foreign oil. Bin \nLaden knows it; Saddam Hussein knows it. But the United States does not \nseem to know it is, to our immense discredit. How could we not know? \nDidn't we recognize on September 11 the significance that much of the \nterrorist activity is funded by oil? If we do not recognize it soon, \nGod help us.\n  In my few remaining minutes I want to enlighten my colleagues on the \nsignificance of what has occurred over an extended period of time \nrelative to public opinion on this matter. We have heard from our \nPresident on four occasions, specifically saying this country must have \nan energy plan that encourages conservation and encourages exploration.\n  He says: I want the Congress to know there is more to helping our \neconomy grow than tax relief. One of the major components is an energy \nplan.\n  He goes on to say on another occasion when the bill has passed the \nHouse of Representatives: They have done their job. He wants the Senate \nto do its job.\n  On October 17, he asked Congress to act on an energy bill the House \nof Representatives passed in August. On October 14, there are two other \naspects to a good, strong stimulus package. One is an energy bill. \nOctober 31, our Nation needs an energy plan.\n  I don't know who is listening around here. I am certainly listening. \nIt is unfortunate that the Democratic leader evidently is not listening \nto the President. I don't understand this political momentum. Why can't \nwe do as the House and have an open discussion on the merits of this \nenergy bill as proposed? Where is the energy bill? We introduced a bill \nin February, about 304 pages. The only thing on which anybody seemed to \nwant to focus was the two or three pages of ANWR, opening up this area.\n  This has become a cash cow for the extreme environmental community. \nMake no mistake; they are milking it for all it is worth. It is an \nissue that is thousands of miles away from the American people. It is \nan issue filled with emotion. They say the polar bear is endangered, \nbut they will not say you cannot take the polar bear--they are marine \nmammals--from the United States, and that includes from my State of \nAlaska. They are protected. You can go to Canada and take them for \ntrophies, or go to Russia, but you cannot in the United States.\n  They say somehow the Gwich' in people, in their dependence on the \ncaribou, are somehow in jeopardy. I will read for the Record from the \nPatroleum News: ``Gwich' in, Ensign link up in new McKenzie Delta \nDrilling Company,'' September 30:\n\n       A new Native-controlled oil and gas drilling company has \n     been formed to provide oilfield services in a land claims \n     area of the Mackenzie Delta that is is seen as a likely route \n     for any Mackenzie Valley pipeline.\n       Gwich'in Oilfield Services, 51 percent owned by Gwich'in \n     Development Corp. of Inuvik, Northwest Territories, and 49 \n     percent by Calgary-based Ensign Drilling, is expecting to \n     start operations this winter.\n       The Gwich'in settlement area covers 22,242 square miles and \n     is governed by the Gwich'in Tribal Council.\n       Gwich'in Development Corp., wholly owned by the tribal \n     council, has a mission to build an investment portfolio that \n     offers business opportunities, employment and training to \n     Gwich'in residents.\n       Tom Connors, chief executive officer of the corporation, \n     said Sept. 10 that the deal with Ensign gives the community a \n     chance to participate in the development of oil and gas \n     resources.\n       Ensign president Selby Porter said his company's experience \n     and equipment make it the right choice to work with the \n     Gwich'in people.\n       The development of a local work force and infrastructure is \n     key to the continued development of oil and gas resources of \n     the Arctic region of Canada,'' he said.\n\n[[Page S11586]]\n\n       Formation of the new company was announced Sept. 6.\n\n  About 80 percent of the Gwich'in people live in Canada. Why is it OK \nfor the Gwich'in people in Canada to go ahead and develop their land \nand somehow the Gwich'ins who live in Alaska and are funded by the \nSierra Club and various other environmental groups in opposition are \nopposed? Obviously, there is some skulduggery associated with this.\n  The other issue is relative to the base of support. We have seen the \nPresident's statements in favor of opening ANWR. Secretary of Interior \nGale Norton, Secretary of Energy Spencer Abraham, Secretary of Labor \nChao, and Secretary of Veterans Affairs Principi have all spoken at \nmore than one event. Yet we have had press conferences with the \nAmerican Legion, all the veterans organizations, including the Veterans \nof Foreign Wars. The AMVETS, Catholic War Veterans, and Vietnam \nveterans have all spoken in favor. It is interesting to hear their \npoint of view. It is enlightening. They say they have fought wars on \nforeign soil. They have fought wars over oil in the Persian Gulf \nconflict where, obviously, we stopped Saddam Hussein from going into \nKuwait, and his objective was to go into Saudi Arabia and take over the \noil.\n  I am reminded of remarks made in this Chamber by Senator Mark \nHatfield from Oregon. He indicated on more than one occasion he would \nvote for opening up ANWR any day rather than send other American men \nand women over on foreign soil to fight a war over oil.\n\n  This is the theme of America's veterans. They say the national \nsecurity of this Nation is at risk because of our increased dependence \non oil. What can we do about it? What we can do about it is increase \ndomestic production. We are not going to relieve our dependence \ntotally, but we will reduce it substantially.\n  The intent of the Senate, if it votes to authorize the opening of \nthis area, is to send a message to the Mideast that we mean business \nabout reducing our dependence. You are going to see a change in the \nOPEC structure, where they are going to be more sensitive to the \nsignificance of what the United States states when we say we are going \nto reduce our dependence on imports.\n  I suggest they are going to increase production. When they increase \nproduction, what does that mean? It means the price goes down. We know, \nas a consequence of terrorist activities, people are not flying, we do \nnot have the same utilization of gasoline, and we have a temporary \ndecline in price. But that is only temporary because what we saw OPEC \ndo the other day was cut production another 1.5 million barrels. They \nknow we are addicted to their oil. As a consequence, they are playing \nit for all it is worth.\n  As to organized labor, we have the Teamsters, maritime unions, \nseafarers unions, operating engineers, plumbers, pipefitters, \ncarpenters and joiners--I could go on with this list--because this is a \njobs issue.\n  Mr. President, as you know very well, we have a very soft economy. We \nare in a recession. This is a jobs issue--several hundred thousand jobs \nin every State.\n  What are we going to do? We are going to build more ships. We will \nbuild them in U.S. yards because those ships that move Alaskan oil, \nunder law, have to be U.S. flagged vessels, built in U.S. yards with \nU.S. crews. This is shipbuilding, gulf shipbuilding and west coast. It \nis a big jobs issue.\n  As we debate the stimulus package, I challenge any Member of this \nbody to tell me a better stimulus than opening up ANWR. Why do I say \nthat? Because it is a jobs issue. It is going to create a couple of \nhundred thousand jobs. It is going to create about $2.6 billion in \nFederal lease sales when the Federal Government puts up those leases. \nWhere will that go? Into the Treasury. It will help offset some of the \ncosts associated with security and terrorism activities. And it is not \ngoing to cost the taxpayer one red cent. You tell me anything else in \nthat stimulus package that fits that category. There isn't any. That is \nwhy organized labor is for it.\n  We have senior citizens; 60-Plus held a press conference the day \nbefore yesterday. The Hispanic community, the Latin-American Management \nAssociation and Latino coalition, the United States-Mexico Chamber of \nCommerce, they had a press conference this morning. American business \ngroups: The National Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, National Black Chamber of Commerce, U.S. Pan Asian Chamber of \nCommerce, the American Women's Economic Development, the Alliance For \nEnergy--it goes on and on and on.\n  Why is that message not coming through to this body? I can only \nassume there are several Members on the other side who do not want to \nvote on this issue. Why don't they want to vote on the issue? Perhaps \nthey made commitments to extreme environmental groups. I don't know.\n\n  In any event, we are here at a stage where we are late in the \nsession. The House has taken on its responsibility totally, passing \nH.R. 4. We have implored the Democratic leader to bring this matter up, \nlet us vote on it, let us debate it, and let us offer amendments. We do \nnot even get an answer.\n  I am putting this body on notice. If we do not get an answer from the \nDemocratic leader--this is not a threat, this is a reality--we will put \nthis on the stimulus bill and we will vote on it. I want everybody to \nunderstand there is going to be a vote on this floor, on this issue, on \nan energy bill that will contain ANWR, before we get out of here.\n  Some Members have threatened a filibuster. I cannot understand--while \nit is everybody's right to do as they see fit--why anybody would \nconsider filibustering an issue as important as this, in the national \nsecurity interests of our Nation. I don't think we have ever had that, \ntraditionally, in this body. We should address this issue on its \nmerits, not proceed to activities associated with the threat of a \nfilibuster.\n  I encourage Members to reflect a little bit about just what the folks \nback home will read into that kind of a vote. They will read the \nfilibuster has been on a procedural motion, not on the merits of the \nissue. They will read it is in defiance of the veterans who have spoken \ntime and time again, in defiance of the position of organized labor, in \ndefiance of the position of our President.\n  I don't know whether there is an effort to ensure the President does \nnot win on this issue. Is that what we are talking about? I hope that \nis not the case.\n  But to have this matter ignored, to have this matter taken away from \nthe committee of jurisdiction by the Democratic leader at least \nwarrants an explanation, and we cannot seem to get an explanation. The \nDemocratic leader is a good friend of mine. We have had some \nconversations. He has been very responsive to hearing me out. But now \nit is time we had an opportunity to hear him out because he has simply \nignored this. I want to tell the Democratic leader the pressure is \ngoing to become more intense. There is no reason this issue should not \nbe addressed in an expeditious manner.\n  I noted in the Boston Herald an article. I ask unanimous consent it \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Boston Herald, Nov. 6, 2001]\n\n                        Energy a Security Issue\n\n       President Bush urged Congress to get an energy bill on his \n     desk before it adjourns for the year, making the case that a \n     sound energy policy is vital to national security.\n       Speaking to business leaders recently, the president \n     observed, ``It's in our national interest that we develop \n     more energy supplies at home.'' And Interior Secretary Gale \n     Norton added, ``Every day the United States imports 700,000 \n     barrels of oil from Saddam Hussein.''\n       The House has passed an energy bill which would allow \n     drilling in portions of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife \n     Refuge. But Senate Democrats have promised the environmental \n     lobby that they will block ANWR development, and \n     Massachusetts Sen. John Kerry has threatened to lead a \n     filibuster.\n       That made little sense before Sept. 11, and even less since \n     then. In the past 30 years, America has become dangerously \n     dependent on foreign oil. It's estimated ANWR contains \n     between 5.7 billion and 16 billion barrels of oil. Roughly 11 \n     billion barrels would be the equivalent of 20 years of \n     imports from Saudi Arabia. And only a miniscule part of \n     ANWR's 19 million acres would be used.\n       America will never again be energy self-sufficient. But \n     every barrel this nation doesn't have to import from the \n     Middle East enhances national security. Planes and tanks \n     don't run on recycled environmentalist cliches.\n\n\n[[Page S11587]]\n\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. The article it supports the opening of ANWR and \nsuggests if there wasn't a reason before September 11, there is \ncertainly an even better reason afterward. It mentioned Senator Kerry, \nwho is opposed to this legislation. It indicates in general terms it \nshould be supported because it is in the national interests of the \ncountry.\n  Lest there be any mistaken innuendoes, saying we don't need, really, \nto open up the ANWR area because there are other areas, that we can \nlook to our friends in Canada--let's just reflect on what Prime \nMinister Jean Chretien said on November 6. He took a swing at the \nUnited States in an interesting way, over soft wood policies. He told \nthe House of Commons:\n\n       If the Americans want free trade in oil and natural gas, \n     they should also have free trade in lumber.\n\n  He further says:\n\n       If they were not to have oil and gas from Canada, then they \n     will need wood to heat their homes.\n\n  This is the Prime Minister saying, in effect, don't just rely on an \nunlimited supply of resources from Canada, there has to be two-way \ntrade.\n  I will close by outlining the significance of the economic stimulus \nassociated with this single issue. The Department of Labor \nMassachusetts Survey indicates jobs, direct, 250,000; the Wharton \nEconometrics Institute at the University of Pennsylvania lists the \ntotal employment, indirect, at 735,000 jobs associated with the \ndevelopment of ANWR; jobs in 50 States, 80,000 in California, 48,000 in \nNew York.\n  We do not make valves. We do not make pipe or welding rod. These \nthings are all going to be made in the United States. Labor is going to \ncome up. We are looking at 200,000 jobs at a minimum, direct.\n  Federal benefits of opening up ANWR will add up to $3.2 billion. That \nis another estimate, in lease sales to the Federal Treasury, and if the \noil is produced we are talking about billions more in royalties. It is \nestimated that ANWR oil has a potential value upwards of $300 billion. \nThat is from the Energy Information Administration. That is $300 \nbillion we do not have to spend overseas. That is $300 billion that \nwill travel through the economy, being taxed here in America. As I \nindicated, the Jones Act mandates the oil move in U.S.-flag vessels.\n  Nineteen new supertankers will be needed at a cost of about $200 \nmillion. What will that do for American shipbuilding? Construction \nalone will generate 5,000 new jobs in American shipbuilding during the \nnext 10 to 15 years.\n  Finally, each day we write a $12 million check to the Iraqi \nGovernment for their oil. That is more than $4.4 billion a year. I \nthink it is time to put that money in our backyard instead of in the \nbackyard and into pocket indirectly of Bin Laden.\n  I thank the Chair for his attention.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/08/senate-section/article/S11587-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11587]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DISASTER VICTIMS RELIEF FUNDS\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, one of the greatest comforts to me \npersonally in the terrible aftermath of September 11 has been the \nimmediate and overwhelming generosity of the American people in \nproviding relief to the thousands who have been directly and indirectly \naffected. Our first priority must be to ensure that the victims and the \nfamilies of the victims of the September 11 attack receive the \nfinancial relief they have been promised.\n  There is a tremendous amount of work going on in New York to ensure \nthat families get their assistance. Many families have expressed their \ngratitude to me, to my staff, to FEMA, to the city, and the centralized \nsupport that was established at Pier 94. The fund that the mayor \ncreated to aid families, the Twin Towers Fund, has announced that it \nwill get aid to families prior to Thanksgiving.\n  I am particularly grateful to the attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, \nwho has led in trying to eliminate the bureaucratic redtape that can \ndelay or prevent families from receiving the help they need in a timely \nmanner. Working with the attorney general as he tries to create \ncentralized databases of charitable organizations and families in need \nof services, I have joined him in calling for all charities to \nestablish a uniform application that will help achieve the goal of \nsimplifying the process of applying for necessary assistance.\n  I am sure many in this Chamber have seen the reports or perhaps seen \non television some of the victims' family members who have been \noverwhelmed trying to work their way through the myriad of services \navailable and who have to spend hours going from one place to the next \nuntil they could get some kind of answer, who say that not only have \nthey be victimized but they have been made to feel like beggars. That \nis just unacceptable.\n  Like so many New Yorkers, we are concerned about those families who \nmay not have the time to go stand in line and fill out endless \napplication forms, who may not have the experience to permit them to \nnavigate this maze, who do not have the stamina, and who, frankly, are \nsill suffering.\n  I have met and talked with a number of people who lost loved ones, \nparticularly widows who are having a very difficult time being able to \ndo what is required to take care of their children and go about their \ndaily business. They need help going through this charitable and \ngovernmental process.\n  Recently, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, called \nto my attention the work he is doing in Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is advised that we are under an \norder to vote at this time.\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Then we should vote, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/08/senate-section/article/S11587-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11587-S11590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2002--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

WOOTEN TO BE U.S. DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n                       DISTRICT OF SOUTH CAROLINA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session to consider the nomination of Terry Wooten \nto be U.S. District Judge, that the Senate vote immediately on his \nconfirmation, that the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action, and the Senate return to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nthe nomination of Terry Wooten to be a judge on the District Court for \nthe District of South Carolina. I was pleased to recommend him to \nPresident Bush for this esteemed position.\n  Just hours ago, Judge Wooten was favorably reported to the floor by \nthe Judiciary Committee in an 19-0 vote. The Committee's unanimous vote \nand the Senate's speed in considering him today is a testament to his \nqualifications, character, and ability.\n  Judge Wooten has spent almost all of his professional life in public \nservice. He has served ably and diligently as a U.S. Magistrate Judge \nsince 1999. Prior to that, he worked as a federal prosecutor for seven \nyears. In the U.S. Attorney's office, he served as the lead Task Force \nattorney for major drug and violent crime prosecutions.\n  Morever, he was the Republican chief counsel on the Judiciary \nCommittee while I was Ranking Member, and did an exceptional job in \nthat capacity.\n  It is unfortunate that some allegations were raised during the \ncommittee's consideration of his nomination. However, once the \ninvestigation of this matter was complete, it was clear that there was \nno merit to them whatsoever.\n  During the Judiciary executive business meeting earlier today, \nChairman Leahy and Senator Biden, who was chairman of the committee at \nthe time Judge Wooten was a staff member, both spoke favorably of his \nnomination. I appreciated their remarks. I was also very pleased that \nall members of the committee supported his candidacy.\n  Judge Wooten is a man of honesty and integrity, and this process has \nsimply reaffirmed that fact. I am confident that he will make an \nexcellent addition to the District Court.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate my fellow \nSouth Carolinian, Terry Wooten, who will be confirmed today to the U.S. \nDistrict Court for South Carolina.\n  Terry Wooten graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of South \nCarolina in 1976 where he continued on to law school. Following law \nschool, he worked in a private two-man firm that focused on criminal \ndefense and personal injury cases. Two years later, he served as \nAssistant Solicitor for Richland County where he handled hundreds of \ncases including murders, criminal sexual conduct, robberies, drug \noffenses, burglaries, and many other local offenses for 4 years. As a \nresult of his notable service as a local prosecutor, Senator Thurmond \ninvited him to move to Washington and work as the chief counsel of the \nU.S. Senate Judiciary Committee minority staff for 5 years. He then \nserved with distinction as Assistant U.S. Attorney for South Carolina \nfor 7 years. In this challenging position, he was assigned to the major \ndrug and violent crime section. Judge Wooten excelled in this role and \nalso served as the chief liaison between the relevant Federal agencies \nand the U.S. Attorney's office on drug and violent crime cases in the \nstate. He is well known and respected by all local law enforcement \nagencies for his hard work with violent crime and drug offenders. In \n1999, this humble, yet very capable man was chosen to be a magistrate \njudge where he did a marvelous job.\n  Terry Wooten comes to the U.S. District Court for the District of \nSouth Carolina judgeship with extensive experience as a State \nprosecutor in Richland County, as the Assistant U.S. Attorney, and as a \nMagistrate Judge. He was chosen for the position of Magistrate Judge by \nthe judges of the Federal District Court for the District of South \nCarolina. I can think of no better testament to his character and \nqualifications and am pleased he will be joining their ranks. He will \nserve our judicial system well.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I congratulate the nominee and his family \non his nomination and on what is soon to be his confirmation by the \nSenate and appointment by the President to the United States District \nCourt for South Carolina. I thank all members of the Judiciary \nCommittee for their attention to this nomination and thank the majority \nleader for his help in scheduling this vote.\n  Since July 2001, when the Senate was allowed to reorganize and the \ncommittee membership was set, we have maintained a strong effort to \nconsider judicial and executive nominees. With the confirmation of \nJudge Wooten, we reach additional milestones. Judge Wooten is the 17th \njudicial nominee we have confirmed since July. That is more total \njudges this year than were confirmed in 1989, the first year of the \nfirst Bush administration, and as many as were confirmed in all of the \n1996 session. Of course, in 1996, the Senate majority at that time did \nnot proceed on a single nominee to a Court of Appeals and limited \nitself to confirming only 17 judges to the District Courts. We have \nthis year already confirmed four nominees to the Courts of Appeals.\n  Thus, despite all the upheavals we have experienced this year with \nthe shifts in chairmanship and, more importantly, the need to focus our \nattention on responsible action in the fight against international \nterrorism, we have matched or beaten the number of confirmations of \njudges during the first year of first Bush administration and the last \nyear of the first Clinton term.\n  As a judge on the United States District Court, Judge Wooten will \nhave a vital role to play in protecting and preserving our civil \nliberties in the days ahead. Our system of checks and balances requires \nthat the judicial branch review the acts of the political branches.\n  Judge Wooten served as the Republican Chief Counsel of the Judiciary \nCommittee when he worked for Senator Thurmond. Senator Thurmond has \nbeen an advocate for this nominee from the beginning. Earlier today the \nJudiciary Committee considered the Wooten nomination and voted without \nobjection to report it to the Senate. Our bipartisanship in these \nmatters was amply demonstrated by our moving as soon as possible in the \nwake of a serious allegation of wrongdoing to consider and report a \nformer Republican staff member for the respected senior Republican in \nthe Senate.\n  I held an expeditious hearing for Judge Wooten on August 27, during \nthe\n\n[[Page S11591]]\n\nAugust recess of the Senate. On the morning of the hearing, we received \nserious allegations about him. These allegations raised questions about \nwhether he had provided confidential materials to people outside the \ncommittee and the Senate with regard to the Clarence Thomas nomination. \nI asked Judge Wooten questions about the allegations and his actions, \nand he answered my questions.\n  Senator Hatch and I agreed that the best course of action would be to \nask the FBI to investigate this situation fully. We had been awaiting \nthe results of that investigation until just recently. Once members of \nthe Judiciary Committee had a chance to review the FBI materials and \nall other materials surrounding this nomination, we brought it to a \nvote.\n  I believe that the allegations raised against Judge Wooten were \nserious and were worthy of inquiry. It appears to me from materials \npublished in the aftermath of the confirmation battle that confidential \ncommittee materials were made available, contrary to our rules, to some \noutside the committee and the Senate. Having asked Judge Wooten about \nhis involvement and having received his denials, I cannot say that \nthere is a strong evidentiary basis on which to challenge his \ncredibility or his denials with regard to his involvement in such \nmatters.\n  I have taken Judge Wooten at his word and voted to report his \nnomination. This afternoon I will vote in favor of this \nnomination. This week we held our ninth hearing on judicial nominations \nsince I became chairman, when the Senate was allowed to reorganize and \nthis committee was assigned its membership on July 10, 2001. We held \nour fifth hearing on judicial nominations since September 11. Overall \nwe have held hearings on 28 judicial nominees, including seven to the \nCourts of Appeals. Since September 11 we have held hearings on 21 \njudicial nominees, including four to the Courts of Appeals.\n\n  Within 2 days of the terrible events of September 11, I chaired a \nconfirmation hearing for the two judicial nominees who drove to \nWashington while interstate air travel was still disrupted. Then on \nOctober 4, 2001 we held another confirmation hearing for five judicial \nnominees, which included a nominee from Nebraska who was unable to \nattend the earlier hearing because of the disruption in air travel.\n  On October 18, 2001, in spite of the closure of Senate office \nbuildings in the wake of the receipt of a letter containing anthrax \nspores and Senate staff and employees were testing positive for anthrax \nexposure, the committee proceeded under extraordinary circumstances in \nthe U.S. Capitol to hold a hearing for five more judicial nominees. The \nbuilding housing the Judiciary Committee hearing room was closed, as \nwere the buildings housing the offices of all the Senators on the \ncommittee. Still we persevered.\n  Two weeks ago, while the Senate Republicans were shutting down the \nSenate with a filibuster preventing action on the bill that funds our \nNation's foreign policy initiatives and provides funds to help build \nthe international coalition against terrorism, the Judiciary Committee \nnonetheless proceeded with yet another hearing for four more judicial \nnominees on October 25, 2001.\n  Yesterday we convened the fifth hearing for judicial nominees within \neight extraordinary weeks--weeks not only interrupted by holidays, but \nby the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, the receipt \nof anthrax in the Senate, and the closure of Senate office buildings. \nYesterday's hearing was delayed by another unfortunate and unforseen \nevent when one of the family members of one of the nominees grew faint \nand required medical attention. With patience and perseverance, the \nhearing was completed after attending to those medical needs.\n  In addition, during the time during which we held five hearings on \njudicial nominees, we devoted our attention and efforts to expedited \nconsideration of anti-terrorism legislation. Far from taking a ``time \nout'' as some have suggested, this committee has been in overdrive \nsince July and we redoubled our efforts after September 11, 2001.\n  With respect to law enforcement, I have noted that the Administration \nwas quite slow in making U.S. Attorney nominations, although it had \ncalled for the resignations of U.S. Attorneys early in the year. Since \nwe began receiving nominations just before the August recess, we have \nbeen able to report and the Senate has confirmed approximately 50 of \nthese nominations. We have a few more with incomplete paperwork and we \nawait approximately 35 nominations from the administration. These are \nthe President's nominees based on the standards that he and the \nAttorney General have devised. I have asked for the standards and \ncriteria they are using, but, as far as I am aware, have not received \nthe courtesy of a reply.\n  I note, again, that it is most unfortunate that we still have not \nreceived even a single nomination for any of the U.S. Marshal \npositions. U.S. Marshals are often the top Federal law enforcement \nofficer in their district. They are an important frontline component in \nhomeland security efforts across the country. It now appears that we \nwill end the year without a single nomination for these 94 critical law \nenforcement positions.\n  In the wake of the terrorist attacks on September 11, many of us have \nbeen disdaining partisanship to join together in a bipartisan effort in \nthe best interests of the country. There were reports within 10 days of \nSeptember 11 that some Republicans were disappointed because they would \nnot be able to filibuster appropriations bills and contend that the \nSenate was treating Bush judicial nominees as badly as they had treated \nthe Clinton nominees. Their initial disappointment apparently \ndissipated within days because they did initiate a 3-week filibuster of \nthe foreign operations appropriations bill. That is the bill that \ncontains funding for our international antiterrorism coalition building \nactivities as well as other essential military and humanitarian \nprograms. Fortunately, cooler heads prevailed and that filibuster \nultimately faded.\n  There have been other press accounts that some Republican operatives \nare trying to engage the White House and, even more unfortunately, the \nDepartment of Justice in a partisan effort to try to take political \nadvantage of the aftermath of the September 11 attacks. Were those \nefforts to go forward, that would be disappointing. The bipartisan \neffort against terrorism is not something that Republicans should try \nto manipulate in such a way. Had the Senate moved more efficiently on \nnominations over the last 6 or 7 years, we would not have had so many \nvacancies perpetuated under their previous Senate majority. And \nfinally, as the facts establish and as our actions today again \ndemonstrate, we are moving ahead to fill judicial vacancies with \nnominees who have strong bipartisan support. These include a number of \nvery conservative nominees. We have proceeded on nominees with mixed \nABA peer reviews, including an Arizona nominee who was included in the \nhearing just yesterday. As I have noted, we have already confirmed more \nDistrict Court judges since July of this year than were confirmed in \nthe entire first year of the first Bush administration. Had the \nadministration not changed the confirmation process from the precedents \nthat had served us for more than 50 years, we might have been able to \nconfirm a few more.\n  The President has yet even to nominate to 46 District Court \nvacancies. I hope that he will work with the Senate to make sure those \nnominations will be consensus nominees and that they can be considered \npromptly. Because the White House was slow to name District Court \nnominees this year, the bulk of those who have not had hearings do not \neven have ABA peer review ratings. When this administration \nunilaterally changed the process from that followed by all prior \nPresidents beginning with Eisenhower, it backloaded the process. There \nare still nine nominees, received since September 10, who do not have \nABA peer reviews.\n  Several others have received mixed reviews that require additional \ntime and study. I have noted that at our most recent hearing we \nincluded a District Court nominee from Arizona with a review that \nincludes a minority of the peer review declaring the candidate ``not \nqualified'' to be a District Court judge. In addition, there are at \nleast two more with those mixed ratings and at least one District Court \nnominee with a ``not qualified'' rating. Those ratings caution against \nrushing people through the confirmation process.\n  With this confirmation today, the Senate will have confirmed another\n\n[[Page S11592]]\n\nfive District Court judges just this week. We held a hearing for five \nmore District Court nominees yesterday. We have an additional three \nDistrict Court nominees who could be considered as soon as they finish \ntheir paperwork and answer questions about their criminal histories.\n  Thus, having confirmed 13 District Court judges in record time, we \ncould confirm an additional eight with cooperation from the White \nHouse, nominees and our Republican colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier this week I introduced the \nImported Food Safety Act of 2001. Food safety has long been a serious \npublic health concern in America, but awareness of the vulnerability of \nour food supply has heightened since September 11.\n  I have long been concerned about the adequacy of our system for \nscreening and ensuring the safety of imported food. In 1998, in my \ncapacity of chairing the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I \nbegan a 16-month investigation of the safety of imported foods. This \ninvestigation revealed much about the Government's flawed food safety \nnet. Regrettably, in the intervening years little has changed, and now \nwe must acknowledge that the systemic shortcomings can also be \nexploited by bioterrorists.\n  As part of the investigation, I asked the General Accounting Office \nto evaluate the Federal Government's efforts to ensure the safety of \nimported food. In its April 1998 report, the General Accounting Office \nconcluded that ``Federal efforts to ensure the safety of imported foods \nare inconsistent and unreliable.'' Just last month, the GAO reiterated \nthat conclusion in testimony before the Subcommittee on Oversight of \nGovernment Management.\n  During the 5 days of subcommittee hearings that I chaired, we heard \ntestimony from 29 witnesses, including scientists, industry and \nconsumer groups, government officials, the General Accounting Office, \nand two individuals with firsthand knowledge of the seamier side of the \nimported food industry--a convicted customs broker and a convicted \nformer FDA inspector.\n  Let me briefly recount some of the subcommittee's findings which make \nclear why the legislation I have introduced is so urgently needed.\n  First, weaknesses in the FDA's import controls--specifically, the \nability of importers to control food shipments from the port to the \npoint of distribution--make the system very vulnerable to fraud and \ndeception, and clearly vulnerable to a concerted bioterrorist attack.\n  Second, the bonds required to be posted by importers who violate food \nsafety laws are so low that they are simply considered by some \nunscrupulous importers to be a cost of doing business.\n  Third, maintaining the food safety net for imported food is an \nincreasingly complicated and complex task, made more complicated by \npreviously unknown food pathogens, such as Cyclospora, that are \ndifficult to detect. Our recent experience with anthrax has taught us \nthere is much that public health officials still need to know when \ndealing with such pathogens and bacteria.\n  Fourth, because some imported food can be contaminated by substances \nthat cannot be detected by visual inspections, grant programs are \nneeded to encourage the development of food safety monitoring devices \nand sensors that are capable of detecting chemical and biological \ncontaminants.\n  Fifth, since contamination of imported food can occur at many \ndifferent places from the farm to the table, the ability to trace \noutbreaks of foodborne illnesses back to the source of contamination \nrequires more coordinated effort among Federal, State, and local \nagencies responsible for ensuring food safety, as well as improved \neducation for health care providers so that they can better recognize \nand treat foodborne illnesses. Again, our recent experience with \nanthrax underscores the need for better coordination and education.\n  Since the terrorist attacks that occurred just weeks ago, we have \nbeen living in a changed world. We are battling enemies who show no \nregard for the value of human life, and whose twisted minds seek to \ndestroy those who embody democracy and freedom. It has never been as \nimportant as it is now to ensure that our food supplies are adequately \nprotected against contamination, both inadvertent and intentional.\n\n[[Page S11593]]\n\n  President Bush and his administration are acting swiftly and \ndecisively on all fronts. Among the responsibilities of the Office of \nHomeland Security is the protection of our livestock and agricultural \nsystems from terrorist attack. The administration has requested \nadditional funding to beef up security at our borders and to add more \ninspectors to evaluate the safety of food imports. And the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, Tommy Thompson, has been working tirelessly \nto obtain the additional tools necessary to combat bioterrorism.\n  On October 17, 2001, Secretary Thompson appeared before the Senate's \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, and testified about the Federal \nGovernment's efforts to ensure that the country is adequately prepared \nto respond to bioterrorist threats. He identified food safety and, in \nparticular, imported foods, as vulnerable areas that require \nfurther strengthening. Similarly, at a recent hearing before the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, every single public \nhealth expert who testified before us expressed concern about the \nvulnerability of our food supplies.\n\n  Weak import controls make our system all too easy to circumvent. \nAfter all, FDA only inspects fewer than 1 percent of all imported food \nshipments that arrive in our country. Those shipments are sent from \ncountries around the world, most of whom wish us no harm. Yet, because \nof the hard lessons we have had to learn since September 11, we must be \nmore vigilant about protecting ourselves. It is vital that we take the \nnecessary steps to close the loopholes that unscrupulous shippers have \nused in the past and that bioterrorists could exploit now.\n  I first became concerned about the safety of the U.S. food supply in \n1998 when I learned that fruit from Mexico and Guatemala was associated \nwith three multi-state outbreaks of foodborne illnesses that sickened \nthousands of Americans. Regrettably, those type of outbreaks are far \ntoo common. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate \nthat 76 million cases of foodborne illnesses occur each year. \nFortunately, the majority of these incidents are mild and cause \nsymptoms for only a day or two. Less fortunately, the CDC also \nestimates that over 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths result \nfrom those 76 million cases. And as astonishingly high as those numbers \nare, they are estimates, and the truth may be even more deadly.\n  It was because of my concern that I began the subcommittee's \ninvestigation of the adequacy of our country's imported food safety \nsystem. The testimony I heard was troubling. The U.S. Customs Service \ntold us of one particularly egregious case. It involved contaminated \nfish and illustrated the challenges facing federal regulators who are \ncharged with ensuring the safety of our Nation's food supply.\n  In 1996, Federal inspectors along our border with Mexico opened a \nshipment of seafood destined for sales to restaurants in Los Angeles. \nThe shipment was dangerously tainted with life-threatening \ncontaminants, including botulism, Salmonella, and just plain filth. \nMuch to the surprise of the inspectors, this shipment of frozen fish \nhad been inspected before by Federal authorities. Alarmingly, in fact, \nit had arrived at our border 2 years before, and had been rejected by \nthe FDA as unfit for consumption. Its importers then held this rotten \nshipment for 2 years before attempting to bring it into the country \nagain, by a different route, and a different port in the hope of \nshipping this seafood through the inspection system.\n  The inspectors only narrowly prevented this poisoned fish from \nreaching American plates. And what happened to the importer who tried \nto sell this deadly food to American consumers? In effect, nothing. He \nwas placed on probation and asked to perform 50 hours of community \nservice.\n  I suppose, given how few shipments are inspected by FDA inspectors, \nwe should count ourselves lucky that these perpetrators were caught at \nall since, as I mentioned earlier, fewer than 1 percent of all \nshipments of imported food under the jurisdiction of FDA are actually \ninspected. Unsafe food might have escaped detection and reached our \ntables. But it worries me that the importer essentially received a slap \non the wrist. I believe that forfeiting the small amount of money \ncurrently required for the Customs' bond, which some importers now \nconsider no more than a ``cost of doing business,'' does little to \ndeter unscrupulous importers from trying to slip tainted fish that is 2 \nyears old past overworked Customs agents.\n\n  It is imperative that Congress provide our Federal agencies with the \ndirection, resources, and authority necessary to protect our food \nsupply from acts of bioterrorism and to keep unsafe, unsanitary food \nout of the United States.\n  I have worked with the FDA, the Customs Service, and the CDC to \nensure that my legislation corrects many of the vulnerabilities that \nhave been identified in our imported food safety system. Let me \ndescribe what this bill is designed to accomplish.\n  My legislation would fill the existing gaps in the food import system \nand provide the FDA with stronger authority to protect American \nconsumers against tainted food imports. First and foremost, this bill \ngives the FDA the authority to stop such food from entering our \ncountry. My bill would authorize FDA to deny the entry of imported food \nthat has caused repeated outbreaks of foodborne illnesses, presents a \nreasonable probability of causing serious adverse health consequences \nor is likely without systemic changes to cause disease again.\n  Second, this legislation would enable the FDA to require secure \nstorage of shipments offered by repeat offenders prior to their release \ninto commerce. Unscrupulous shippers who have demonstrated a \nwillingness to knowingly send tainted food to our country cannot be \noverlooked as potential sources of bioterrorist acts. My bill would \nalso prohibit the practice of ``port-shopping,'' and would require that \nboxes containing violative foods that have been refused entry into our \ncountry be clearly marked. This latter authority is currently used with \nsuccess by the U.S. Department of Agriculture. My bill also would \nrequire the destruction of certain imported foods that cannot be \nadequately reconditioned to ensure safety.\n  What happens now is that when the food is ordered to be reexported \nand denied entrance into this country, it is not destroyed, even if it \nis completely unfit for human consumption and cannot be made safe.\n  Third, the legislation would direct the FDA to develop criteria for \nuse by private laboratories to collect and analyze samples of food \noffered for import. This will help ensure the integrity of the testing \nprocess.\n  What happens now is that it is often the very same shipper who tried \nto slip the tainted food into our country who is responsible for taking \nit to a lab and getting it tested. Obviously, that is like putting the \nfox in charge of the hen house and offers very little protection to \nconsumers.\n  Fourth, the legislation would give ``teeth'' to the current food \nimport system by establishing two strong deterrents--the threats of \nhigher bonds and of debarment--for unscrupulous importers who \nrepeatedly violate U.S. law. No longer will the industry's ``bad \nactors'' be able to profit from endangering the health of American \nconsumers. In other words, if the shipper is found to be repeatedly \nviolating Federal laws regarding food safety, we could ban that shipper \nfrom importing anything into the United States. We will just kick them \nout of the business altogether.\n  Finally, my legislation would authorize the CDC to award grants to \nState and local public health agencies to strengthen the public health \ninfrastructure by updating essential items, such as laboratory and \nelectronic reporting equipment. Grants would also be available for \nuniversities, nonprofit corporations, and industrial partners to \ndevelop new and improved sensors and tests to detect pathogens, and for \nprofessional schools and societies to develop programs to increase the \nawareness of foodborne illness among health care providers and the \ngeneral public.\n  We are truly fortunate that the American food supply is the safest in \nthe world. But our system for safeguarding our citizens from imported \nfood that has been tainted, either intentionally or inadvertently, is \nfundamentally flawed. We need to work together to correct this problem.\n\n[[Page S11594]]\n\n  In that regard, I am pleased to report that I am working with my \ncolleagues on bipartisan bioterrorism legislation that targets problems \nposed by bioterrorist threats to our Nation's food supply. I believe \nthat the measures provided for in my Imported Food Safety Act of 2001, \nas well as the bipartisan bioterrorism bill we are drafting, will \nsignificantly reduce this potential threat to our country. It is my \nhope that parts of my bill will be incorporated into the comprehensive \nbioterrorism bill that we are working on now and that we will pass it \nthis year.\n  Mr. President, we need to take action now. We have identified a \nthreat to our food supply. We know what we need to do to put in place \nthe safeguards that are needed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I know how \ncommitted the Senator is to this issue, and much of that issue I agree \nwith. I hope sometime in the future we can deal with it. It is \nimportant, certainly to those who meet the standards and the \nqualifications which the Senator has proposed.\n  At this time I believe it necessary to object, and I do object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I have spoken about this before. The \nSenator from Idaho was objecting on behalf of someone else. He said: I \nhope this legislation passes soon because we all support this, or \nbecause it is important, something to that effect.\n  This legislation passed the veterans committee on a 21-0 vote. It is \nthe kind of legislation you massage--Lane Evans has done this in the \nHouse--so you get everybody agreeing. It is really important. I have \ngone through all the details before.\n  It is there in terms of making sure you have the job training, the \nservices for people, and the health care for people struggling with \naddiction or struggling with posttraumatic stress syndrome, transition \nto other housing. It is really important to do.\n  Veterans Day is coming in just a few days.\n  My last point is that even though my colleague from Idaho says we all \nthink it is a good thing to do, for 2 weeks I have come out here and I \nhave asked: Who is the Senator who has an anonymous hold on this bill? \nIf he or she opposes it, come out and debate it. This is no way to \nproceed. As a result, I have put a hold on every bill introduced by my \ncolleagues from the other side, all of them that are unanimous consent \nand have a great deal of merit. I am not giving up any of my leverage.\n  It is unconscionable that this piece of legislation has been blocked \nthrough an anonymous hold. It is no way to say thanks to veterans. The \nveterans in the military say: We don't leave our wounded behind. We \nhave a lot of wounded left behind on the streets of our country who are \nhomeless.\n  If I got started on this issue, I could spend about 10 hours \nexpressing my indignation at what has happened. Out of deference to \nSenator Mikulski, I will not.\n  Again, there aren't going to be any bills beyond appropriations and \njudicial appointments that are going to go through until this bill goes \nthrough. This should be a priority.\n  I make a plea to my colleagues from the other side of the aisle, find \nout who it is, the Senator who is blocking this consideration. No one \nhas ever even given me the slightest hint why. Let's get this work \ndone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/08/senate-section/article/S11594-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11594-S11603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nDEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND \n    INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on the bill, H.R. 2620, and ask for its immedidate \nconsideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2620) making appropriations for the Departments of Veterans \n     Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and for sundry \n     independent agencies, boards, commission, corporations, and \n     offices for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2002, and \n     for other purposes, having met have agreed that the House \n     recede from its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate \n     and agree to the same with an amendment, signed by all of the \n     conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of November 6, 2001, at page H7787.)\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, it is with a great deal of pride that I \nbring this conference report to the Senate. I take this opportunity to \nthank my Republican colleague, the ranking member, Senator Bond of \nMissouri. This has been a year of tumultuous change in our country.\n  On Tuesday a year ago, we thought we had elected the President. It \nwent on for 35 days--unprecedented. We were turned into a 50-50 \nSenate--again unprecedented.\n  Senator Bond chaired the committee in January and then, after Senator \nJeffords' decision, the reins passed to me.\n  I say publicly, I thank Senator Bond for the graciousness in the way \nhe transited the gavel and the chairmanship to me. He did it with \ngraciousness and efficiency. His staff could not have been more \ncooperative or collegial. Because of that, our subcommittee didn't miss \na beat, and we didn't miss a buck. We went to work on behalf of \nveterans, housing, the environment, investments in space, science, \ntechnology, as well as other agencies. I thank him for that.\n  I bring to the Senate's attention a summary of the bill. This act \nprovides for a total of $112.7 billion for all the programs within the \nbill, which is $4.8 billion or 4 percent over the fiscal year\n\n[[Page S11595]]\n\n2001 level. This includes $27.3 billion in mandatory funding, an \nincrease of $1.8 billion over the fiscal year 2001 level, and $85.4 \nbillion in discretionary spending, which is an increase of $3 billion \nover last year.\n  What this bill essentially does is meet compelling human need. It \nmeets compelling human need in terms of our veterans, in terms of the \npoor, meeting the day-to-day needs of the working poor. It helps \nrebuild our neighborhoods and communities. Through its funding for \nFEMA, it protects our homeland security. And it invests in science and \ntechnology through NASA and the National Science Foundation.\n\n  For our veterans, we have increased veterans health care by over $1 \nbillion from last year, bringing it to a total of $21.3 billion. This \nwould allow the VA healthcare system to serve 4 million patients \nthrough 2002. This conference agreement also provides the VA the \nability to open 33 new outpatient clinics. It would also continue to \nallow research and treatment of chronic disease; diagnosis and \ntreatment for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's; look at the issues again of \nspecial populations, such as stroke and spinal cord injury; and \ncontinue its groundbreaking research in the area of prostate cancer.\n  In terms of our veterans, we also make a substantial effort to reduce \nthe claim time for how long a veteran has to wait in order to get their \ndisability benefit. They had to often stand in line when they were in \nthe U.S. military. But after the way they serve their country, they \nshould not have to stand in line for almost a year in order to see if \ntheir disability claim can be processed. We are working on a bipartisan \nbasis to shorten that.\n  As to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, we had three \ngoals: Expand housing opportunity for the poor, rebuild our \nneighborhoods, and help special-need populations. To do that, we have \nrenewed all the section 8 housing vouchers. We have funded this program \nat $15.6 billion. This is $1.7 billion over last year.\n  At the same time, we restored cuts proposed by the President to the \ncritical public housing capital program by funding it at $2.8 billion. \nWe have increased funding for the public housing operating cost by $250 \nmillion over last year for a total of $3.5 billion.\n  Knowing that many of our colleagues believe the decisions are best \nmade locally, we wanted to keep our commitment to the community \ndevelopment block grant money, and we have increased that by over $200 \nmillion. This year CDBG will be funded at $5 billion.\n  For other HUD programs, we have continued at last year's level the \nfunding for brownfields, housing for the elderly, and housing for the \ndisabled. But we have, in order to create home ownership, included \nlanguage to raise the FHA loan limit for multifamily housing by 25 \npercent this year. This came from the private sector, home builders, as \nwell as the AFL-CIO. I believe this will mean more rental property will \nbe available. We cannot voucher our way out of our housing crisis. We \nneed a new production program. This has long been a position held by my \ncolleague, Senator Bond. I look forward to the recommendation of the \nMillennial Housing Commission and the Commission on Senior Housing. We \nlook to those in the private sector and the nonprofit sector to give us \nguidance on what a 21st century HUD should look like, which will create \nreal hope and opportunity. We provided the inspector general with no \nless than $5 million, and this will also be going after predatory \nlending.\n\n  Let's move on now to EPA. For EPA, the conference agreement provides \n$7.9 billion, an increase of $587 million above the budget level. This \nis $75 million above what we funded last year. What do we get for our \nmoney? First of all, we get EPA enforcement. This is funded at last \nyear's level of $465 million. We can keep the current level of \nenforcement.\n  The conference agreement also keeps our commitment to clean and safe \nwater by fully funding the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund at \n$1.35 billion, which is an increase over the President's budget \nrequest. We also fully fund the Drinking Water SRF at $850 million, an \nincrease of $27 million over the President's budget request.\n  This country is facing an enormous backlog of funding for water \ninfrastructure projects. Every single one of my colleagues talks to me \nabout sewer or water infrastructure projects, failing septic tanks, how \nto comply with the new arsenic requirement; we have aging systems in my \nown region, as do New Orleans and Chicago. I could give every single \nSenator a billion dollars to take back to their State, and it would be \njust a drop in the bucket for this need.\n  I hope, as we look at the stimulus package, we look at how we can \nfund clean water and safe drinking water projects because, at the end \nof the day, I believe we will stimulate the local economy and create \njobs but have value for our dollar.\n  We also kept our commitment to cleanup. We provided $1.27 billion for \nthe cleanup of Superfund sites. This also includes $95 million for \nbrownfields. We have included $22.6 million for the National Estuary \nProgram. Again, we have worked closely with the administrator.\n  For FEMA, we maintain our commitment to protecting our homeland by \nproviding FEMA with $3 billion. We provide $2.1 billion for disaster \nrelief to ensure that we are ready to respond to any future disaster. \nWe have also worked very closely with Joe Allbaugh, the FEMA Director, \nto be sure we respond to the needs of New York and local communities \nand, at the same time, are ready for those natural disasters like \nhurricanes and tornadoes that could affect us.\n  We also wanted to support America's heroes, our firefighters, and in \nthis bill we fund the Fire Grant Program at $150 million in order to be \nable to fund the firefighters' need of protective gear and equipment. \nThis program is authorizing $3 billion. We would prefer to do more and \nlook forward to doing more in the stimulus package. We understand \nSenator Byrd is going to work closely with us to do this.\n  In order to be protected by the firefighters, we need to protect them \nand make sure they have the protective gear, respiratory gear, and the \ntechnological tools to go into horrific situations. In order to be able \nto protect us, they need to have the right equipment. Many firefighters \nin America are volunteers; we ask them to do it on their own time and \non their own dime. We can't protect our firefighters and give them the \nequipment they need based on bingo and fish fries at the local level--\nalthough, I sure like those bingo games and fish fries. They are fun \nthings to do, but they are not a reliable funding stream. We have to \nback them.\n\n  Let's go to NASA. We provide $14.8 billion for NASA programs, which \nis $500 million over last year. Our top priority remains the safety of \nour astronauts. We made a significant investment in shuttle upgrades, \nincluding $207 million allocated for safety upgrades to the space \nshuttle. By improving the safety of the shuttle, we reduce the risks to \nour astronauts.\n  We fully fund the rest of the shuttle program at over $3 billion for \nfiscal year 2002. For the space station, we redirected $75 million to \nother pressing needs such as safety upgrades to the shuttle and other \nscience and aeronautics programs. We know that former astronaut Tom \nYoung is taking a look at our space station. We like it; we think it is \nvery important to our country and to the world. But we also believe \nthat the management of the space station has had a fiscal \npermissiveness that has allowed unacceptable cost overruns. They had \nover $4 billion in overruns. We can't let that stand.\n  This independent review team, chaired by former astronaut Tom Young, \nhas given us a new roadmap for the station. I can assure the Senate and \nour taxpayers that we will be holding hearings and meetings to be able \nto ensure that we keep our commitment to the space station, do our \nresearch, keep our astronauts safe, but at the same time have fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  For the National Science Foundation, the conference agreement \nprovides $4.8 billion, an increase of 8.4 percent over last year. This \nrepresents a downpayment on an effort initiated by Senator Bond and \nmyself to double the NSF budget. We want to do that in 5 years. I think \nwe might have to wait 6 years to do it, but we are convinced it is in \nthe Nation's long-term interest that funding for basic research in all \nscience and engineering disciplines must increase substantially.\n  We have increased the funding in several areas for research, such as \ninformation technology and nanotechnology\n\n[[Page S11596]]\n\nand, of course, in agricultural biotech, on which, of course, the \nranking member has been a leader. But also, at the same time, we really \ntry to back our young researchers so that young Americans will choose \nscience and scientific research as a career.\n  We have also maintained the Corporation for National Service. \nVoluntarism is our national trademark, and this agreement maintains our \ncommitment to AmeriCorps and other agencies within it.\n  There are also 25 other agencies, but I am not going to go through \nall 25. We have kept our commitment to them. I thank the President for \ngiving us the opportunity to work with very excellent Cabinet people. \nAgain, we were under very difficult circumstances, with a late start, \nbut there was an orderly transition.\n  I think we have met our charge to the compelling needs of our \nconstituents, the long-range needs of our Nation and done it with \nfiscal stewardship, which I believe the taxpayers require from us.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my summary of the bill.\n  I thank Paul Carliner, Gabriel Batkin, and Joel Widder of my staff \nfor giving me the support that I needed. I thank John Kamarck and Cheh \nKim from Senator Bond's staff for their cooperation and collegiality.\n  Mr. President, I hope that at the conclusion of our debate, when we \ntake the rollcall, the Senate will support this conference report. They \ncan go back and talk to every single one of their constituents, whether \nit is a veteran from the ``greatest generation,'' or the firefighters, \nthe warriors of this generation, or the scientists who are giving us \nthe ideas to keep America strong and safe, or the poor who depend on us \neven at this time. We have a great bill and I hope that this bill will \npass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the conferees of this bill for \ntheir hard work in completing this conference report for this \nlegislation.\n  The report provides critical Federal funding for the Departments of \nVeterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent \nAgencies. The conference report spends at a level of 4.1 percent higher \nthan the level enacted in fiscal year 2001.\n  In real dollars, this is $2.1 billion in additional spending above \nthe amount requested by the President, and a $4.4 billion increase in \nspending from last year.\n  Once again I find myself in the unpleasant position of speaking \nbefore my colleagues about parochial projects in yet another conference \nreport. I have identified over $1 billion in earmarks, which is greater \nthan the cost of the earmarks in the conference report passed last \nyear. Last year, it was $970 million. So far this year, the total of \nappropriations pork-barrel spending has already hit a staggering $9 \nbillion.\n  Before I go into some specifics--and it will not be many on this \nbill--I would like to quote from an article by Deroy Murdoch of the \nScripps Howard News Service that was published on October 14, 2001. He \nsays:\n\n       Each dollar spent on pork-barrel projects is one less \n     dollar that can be devoted to the War on Terror. This \n     inescapable fact somehow has escaped members of Congress. \n     While senators and representatives swiftly and wisely \n     approved $40 billion in recovery and defense funds after the \n     Sept. 11 massacre, they quickly relapsed into old habits.\n       Congress again is spending money as recklessly and \n     foolishly as it did on Sept. 10. Even as U.S. warships steam \n     toward the Persian Gulf, Citizens Against Government Waste, a \n     Washington-based fiscal watchdog group, has calculated in \n     military terms the opportunity cost of business as usual.\n       Sidewinder missiles sell for $41,300 each. . . . Tomahawk \n     Cruise missiles are $1 million apiece while one F-15 fighter \n     jet costs $15 million. Pork projects chew right through cash \n     that could purchase these and other weapons the Pentagon will \n     need to crush the international terror network and its state \n     sponsors.\n       For instance, on Sept. 13, the Senate adopted the fiscal \n     2002 Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary Appropriations \n     Bill. Consider just several items the Senate approved while \n     the Pentagon and Ground Zero still smoldered:\n       --$2 million for the Oregon Groundfish Outreach Program and \n     $850,000 for Chesapeake Bay Oyster Research.\n       Cost: 69 sidewinders.\n       --$6 million for the National Infrastructure Institute in \n     Portsmouth, New Hampshire.\n       Cost: Six cruise missiles.\n       --$204 million for the Advanced Technology Program, a \n     quintessential corporate welfare boondoggle, for which the \n     Bush administration requested only $13 million.\n       Cost: Thirteen F-15 fighters.\n       Even more maddening is a brand-new bill to expand farm \n     subsidies one year before the existing spending plan expires. \n     The Farm Security Act would increase agricultural pork by \n     $73.1 billion over the next 10 years. Added to the $96.9 \n     billion budget baseline, Uncle Sam would plow $170 billion \n     into the ground through the year 2011.\n       This bill authorizes $101 million for honey producers. The \n     once-terminated wool and mohair program rises again, $202 \n     million strong. Peanut farmers can expect $3.48 billion. This \n     bill would also revive a $37.1 billion in ``counter-cyclical \n     assistance'' which was scrapped in 1996.\n\n  I talked about this at another time.\n\n       The U.S. Agriculture Department released a study last month \n     that describes these subsidies as spectacularly wasteful and \n     fundamentally unfair. Forty-seven percent of agricultural \n     payments go to commercial farms with average household \n     incomes of $135,397, more than 2\\1/2\\ times the average \n     American household's $51,855 in earnings.\n       According to the Associated Press, just 10 percent of farm \n     owners shared 63 percent of last year's $27 billion in \n     federal agriculture payments.\n       Media tycoon Ted Turner received farm aid, as did Portland \n     Trail Blazer Scottie Pippen. Modestly paid waitresses and \n     school bus drivers pay twice for largesse--first through \n     taxes, then again as agricultural price supports hike their \n     grocery bills. . . .\n       These legislative hijinks are bad enough in peacetime. \n     America is at war. Soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines are \n     kissing their loved ones goodbye and shipping out to face a \n     vicious and bloodthirsty enemy lurking in foreign shadows. \n     Right now, Congress should grow up and stop treating the \n     domestic budget as a political Toys R Us. Americans already \n     are making huge sacrifices. Weak tourist revenues have \n     lowered the curtains on five Broadway shows. Hotel beds have \n     gone empty as conferences have been canceled, and weddings \n     have been scaled back or postponed. Major U.S. airlines have \n     fired 87,000 employees since terror struck.\n       Amid such national belt-tightening, it is beyond ugly to \n     watch public servants loosen their belts as their pork-laden \n     bellies swell. If the American people must live with less, so \n     must their representatives.\n\n  I would like to read the words of OMB Director Mitch Daniels who said \nthat in time of war:\n\n       Everything ought to be held up to scrutiny. . . . \n     Situations like this can have a clarifying benefit. People \n     who could not identify a low priority or lousy program before \n     may now see the need.\n\n  Mr. President, we obviously have not seen the need in this conference \nreport, and I intend to clarify some items stuffed in the bill. Let us \ntake a look at this year's porkbarrel spending projects in the VA-HUD \nconference report before us.\n  No. 10: $1 million for Spring Hill College in Mobile, AL, for \nconstruction of the Regional Library Resource Center;\n  No. 9: $175,000 for the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, CA, for \nconstruction needs of the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum;\n  No. 8: $1 million for Dubuque, IA, for the development of an American \nRiver Museum;\n  No. 7: $300,000 for the Central Missouri Lake of the Ozarks \nConvention and Visitor Bureau Community Center;\n  No. 6: $750,000 for the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development \nat Iowa State University;\n  No. 5: $1 million for the Mid-Atlantic Aerospace Complex in West \nVirginia.\n  You will notice, Mr. President, each one of those is earmarked to a \nspecific location. For example, in my State of Arizona, we just voted a \nbond issue to expand our convention facilities. They are not going to \nhave to do that in the Central Missouri Lake of the Ozarks because they \nare going to build a convention center, and we are going to give them \n$300,000 to do so.\n  Again, No. 5, $1 million for the State of West Virginia, which seems \nto pop up quite a bit.\n  There is an additional $250,000 to Maui for the control of nuisance \nseaweed accumulations on the beaches of Kihei, Maui, HI;\n  $100,000 for the Memphis Zoo in Memphis, TN, for the Northwest \nPassage Campaign;\n  $140,000 for the city of El Reno, OK, for development of a trolley \nsystem;\n  And $190,000 for the city of Spartanburg, SC, for the Motor Racing \nMuseum of the South.\n  Mr. President, we are in a war. Isn't this really unconscionable? \nIsn't it\n\n[[Page S11597]]\n\nreally unacceptable? Isn't it really quite a commentary that the \nearmarks in this year's bill are higher than last year's bill? Isn't it \ninteresting that each one of these is earmarked for a specific place? \nPerhaps the Presiding Officer's home State would like to compete for \nmoney for a Motor Racing Museum of the Midwest since we are giving \nmoney to Spartanburg, SC, for the Motor Racing Museum of the South.\n  We are now about to have a big fight with the President and my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle about increased spending. How \ncan my colleagues on this side of the aisle go into that battle with \nclean hands when we continue to add porkbarrel project after porkbarrel \nproject--$9 billion so far of unrequested, unauthorized items that are \nspecifically earmarked for certain powerful members of the \nAppropriations Committee. That is not right, Mr. President.\n  Sooner or later, we are going to educate the American people about \nthis, and it is going to come to a halt. I am afraid it may be later \nrather than sooner. It continues to lurch out of control, and no one \nbelieves we have enough money for defense spending. No one believes \nthat. That is why we are spending extra money on defense, and yet these \nprojects continue to be added both in conference as well as in the \nbills themselves, and it is not acceptable.\n  It is not acceptable. If the average American knew more about this, \nthey would reject it.\n  I intend to do as I have done in the past to make sure as many \nAmericans understand where their tax dollars are spent.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am proud to rise in strong support of a \nconference report on H.R. 2620, the VA-HUD fiscal year 2002 \nappropriations bill. The chair of the committee, Senator Mikulski, has \ndone an excellent job in crafting this measure. I am deeply grateful \nfor her leadership.\n  She was kind enough to talk about the smooth transition. It was not \nsomething we desired, but it was something that worked extremely well \nbecause we have had the good fortune of being able to work closely on \nthis measure for a number of years. In fact, it was a seamless \ntransition.\n  I believe the legitimate wishes and concerns of Members of this body, \nthe needs of the veterans, those who depend upon housing for Federal \nGovernment assistance, those who depend upon the Environmental \nProtection Agency to clean up our rivers and our waters and our air, \nare well served by this measure.\n  I add my compliments to Congressman Walsh, the chair of the House VA-\nHUD Committee, and Congressman Mollohan, the ranking member. This bill \nhas been a very tough one because of the limitation on funding, but I \nbelieve it strikes the right balance. We have met many of the \nadministration's funding priorities, and I compliment the \nadministration for not looking to create a series of new programs but \ninstead focusing on some exceptions, maintaining existing program \nlevels and reforming program implementation to ensure that agencies can \ndeliver assistance under existing program requirements.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has asked for a few minutes out of my \ntime, so I ask the Presiding Officer to notify me when I have used 9 \nminutes of time. I do wish to reserve some time for Senator Domenici \nfor a very pressing issue he must address.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the respective leaders have asked the \nvote be held at 4:30, so we are going to have some extra time. We can \naccommodate the Senator for as much time as he or the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico would like to have.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my chairman. I will try to be \nreasonably brief, but there are some important things I wish to \ninclude.\n  To return to the analysis of the bill, the VA and veterans needs \nremain the highest priority of the bill. The funding decisions in this \nbill are designed to ensure the best quality of medical care for our \nveterans and to keep the best doctors in the VA system. Furthermore, \nSenator Mikulski and I are committed deeply to meeting the medical \nneeds of veterans, and we are working with the VA and the \nadministration to ensure the successful implementation of the new CARES \nprocess, which is designed to assure that VA has the facilities it \nneeds, that targets the services and the medical care throughout the \ncountry, and gets rid of unneeded facilities that drain money away from \nneeded care for veterans.\n  In addition, the VA-HUD bill appropriates some $30.2 billion for the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, an increase of $1.7 \nbillion. This includes funding to renew all expiring section 8 \ncontracts and provides for 18,000 incremental vouchers. I do remain \ndeeply concerned that vouchers do not work well in many housing \nmarkets. We do, as the chairman of the subcommittee mentioned, need to \ndevelop new production programs that assist extremely low-income \nfamilies in particular. This is a need that we must address, and we \nlook forward to working with the authorizing committees, the Millennium \nHousing Commission, and others, to ensure it is addressed.\n\n  The bill also reflects our continuing support for CDBG, the HOME \nProgram, homeless assistance, FHA mortgage insurance, and assistance \nfor abatement of lead hazards in housing.\n  As for the Environmental Protection Agency, the bill includes a $587 \nmillion increase to $7.9 billion, $74 million over the fiscal year 2001 \nlevel. The bill maintains funding of the clean water State revolving \nfund at $1.35 billion and drinking water at $850 million. I cannot \nemphasize enough the importance of continuing to maintain funding for \nthese State revolving funds.\n  The clean water infrastructure financing alone, there is a need in \nthis country for some $200 billion over the next 20 years, excluding \nreplacement costs and operation and maintenance.\n  I want to address some comments made about spending characterized in \nthis bill as porkbarrel. The Members of this body know this bill funds \nmonies that go through to State and local governments. This is a \nmeasure that includes funds for the Community Development Block Grant \nProgram. Under that program, we take Federal dollars and send it back \nto the local communities so Governors, mayors, and city council members \ncan allocate the needs in their community.\n  Is that porkbarrel? I happen to think that providing money for needed \ncommunity improvements is not porkbarrel spending. This measure also \nsends, as I just said, $1.35 billion for the clean water state \nrevolving funds to clean up sewers, and $850 million for safe drinking \nwater. Is that porkbarrel? I do not think so.\n  The greatest need for many of our communities, whether they be large \nor small communities, is to have the money they need to develop \nprojects that will make them strong communities and to assure that the \nwater systems are healthy. We provide that money.\n  Now my colleague was addressing the fact that out of that money, we \nsend back for community development block grants some 6.8 percent. Less \nthan 10 percent has been designated by Members of the House or the \nSenate for particular high need activities and investments in \ncommunities in their State.\n  Do Members of Congress somehow know less about the needs of their \ncommunities for community development? Do Members of Congress somehow \nknow less about the need for critical improvements to water and sewer \nsupply systems? I think not.\n  This money goes to those communities that have needs for tremendous \nefforts to improve community life, whether it be facilities that will \nbring in more business or whether it be money to go to drinking water \nor cleaning up sewer water in the States. This is one of the areas \nwhere those legislators in Congress who are concerned and who pay \nattention to the needs of their State can find areas where there are \npressing needs. I believe, by and large, they do an excellent job, and \nwe do a good job.\n  One may quarrel with some of the decisions made by local officials on \ncommunity development block grants. One may quarrel with some of the \ndecisions made on clean water in State revolving funds for drinking \nwater, but the fact\n\n[[Page S11598]]\n\nremains there are tremendous needs in all of these areas. So I am very \nproud of the fact we are able to assist States, communities, and \nlocalities in taking care of their needs.\n  Mr. President, I do not see the Senator from New Mexico. I believe we \nhave additional time remaining so I will continue and intend to address \nthe subject he was going to address because I know he feels very \nstrongly about it. One of the major controversial areas we have \naddressed in this bill concerns the level of arsenic in drinking water. \nIn this case, the bill supports the current regulation of 10 parts per \nbillion for arsenic levels in drinking water, and while this level is \nsupported by a number of scientific studies, the requirement that the \ncommunities must meet these new requirements by 2006 is very troubling \nbecause there are communities in the United States, especially \ncommunities in the West, communities in New Mexico and Idaho and other \nStates, where there are high levels of naturally occurring arsenic in \nthe water.\n  Unfortunately, for communities which are small and do not have the \nfinancial ability to meet these requirements, the possibility is some \nvery unwanted consequences of forcing through a regulation on all \ncommunities. We provide some relief in these communities through a \ntemporary waiver. Our colleagues on the authorizing committees objected \nto this approach even though the leaders of the committee on both the \nHouse and Senate sides believed it was warranted. The conference report \ndefers to those committees and suggests the authorizing committees pay \nattention to an evaluation to be done by EPA on the affordability of \nthese projects and how a small system variance and exemption programs \nshould be implemented for arson. This is a serious issue. Congress will \nhave to address and balance this need over the next few years, both the \nfinancial burdens and health concerns faced by the small communities on \nthe new arsenic standards.\n\n  To be blunt, the last thing we need is to push these communities, \nwith high arsenic levels in their drinking water, to abandon local \nmunicipal water systems which are reducing the levels of arsenic and \nforce residents to go back to untreated and unregulated wells where \nthey would be getting potentially higher levels of arsenic and \npotentially being exposed to greater health risks, not only from \narsenic but from other sources of water pollution that would be treated \nin the municipal water systems.\n  For FEMA, the conference report includes $1.5 billion in emergency \ndisaster assistance, funding for firefighters, and flood mapping and \nmitigation. I join with my colleague from Maryland in expressing my \ngratitude for the way FEMA moved in. They have our highest \nappreciation. They stepped up to the plate and assisted the citizens of \nour Nation during this time of need.\n  I will address for my colleagues the fact, at the request of \nRepresentatives and Senators from New York, that we took special note \nof the economic needs of the people and businesses in New York that \nhave been devastated by the tragic terrorist attack of September 11. \nThe President allocated $700 million for New York for the VA/HUD \ncommunity development block grant. In this bill we included authority \nfor HUD to meet these needs through existing programs, including broad \nauthority to waive a part of the statute--except for labor standards, \nenvironmental standards, fair housing, and antidiscrimination--to meet \nthese truly pressing needs. I understand a community economic \ndevelopment corporation has been established to allocate these funds.\n  I believe the Governor and the mayor set up a Lower Manhattan \nRedevelopment Corporation that will hand out the funds. I raise this \npoint because today the Environment and Public Works Committee passed \nout of committee a new measure setting up a different form of \nallocating these funds. I caution members of that committee, on which I \nhappen to serve, that we not set up a competing structure. We need to \ndo the job well. We need to do it right. We need to do it one time and \nnot have two different structures stumbling all over each other. We \nhave, we think, dealt with the concerns, and we will be happy to work \nwith friends and colleagues from New York to make sure we do it \neffectively.\n  Finally, I mention in addition to funding NASA at $14.78 billion, we \nhave expressed grave concerns about the serious cost overruns. The \ncosts of the International Space Station have continued to grow, over \n$4 billion above more recently; it is probably now $5 or $6 billion. \nThere seems to be a total loss of management control by NASA with \nregard to the space station. We have received a report from the Young \ncommission to study the International Space Station. I believe it is a \ntop priority for the administration to find a new Administrator as soon \nas possible to review the extensive analysis and major recommendations \nof the Young commission and make whatever program and management \nreforms are necessary to ensure the ISS and other NASA programs meet \nour expectations and not rob the funding for NASA.\n  I express my strong feeling, as the chair of our subcommittee has, \nfor the need to double the National Science Foundation budget. We have \nto meet pressing human priorities. But for the long run, the pressing \nhuman needs of this country are going to be met to the extent that we \nfund the scientific exploration that goes on in the National Science \nFoundation. We should not be shorting the basic scientific research. I \nhope we can have the support of our colleagues to get the money to \nincrease it next year to put us on the path of doubling.\n  In addition to thanking Senator Mikulski, I express my sincere thanks \nto the members of the subcommittee and my staff, Jon Kamarck, Cheh Kim, \nand Isaac Green, who worked long and hard. They have become very good \nfriends and worked closely, particularly in the new setting with \nlimited space, with our good friends, Paul Carliner, Gabrielle Batkin \nand Joel Widder, for their quality work and commitment to the process. \nThey have done an excellent job, and we are very proud of the work they \ndo.\n  I, too, commend this bill to my colleagues and urge unanimous \nsupport.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to voice my \nsupport for the fiscal year 2002 HUD-VA conference report. I \ncongratulate Chairwoman Mikulski and Senator Bond for the outstanding \njob they have done to provide HUD with the resources it needs, while \nworking within a very tight allocation for all of the agencies within \ntheir jurisdiction.\n  The conference report before us today is a great improvement over the \nadministration's budget request. The budget request for HUD, the agency \nthat provides housing assistance to this Nation's poorest families, was \nsorely inadequate. Their proposal would not even have provided the \nfunding necessary to maintain HUD programs at current levels.\n  The appropriators recognized the great need for housing assistance in \nthis country by providing more funding than the administration \nrequested in almost every program area.\n  The increases included in this bill are clearly needed. We have a \nsevere housing crisis in this country, and the need for housing \nassistance continues to grow. In addition to the 5 million very low-\nincome households in this country who have worst case housing needs, \nwhich means they are either paying more than half of their income \ntowards rent or living in severely substandard housing, another 2 \nmillion people will experience homelessness this year. These families \nface greater challenges today, as the Nation's low-income housing stock \ncontinues to shrink. In the past decade, the number of units available \nto extremely low-income renters has dropped by 14 percent, a loss of \nalmost a million units.\n  These statistics make clear that programs to aid low-income families \nmust not be cut, but must be expanded to meet the growing need. \nUnfortunately, the overall funding level requested by the \nadministration put Congress in the untenable position of choosing \nbetween maintaining the current affordable housing stock or funding \nadditional needed housing units. The appropriators were forced to \nforego expanding housing opportunities so that scarce Federal resources \ncould be used to maintain existing housing, a choice that is both cost-\neffective and necessary. While we need to expand Federal housing \nprograms, we have an obligation to ensure that the affordable housing \nthat exists is habitable and safe.\n\n[[Page S11599]]\n\n  For this reason, I am pleased that the conference report increases \nfunding for public housing, a program that houses over 1.3 million of \nthis Nation's poorest families. This bill provides $2.84 billion for \nthe Public Housing Capital Fund, the fund used to repair and modernize \npublic housing--$550 million above the administration's request. There \nis a significant need for Public Housing Capital Funds as HUD estimates \nthat there is currently a $22 billion backlog in needed capital repairs \nin public housing. A cut of the magnitude proposed by the \nadministration would have led to further deterioration of this Nation's \npublic housing stock. Fortunately, the bill before us today provides \nadditional funding, helping us to maintain a much needed resource and \nto ensure that the Federal investment in public housing is protected.\n  Recognizing the importance of public housing, the conference report \nfunds the Public Housing Operating Fund at $3.5 billion, $110 million \nabove the administration's request. I am disappointed that this bill \ndoes not separately fund the Public Housing Drug Elimination Fund. The \nadministration requested no funding for this critical program which \nhelps to fight drugs and crime in our public housing communities. The \nconference report provides $250 million more for the Operating Fund \nthan provided in fiscal year 2001 to ensure that PHAs will not have to \ncut all of their anticrime activities. While this increase will assist \nPHAs in continuing after-school programs, mentoring activities, and \nsafety patrols, I am concerned that PHAs may be forced to use the \nincreased funding to pay for rising utility costs, leading to a \nreduction in activities normally funded by the Drug Elimination Fund.\n  In addition to ensuring that public housing is maintained, this bill \nfully funds the Homeless Assistance Programs. I am pleased that the \nbill provides $100 million to fund Shelter Plus Care renewals. Shelter \nPlus Care provides permanent housing to formerly homeless people, and \nthis $100 million will maintain all of these housing units, while \nallowing communities to continue to meet the demand for additional \nhomeless services.\n  The conference report continues to expand the section 8 voucher \nprogram. I am concerned that we are only providing an additional 17,000 \nincremental vouchers, as compared to 79,000 vouchers provided last \nyear. While I had hoped we would be able to provide as many vouchers as \nlast year, I appreciate the effort of the appropriators to continue \nexpanding the voucher program even with such a tight budget allocation.\n  One area of concern in this bill is the cut in section 8 reserves \nfrom 2 months to 1 month. These reserves are used in the event of \nhigher program costs so that the section 8 program can continue to \nserve the same number of families. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, this cut could result in a decrease of almost 25,000 \nvouchers being used this year. This would be an unfortunate, and \ndevastating consequence. Fortunately, the appropriators included report \nlanguage directing HUD to ensure that PHAs can fund all of their \nvouchers, and I expect HUD to implement these changes so that the \nnumber of families receiving vouchers is not decreased.\n  Housing assistance for elderly people and those with disabilities is \nalso increased in this bill. Housing for the elderly is funded at $783 \nmillion, an increase of $4 million over the fiscal year 2001 level, and \nhousing for people with disabilities is funded at $240 million, an \nincrease of $23 million. In addition, I am pleased that the conference \nreport provides $277 million for Housing for Persons with AIDS, an \nincrease of $20 million over last year's funding level. This $20 \nmillion will ensure that additional communities in need of housing \nassistance for people with HIV and AIDs will receive Federal funding. \nThese increases will go a long way in providing needed housing to this \nnation's most vulnerable citizens.\n  At this time of economic uncertainly, it is imperative that we not \nturn our backs on low-income families in need of housing assistance. \nThough it is unfortunate that the administration's budget request \nforced us to forgo expanding affordable housing opportunities further, \nthe bill fully funds the HOME program, which is a primary vehicle for \nbuilding affordable rental housing. The need for new affordable rental \nhousing is growing, and I hope that we can work over the next year to \nsecure additional funding for housing construction.\n  Hard choices had to be made in hammering out a final version of this \nbill, and I understand that all of our priorities could not be funded \nat the desired levels. As a whole, I support this bill, and commend \nChairwoman Mikulski and the other members of the Appropriations \nCommittee for negotiating a bill that greatly improves on the \ninadequate budget request, and affirms our commitment to housing this \nNation's poor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring for the conference report to H.R. 2620, \nthe Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, \nand Independent Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002.\n  Including an advance appropriation into 2002 of $4.2 billion, the \nconference report provides $85.434 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority, of which $143 million is for defense spending. The \nconference report will result in new outlays in 2002 of $40,489 \nbillion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into \naccount, discretionary outlays for the conference report total $88.463 \nbillion in 2002. The conference report is within its section 302(b) \nallocation for both budget authority and outlays.\n  Included within the $85.434 billion in budget authority for 2002 is \n$1.5 billion in emergency-designated sending authority for the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency for disaster relief activities. The \nemergency funding, which is not estimated to result in any outlays in \n2002, is consistent with the revised 2002 budget reached between \nPresident Bush and Congressional leaders last month. Per section 314 of \nthe Congressional Budget Act, I have adjusted the Appropriations \nCommittee's allocation for 2002 by the amount of the emergency funding. \nIn addition, the conference report provides an advance appropriation \nfor section 8 renewals of $4.2 billion for 2003. That advance is \nallowed under the budget resolution adopted for 2002. Finally, the \nreport would reduce federal revenues by $32 million in 2002. By law, \nthe revenue loss, which results from changes made to certain HUD and \nEPA fees, will be placed on the PAYGO scorecard.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that a table displaying \nthe budget committee scoring of this bill be inserted in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   H.R. 2620, CONFERENCE REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND\n             INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002, SPENDING COMPARISONS--CONFERENCE REPORT\n                                            [In millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      General\n                                                    purpose \\1\\     Defense \\1\\      Mandatory         Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference report: \\2\\\n    Budget Authority............................          85,291             143          26,898         112,332\n    Outlays.....................................          88,326             137          26,662         115,125\nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\3\\\n    Budget Authority............................          85,415             138          26,898         112,451\n    Outlays.....................................          88,463               0          26,662         115,125\nPresident's request:\n    Budget Authority............................          83,221             138          26,898         110,257\n    Outlays.....................................          87,827             136          26,662         114,625\nHouse-passed:\n    Budget Authority............................          85,296             138          26,898         112,332\n    Outlays.....................................          87,909             136          26,662         114,707\n\n[[Page S11600]]\n\n \nSenate-passed:\n    Budget Authority............................          85,905             138          26,898         112,941\n    Outlays.....................................          88,320             136          26,662         115,118\n \n         CONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO:\nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\3\\\n    Budget Authority............................            -124               5               0            -119\n    Outlays.....................................               0               0               0               0\nPresident's request:\n    Budget Authority............................           2,070               5               0           2,075\n    Outlays.....................................             499               1               0             500\nHouse-passed:\n    Budget Authority............................              -5               5               0               0\n    Outlays.....................................             417               1               0             418\nSenate-passed:\n    Budget Authority............................            -614               5               0            -609\n    Outlays.....................................               6               1               0               7\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The split between general purpose and defense spending is for illustrative (i.e., nonenforceable) purposes\n  only.

Totals adjusted for consistency with scorekeeping\n  conventions.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the VA-HUD \nconference report, H.R. 2620. I appreciate the conferee's recognition \nof the importance of the Environmental Protection Agency's enforcement \nbudget, as well as full funding for state revolving loan funds. These \nare priorities for the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Another priority for the Committee is ensuring the American public \nthat when they turn on their faucets in their homes and businesses, day \ncare centers and hospitals, they will fill their cups with clean, safe \nwater. The new standard for arsenic in drinking water is a welcome \nmeasure to improve the quality of drinking water nationwide. Earlier \nthis year, I was concerned when this Administration announced its \nintention to review the new, lower arsenic standard issued by the last \nAdministration. Last week, I was relieved when EPA Administrator \nWhitman announced her intention to abide by the 10 parts per billion \nstandard as well as the 2006 compliance date.\n  As Administrator Whitman stated in her letter to me on October 31st, \nthe science clearly supports an arsenic standard no higher than 10 \nparts per billion. Over the past several months, three new independent \nscientific studies have been conducted by the National Academy of \nSciences, the National Drinking Water Advisory Council and EPA's \nScience Advisory Board. These studies tell us that arsenic in drinking \nwater is a public health concern, and that the levels allowed by \ncurrent law are much too high. In fact, these studies support a \nstandard lower than 10 parts per billion. EPA tells me they have \nreceived more than 55,000 comments from the public on this subject. \nClearly, this new, lower standard confers an important protection, \nsupported by many of our citizens.\n  I am aware of the concerns that some of my colleagues have expressed \nabout the ability of small communities to comply with the new arsenic \nstandard. I have read the conference report language directing EPA to \nstudy this issue, and I look forward to receiving EPA's report. Indeed, \nwith the significant public health concern associated with arsenic in \ndrinking water, we care greatly that all communities are able to \ncomply. Although current law contains affordability criteria as well as \nwaiver and variance provisions, I would hope that we can provide \nfinancial assistance to these communities, if they need it, so that \nthey can comply with the new standard in accordance with the compliance \ndeadline and without having to avail themselves of these mechanisms. \nWith such a pressing health issue at stake, what the public needs is \ntimely compliance, not delay.\n  I also thank the conferees for their attention to a hazardous waste \nissue known as the ``mixture and derived from rule.'' While EPA will \ncontinue to pursue exemptions for certain low-risk wastes, the \nconferees' commitment to supporting exemptions only where sound science \napplies will ensure protection of human health and the environment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the conference report.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased that the conference report on \nthe VA-HUD Appropriations bill includes a provision requiring the Bush \nadministration to end its delay of the Clinton rule establishing a \ntougher standard on arsenic in drinking water.\n  The statutory language is similar to the amendment I offered to this \nbill, which passed the Senate 97-1. This language will result in a 10 \nparts per billion standard for arsenic and will ensure the community's \nright to know when unhealthy levels of arsenic are present in the \ndrinking water\n  I am concerned, however, about language in the conference report. It \nsays that the Administrator should focus on developing procedures that \nwould result in extensions of time for small systems to comply with the \narsenic standard. Clearly, those extensions would have to be consistent \nwith the Safe Drinking Water Act requirements. But they would only \nresult in further delay.\n  In addition, the Administrator is asked to report to Congress on \nlegislative proposals that address further extensions of time for \ncompliance by small systems. The focus of EPA's limited resources \nshould be on helping these systems to accelerate compliance--by \nproviding technical and financial assistance--not on how to further \ndelay compliance.\n  As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, that will \nbe my focus. I will be working to provide funding for small communities \nto meet the 10 parts per billion standard, and I will not support \nlegislative proposals that provide additional extensions and delay even \nmore the time when all Americans have safer drinking water.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, while I will support the fiscal year 2002 \nVA-HUD and Independent Agencies conference report, I must express my \nstrong disappointment in the funding level included in the bill for \nYouthBuild. I strongly believe that YouthBuild proves that the Federal \nGovernment, working in cooperation with community-based non-profits, \ncan make a real difference in the lives of young people, the young \npeople that most Americans have given up on. During Senate \nconsideration of the VA-HUD appropriations bill, I successfully \nincluded an amendment to provide a $10 million increase in funding for \nYouthBuild. A similar amendment was included in the House, so the \namount allocated to YouthBuild was approximately $70 million in each \nbill.\n  While I understand the difficult allocation which the Subcommittee \noperates, I am nevertheless very disappointed that in the Conference \nReport included only $65 million for YouthBuild. With strong support \nfor YouthBuild in both the House and the Senate, I believe this program \ndeserved $70 million in fiscal year 2002. These additional funds would \nhave assisted YouthBuild in expanding its programs across the nation \nand assisted more at-risk youths.\n  YouthBuild is designed to serve those that, too often, have proven to \nbe the\n\n[[Page S11601]]\n\nhardest to serve. In return, they serve us, by getting job training, \nlearning a skill, completing their educations, and working in \ncommunities across the country rebuilding housing, providing \ndesperately needed affordable housing to other needy families.\n  Many low-income young adults are having great difficulty achieving \nsuccess in our society. YouthBuild attracts low-income young adults who \nhave dropped out of school. Many participants have been adjudicated, \nare from welfare families, have children already and live in public \nhousing projects. The premise of YouthBuild is that these young adults \nneed and deserve a second chance, that they are eager to live \nproductive, constructive lives, and we cannot afford not to provide \nthem with that second chance. Skills, education, inspiration and \nsupport provided by YouthBuild help them make the transition to the \njobs or higher education.\n  YouthBuild is the only national program that provides young adults an \nimmediately productive role in the community while at the same time \nproviding all of the following benefits to participants: basic \neducation toward a diploma; skills training toward a decent paying job; \nleadership development toward civic engagement; adult mentoring to help \novercome personal problems; and participation in a supportive mini-\ncommunity with a positive set of values.\n  Of those that enter YouthBuild, 67 percent complete the program. 85 \npercent of YouthBuild graduates are placed in college, or get a job \nwith an average wage of $7.53 per hour. Many become leaders in their \ncommunities, both while they are in the program and thereafter.\n  YouthBuild receives bipartisan support for one simple reason--it \nworks. The program fills a major gap in public policy by addressing the \nneeds of at-risk, out of school young adults in a more comprehensive \nway than any other existing national program. That is why I circulated \na letter with Senator Mike DeWine, which was cosigned by 63 Senators, \nin support of increasing funding for YouthBuild to $90 million.\n  YouthBuild program has grown from 15 sites which served 600 at-risk \nyouth in 1993, to 145 sites serving approximately 5,800 youth in 40 \nStates today. The engine of this growth has been the HUD appropriation. \nThe fuel has been the highly motivated local leaders whose commitment \nkeeps the program on the cutting edge of community needs. They have \nraised State, local, and private funds to supplement Federal funds and \nextend the reach of this important program. Major support from the Ford \nFoundation, the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, The DeWitt Wallace-\nReader's Digest Fund, local Rotary Clubs, The Home Depot, US Bancorp, \nand Metropolitan Life Insurance Company demonstrates that the network \nis highly regarded by leaders in the private sector. YouthBuild \nattracts, motivates, educates, and trains precisely the young people \nwho have fared least well in virtually all other existing systems.\n  The demand and need for YouthBuild programs far exceeds the resources \nallocated to it. Successful YouthBuild programs have 6 to 10 times more \napplicants each year than they can accept. In this period, with the \neconomy in need of qualified workers and the number of at-risk adults \nis increasing, it is excellent public policy to invest in a proven \nnational model that can bring these young adults into employment, post-\nsecondary education, and constructive civic engagement.\n  The best way for me to explain to you the importance of YouthBuild is \nto tell you about one the YouthBuild programs. YouthBuild Springfield, \nMA, has received more than 250 applications for its services since it \nopened in 1999, and has been able to serve 80 young people in a \ncomprehensive, year round programs which includes education and \nemployment training, as well as community and leadership development. \nOver half of the participants are young women, many with dependent \nchildren. All of the participants commit to being drug free, \nparticipate in weekly drug education workshops, and agree to random \ndrug testing. They provide four therapy groups each week and access \nprivate therapy as needed. They have maintained a 77 percent retention \nrate, 86 percent attendance rate, and 82 percent placement rate at an \naverage wage of $8.10 per hour. Another 10 percent have gone on to \nfurther training or college.\n  With the strong bipartisan support for YouthBuild, I am hopeful that \nwe will be able to increase the appropriation for this important \nprogram in fiscal year 2003.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent the vote on adoption of this \nconference report to accompany H.R. 2620, the VA/HUD appropriations \nbill, occur at 4:30 p.m. today and that if all time for debate has \nexpired, the time until 4:30 p.m. be equally divided and controlled by \nthe two managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator from \nTexas such time as she may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the VA/HUD bill \nwhich has a number of good parts to it. I know the managers have worked \nvery hard to divide up the dollars. It is always hard when there are \nnot as many dollars as projects.\n  I specifically want to talk about the issue of NASA. I know of the \ngreat concerns, because it is very obvious from the bill, and, frankly, \nthey are valid concerns, about the management of the space station and \nthe cost overruns. I also understand there are concerns about the \noverruns hurting other programs within NASA.\n  When you are doing something new, when you are pushing the envelope \nof technology, you cannot always be precise. This is not to say some of \nthe overruns have been invalid, incomprehensible in some ways, and I \ndon't understand some of them myself. I do not think you can set an \nexact budget when you are experimenting. We all know you have to have \nsome freedom in science in order to be able to make a mistake, learn \nfrom the mistake, and do something else.\n  I appreciate the $150 million cut in the original Senate bill was \nhalved to $75 million in the conference. I hope NASA can work within \nthat $75 million and the rest of the budget for the space station to \ncontinue to move ahead. I am told by the people at NASA it will delay \nthe space station, but it will certainly not kill it.\n  But I think the overriding issue is the one that was mentioned by the \nSenator from Missouri, and that is we need to have a new administrator \nappointed for NASA right away. Dan Goldin has done a terrific job, but \nhe is leaving at the middle of this month. So we need to have that \nleadership.\n  I urge that the new leader of NASA look at what NASA can do. Let's \ndecide, what is the science that we want to create? What is the goal of \nNASA? NASA has given us so much in the past, in new technologies that \ncreate new industries and new jobs. It has been part of the \nrevitalization of our economy. We want to continue to push ahead. We \nwant to continue to be the leader of the world in technology. To do \nthat, we are going to have to have a clear vision for NASA and new \nleadership.\n  I thank the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from Missouri for \nworking with me to make sure we do have the expenses that must be paid \nfor NASA to stay in place. I think their concerns are valid, but let's \nnot throw out the baby with the bath water. We cannot starve NASA if we \nare going to stay in the forefront of technology.\n  I look forward to working with the Senators from Maryland and \nMissouri during the next year, hopefully with a new Administrator from \nNASA, so we can have a clear vision and we can continue America's lead \nin technology that will have a major impact, not only on our future \ndefense and our future programs, but also for our economy for the \nfuture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know the Senator from New Mexico \nwishes to speak. We have guaranteed him this time. I say to the Senator \nfrom Texas, she has been a longstanding advocate of the space program. \nI have traveled with her to Texas to see the first-class, world-class \nresearch that is going on there.\n  I, too, look forward to working with the new Administrator of NASA. \nWe\n\n[[Page S11602]]\n\nshould also recognize the current one because I think he has tried his \nbest. But we have to have a NASA for the 21st century. I look forward \nto working with her to be able to do that.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleagues for their important discussion. I am \nnow pleased to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Mikulski and Senator \nBond for their sensitivity to the issue of the new arsenic standards in \nwater and its impact on thousands of communities throughout America.\n  Let me say, I have given up on attempting to challenge the 10-parts-\nper-billion standard the administration has now found to be the \nstandard that is necessary in drinking water in America for the water \nto be healthy and safe. Saying that I cannot fight it any longer does \nnot mean I agree with it, nor that I think the Congress can ignore the \nconsequences of this new standard on many communities across this land.\n  More than 140 communities in my home State of New Mexico face this \nnew burden at an estimated cost of more than $440 million, from the \nsmallest of water supply systems to the very largest in the city of \nAlbuquerque.\n  Why would one be concerned enough about this to bring it to the floor \nof the Senate? It is a highly controversial issue as to whether the \nexact same standards on arsenic should apply in every community across \nthe breadth and width of America because if you come from a State such \nas New Mexico, Nevada, West Virginia, Utah, Idaho, and many more, \nwhatever human beings have lived in those parts of America, from the \nearliest arrival of men to the modern American living in these \ncommunities, there has been arsenic in the water that did not come from \nanything that human beings did by their actions or nonactions. Arsenic \nwas in the water for all the time that humans have lived and found this \nwater and drank of it. The arsenic was there because of the rock \nformations, that geology, over which the rainwater, after it rippled \ndown, ran and percolated into lakes and reservoirs and areas \nunderground which were then used for drinking water.\n  Many hundreds of thousands of people drank of that water with no ill \neffects. I know it is almost the wrong thing to say scientifically, but \nit seems as if it is factual that the citizens in those areas to which \nI have alluded, including my State of New Mexico, are healthier, \nwhatever is allegedly the damage that arsenic in the water produces.\n  In other words, the diseases that are attributable to having more \narsenic in the water are present less frequently in States such as mine \nthan they are in other States that have not, for all this period of \ntime, had drinking water which had naturally flowing arsenic as a \ncomponent of the compound.\n  Since I believe that, it doesn't mean I am advising that we not \nfollow the law. But what I am suggesting is that soon small, medium-\nsized, and large communities in all of these States, including Nevada, \nincluding West Virginia, including New Mexico, including Arizona and \nmany others, are going to start getting the estimates as to how they \nmake these small water systems, these medium-sized ones, and these \nlarge ones--how do you get them down to 10 parts per billion of \narsenic. They are going to get these big estimates.\n  They are going to get estimates of rebuilding whole waterworks for \nthis purpose. Then the citizens are going to be asking, after seeing \nthe headlines: What is this all about?\n  What I think we should have done in this conference is we should have \nlet the Department--the Environmental Protection Agency--which adopted \nthe new standard, deal with it in a normal manner. Actually, they would \nhave 6 years before the implementation date. But they could at least \nwork with cities. They could perhaps work on waivers attributable to \ngood research which said if they are given 2 more years, they are going \nto come out with new science and it is going to be much less costly to \nLas Vegas, NV, and Reno, NV.\n  I see my friend, the junior Senator from Nevada is here.\n  But we went one step further in this bill and we prohibited the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency from doing anything other than \nenforcing this standard, literally, specifically, no exemptions, no \nwaivers.\n  I say to the two Senators who are managing this bill, the Chair and \nSenator Bond have been most understanding. They have both pledged if we \ncan find a way to help with this, by either partial financing or in \nsome reasonable way, they are going to do that.\n  I want to tell the Senate there is some exciting research going on. \nThat is getting funded, too. So we might make a breakthrough where we \ndon't have to clean the arsenic out of the water in the manner expected \nof us today. There will be a newer way, cheaper, more reasonable, and \nperhaps we can get something done.\n  To reiterate, I thank Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond for their \nsensitivity to the issue of the new arsenic standard and its impact on \nthousands of communities throughout the nation. I am not arguing \nagainst the new standard of 10 parts per billion, since the \nadministration has announced that it will support this level of arsenic \nin our water. But, we all know that achieving this new level will cost \nliterally billions of dollars for communities, most of which will never \nbe able to afford the equipment to meet this standard by the year 2006.\n  I wish that we in the conference on VA-HUD could have addressed this \nissue in a substantive fashion, perhaps by establishing direct funding \nto help these communities. We were not able to do so, but I am assured \nby the many Senators who agreed with me that this issue is critical. We \nmust establish a new program to help through grants and loans the \ncommunities that face virtual ruin if they try to fund this new \nequipment themselves. More than 140 communities in my home state alone \nface this new burden, at an estimated cost of more than $440 million.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join with me, and with others, like \nSenator Reid of Nevada, as we try to forge a program as soon as \npossible, perhaps even later this session of Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Let me conclude by thanking the Senator from Missouri \nfor all his help and cooperation, and his staff--all of whom were \nworking on it. I take this opportunity to thank the people who worked \ndirectly with the bill, worked directly in the Senate.\n  There are a lot of people who work in this institution.\n  We are coming up on the second month anniversary of the aerial attack \non the United States of America. I thank all the people here at the \nCapitol who continue to show up every day and every way to support us \nso we can keep democracy's doors open.\n  First, I thank our young pages. They are high school students. They \ncould have gone back home and been prom queens and football heroes, but \ninstead they chose to serve their country by being right here in this \nChamber. We thank them for their support for us and the confidence \ntheir families showed in us.\n  All of the people who run the food service, who run the elevators, \nand who are trying to clean up the Hart Building need to be \nacknowledged. By supporting us, they really support democracy. As we \npass this bill that honors America's veterans and protects our homeland \nsecurity, I thank all the people from the pages to the elevator \noperators, to the carpenters, and so on, who just show up every day and \nhelp us keep democracy's door open and functioning.\n  I bring you the VA-HUD bill and say God bless the U.S. Senate and God \nbless America. Let's vote and pass this bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I submit a report of the committee of \nconference on the bill, H.R. 2620, and ask for its immedidate \nconsideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2620) making appropriations for the Departments of Veterans \n     Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and for sundry \n     independent agencies, boards, commission, corporations, and \n     offices for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2002, and \n     for other purposes, having met have agreed that the House \n     recede from its disagreement to the amendment of the Senate \n     and agree to the same with an amendment, signed by all of the \n     conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The Senate proceeded to consider the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of November 6, 2001, at page H7787.)\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, it is with a great deal of pride that I \nbring this conference report to the Senate. I take this opportunity to \nthank my Republican colleague, the ranking member, Senator Bond of \nMissouri. This has been a year of tumultuous change in our country.\n  On Tuesday a year ago, we thought we had elected the President. It \nwent on for 35 days--unprecedented. We were turned into a 50-50 \nSenate--again unprecedented.\n  Senator Bond chaired the committee in January and then, after Senator \nJeffords' decision, the reins passed to me.\n  I say publicly, I thank Senator Bond for the graciousness in the way \nhe transited the gavel and the chairmanship to me. He did it with \ngraciousness and efficiency. His staff could not have been more \ncooperative or collegial. Because of that, our subcommittee didn't miss \na beat, and we didn't miss a buck. We went to work on behalf of \nveterans, housing, the environment, investments in space, science, \ntechnology, as well as other agencies. I thank him for that.\n  I bring to the Senate's attention a summary of the bill. This act \nprovides for a total of $112.7 billion for all the programs within the \nbill, which is $4.8 billion or 4 percent over the fiscal year\n\n[[Page S11595]]\n\n2001 level. This includes $27.3 billion in mandatory funding, an \nincrease of $1.8 billion over the fiscal year 2001 level, and $85.4 \nbillion in discretionary spending, which is an increase of $3 billion \nover last year.\n  What this bill essentially does is meet compelling human need. It \nmeets compelling human need in terms of our veterans, in terms of the \npoor, meeting the day-to-day needs of the working poor. It helps \nrebuild our neighborhoods and communities. Through its funding for \nFEMA, it protects our homeland security. And it invests in science and \ntechnology through NASA and the National Science Foundation.\n\n  For our veterans, we have increased veterans health care by over $1 \nbillion from last year, bringing it to a total of $21.3 billion. This \nwould allow the VA healthcare system to serve 4 million patients \nthrough 2002. This conference agreement also provides the VA the \nability to open 33 new outpatient clinics. It would also continue to \nallow research and treatment of chronic disease; diagnosis and \ntreatment for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's; look at the issues again of \nspecial populations, such as stroke and spinal cord injury; and \ncontinue its groundbreaking research in the area of prostate cancer.\n  In terms of our veterans, we also make a substantial effort to reduce \nthe claim time for how long a veteran has to wait in order to get their \ndisability benefit. They had to often stand in line when they were in \nthe U.S. military. But after the way they serve their country, they \nshould not have to stand in line for almost a year in order to see if \ntheir disability claim can be processed. We are working on a bipartisan \nbasis to shorten that.\n  As to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, we had three \ngoals: Expand housing opportunity for the poor, rebuild our \nneighborhoods, and help special-need populations. To do that, we have \nrenewed all the section 8 housing vouchers. We have funded this program \nat $15.6 billion. This is $1.7 billion over last year.\n  At the same time, we restored cuts proposed by the President to the \ncritical public housing capital program by funding it at $2.8 billion. \nWe have increased funding for the public housing operating cost by $250 \nmillion over last year for a total of $3.5 billion.\n  Knowing that many of our colleagues believe the decisions are best \nmade locally, we wanted to keep our commitment to the community \ndevelopment block grant money, and we have increased that by over $200 \nmillion. This year CDBG will be funded at $5 billion.\n  For other HUD programs, we have continued at last year's level the \nfunding for brownfields, housing for the elderly, and housing for the \ndisabled. But we have, in order to create home ownership, included \nlanguage to raise the FHA loan limit for multifamily housing by 25 \npercent this year. This came from the private sector, home builders, as \nwell as the AFL-CIO. I believe this will mean more rental property will \nbe available. We cannot voucher our way out of our housing crisis. We \nneed a new production program. This has long been a position held by my \ncolleague, Senator Bond. I look forward to the recommendation of the \nMillennial Housing Commission and the Commission on Senior Housing. We \nlook to those in the private sector and the nonprofit sector to give us \nguidance on what a 21st century HUD should look like, which will create \nreal hope and opportunity. We provided the inspector general with no \nless than $5 million, and this will also be going after predatory \nlending.\n\n  Let's move on now to EPA. For EPA, the conference agreement provides \n$7.9 billion, an increase of $587 million above the budget level. This \nis $75 million above what we funded last year. What do we get for our \nmoney? First of all, we get EPA enforcement. This is funded at last \nyear's level of $465 million. We can keep the current level of \nenforcement.\n  The conference agreement also keeps our commitment to clean and safe \nwater by fully funding the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund at \n$1.35 billion, which is an increase over the President's budget \nrequest. We also fully fund the Drinking Water SRF at $850 million, an \nincrease of $27 million over the President's budget request.\n  This country is facing an enormous backlog of funding for water \ninfrastructure projects. Every single one of my colleagues talks to me \nabout sewer or water infrastructure projects, failing septic tanks, how \nto comply with the new arsenic requirement; we have aging systems in my \nown region, as do New Orleans and Chicago. I could give every single \nSenator a billion dollars to take back to their State, and it would be \njust a drop in the bucket for this need.\n  I hope, as we look at the stimulus package, we look at how we can \nfund clean water and safe drinking water projects because, at the end \nof the day, I believe we will stimulate the local economy and create \njobs but have value for our dollar.\n  We also kept our commitment to cleanup. We provided $1.27 billion for \nthe cleanup of Superfund sites. This also includes $95 million for \nbrownfields. We have included $22.6 million for the National Estuary \nProgram. Again, we have worked closely with the administrator.\n  For FEMA, we maintain our commitment to protecting our homeland by \nproviding FEMA with $3 billion. We provide $2.1 billion for disaster \nrelief to ensure that we are ready to respond to any future disaster. \nWe have also worked very closely with Joe Allbaugh, the FEMA Director, \nto be sure we respond to the needs of New York and local communities \nand, at the same time, are ready for those natural disasters like \nhurricanes and tornadoes that could affect us.\n  We also wanted to support America's heroes, our firefighters, and in \nthis bill we fund the Fire Grant Program at $150 million in order to be \nable to fund the firefighters' need of protective gear and equipment. \nThis program is authorizing $3 billion. We would prefer to do more and \nlook forward to doing more in the stimulus package. We understand \nSenator Byrd is going to work closely with us to do this.\n  In order to be protected by the firefighters, we need to protect them \nand make sure they have the protective gear, respiratory gear, and the \ntechnological tools to go into horrific situations. In order to be able \nto protect us, they need to have the right equipment. Many firefighters \nin America are volunteers; we ask them to do it on their own time and \non their own dime. We can't protect our firefighters and give them the \nequipment they need based on bingo and fish fries at the local level--\nalthough, I sure like those bingo games and fish fries. They are fun \nthings to do, but they are not a reliable funding stream. We have to \nback them.\n\n  Let's go to NASA. We provide $14.8 billion for NASA programs, which \nis $500 million over last year. Our top priority remains the safety of \nour astronauts. We made a significant investment in shuttle upgrades, \nincluding $207 million allocated for safety upgrades to the space \nshuttle. By improving the safety of the shuttle, we reduce the risks to \nour astronauts.\n  We fully fund the rest of the shuttle program at over $3 billion for \nfiscal year 2002. For the space station, we redirected $75 million to \nother pressing needs such as safety upgrades to the shuttle and other \nscience and aeronautics programs. We know that former astronaut Tom \nYoung is taking a look at our space station. We like it; we think it is \nvery important to our country and to the world. But we also believe \nthat the management of the space station has had a fiscal \npermissiveness that has allowed unacceptable cost overruns. They had \nover $4 billion in overruns. We can't let that stand.\n  This independent review team, chaired by former astronaut Tom Young, \nhas given us a new roadmap for the station. I can assure the Senate and \nour taxpayers that we will be holding hearings and meetings to be able \nto ensure that we keep our commitment to the space station, do our \nresearch, keep our astronauts safe, but at the same time have fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  For the National Science Foundation, the conference agreement \nprovides $4.8 billion, an increase of 8.4 percent over last year. This \nrepresents a downpayment on an effort initiated by Senator Bond and \nmyself to double the NSF budget. We want to do that in 5 years. I think \nwe might have to wait 6 years to do it, but we are convinced it is in \nthe Nation's long-term interest that funding for basic research in all \nscience and engineering disciplines must increase substantially.\n  We have increased the funding in several areas for research, such as \ninformation technology and nanotechnology\n\n[[Page S11596]]\n\nand, of course, in agricultural biotech, on which, of course, the \nranking member has been a leader. But also, at the same time, we really \ntry to back our young researchers so that young Americans will choose \nscience and scientific research as a career.\n  We have also maintained the Corporation for National Service. \nVoluntarism is our national trademark, and this agreement maintains our \ncommitment to AmeriCorps and other agencies within it.\n  There are also 25 other agencies, but I am not going to go through \nall 25. We have kept our commitment to them. I thank the President for \ngiving us the opportunity to work with very excellent Cabinet people. \nAgain, we were under very difficult circumstances, with a late start, \nbut there was an orderly transition.\n  I think we have met our charge to the compelling needs of our \nconstituents, the long-range needs of our Nation and done it with \nfiscal stewardship, which I believe the taxpayers require from us.\n  Mr. President, that concludes my summary of the bill.\n  I thank Paul Carliner, Gabriel Batkin, and Joel Widder of my staff \nfor giving me the support that I needed. I thank John Kamarck and Cheh \nKim from Senator Bond's staff for their cooperation and collegiality.\n  Mr. President, I hope that at the conclusion of our debate, when we \ntake the rollcall, the Senate will support this conference report. They \ncan go back and talk to every single one of their constituents, whether \nit is a veteran from the ``greatest generation,'' or the firefighters, \nthe warriors of this generation, or the scientists who are giving us \nthe ideas to keep America strong and safe, or the poor who depend on us \neven at this time. We have a great bill and I hope that this bill will \npass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the conferees of this bill for \ntheir hard work in completing this conference report for this \nlegislation.\n  The report provides critical Federal funding for the Departments of \nVeterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent \nAgencies. The conference report spends at a level of 4.1 percent higher \nthan the level enacted in fiscal year 2001.\n  In real dollars, this is $2.1 billion in additional spending above \nthe amount requested by the President, and a $4.4 billion increase in \nspending from last year.\n  Once again I find myself in the unpleasant position of speaking \nbefore my colleagues about parochial projects in yet another conference \nreport. I have identified over $1 billion in earmarks, which is greater \nthan the cost of the earmarks in the conference report passed last \nyear. Last year, it was $970 million. So far this year, the total of \nappropriations pork-barrel spending has already hit a staggering $9 \nbillion.\n  Before I go into some specifics--and it will not be many on this \nbill--I would like to quote from an article by Deroy Murdoch of the \nScripps Howard News Service that was published on October 14, 2001. He \nsays:\n\n       Each dollar spent on pork-barrel projects is one less \n     dollar that can be devoted to the War on Terror. This \n     inescapable fact somehow has escaped members of Congress. \n     While senators and representatives swiftly and wisely \n     approved $40 billion in recovery and defense funds after the \n     Sept. 11 massacre, they quickly relapsed into old habits.\n       Congress again is spending money as recklessly and \n     foolishly as it did on Sept. 10. Even as U.S. warships steam \n     toward the Persian Gulf, Citizens Against Government Waste, a \n     Washington-based fiscal watchdog group, has calculated in \n     military terms the opportunity cost of business as usual.\n       Sidewinder missiles sell for $41,300 each. . . . Tomahawk \n     Cruise missiles are $1 million apiece while one F-15 fighter \n     jet costs $15 million. Pork projects chew right through cash \n     that could purchase these and other weapons the Pentagon will \n     need to crush the international terror network and its state \n     sponsors.\n       For instance, on Sept. 13, the Senate adopted the fiscal \n     2002 Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary Appropriations \n     Bill. Consider just several items the Senate approved while \n     the Pentagon and Ground Zero still smoldered:\n       --$2 million for the Oregon Groundfish Outreach Program and \n     $850,000 for Chesapeake Bay Oyster Research.\n       Cost: 69 sidewinders.\n       --$6 million for the National Infrastructure Institute in \n     Portsmouth, New Hampshire.\n       Cost: Six cruise missiles.\n       --$204 million for the Advanced Technology Program, a \n     quintessential corporate welfare boondoggle, for which the \n     Bush administration requested only $13 million.\n       Cost: Thirteen F-15 fighters.\n       Even more maddening is a brand-new bill to expand farm \n     subsidies one year before the existing spending plan expires. \n     The Farm Security Act would increase agricultural pork by \n     $73.1 billion over the next 10 years. Added to the $96.9 \n     billion budget baseline, Uncle Sam would plow $170 billion \n     into the ground through the year 2011.\n       This bill authorizes $101 million for honey producers. The \n     once-terminated wool and mohair program rises again, $202 \n     million strong. Peanut farmers can expect $3.48 billion. This \n     bill would also revive a $37.1 billion in ``counter-cyclical \n     assistance'' which was scrapped in 1996.\n\n  I talked about this at another time.\n\n       The U.S. Agriculture Department released a study last month \n     that describes these subsidies as spectacularly wasteful and \n     fundamentally unfair. Forty-seven percent of agricultural \n     payments go to commercial farms with average household \n     incomes of $135,397, more than 2\\1/2\\ times the average \n     American household's $51,855 in earnings.\n       According to the Associated Press, just 10 percent of farm \n     owners shared 63 percent of last year's $27 billion in \n     federal agriculture payments.\n       Media tycoon Ted Turner received farm aid, as did Portland \n     Trail Blazer Scottie Pippen. Modestly paid waitresses and \n     school bus drivers pay twice for largesse--first through \n     taxes, then again as agricultural price supports hike their \n     grocery bills. . . .\n       These legislative hijinks are bad enough in peacetime. \n     America is at war. Soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines are \n     kissing their loved ones goodbye and shipping out to face a \n     vicious and bloodthirsty enemy lurking in foreign shadows. \n     Right now, Congress should grow up and stop treating the \n     domestic budget as a political Toys R Us. Americans already \n     are making huge sacrifices. Weak tourist revenues have \n     lowered the curtains on five Broadway shows. Hotel beds have \n     gone empty as conferences have been canceled, and weddings \n     have been scaled back or postponed. Major U.S. airlines have \n     fired 87,000 employees since terror struck.\n       Amid such national belt-tightening, it is beyond ugly to \n     watch public servants loosen their belts as their pork-laden \n     bellies swell. If the American people must live with less, so \n     must their representatives.\n\n  I would like to read the words of OMB Director Mitch Daniels who said \nthat in time of war:\n\n       Everything ought to be held up to scrutiny. . . . \n     Situations like this can have a clarifying benefit. People \n     who could not identify a low priority or lousy program before \n     may now see the need.\n\n  Mr. President, we obviously have not seen the need in this conference \nreport, and I intend to clarify some items stuffed in the bill. Let us \ntake a look at this year's porkbarrel spending projects in the VA-HUD \nconference report before us.\n  No. 10: $1 million for Spring Hill College in Mobile, AL, for \nconstruction of the Regional Library Resource Center;\n  No. 9: $175,000 for the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, CA, for \nconstruction needs of the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum;\n  No. 8: $1 million for Dubuque, IA, for the development of an American \nRiver Museum;\n  No. 7: $300,000 for the Central Missouri Lake of the Ozarks \nConvention and Visitor Bureau Community Center;\n  No. 6: $750,000 for the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development \nat Iowa State University;\n  No. 5: $1 million for the Mid-Atlantic Aerospace Complex in West \nVirginia.\n  You will notice, Mr. President, each one of those is earmarked to a \nspecific location. For example, in my State of Arizona, we just voted a \nbond issue to expand our convention facilities. They are not going to \nhave to do that in the Central Missouri Lake of the Ozarks because they \nare going to build a convention center, and we are going to give them \n$300,000 to do so.\n  Again, No. 5, $1 million for the State of West Virginia, which seems \nto pop up quite a bit.\n  There is an additional $250,000 to Maui for the control of nuisance \nseaweed accumulations on the beaches of Kihei, Maui, HI;\n  $100,000 for the Memphis Zoo in Memphis, TN, for the Northwest \nPassage Campaign;\n  $140,000 for the city of El Reno, OK, for development of a trolley \nsystem;\n  And $190,000 for the city of Spartanburg, SC, for the Motor Racing \nMuseum of the South.\n  Mr. President, we are in a war. Isn't this really unconscionable? \nIsn't it\n\n[[Page S11597]]\n\nreally unacceptable? Isn't it really quite a commentary that the \nearmarks in this year's bill are higher than last year's bill? Isn't it \ninteresting that each one of these is earmarked for a specific place? \nPerhaps the Presiding Officer's home State would like to compete for \nmoney for a Motor Racing Museum of the Midwest since we are giving \nmoney to Spartanburg, SC, for the Motor Racing Museum of the South.\n  We are now about to have a big fight with the President and my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle about increased spending. How \ncan my colleagues on this side of the aisle go into that battle with \nclean hands when we continue to add porkbarrel project after porkbarrel \nproject--$9 billion so far of unrequested, unauthorized items that are \nspecifically earmarked for certain powerful members of the \nAppropriations Committee. That is not right, Mr. President.\n  Sooner or later, we are going to educate the American people about \nthis, and it is going to come to a halt. I am afraid it may be later \nrather than sooner. It continues to lurch out of control, and no one \nbelieves we have enough money for defense spending. No one believes \nthat. That is why we are spending extra money on defense, and yet these \nprojects continue to be added both in conference as well as in the \nbills themselves, and it is not acceptable.\n  It is not acceptable. If the average American knew more about this, \nthey would reject it.\n  I intend to do as I have done in the past to make sure as many \nAmericans understand where their tax dollars are spent.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am proud to rise in strong support of a \nconference report on H.R. 2620, the VA-HUD fiscal year 2002 \nappropriations bill. The chair of the committee, Senator Mikulski, has \ndone an excellent job in crafting this measure. I am deeply grateful \nfor her leadership.\n  She was kind enough to talk about the smooth transition. It was not \nsomething we desired, but it was something that worked extremely well \nbecause we have had the good fortune of being able to work closely on \nthis measure for a number of years. In fact, it was a seamless \ntransition.\n  I believe the legitimate wishes and concerns of Members of this body, \nthe needs of the veterans, those who depend upon housing for Federal \nGovernment assistance, those who depend upon the Environmental \nProtection Agency to clean up our rivers and our waters and our air, \nare well served by this measure.\n  I add my compliments to Congressman Walsh, the chair of the House VA-\nHUD Committee, and Congressman Mollohan, the ranking member. This bill \nhas been a very tough one because of the limitation on funding, but I \nbelieve it strikes the right balance. We have met many of the \nadministration's funding priorities, and I compliment the \nadministration for not looking to create a series of new programs but \ninstead focusing on some exceptions, maintaining existing program \nlevels and reforming program implementation to ensure that agencies can \ndeliver assistance under existing program requirements.\n  The Senator from New Mexico has asked for a few minutes out of my \ntime, so I ask the Presiding Officer to notify me when I have used 9 \nminutes of time. I do wish to reserve some time for Senator Domenici \nfor a very pressing issue he must address.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, the respective leaders have asked the \nvote be held at 4:30, so we are going to have some extra time. We can \naccommodate the Senator for as much time as he or the distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico would like to have.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I thank my chairman. I will try to be \nreasonably brief, but there are some important things I wish to \ninclude.\n  To return to the analysis of the bill, the VA and veterans needs \nremain the highest priority of the bill. The funding decisions in this \nbill are designed to ensure the best quality of medical care for our \nveterans and to keep the best doctors in the VA system. Furthermore, \nSenator Mikulski and I are committed deeply to meeting the medical \nneeds of veterans, and we are working with the VA and the \nadministration to ensure the successful implementation of the new CARES \nprocess, which is designed to assure that VA has the facilities it \nneeds, that targets the services and the medical care throughout the \ncountry, and gets rid of unneeded facilities that drain money away from \nneeded care for veterans.\n  In addition, the VA-HUD bill appropriates some $30.2 billion for the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, an increase of $1.7 \nbillion. This includes funding to renew all expiring section 8 \ncontracts and provides for 18,000 incremental vouchers. I do remain \ndeeply concerned that vouchers do not work well in many housing \nmarkets. We do, as the chairman of the subcommittee mentioned, need to \ndevelop new production programs that assist extremely low-income \nfamilies in particular. This is a need that we must address, and we \nlook forward to working with the authorizing committees, the Millennium \nHousing Commission, and others, to ensure it is addressed.\n\n  The bill also reflects our continuing support for CDBG, the HOME \nProgram, homeless assistance, FHA mortgage insurance, and assistance \nfor abatement of lead hazards in housing.\n  As for the Environmental Protection Agency, the bill includes a $587 \nmillion increase to $7.9 billion, $74 million over the fiscal year 2001 \nlevel. The bill maintains funding of the clean water State revolving \nfund at $1.35 billion and drinking water at $850 million. I cannot \nemphasize enough the importance of continuing to maintain funding for \nthese State revolving funds.\n  The clean water infrastructure financing alone, there is a need in \nthis country for some $200 billion over the next 20 years, excluding \nreplacement costs and operation and maintenance.\n  I want to address some comments made about spending characterized in \nthis bill as porkbarrel. The Members of this body know this bill funds \nmonies that go through to State and local governments. This is a \nmeasure that includes funds for the Community Development Block Grant \nProgram. Under that program, we take Federal dollars and send it back \nto the local communities so Governors, mayors, and city council members \ncan allocate the needs in their community.\n  Is that porkbarrel? I happen to think that providing money for needed \ncommunity improvements is not porkbarrel spending. This measure also \nsends, as I just said, $1.35 billion for the clean water state \nrevolving funds to clean up sewers, and $850 million for safe drinking \nwater. Is that porkbarrel? I do not think so.\n  The greatest need for many of our communities, whether they be large \nor small communities, is to have the money they need to develop \nprojects that will make them strong communities and to assure that the \nwater systems are healthy. We provide that money.\n  Now my colleague was addressing the fact that out of that money, we \nsend back for community development block grants some 6.8 percent. Less \nthan 10 percent has been designated by Members of the House or the \nSenate for particular high need activities and investments in \ncommunities in their State.\n  Do Members of Congress somehow know less about the needs of their \ncommunities for community development? Do Members of Congress somehow \nknow less about the need for critical improvements to water and sewer \nsupply systems? I think not.\n  This money goes to those communities that have needs for tremendous \nefforts to improve community life, whether it be facilities that will \nbring in more business or whether it be money to go to drinking water \nor cleaning up sewer water in the States. This is one of the areas \nwhere those legislators in Congress who are concerned and who pay \nattention to the needs of their State can find areas where there are \npressing needs. I believe, by and large, they do an excellent job, and \nwe do a good job.\n  One may quarrel with some of the decisions made by local officials on \ncommunity development block grants. One may quarrel with some of the \ndecisions made on clean water in State revolving funds for drinking \nwater, but the fact\n\n[[Page S11598]]\n\nremains there are tremendous needs in all of these areas. So I am very \nproud of the fact we are able to assist States, communities, and \nlocalities in taking care of their needs.\n  Mr. President, I do not see the Senator from New Mexico. I believe we \nhave additional time remaining so I will continue and intend to address \nthe subject he was going to address because I know he feels very \nstrongly about it. One of the major controversial areas we have \naddressed in this bill concerns the level of arsenic in drinking water. \nIn this case, the bill supports the current regulation of 10 parts per \nbillion for arsenic levels in drinking water, and while this level is \nsupported by a number of scientific studies, the requirement that the \ncommunities must meet these new requirements by 2006 is very troubling \nbecause there are communities in the United States, especially \ncommunities in the West, communities in New Mexico and Idaho and other \nStates, where there are high levels of naturally occurring arsenic in \nthe water.\n  Unfortunately, for communities which are small and do not have the \nfinancial ability to meet these requirements, the possibility is some \nvery unwanted consequences of forcing through a regulation on all \ncommunities. We provide some relief in these communities through a \ntemporary waiver. Our colleagues on the authorizing committees objected \nto this approach even though the leaders of the committee on both the \nHouse and Senate sides believed it was warranted. The conference report \ndefers to those committees and suggests the authorizing committees pay \nattention to an evaluation to be done by EPA on the affordability of \nthese projects and how a small system variance and exemption programs \nshould be implemented for arson. This is a serious issue. Congress will \nhave to address and balance this need over the next few years, both the \nfinancial burdens and health concerns faced by the small communities on \nthe new arsenic standards.\n\n  To be blunt, the last thing we need is to push these communities, \nwith high arsenic levels in their drinking water, to abandon local \nmunicipal water systems which are reducing the levels of arsenic and \nforce residents to go back to untreated and unregulated wells where \nthey would be getting potentially higher levels of arsenic and \npotentially being exposed to greater health risks, not only from \narsenic but from other sources of water pollution that would be treated \nin the municipal water systems.\n  For FEMA, the conference report includes $1.5 billion in emergency \ndisaster assistance, funding for firefighters, and flood mapping and \nmitigation. I join with my colleague from Maryland in expressing my \ngratitude for the way FEMA moved in. They have our highest \nappreciation. They stepped up to the plate and assisted the citizens of \nour Nation during this time of need.\n  I will address for my colleagues the fact, at the request of \nRepresentatives and Senators from New York, that we took special note \nof the economic needs of the people and businesses in New York that \nhave been devastated by the tragic terrorist attack of September 11. \nThe President allocated $700 million for New York for the VA/HUD \ncommunity development block grant. In this bill we included authority \nfor HUD to meet these needs through existing programs, including broad \nauthority to waive a part of the statute--except for labor standards, \nenvironmental standards, fair housing, and antidiscrimination--to meet \nthese truly pressing needs. I understand a community economic \ndevelopment corporation has been established to allocate these funds.\n  I believe the Governor and the mayor set up a Lower Manhattan \nRedevelopment Corporation that will hand out the funds. I raise this \npoint because today the Environment and Public Works Committee passed \nout of committee a new measure setting up a different form of \nallocating these funds. I caution members of that committee, on which I \nhappen to serve, that we not set up a competing structure. We need to \ndo the job well. We need to do it right. We need to do it one time and \nnot have two different structures stumbling all over each other. We \nhave, we think, dealt with the concerns, and we will be happy to work \nwith friends and colleagues from New York to make sure we do it \neffectively.\n  Finally, I mention in addition to funding NASA at $14.78 billion, we \nhave expressed grave concerns about the serious cost overruns. The \ncosts of the International Space Station have continued to grow, over \n$4 billion above more recently; it is probably now $5 or $6 billion. \nThere seems to be a total loss of management control by NASA with \nregard to the space station. We have received a report from the Young \ncommission to study the International Space Station. I believe it is a \ntop priority for the administration to find a new Administrator as soon \nas possible to review the extensive analysis and major recommendations \nof the Young commission and make whatever program and management \nreforms are necessary to ensure the ISS and other NASA programs meet \nour expectations and not rob the funding for NASA.\n  I express my strong feeling, as the chair of our subcommittee has, \nfor the need to double the National Science Foundation budget. We have \nto meet pressing human priorities. But for the long run, the pressing \nhuman needs of this country are going to be met to the extent that we \nfund the scientific exploration that goes on in the National Science \nFoundation. We should not be shorting the basic scientific research. I \nhope we can have the support of our colleagues to get the money to \nincrease it next year to put us on the path of doubling.\n  In addition to thanking Senator Mikulski, I express my sincere thanks \nto the members of the subcommittee and my staff, Jon Kamarck, Cheh Kim, \nand Isaac Green, who worked long and hard. They have become very good \nfriends and worked closely, particularly in the new setting with \nlimited space, with our good friends, Paul Carliner, Gabrielle Batkin \nand Joel Widder, for their quality work and commitment to the process. \nThey have done an excellent job, and we are very proud of the work they \ndo.\n  I, too, commend this bill to my colleagues and urge unanimous \nsupport.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to voice my \nsupport for the fiscal year 2002 HUD-VA conference report. I \ncongratulate Chairwoman Mikulski and Senator Bond for the outstanding \njob they have done to provide HUD with the resources it needs, while \nworking within a very tight allocation for all of the agencies within \ntheir jurisdiction.\n  The conference report before us today is a great improvement over the \nadministration's budget request. The budget request for HUD, the agency \nthat provides housing assistance to this Nation's poorest families, was \nsorely inadequate. Their proposal would not even have provided the \nfunding necessary to maintain HUD programs at current levels.\n  The appropriators recognized the great need for housing assistance in \nthis country by providing more funding than the administration \nrequested in almost every program area.\n  The increases included in this bill are clearly needed. We have a \nsevere housing crisis in this country, and the need for housing \nassistance continues to grow. In addition to the 5 million very low-\nincome households in this country who have worst case housing needs, \nwhich means they are either paying more than half of their income \ntowards rent or living in severely substandard housing, another 2 \nmillion people will experience homelessness this year. These families \nface greater challenges today, as the Nation's low-income housing stock \ncontinues to shrink. In the past decade, the number of units available \nto extremely low-income renters has dropped by 14 percent, a loss of \nalmost a million units.\n  These statistics make clear that programs to aid low-income families \nmust not be cut, but must be expanded to meet the growing need. \nUnfortunately, the overall funding level requested by the \nadministration put Congress in the untenable position of choosing \nbetween maintaining the current affordable housing stock or funding \nadditional needed housing units. The appropriators were forced to \nforego expanding housing opportunities so that scarce Federal resources \ncould be used to maintain existing housing, a choice that is both cost-\neffective and necessary. While we need to expand Federal housing \nprograms, we have an obligation to ensure that the affordable housing \nthat exists is habitable and safe.\n\n[[Page S11599]]\n\n  For this reason, I am pleased that the conference report increases \nfunding for public housing, a program that houses over 1.3 million of \nthis Nation's poorest families. This bill provides $2.84 billion for \nthe Public Housing Capital Fund, the fund used to repair and modernize \npublic housing--$550 million above the administration's request. There \nis a significant need for Public Housing Capital Funds as HUD estimates \nthat there is currently a $22 billion backlog in needed capital repairs \nin public housing. A cut of the magnitude proposed by the \nadministration would have led to further deterioration of this Nation's \npublic housing stock. Fortunately, the bill before us today provides \nadditional funding, helping us to maintain a much needed resource and \nto ensure that the Federal investment in public housing is protected.\n  Recognizing the importance of public housing, the conference report \nfunds the Public Housing Operating Fund at $3.5 billion, $110 million \nabove the administration's request. I am disappointed that this bill \ndoes not separately fund the Public Housing Drug Elimination Fund. The \nadministration requested no funding for this critical program which \nhelps to fight drugs and crime in our public housing communities. The \nconference report provides $250 million more for the Operating Fund \nthan provided in fiscal year 2001 to ensure that PHAs will not have to \ncut all of their anticrime activities. While this increase will assist \nPHAs in continuing after-school programs, mentoring activities, and \nsafety patrols, I am concerned that PHAs may be forced to use the \nincreased funding to pay for rising utility costs, leading to a \nreduction in activities normally funded by the Drug Elimination Fund.\n  In addition to ensuring that public housing is maintained, this bill \nfully funds the Homeless Assistance Programs. I am pleased that the \nbill provides $100 million to fund Shelter Plus Care renewals. Shelter \nPlus Care provides permanent housing to formerly homeless people, and \nthis $100 million will maintain all of these housing units, while \nallowing communities to continue to meet the demand for additional \nhomeless services.\n  The conference report continues to expand the section 8 voucher \nprogram. I am concerned that we are only providing an additional 17,000 \nincremental vouchers, as compared to 79,000 vouchers provided last \nyear. While I had hoped we would be able to provide as many vouchers as \nlast year, I appreciate the effort of the appropriators to continue \nexpanding the voucher program even with such a tight budget allocation.\n  One area of concern in this bill is the cut in section 8 reserves \nfrom 2 months to 1 month. These reserves are used in the event of \nhigher program costs so that the section 8 program can continue to \nserve the same number of families. According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, this cut could result in a decrease of almost 25,000 \nvouchers being used this year. This would be an unfortunate, and \ndevastating consequence. Fortunately, the appropriators included report \nlanguage directing HUD to ensure that PHAs can fund all of their \nvouchers, and I expect HUD to implement these changes so that the \nnumber of families receiving vouchers is not decreased.\n  Housing assistance for elderly people and those with disabilities is \nalso increased in this bill. Housing for the elderly is funded at $783 \nmillion, an increase of $4 million over the fiscal year 2001 level, and \nhousing for people with disabilities is funded at $240 million, an \nincrease of $23 million. In addition, I am pleased that the conference \nreport provides $277 million for Housing for Persons with AIDS, an \nincrease of $20 million over last year's funding level. This $20 \nmillion will ensure that additional communities in need of housing \nassistance for people with HIV and AIDs will receive Federal funding. \nThese increases will go a long way in providing needed housing to this \nnation's most vulnerable citizens.\n  At this time of economic uncertainly, it is imperative that we not \nturn our backs on low-income families in need of housing assistance. \nThough it is unfortunate that the administration's budget request \nforced us to forgo expanding affordable housing opportunities further, \nthe bill fully funds the HOME program, which is a primary vehicle for \nbuilding affordable rental housing. The need for new affordable rental \nhousing is growing, and I hope that we can work over the next year to \nsecure additional funding for housing construction.\n  Hard choices had to be made in hammering out a final version of this \nbill, and I understand that all of our priorities could not be funded \nat the desired levels. As a whole, I support this bill, and commend \nChairwoman Mikulski and the other members of the Appropriations \nCommittee for negotiating a bill that greatly improves on the \ninadequate budget request, and affirms our commitment to housing this \nNation's poor.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring for the conference report to H.R. 2620, \nthe Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, \nand Independent Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002.\n  Including an advance appropriation into 2002 of $4.2 billion, the \nconference report provides $85.434 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority, of which $143 million is for defense spending. The \nconference report will result in new outlays in 2002 of $40,489 \nbillion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into \naccount, discretionary outlays for the conference report total $88.463 \nbillion in 2002. The conference report is within its section 302(b) \nallocation for both budget authority and outlays.\n  Included within the $85.434 billion in budget authority for 2002 is \n$1.5 billion in emergency-designated sending authority for the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency for disaster relief activities. The \nemergency funding, which is not estimated to result in any outlays in \n2002, is consistent with the revised 2002 budget reached between \nPresident Bush and Congressional leaders last month. Per section 314 of \nthe Congressional Budget Act, I have adjusted the Appropriations \nCommittee's allocation for 2002 by the amount of the emergency funding. \nIn addition, the conference report provides an advance appropriation \nfor section 8 renewals of $4.2 billion for 2003. That advance is \nallowed under the budget resolution adopted for 2002. Finally, the \nreport would reduce federal revenues by $32 million in 2002. By law, \nthe revenue loss, which results from changes made to certain HUD and \nEPA fees, will be placed on the PAYGO scorecard.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that a table displaying \nthe budget committee scoring of this bill be inserted in the Record at \nthis point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   H.R. 2620, CONFERENCE REPORT TO THE DEPARTMENTS OF VETERANS AFFAIRS AND HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND\n             INDEPENDENT AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002, SPENDING COMPARISONS--CONFERENCE REPORT\n                                            [In millions of dollars]\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                      General\n                                                    purpose \\1\\     Defense \\1\\      Mandatory         Total\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference report: \\2\\\n    Budget Authority............................          85,291             143          26,898         112,332\n    Outlays.....................................          88,326             137          26,662         115,125\nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\3\\\n    Budget Authority............................          85,415             138          26,898         112,451\n    Outlays.....................................          88,463               0          26,662         115,125\nPresident's request:\n    Budget Authority............................          83,221             138          26,898         110,257\n    Outlays.....................................          87,827             136          26,662         114,625\nHouse-passed:\n    Budget Authority............................          85,296             138          26,898         112,332\n    Outlays.....................................          87,909             136          26,662         114,707\n\n[[Page S11600]]\n\n \nSenate-passed:\n    Budget Authority............................          85,905             138          26,898         112,941\n    Outlays.....................................          88,320             136          26,662         115,118\n \n         CONFERENCE REPORT COMPARED TO:\nSenate 302(b) allocation: \\3\\\n    Budget Authority............................            -124               5               0            -119\n    Outlays.....................................               0               0               0               0\nPresident's request:\n    Budget Authority............................           2,070               5               0           2,075\n    Outlays.....................................             499               1               0             500\nHouse-passed:\n    Budget Authority............................              -5               5               0               0\n    Outlays.....................................             417               1               0             418\nSenate-passed:\n    Budget Authority............................            -614               5               0            -609\n    Outlays.....................................               6               1               0               7\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ The split between general purpose and defense spending is for illustrative (i.e., nonenforceable) purposes\n  only.

Totals adjusted for consistency with scorekeeping\n  conventions.\n\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the VA-HUD \nconference report, H.R. 2620. I appreciate the conferee's recognition \nof the importance of the Environmental Protection Agency's enforcement \nbudget, as well as full funding for state revolving loan funds. These \nare priorities for the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Another priority for the Committee is ensuring the American public \nthat when they turn on their faucets in their homes and businesses, day \ncare centers and hospitals, they will fill their cups with clean, safe \nwater. The new standard for arsenic in drinking water is a welcome \nmeasure to improve the quality of drinking water nationwide. Earlier \nthis year, I was concerned when this Administration announced its \nintention to review the new, lower arsenic standard issued by the last \nAdministration. Last week, I was relieved when EPA Administrator \nWhitman announced her intention to abide by the 10 parts per billion \nstandard as well as the 2006 compliance date.\n  As Administrator Whitman stated in her letter to me on October 31st, \nthe science clearly supports an arsenic standard no higher than 10 \nparts per billion. Over the past several months, three new independent \nscientific studies have been conducted by the National Academy of \nSciences, the National Drinking Water Advisory Council and EPA's \nScience Advisory Board. These studies tell us that arsenic in drinking \nwater is a public health concern, and that the levels allowed by \ncurrent law are much too high. In fact, these studies support a \nstandard lower than 10 parts per billion. EPA tells me they have \nreceived more than 55,000 comments from the public on this subject. \nClearly, this new, lower standard confers an important protection, \nsupported by many of our citizens.\n  I am aware of the concerns that some of my colleagues have expressed \nabout the ability of small communities to comply with the new arsenic \nstandard. I have read the conference report language directing EPA to \nstudy this issue, and I look forward to receiving EPA's report. Indeed, \nwith the significant public health concern associated with arsenic in \ndrinking water, we care greatly that all communities are able to \ncomply. Although current law contains affordability criteria as well as \nwaiver and variance provisions, I would hope that we can provide \nfinancial assistance to these communities, if they need it, so that \nthey can comply with the new standard in accordance with the compliance \ndeadline and without having to avail themselves of these mechanisms. \nWith such a pressing health issue at stake, what the public needs is \ntimely compliance, not delay.\n  I also thank the conferees for their attention to a hazardous waste \nissue known as the ``mixture and derived from rule.'' While EPA will \ncontinue to pursue exemptions for certain low-risk wastes, the \nconferees' commitment to supporting exemptions only where sound science \napplies will ensure protection of human health and the environment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the conference report.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased that the conference report on \nthe VA-HUD Appropriations bill includes a provision requiring the Bush \nadministration to end its delay of the Clinton rule establishing a \ntougher standard on arsenic in drinking water.\n  The statutory language is similar to the amendment I offered to this \nbill, which passed the Senate 97-1. This language will result in a 10 \nparts per billion standard for arsenic and will ensure the community's \nright to know when unhealthy levels of arsenic are present in the \ndrinking water\n  I am concerned, however, about language in the conference report. It \nsays that the Administrator should focus on developing procedures that \nwould result in extensions of time for small systems to comply with the \narsenic standard. Clearly, those extensions would have to be consistent \nwith the Safe Drinking Water Act requirements. But they would only \nresult in further delay.\n  In addition, the Administrator is asked to report to Congress on \nlegislative proposals that address further extensions of time for \ncompliance by small systems. The focus of EPA's limited resources \nshould be on helping these systems to accelerate compliance--by \nproviding technical and financial assistance--not on how to further \ndelay compliance.\n  As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee, that will \nbe my focus. I will be working to provide funding for small communities \nto meet the 10 parts per billion standard, and I will not support \nlegislative proposals that provide additional extensions and delay even \nmore the time when all Americans have safer drinking water.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, while I will support the fiscal year 2002 \nVA-HUD and Independent Agencies conference report, I must express my \nstrong disappointment in the funding level included in the bill for \nYouthBuild. I strongly believe that YouthBuild proves that the Federal \nGovernment, working in cooperation with community-based non-profits, \ncan make a real difference in the lives of young people, the young \npeople that most Americans have given up on. During Senate \nconsideration of the VA-HUD appropriations bill, I successfully \nincluded an amendment to provide a $10 million increase in funding for \nYouthBuild. A similar amendment was included in the House, so the \namount allocated to YouthBuild was approximately $70 million in each \nbill.\n  While I understand the difficult allocation which the Subcommittee \noperates, I am nevertheless very disappointed that in the Conference \nReport included only $65 million for YouthBuild. With strong support \nfor YouthBuild in both the House and the Senate, I believe this program \ndeserved $70 million in fiscal year 2002. These additional funds would \nhave assisted YouthBuild in expanding its programs across the nation \nand assisted more at-risk youths.\n  YouthBuild is designed to serve those that, too often, have proven to \nbe the\n\n[[Page S11601]]\n\nhardest to serve. In return, they serve us, by getting job training, \nlearning a skill, completing their educations, and working in \ncommunities across the country rebuilding housing, providing \ndesperately needed affordable housing to other needy families.\n  Many low-income young adults are having great difficulty achieving \nsuccess in our society. YouthBuild attracts low-income young adults who \nhave dropped out of school. Many participants have been adjudicated, \nare from welfare families, have children already and live in public \nhousing projects. The premise of YouthBuild is that these young adults \nneed and deserve a second chance, that they are eager to live \nproductive, constructive lives, and we cannot afford not to provide \nthem with that second chance. Skills, education, inspiration and \nsupport provided by YouthBuild help them make the transition to the \njobs or higher education.\n  YouthBuild is the only national program that provides young adults an \nimmediately productive role in the community while at the same time \nproviding all of the following benefits to participants: basic \neducation toward a diploma; skills training toward a decent paying job; \nleadership development toward civic engagement; adult mentoring to help \novercome personal problems; and participation in a supportive mini-\ncommunity with a positive set of values.\n  Of those that enter YouthBuild, 67 percent complete the program. 85 \npercent of YouthBuild graduates are placed in college, or get a job \nwith an average wage of $7.53 per hour. Many become leaders in their \ncommunities, both while they are in the program and thereafter.\n  YouthBuild receives bipartisan support for one simple reason--it \nworks. The program fills a major gap in public policy by addressing the \nneeds of at-risk, out of school young adults in a more comprehensive \nway than any other existing national program. That is why I circulated \na letter with Senator Mike DeWine, which was cosigned by 63 Senators, \nin support of increasing funding for YouthBuild to $90 million.\n  YouthBuild program has grown from 15 sites which served 600 at-risk \nyouth in 1993, to 145 sites serving approximately 5,800 youth in 40 \nStates today. The engine of this growth has been the HUD appropriation. \nThe fuel has been the highly motivated local leaders whose commitment \nkeeps the program on the cutting edge of community needs. They have \nraised State, local, and private funds to supplement Federal funds and \nextend the reach of this important program. Major support from the Ford \nFoundation, the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation, The DeWitt Wallace-\nReader's Digest Fund, local Rotary Clubs, The Home Depot, US Bancorp, \nand Metropolitan Life Insurance Company demonstrates that the network \nis highly regarded by leaders in the private sector. YouthBuild \nattracts, motivates, educates, and trains precisely the young people \nwho have fared least well in virtually all other existing systems.\n  The demand and need for YouthBuild programs far exceeds the resources \nallocated to it. Successful YouthBuild programs have 6 to 10 times more \napplicants each year than they can accept. In this period, with the \neconomy in need of qualified workers and the number of at-risk adults \nis increasing, it is excellent public policy to invest in a proven \nnational model that can bring these young adults into employment, post-\nsecondary education, and constructive civic engagement.\n  The best way for me to explain to you the importance of YouthBuild is \nto tell you about one the YouthBuild programs. YouthBuild Springfield, \nMA, has received more than 250 applications for its services since it \nopened in 1999, and has been able to serve 80 young people in a \ncomprehensive, year round programs which includes education and \nemployment training, as well as community and leadership development. \nOver half of the participants are young women, many with dependent \nchildren. All of the participants commit to being drug free, \nparticipate in weekly drug education workshops, and agree to random \ndrug testing. They provide four therapy groups each week and access \nprivate therapy as needed. They have maintained a 77 percent retention \nrate, 86 percent attendance rate, and 82 percent placement rate at an \naverage wage of $8.10 per hour. Another 10 percent have gone on to \nfurther training or college.\n  With the strong bipartisan support for YouthBuild, I am hopeful that \nwe will be able to increase the appropriation for this important \nprogram in fiscal year 2003.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent the vote on adoption of this \nconference report to accompany H.R. 2620, the VA/HUD appropriations \nbill, occur at 4:30 p.m. today and that if all time for debate has \nexpired, the time until 4:30 p.m. be equally divided and controlled by \nthe two managers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the Senator from \nTexas such time as she may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise to talk about the VA/HUD bill \nwhich has a number of good parts to it. I know the managers have worked \nvery hard to divide up the dollars. It is always hard when there are \nnot as many dollars as projects.\n  I specifically want to talk about the issue of NASA. I know of the \ngreat concerns, because it is very obvious from the bill, and, frankly, \nthey are valid concerns, about the management of the space station and \nthe cost overruns. I also understand there are concerns about the \noverruns hurting other programs within NASA.\n  When you are doing something new, when you are pushing the envelope \nof technology, you cannot always be precise. This is not to say some of \nthe overruns have been invalid, incomprehensible in some ways, and I \ndon't understand some of them myself. I do not think you can set an \nexact budget when you are experimenting. We all know you have to have \nsome freedom in science in order to be able to make a mistake, learn \nfrom the mistake, and do something else.\n  I appreciate the $150 million cut in the original Senate bill was \nhalved to $75 million in the conference. I hope NASA can work within \nthat $75 million and the rest of the budget for the space station to \ncontinue to move ahead. I am told by the people at NASA it will delay \nthe space station, but it will certainly not kill it.\n  But I think the overriding issue is the one that was mentioned by the \nSenator from Missouri, and that is we need to have a new administrator \nappointed for NASA right away. Dan Goldin has done a terrific job, but \nhe is leaving at the middle of this month. So we need to have that \nleadership.\n  I urge that the new leader of NASA look at what NASA can do. Let's \ndecide, what is the science that we want to create? What is the goal of \nNASA? NASA has given us so much in the past, in new technologies that \ncreate new industries and new jobs. It has been part of the \nrevitalization of our economy. We want to continue to push ahead. We \nwant to continue to be the leader of the world in technology. To do \nthat, we are going to have to have a clear vision for NASA and new \nleadership.\n  I thank the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from Missouri for \nworking with me to make sure we do have the expenses that must be paid \nfor NASA to stay in place. I think their concerns are valid, but let's \nnot throw out the baby with the bath water. We cannot starve NASA if we \nare going to stay in the forefront of technology.\n  I look forward to working with the Senators from Maryland and \nMissouri during the next year, hopefully with a new Administrator from \nNASA, so we can have a clear vision and we can continue America's lead \nin technology that will have a major impact, not only on our future \ndefense and our future programs, but also for our economy for the \nfuture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know the Senator from New Mexico \nwishes to speak. We have guaranteed him this time. I say to the Senator \nfrom Texas, she has been a longstanding advocate of the space program. \nI have traveled with her to Texas to see the first-class, world-class \nresearch that is going on there.\n  I, too, look forward to working with the new Administrator of NASA. \nWe\n\n[[Page S11602]]\n\nshould also recognize the current one because I think he has tried his \nbest. But we have to have a NASA for the 21st century. I look forward \nto working with her to be able to do that.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank my colleagues for their important discussion. I am \nnow pleased to yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I thank Senator Mikulski and Senator \nBond for their sensitivity to the issue of the new arsenic standards in \nwater and its impact on thousands of communities throughout America.\n  Let me say, I have given up on attempting to challenge the 10-parts-\nper-billion standard the administration has now found to be the \nstandard that is necessary in drinking water in America for the water \nto be healthy and safe. Saying that I cannot fight it any longer does \nnot mean I agree with it, nor that I think the Congress can ignore the \nconsequences of this new standard on many communities across this land.\n  More than 140 communities in my home State of New Mexico face this \nnew burden at an estimated cost of more than $440 million, from the \nsmallest of water supply systems to the very largest in the city of \nAlbuquerque.\n  Why would one be concerned enough about this to bring it to the floor \nof the Senate? It is a highly controversial issue as to whether the \nexact same standards on arsenic should apply in every community across \nthe breadth and width of America because if you come from a State such \nas New Mexico, Nevada, West Virginia, Utah, Idaho, and many more, \nwhatever human beings have lived in those parts of America, from the \nearliest arrival of men to the modern American living in these \ncommunities, there has been arsenic in the water that did not come from \nanything that human beings did by their actions or nonactions. Arsenic \nwas in the water for all the time that humans have lived and found this \nwater and drank of it. The arsenic was there because of the rock \nformations, that geology, over which the rainwater, after it rippled \ndown, ran and percolated into lakes and reservoirs and areas \nunderground which were then used for drinking water.\n  Many hundreds of thousands of people drank of that water with no ill \neffects. I know it is almost the wrong thing to say scientifically, but \nit seems as if it is factual that the citizens in those areas to which \nI have alluded, including my State of New Mexico, are healthier, \nwhatever is allegedly the damage that arsenic in the water produces.\n  In other words, the diseases that are attributable to having more \narsenic in the water are present less frequently in States such as mine \nthan they are in other States that have not, for all this period of \ntime, had drinking water which had naturally flowing arsenic as a \ncomponent of the compound.\n  Since I believe that, it doesn't mean I am advising that we not \nfollow the law. But what I am suggesting is that soon small, medium-\nsized, and large communities in all of these States, including Nevada, \nincluding West Virginia, including New Mexico, including Arizona and \nmany others, are going to start getting the estimates as to how they \nmake these small water systems, these medium-sized ones, and these \nlarge ones--how do you get them down to 10 parts per billion of \narsenic. They are going to get these big estimates.\n  They are going to get estimates of rebuilding whole waterworks for \nthis purpose. Then the citizens are going to be asking, after seeing \nthe headlines: What is this all about?\n  What I think we should have done in this conference is we should have \nlet the Department--the Environmental Protection Agency--which adopted \nthe new standard, deal with it in a normal manner. Actually, they would \nhave 6 years before the implementation date. But they could at least \nwork with cities. They could perhaps work on waivers attributable to \ngood research which said if they are given 2 more years, they are going \nto come out with new science and it is going to be much less costly to \nLas Vegas, NV, and Reno, NV.\n  I see my friend, the junior Senator from Nevada is here.\n  But we went one step further in this bill and we prohibited the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency from doing anything other than \nenforcing this standard, literally, specifically, no exemptions, no \nwaivers.\n  I say to the two Senators who are managing this bill, the Chair and \nSenator Bond have been most understanding. They have both pledged if we \ncan find a way to help with this, by either partial financing or in \nsome reasonable way, they are going to do that.\n  I want to tell the Senate there is some exciting research going on. \nThat is getting funded, too. So we might make a breakthrough where we \ndon't have to clean the arsenic out of the water in the manner expected \nof us today. There will be a newer way, cheaper, more reasonable, and \nperhaps we can get something done.\n  To reiterate, I thank Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond for their \nsensitivity to the issue of the new arsenic standard and its impact on \nthousands of communities throughout the nation. I am not arguing \nagainst the new standard of 10 parts per billion, since the \nadministration has announced that it will support this level of arsenic \nin our water. But, we all know that achieving this new level will cost \nliterally billions of dollars for communities, most of which will never \nbe able to afford the equipment to meet this standard by the year 2006.\n  I wish that we in the conference on VA-HUD could have addressed this \nissue in a substantive fashion, perhaps by establishing direct funding \nto help these communities. We were not able to do so, but I am assured \nby the many Senators who agreed with me that this issue is critical. We \nmust establish a new program to help through grants and loans the \ncommunities that face virtual ruin if they try to fund this new \nequipment themselves. More than 140 communities in my home state alone \nface this new burden, at an estimated cost of more than $440 million.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join with me, and with others, like \nSenator Reid of Nevada, as we try to forge a program as soon as \npossible, perhaps even later this session of Congress.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time is left?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Let me conclude by thanking the Senator from Missouri \nfor all his help and cooperation, and his staff--all of whom were \nworking on it. I take this opportunity to thank the people who worked \ndirectly with the bill, worked directly in the Senate.\n  There are a lot of people who work in this institution.\n  We are coming up on the second month anniversary of the aerial attack \non the United States of America. I thank all the people here at the \nCapitol who continue to show up every day and every way to support us \nso we can keep democracy's doors open.\n  First, I thank our young pages. They are high school students. They \ncould have gone back home and been prom queens and football heroes, but \ninstead they chose to serve their country by being right here in this \nChamber. We thank them for their support for us and the confidence \ntheir families showed in us.\n  All of the people who run the food service, who run the elevators, \nand who are trying to clean up the Hart Building need to be \nacknowledged. By supporting us, they really support democracy. As we \npass this bill that honors America's veterans and protects our homeland \nsecurity, I thank all the people from the pages to the elevator \noperators, to the carpenters, and so on, who just show up every day and \nhelp us keep democracy's door open and functioning.\n  I bring you the VA-HUD bill and say God bless the U.S. Senate and God \nbless America. Let's vote and pass this bill.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the conference report.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, all of us who knew and loved our former \ngreat Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield were saddened by his death \nlast month. He was truly one of the all-time giants of the Senate, and \nhe went on to serve with high distinction for many years as our \nNation's Ambassador to Japan. His wisdom, his intelligence, his \ninsights, his friendship, his fundamental fairness, and his \nextraordinary humility combined to make him a leader of uncommon vision \nand ability during his long and brilliant and historic service to the \nSenate, to the people of Montana, and to the entire country.\n  On October 10, at a beautiful service for Senator Mansfield at Fort \nMyer Memorial Chapel, his former Senate assistant, Charles Ferris, \ndelivered an eloquent eulogy that touched us all and reminded us again \nof the many reasons why we loved and admired Mike Mansfield so deeply. \nI know that the eulogy will be of interest to all of us, and I ask \nunanimous consent that the eulogy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the eulogy was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n           Eulogy Delivered at the Funeral of Mike Mansfield\n\n                (By Charles D. Ferris, October 10, 2001)\n\n       Thank you one and all for being here. A quiet giant is \n     gone. And in the spirit in which he lived, Mike Mansfield \n     would be embarrassed by inconveniencing so many but privately \n     very grateful to each of you. And a special thanks to Father \n     Monan, the Chancellor of Boston College. Mike received an \n     honorary degree decades ago from Boston College and was the \n     first recipient of their Thomas P. O'Neill Distinguished \n     Citizen Award in 1996. He had a soft spot for Boston--he \n     referred to Boston as the Butte of the East--an expression of \n     great affection--for Butte had a hold on his heart. It was \n     where he met Maureen.\n       And during 67 years of marriage, Maureen was to him what \n     Abigail was to John Adams--a loving partner in a marriage of \n     equals based on respect for each other's judgment and \n     intelligence, with equal participation in all decisions, \n     professional as well as personal.\n       How does one talk about the life of such a great man who \n     was so reluctant to talk about himself? Any of the hundreds \n     of experiences he shared with me and with so many of you \n     would be a story worth telling. But most of the stories must \n     be for another time, for the Irish wake we will conduct for \n     him in our memories and hearts will never end.\n       He left the world as he lived in it, with the least \n     possible fuss and absolutely no nonsense. His hospitalization \n     was blessedly short, his mental capacity and condition \n     unimpaired until the last three days when he gracefully \n     slipped deeper into the last sleep. He gave his daughter Anne \n     and granddaughter Caroline and others of us who loved him \n     time to prepare ourselves and say goodbye. Till the end, he \n     conducted himself with character and class, a sense of \n     dignity and a lifelong sensitivity to others.\n       My sadness today is overwhelmed by the surge of gratitude \n     for the things we shared that will be a part of me and my \n     family forever. Thirty-eight years ago, he plucked me from \n     the Justice Department where I was a happy and content trial \n     lawyer. I don't know to this day how I got the job. I had \n     never met him before that day. He was anxious about the Civil \n     Rights legislation coming over from the House--the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee for decades being a graveyard for civil \n     rights bills. As he talked, I wondered how I could ever \n     connect my specialty in Admiralty law with the challenge he \n     was describing. Thankfully, I didn't try. I just told him \n     that I didn't know exactly how I could be helpful but, if he \n     wanted me, I would do my best. After we spoke for about 25 \n     minutes--which I would soon learn for him was a filibuster--\n     he asked me to start the following Monday. Mike Mansfield was \n     a ``yep, nope, don't know, can't say'' type of guy. My \n     winning argument must have been admitting I didn't know. Over \n     the years, I learned how clearly he detected and how strongly \n     he reacted to any and all variations of the snow job. For \n     whatever reason, his decision changed my life as he changed \n     the lives of all who shared time with him. I look back and \n     wonder if he hadn't taken that leap of faith, I would today \n     be a GS18 step 32 at the Justice Department.\n       But, by my good fortune and his hasty judgment, I was \n     graced with the opportunity to observe him--and learn from \n     him, as I never could from any book, the meaning of decency, \n     integrity, humility, of perspective, patience, and honor. \n     Mike Mansfield exhibited all these rare qualities in full \n     measure--and with it all, he was also the wisest man I have \n     ever met.\n       His mother died when he was 7 and he had a rocky childhood \n     until he finally joined the Navy at age 14, committing \n     probably the only deceptive act in his life--presenting a \n     document that declared he was 18. After the Navy, it was the \n     Army and, after the Army, it was the Marines (he obviously \n     got all his indecision out early in life). The Marines sent \n     him to the Philippines and China. Thus began his lifetime \n     interest and study of East Asia. But he had no formal \n     education so he returned to work in the copper mines in \n     Butte. Then, at the urging of his new found love Maureen, he \n     enrolled at the Montana School of Mines as a special student, \n     concurrently taking courses to earn his high school diploma; \n     transferring a year later to the University of Montana, where \n     he won his BA and high school diploma simultaneously in 1933. \n     A Masters Degree followed, then a teaching position at the \n     University, which was his calling until elected to Congress \n     in the Fall of '42, then the Senate in the Fall of '52, \n     Majority Whip in 1957 and Majority Leader in 1961.\n       Mike Mansfield was a distinctly different Leader than his \n     predecessor. He never twisted an arm but he touched the \n     conscience of his colleagues. He won them over by his \n     openness, his character and his reason. He transformed a \n     Senate of power brokers into a Senate of equals. His was a \n     leadership rooted in clarity of motive, honesty of purpose \n     and respect of his fellow Senators.\n       And he led it to shape an America of greater equality. He \n     was a shaping force of the New Frontier and the Great \n     Society. He was at the helm of the Senate at the height of \n     fundamental achievement--the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the \n     Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the \n     passage of Medicare, federal aid to education, the 18-year-\n     old vote--all deeply controversial at the time, many \n     requiring the then-dreaded two-thirds cloture vote. All this \n     and more was written in American life and law--and, in each \n     instance, he made sure a different Senator received the \n     lion's share of the accolades. Mike Mansfield always gave the \n     credit to others; his satisfaction came from within; his \n     approbation from Maureen. Yet, each time, Mike Mansfield's \n     leadership was the hinge of history: he was the man without\n\n[[Page S11604]]\n\n     whom the achievements might well have been different--in all \n     likelihood, at least greatly lessened. He was the strong \n     gentle wind that set the climate of the Senate. He was the \n     essential chemistry of that Body. I say that as one who \n     observed the entire process closely from the wings.\n       During the months of daily backroom negotiations on the \n     Voting Rights Act in 1965, a disgruntled Chief of Staff for a \n     Midwestern Democrat complained about holding the daily \n     meetings in Everett Dirksen's office, with the press \n     conference right outside every day at 4 p.m. Everett Dirksen \n     was given center stage by the Boss, who was content to simply \n     stand there and second Dirksen's loquacious progress report. \n     The Chief of Staff pleaded to have at least half the meetings \n     in the Majority Leader's office and hold the press \n     conferences there so the office nameplate of the Majority \n     Leader would stamp the photos and TV coverage of the day. I \n     thought this a perfectly reasonable request and brought it to \n     the Boss, whose response was ``Charlie, last year the \n     Republican Party drifted far from the mainstream during the \n     Presidential election. If the public can see the Republican \n     Leader each day reporting on the progress of what will \n     hopefully be the most significant civil rights legislation \n     ever, it will be very beneficial for the country to grasp \n     that this bill was being drafted by both parties, even in an \n     overwhelmingly Democratic Congress.'' And so it was; and for \n     me, another lesson in perspective, in wisdom.\n       Mike Mansfield's fairness was never questioned on either \n     side of the aisle. I recall a freshman Senator with an \n     important amendment--important to him politically and to his \n     state almost exclusively--that he had already announced he \n     would offer to a pending bill. But with some swift \n     parliamentary gymnastics, the managers raced the bill to \n     final passage. The freshman Senator had been left high and \n     dry and certain to be embarrassed back home. Mike was not on \n     the Senate Floor for the parliamentary sleight of hand but, \n     once summoned, he exhibited with few words and mostly by a \n     stern look his sense of outrage at the unfairness of what had \n     happened. He rescinded by unanimous consent the passage of \n     the bill and the freshman Senator had his day. I don't \n     remember the outcome, but it didn't matter; the opportunity \n     was the victory. That freshman Senator, incidentally, was a \n     Republican--he is still a Member of the Senate and he is here \n     today.\n       He was our Ambassador to Japan during both the Carter and \n     the Reagan Administrations, a post where he became in another \n     great country what he was in our own--the most respected of \n     leaders. Again he remained himself and redefined diplomacy. \n     Early in his years as Ambassador, the American nuclear \n     submarine George Washington violated the law of the seas. It \n     surfaced and sank a Japanese vessel in Japanese waters, \n     tragically causing loss of life, a most embarrassing and \n     politically explosive incident. In a world where debate over \n     words like regret, sorrow, excuse or apology can take weeks \n     and months to be decided, at his own instigation and \n     insistence, Ambassador Mansfield delivered a note of apology \n     to the Japanese Foreign Minister. He asked, however, most \n     uncharacteristically, that the TV cameras be permitted to \n     remain in the room while he submitted the written apology. \n     Again in character, actions over words, he bowed deeply \n     below the waistline in presenting the official government \n     position. As he knew, this symbol in the Japanese culture \n     has great significance. The sincerity and depth of the \n     apology was visually conveyed. That five seconds was \n     played and replayed on Japan's TV stations many times \n     over--obviously seen by everyone in Japan with a \n     television. The political issue ceased to exist. Again, \n     few words--great action--achieved goal. I don't doubt that \n     his 12 years in Tokyo were characterized with other \n     telling examples.\n       In the last decade of his life, after he returned from \n     Tokyo, I was blessed with the good fortune of becoming Mike \n     Mansfield's good friend. We shared wonderful moments together \n     and our almost daily visits were a ritual we both became \n     addicted to. When the end came on Friday morning, I was \n     filled with sadness for an irreplaceable loss, but full of \n     gratitude for the friendship and love and the lessons on how \n     to live.\n       At the hospital three days before he died, he was resting \n     comfortably, his eyes closed. He had been informed the day \n     before that he was on his final lap. I went to his bedside, \n     and took his hand and quietly asked how he was doing. He \n     opened his eyes, strained to focus, and said, ``Oh, Charlie, \n     how are you? A moment later, ``What day is it?'' Monday, I \n     said. A short pause, and then, ``How did our little giant do \n     yesterday?'' Knowing, of course, he was talking about Doug \n     Flutie, I said he won. They're now 3-0. He smiled and said, \n     ``If they go 4-0, he should own the team.''\n       It was as if this were a normal day, another visit, nothing \n     unusual. In looking back, this final chat I believe was much \n     more. He was not a man of idle gestures or wasted words. He \n     knew the wheels were about to touch down. But like remaining \n     in the background at joint press conferences, or bowing below \n     the waist to the Foreign Minister or with a stern look \n     repairing a parliamentary abuse, I believe he was conveying a \n     message. That he was mentally comfortable and spiritually \n     content; that he had no fear about what lay beyond the \n     horizon. In effect, he remained a mentor to the very end--\n     still more interested in giving comfort than seeking it--\n     teaching again by example the final lesson of dying with \n     serene dignity.\n       Now what we have left are indelible memories and his \n     shining example. But how much more that is than most people, \n     not just politicians, ever give. He left a deep imprint on \n     the history he once taught and every person he ever met.\n       Mike has gone to Maureen. Together again with the love of \n     his life. But he will always be with all of us who knew him--\n     who were directed by his example, honored by his friendship--\n     blessed by his life and appreciative of his love.\n       In the world where politics is so often so self-regarding \n     and so many so self-absorbed, Boss, you set a different, \n     higher standard. You tapped er light but left the deepest \n     imprint.\n       There will never be another like you.\n       You will always be a part of my life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/08/senate-section/article/S11604-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              VETERANS DAY\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, Sunday is Veterans Day, a day dedicated \nto honoring the brave men and women who have served in the armed forces \nof this great Nation. Over 26 million men and women living today have \nanswered their Nation's call to defend the ideals, values, and \nliberties we Americans hold dear.\n  This Sunday will mark the 63rd anniversary of the creation of the \nfirst official holiday honoring veterans who, like my father, Harry \nSpecter, served in World War I. Unfortunately, it will also mark the 3-\nmonth anniversary of the horrific attacks of September 11, attacks \nwhich were directed at the same ideals, values, and liberties millions \nof Americans have fought so bravely to defend. As ranking member of the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs, I wish to express my deepest gratitude \nand appreciation to the veterans of wars past--and to those who are \nengaged today in fighting this new war against terrorism.\n  I am proud of what has been accomplished in Congress in recent years \nto honor America's veterans. We have expanded educational benefits, \nimproved life insurance coverage, and opened new national cemeteries. \nAnd we have worked hard to increase funding for VA medical care. We \nintend to build on these accomplishments with further improvements in \nVA services and benefits. I thank my colleagues for their past support, \nand I urge them to continue in their steadfast support for veterans. \nVery few things we do here are more important.\n  Whereas Memorial Day is dedicated to remembering those who made the \nultimate sacrifice for their country, Veterans Day is dedicated to \nacknowledging the commitment and devotion to duty millions of former \nsoldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines made to this great Nation. \nVeterans are the best of America--people who, through sacrifice, \ndedication, and love of country, protected our freedoms, liberties, and \nway of life. This Sunday I ask every American to join me in honoring \nthem. I also ask that we take a moment to acknowledge and thank the \nwarriors of today who are the veterans of tomorow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/08/senate-section/article/S11604-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11604-S11605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ENHANCING SECURITY OF U.S. BORDERS\n\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, as a member of the Judiciary Committee \nSubcommittee on Immigration; the Select Committee on Intelligence; and \nthe Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Technology, Terrorism, and \nGovernment Information, I am committed to improving the integrity of \nour immigration system. My positions on these committees also have \ngiven me an understanding of the unique interrelationship between \nimmigration, national security, and law enforcement.\n  I am especially interested in border security issues. The tragic \nSeptember 11 bombings have made it clear that we must improve our law \nenforcement and intelligence systems to enhance public safety and \nnational security, particularly at our borders. I am pleased that two \nbills have been introduced to revise our immigration and visa system to \nenhance our border security. The chair and ranking member of the \nImmigration Subcommittee, Senators Kennedy and Brownback, introduced S. \n1618, the ``Enhanced Border Security Act.'' The chair and ranking \nmember of the Technology and Terrorism Subcommittee, Senators Feinstein \nand Kyl, introduced S. 1627, the ``Visa Entry Reform Act.''\n\n[[Page S11605]]\n\n  The Kennedy-Brownback bill emphasizes an immigration approach, while \nthe Feinstein-Kyl bill reflects a keen understanding of the needs of \nlaw enforcement. While there are a few overlapping, even conflicting, \nprovisions in these bills, I think that the sponsors have some \nexcellent ideas and are clearly headed in the right direction. Both \nbills seek to improve data sharing between agencies that are \nresponsible for protecting our borders.\n  At the same time, I think it is very important that we do not \n``reinvent the wheel.'' In the recently passed counter-terrorism law, \n``Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools \nRequired to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001'', USA PATRIOT \nACT, Congress passed a provision of mine to demonstrate how we can \nexpand the Integrated Automated Identification System to help secure \nour borders. We already have the technology available to pre-screen, \nidentify, verify individuals, and share information through the FBI's \nfingerprint database. We ought to leverage our previous investment in \nthis system.\n  Specifically, if someone is on an international ``watch list'' or \n``wanted'' in connection with a criminal or intelligence investigation \nin the United States, we need to know this information. I believe our \ndecisions as to whom we allow to enter and stay in our country are only \nas good as the information upon which we base our decisions. My \nprovision in our new counter-terrorism law requires the FBI to report \nto Congress on how its fingerprint database and other systems can be \nused to address this problem.\n  Again, I anticipate that these bills will be reconciled into a \ncomprehensive border security bill. I hope to work with the sponsors of \nboth bills and help bridge the gaps.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/08/senate-section/article/S11605-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11605]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DOMESTIC TRAVEL AND TOURISM INDUSTRY\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, as my colleagues know, Senator Zell Miller \nand I have introduced bipartisan legislation to help our domestic \ntravel and tourism industry recover from the devastating effects of \nSeptember 11. I believe that we must focus an emergency economic \nstimulus package on the sector that has been most harmed: our travel \nand tourism industry. If we are to prevent thousands of bankruptcies, \nhundreds of thousands of lost jobs, and a host of indirect consequences \nto the rest of the economy, it is essential that we provide some \nimmediate help to the travel and tourism industry.\n  The most important element of the legislation would provide a \ntemporary $500 tax credit per person, $1,000 for a couple filing \njointly, for personal travel expenses incurred by the end of the year. \nThis temporary measure will help encourage Americans to resume their \nnormal travel habits. Unlike general rebate checks to taxpayers, a tax \ncredit conditioned on travel expenses ensures that the money is spent \non a specific activity, in this case an activity that will generate \npositive economic ripples throughout the entire American economy. It \nwill also help create confidence and encourage Americans to get back on \nairplanes.\n  Since business-travel expenses are already deductible, temporarily \nrestoring full deductibility for all business-entertainment expenses, \nincluding meals, that are now subject to a 50 percent limitation, also \nwould help restore the mainstay of the travel industry: the business \ntraveler.\n  In a recent letter to the President, the members of the Travel \nIndustry Recovery Coalition endorsed the travel credit as well as \nelimination of the current 50 percent penalty on business meals and \nentertainment. I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  I hope my colleagues will cosponsor S. 1500 and join in our \nbipartisan effort to preserve jobs and revive this vital sector of the \neconomy by getting travelers traveling again.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                 November 2, 2001.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: On behalf of the twenty-six member \n     organizations comprising the Travel Industry Recovery \n     Coalition representing all segments of our nations $582 \n     billion travel and tourism industry and listed in detail on \n     the enclosed sheet, I write to thank you for encouraging \n     Americans to travel again and for your Administration's \n     ongoing efforts to make travel safe and secure. Working with \n     your Administration, our industry has made progress ensuring \n     that travel is safe and secure and in restoring consumer \n     confidence in travel.\n       We are grateful for your leadership in expanding the low \n     interest SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loan program to small \n     business across the entire country. We also appreciate the \n     congressional leaders who have expressed their strong support \n     for an expansion of the net operating loss carry-back that \n     will be of real benefit to our industry. Unfortunately, these \n     important efforts have not been sufficient to encourage \n     enough travelers to travel and thus to keep workers working. \n     The state of our travel and tourism industry thus remains \n     precarious.\n       We write to urge your Administration to support bipartisan \n     legislation introduced in both the Senate and the House that \n     would provide a $500 per person ($1,000 per couple) tax \n     credit for travel booked by the end of the year. The proposed \n     tax credit meets your Administration's central condition for \n     inclusion in the economic stimulus package in that it would \n     have an immediate and significant impact on the entire \n     economy, and would not require a permanent change to the tax \n     code (and thus would not affect future interest rates). We \n     believe its enactment would generate $50 billion in economic \n     activity and 590,000 jobs over the course of the next year. \n     We urge you to support this temporary travel tax credit to \n     stimulate the economy, to preserve jobs, and to bring \n     families together this year at Thanksgiving and during the \n     December holidays.\n       We urge your Administration to support short-term measures \n     that would eliminate the current 50% penalty on business \n     meals and entertainment expenses and to work with our \n     industry on a comprehensive promotional campaign to encourage \n     travel to and within the United States. We also ask your \n     Administration to work with us in providing assistance to the \n     valuable employees in our industry who have lost their jobs, \n     face reduced hours, or face the imminent loss of their jobs \n     if travel does not rebound quickly.\n       Thank you again for leading our country at this difficult \n     time and for your Administration working with us to achieve \n     our twin objectives to ensure safe traveling and restoring \n     confidence in travel to and within America.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                William S.

Madam President, recently the National Trust for Historic \nPreservation held its annual National Preservation Conference in \nProvidence, Rhode Island. In tribute of my father, the late Senator \nJohn H. Chafee, the\n\n[[Page S11606]]\n\ntheme of the conference was ``Preserving the Spirit of Place'' which \nhonored one of the last speeches he gave before his death.\n  Particularly during this time of national turmoil, we recognize the \nimportance of our sense of place as we move about our daily lives. \nLiberty and freedom unite all Americans, form our common heritage, and \npermit us to cherish our sense of place in the world.\n  The preservation of our Nation's historic buildings and districts is \na way for us to acknowledge the events of America's rich past and \nimmortal legacy. The restoration of a downtown square in Spokane, WA; \nthe revitalization of an old fort in Salt Lake City, UT; and the \nrenovation of historic homes in Providence, RI; these projects \nrepresent how American ingenuity and perseverance form the building \nblocks of our architectural and cultural heritage.\n  I would like to recognize the work of the National Trust for Historic \nPreservation and its dedication to revitalizing historic buildings \nacross the Nation in order to preserve our spirit of place. I ask that \nPresident Richard Moe's speech at the 2001 Conference of the National \nTrust for Historic Preservation be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       2001 President's Report--National Preservation Conference\n\n                            (By Richard Moe)\n\n       I'm very glad you're all here.\n       We've spoken and heard those words often in recent weeks, \n     as we've sought comfort and reassurance in the presence of \n     family, friends and colleagues. It's a sentiment that's \n     totally appropriate here, because we are a family. That is \n     really why I'm so glad you're here, so grateful that we can \n     gather together, can strengthen and support each another as \n     we try to make sense out of what has happened and try to \n     figure out where we fit in the new world into which we've \n     been thrust.\n       We've heard it said over and over: ``Things will never be \n     the same again.'' Thousands of lives have been changed \n     forever. The skyline of our biggest city has been changed. \n     It's probably no exaggeration to say that the very shape of \n     our future has changed too--in some ways that we can already \n     see and in others that aren't yet clear and we cannot yet \n     see.\n       But some things remain intact--and maybe even stronger than \n     before: our appreciation of the traditions and values that \n     have shaped our country and that still shape our lives; the \n     bravery, compassion and generosity that we demonstrate when \n     our fellow citizens are in need; the sense of common purpose \n     that unites us.\n       So much has changed since the morning of September 11--but \n     one thing, above all, remains true and constant: The American \n     spirit endures.\n       September 14--just 3 days after these terrible events--was \n     the anniversary of the firing on Fort McHenry. That was in \n     1814. One hundred eighty-seven years later, we have all taken \n     comfort from the same sight that inspired Francis Scott Key. \n     On the tops of skyscrapers, in front of government buildings, \n     on police cars and firetrucks and taxis, on the front porches \n     of thousands of homes, on millions of shirts and blouses and \n     coats, draped on the blackened wall of the Pentagon, we all \n     saw it: Our flag was still there.\n       That's proof that the American spirit endures--and you can \n     find it on just about every block in every community in this \n     country. This simple, reassuring fact provides a firm \n     foundation, I believe, for the work we have to do.\n       In times like this, our first thoughts naturally are for \n     the well-being of our families and our fellow citizens. But \n     beyond these immediate personal concerns, I believe we have a \n     specific and critically important responsibility as \n     preservationists. We're all aware of the importance of \n     healing the nation's physical wounds, of strengthening the \n     nation's defenses--but we can't lose sight of the importance \n     of nurturing the nation's soul.\n       In the context of this pressing need to heal and move on, \n     our work as preservationists has an importance--a relevance--\n     that is greater than ever before.\n       Think for a moment about where the blows fell on September \n     11. Not on missile bases or factories or power plants or \n     shipyards. No, the targets were people and buildings that \n     symbolize America's military and economic strength. Did the \n     terrorists really believe that an attack on the Pentagon \n     would bring our military to its knees? Or that destroying the \n     World Trade Center would shatter America's financial \n     structure? Probably not--but they recognized the enormous \n     importance of symbols.\n       As preservationists, we recognize their importance too. We \n     know that place has power.\n       We know that we can read about our history in books, but we \n     also know that facts on paper are no more or less important \n     than truth on the ground--truth made tangible in place.\n       History says, ``This is what happened.'' Preservation says, \n     ``Right here''--and that simple addition gives our knowledge \n     of history an immediacy that is absolutely essential if we \n     hope to make an understanding of the past a springboard to a \n     better future.\n       Similarly, we can learn about shared values from mentors at \n     home, in a school or a house of worship, but those values \n     take on a new and amplified reality when we can see them \n     embodied in a place. Back in 1966, the visionaries who sought \n     to define the work of preservation in the groundbreaking \n     report With Heritage So Rich encapsulated this concept when \n     they wrote that our movement's ultimate success would be \n     determined by its ability to ``give a sense of orientation to \n     our society, using structures and objects of the past to \n     establish values of time and place.''\n       The places we cherish--the places that we, as \n     preservationists, work to save--are symbols, but they are not \n     abstractions. They are real and tangible. They surround, \n     support and illuminate almost every aspect of our daily \n     lives. And they embody our most fundamental values.\n       The nation's schools symbolize the value of education, the \n     importance of good citizenship. Our courthouses embody our \n     commitment to the rule of law. State capitols and city halls \n     are monumental representations of the grandeur and stability \n     of democratic government. Shrines like the Lincoln Memorial \n     and the Statue of Liberty refresh the wells of patriotism \n     that lie deep within all of us. Churches and synagogues and \n     mosques symbolize our freedom to worship as we please. Barns \n     and fields and farmhouses remind us of our strong ties to the \n     land and summon images of the restless, adventurous spirit \n     that pushed us across a continent. Main Streets from coast to \n     coast are a bricks-and-mortar textbook on the virtues of hard \n     work and free enterprise. Residential neighborhoods \n     everywhere speak eloquently about the things that we cherish \n     most: community, family, home.\n       They are buildings, certainly. But they are much more than \n     that. They are the places we depend on as anchors in a \n     restless, uncertain world. They are the wellsprings of the \n     sense of continuity that one historian has called ``part of \n     the very backbone of human dignity.'' They are the magnets \n     that pull us together to commemorate, to celebrate, to mourn, \n     to mark the major passages in our national life. They are, in \n     effect, the story of us as a nation and a people--a powerful \n     story written in wood and stone and steel.\n       We need them. Preservationists have been saying that for a \n     long time, and now--probably more than ever before--people \n     understand what we mean. A part of what makes us human is our \n     need to belong to a specific place with a history, a \n     geography and a set of values.\n       A nation at war needs these places more than ever. Arthur \n     Schlesinger has written that the recent history of America is \n     a story of ``too much pluribus and not enough unum.''\n       In times like these, unity is essential. An understanding \n     of the history and values that we share is part of the \n     cultural ``glue'' that binds us together, that keeps our \n     society from cracking apart into dozens of separate pieces. \n     If we're to meet the challenge of living in a changed world, \n     it is imperative that we pledge our best efforts to \n     recognizing and safeguarding the places that help give us a \n     sense of community--and a sense of continuity.\n       We need these places--but we can lose them. We've always \n     known they are fragile, but last month, in images that will \n     stay with us for the rest of our lives, we were reminded of \n     just how quickly and stunningly our symbols can be taken from \n     us. For some time now, we've been saying that the National \n     Trust's mission is to protect the irreplaceable. In the \n     aftermath of September 11 we realize anew, with a terrible \n     clarity, how important this mission is.\n       More than 150 years ago, the English artist and critic John \n     Ruskin wrote, ``Architecture is to be regarded by us with the \n     most serious thought. We may live without her, we may worship \n     without her, but we cannot remember without her.'' In times \n     like these, we need to remember who we are. It's essential to \n     remember the long process that made us Americans, to remember \n     the struggles, the crises, the triumphs that we've known in \n     the past--and to be sustained and empowered by that memory. \n     This means that more than ever before, we preservationists \n     must work to ensure that the places that embody what America \n     stands for are kept safe, firm and alive so that we can \n     continue to learn from them, be enriched by them, draw \n     strength and inspiration from them.\n       So what happens now? It's a complicated question, but it \n     has, I think, a deceptively simple answer: We go on. As \n     individual Americans, we'll go on with our lives. As \n     preservationists, we'll go on with our job, strengthened by a \n     renewed conviction that our job is essential to the unity and \n     well-being of the nation we love.\n       There is plenty of work to be done right now. There is an \n     entire sector of a city to be repaired or rebuilt. There are \n     thousands of businesses, institutions and individuals to be \n     housed. Perhaps most important, there is a wound in the \n     nation's soul to be healed.\n       It's an enormous job--and I'm very pleased to report that \n     the National Trust has already rolled up its sleeves and \n     started to work. Here's a quick snapshot of what we're doing:\n       The Trust is participating in a working group of 10 public- \n     and private-sector organizations that will undertake a \n     comprehensive,\n\n[[Page S11607]]\n\n     coordinated effort to assess damage to historic buildings in \n     lower Manhattan and deal with other preservation issues \n     stemming from the tremendous damage in that area.\n       As an outgrowth of this collaboration with our New York \n     partners, the National Trust is one of 5 organizations that \n     have established the Lower Manhattan Emergency Preservation \n     Fund, which will make grants to help alleviate the impact of \n     the disaster and to stabilize, renovate, and restore damaged \n     historic sites in Lower Manhattan. We've already pledged \n     $10,000 to this fund, and we're prepared to do more. The \n     Lower East Side Tenement Museum, a National Trust historic \n     site located within sight of Ground Zero, opened its doors to \n     shelter those fleeing the financial district on September 11. \n     Now, as part of its longstanding commitment to programs that \n     promote cultural tolerance and understanding, the museum--\n     with support from Trust employee contributions--is launching \n     new initiatives focusing on understanding the Arab-American \n     experience.\n       National Trust staff are also contributing to the Service \n     Employees September 11th Relief Fund, established to provide \n     assistance to the thousands of janitors, day porters, \n     security guards, tour guides and other service employees \n     working in the World Trade Center and the Pentagon who were \n     either killed or injured in the attacks, or who are out of \n     work indefinitely because of the damage to these buildings.\n       Anyone who wishes to contribute to these funds is certainly \n     welcome to do so. Already we have collected more than \n     $11,000. We'll continue to increase this amount with your \n     help tonight--in the lobby as you leave there will be \n     volunteers accepting your contributions to this effort. Thank \n     you in advance for your help. For future and ongoing \n     contributions, you can get information about them at the \n     National Trust programs booth in the Resource Center.\n       These efforts mark the mere beginning of what will be a \n     long process of recovery and rebuilding. I'm convinced that \n     it will challenge this organization and the preservation \n     movement as a whole. Fortunately we are positioned to meet \n     the challenge effectively. As you'll hear in a few moments, \n     our financial base is strong and getting stronger. And our \n     programs to help Americans appreciate their heritage and \n     strengthen efforts to save it are meeting unprecedented \n     success.\n       My confidence in the National Trust's ability to meet this \n     challenge extends to the preservation movement as a whole. \n     We've never been stronger. Historic sites across the country \n     are doing a better job than ever of linking us with our \n     past and reminding us of its relevance to our daily lives. \n     There are more--and more effective--statewide and local \n     organizations than ever before. Together, we're making a \n     real difference--a difference you can see in landmark \n     buildings put to innovative uses; in traditional downtowns \n     given new economic life; in historic neighborhood schools \n     adapted to provide state-of-the-art learning environments \n     for today's students; in farmland and open spaces \n     protected from wasteful sprawl; in historic sites where \n     interpretive programs bring our heritage alive; and in \n     communities rescued from decades of disinvestment and \n     deterioration.\n       Because of the great strides our movement has made in \n     recent decades, it's hard to find a city or town where \n     preservation's benefits aren't clearly and proudly--and even \n     profitably--displayed. This widespread success is helping \n     vast new audiences learn what you and I have always known for \n     a long time: that preservation is not about buildings, it's \n     about lives.\n       It's about saving historic places not just as isolated bits \n     of architecture and landscape, not just as lifeless \n     monuments, but as environments where we can connect with the \n     lives of the generations that came before us, places where we \n     can build and maintain safe, rich, meaningful lives for \n     ourselves and the generations that will come after us.\n       Our strengths, our skills, our experience and our unique \n     perspective will see us through this challenge. But I am \n     convinced that it won't be easy--and what's more, it \n     certainly won't be quick. In the altered context in which we \n     now operate, many questions remain to be answered: How will \n     the changing and uncertain state of the economy affect us? \n     How will the events of September 11 affect the growing \n     momentum of the back-to-the-city movement? Can we take steps \n     to ensure that smart-growth issues such as improved passenger \n     rail and mass-transit options and increased development \n     density are included in the national recovery agenda?\n       Can we develop innovative, yet sensitive ways to address \n     the very real concerns for public safety in historic \n     buildings and gathering places? How can we best help the \n     public understand the importance of a strong commitment to \n     historic preservation as an essential component of building \n     our national unity?\n       These are tough questions. There are dozens more, all \n     equally challenging. We'll need time and perspective and lots \n     of serious conversation before we find answers to them. This \n     conference provides an excellent forum for starting those \n     conversations. As Americans, one of our greatest strengths is \n     our identity. Knowing who we are makes us strong. Knowing \n     where we came from makes us confident. Knowing the legacy we \n     have inherited makes us part of a powerful partnership \n     between past, present, and future.\n       Passing on that knowledge--of who we are, where we came \n     from and what is the legacy that shapes and enriches us --is \n     what preservation is all about. It's what makes preservation \n     such important--and yes, noble--work. The Talmud tells us, \n     ``We do not see things as they are. We see them as we are.'' \n     As preservationists, we have a unique way of seeing things. \n     Our vision can help America find its way through the \n     uncertainties of this new world. We will pass on that vision.\n       As preservationists, we understand the strength that comes \n     from a shared sense of the rich heritage that is ours as \n     Americans. We will pass on that heritage--and the strength \n     that grows with it.\n       We know that our work is America's work. We know that the \n     heritage we share is worthy of our best efforts to save it. \n     We know that the skills and vision we offer have never been \n     more important--or more needed. We have an enormous job to \n     do--but it's the same job we've been doing for a long time, \n     and we know how to do it well.\n       So let us go forward with a renewed sense of purpose. The \n     heritage we preserve will sustain us in these very different \n     and trying times. The heritage we pass on will enrich and \n     inspire generations of Americans to come.\n       May God bless our work as preservationists. May God bless \n     America.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/08/senate-section/article/S11607-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11607-S11609]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ADDRESS TO THE NATIONAL PRESS CLUB BY WINSTON S. CHURCHILL\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, I rise to day to pay tribute to a great \nfriend of the United States and a man whose unique perspective on the \ncurrent events of the world is worthy of our attention. Recently, I had \nthe rare honor of spending some time with Winston S. Churchill. His \ngrandfather, former Prime Minister Sir Winston Churchill is a hero to \nmany Americans including myself. Sir Winston's leadership of the \nBritish people in their darkest hours are a source of inspiration for \nall of us in these uncertain times. His picture hangs on the wall of my \noffice and a recording of his speeches remains ready to be played in my \ncar should I need inspiration for the day ahead. In the face of \nadversity and as his country was faced with the most brutal of all \nenemies, Churchill steadfastly ``held the line.'' In October of 1941, \njust over 60 years ago, Churchill spoke these words to the young men of \nHarrow school:\n\n       Never give in, never give in, never, never, never, never. \n     In nothing, great or small, large or petty--never give in \n     except to convictions of honor and good sense. Never yield to \n     force; never yield to the apparently overwhelming might of \n     the enemy.\n\n  Those words inspire me to keep fighting in the Senate for what is \nright and for what is good. Those words inspire me to keep working \ntoward the righteous goal in the conflict in which the United States \nand the United Kingdom are fighting today. I have no doubt that, were \nSir Winston alive today, he would be standing beside our country in \nthis crisis, just as Prime Minister Blair has done.\n  Last month, at a dinner hosted by the Churchill Center, I had the \nhonor of meeting with Winston S. Churchill. Just like his grandfather, \nWinston S. Churchill has led a remarkable life. His experience as a \nformer war correspondent and Member of Parliament has, I believe, given \nhim a unique insight into our current War on Terrorism. He has traveled \nthe globe and has a deep understanding of the different peoples and \ncultures of our world. In particular, my colleagues may benefit from \nhis interesting and thought provoking assessment of the current \nsituation he made in an address to the National Press Club on October \n11, 2001.\n  I ask unanimous consent this address be printed in the Record and, on \nbehalf of the American people, I offer Winston S. Churchill my sincere \nappreciation for everything that he has done to further the ``special \nrelationship'' between the United States and Great Britain.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Confronting the Challenge of Terrorism\n\n (Address to the National Press Club, Washington, DC, on Thursday, 11 \n                 October 2001, by Winston S. Churchill)\n\n       I find it a remarkable honour, as a former war \n     correspondent of the 1960s and early 1970s, to be your guest \n     here today. At the time I received your invitation back in \n     May, it was my intention to speak to you on the theme of the \n     Special Relationship, which it was fashionable--especially in \n     media circles--to regard as finished. Though that remains an \n     underlying theme, the subject of my address to you today is: \n     Confronting the Challenge of Terrorism.\n       Precisely one month ago today, the vilest and most \n     devastating terrorist attack was\n\n[[Page S11608]]\n\n     perpetrated against innocent civilians. Let there be no \n     doubt: in striking at New York's Twin Towers and at the \n     Pentagon here in Washington, the terrorists were striking at \n     us all, all that is who value freedom, decency and democratic \n     government.\n       I happened to be in New York at the time and watched in \n     disbelief as, one after the other, these two proud icons \n     disappeared from New York's skyline. I saw the courage of the \n     men and women of New York's Fire and Police Departments and \n     the calm resolve of the ordinary citizens in the face of \n     terror, which came without warning out of a clear blue sky.\n       It evoked for me memories of wartime London. I was a Blitz \n     baby, born in 1940, and my earliest memories are of bombs \n     falling on London, of blazing buildings, of anti-aircraft \n     tracer crisscrossing the night sky and of many a night spent \n     in public shelters beneath the streets of London.\n       Indeed I understand that Mayor Guiliani, who has been such \n     a tower of strength to New Yorkers in their hour of crisis, \n     has become so fond of quoting my Grandfather, that he has \n     earned the accolade of ``Churchill in a ball cap''. The words \n     of Winston Churchill, in a speech to the House of Commons--\n     following Hitler's orders to the German Luftwaffe to begin \n     terror-bombing the civilian population of Britain--are indeed \n     most apposite. They apply every bit as much to New Yorkers \n     and the people of America today:\n       ``[Hitler] hopes by killing large numbers of civilians, and \n     women and children, that he will terrorise and cow the people \n     of this mighty imperial city. . . . Little does he know the \n     spirit of the British nation, or the tough fibre of the \n     Londoners. . . .\n       ``This wicked man, the repository and embodiment of many \n     forms of soul-destroying hatred, this monstrous product of \n     former wrongs and shame, has now resolved to try to break our \n     famous island race by a process of indiscriminate slaughter \n     and destruction.\n       ``What he has done is to kindle a fire in British hearts, \n     here and all over the world, which . . . will burn with a \n     steady and consuming flame until the last vestiges of Nazi \n     tyranny have been burned out of Europe, and until the Old \n     World--and the New--can join hands to rebuild the temples of \n     man's freedom and man's honour, upon foundations which will \n     not be soon or easily overthrown. . . .''\n       The reference to ``the temples of man's freedom'' has a \n     haunting echo about it, and I could not help but notice the \n     date of that 1940 speech: poignantly, it was 11th of \n     September.\n       However much we may wish our lives to return to normality, \n     things can never be the same again. What happened on Tuesday, \n     11 September 2001, is something that has changed the lives of \n     us all. There is a new sense of vulnerability and a \n     realisation of how tenuous a hold each one of us has on life \n     when--with barely a split second's warning--death can come \n     upon us out of a clear blue sky. It is not just New Yorkers, \n     Washingtonians or Americans, who have been touched by this \n     outrage, but all of us, wherever we may live.\n       Jogging round London's Hyde Park the other day I noticed--\n     just as I had in Central Park a few days earlier--how much \n     more friendly we have suddenly all become. There was a smile \n     or ``good morning'' from total strangers who, previously, \n     would just have gone about their business like planets \n     spinning in their own orbits, heedless of the rest of the \n     universe. All at once we have come to realise how much we \n     depend upon each other. More than ever before, we are \n     extending the hand of friendship to total strangers.\n       Even at national level, new friendships and alliances are \n     being forged, while old ones are being put to the test. \n     Suddenly President Putin is our friend and Russia has become \n     our ally in encompassing the defeat of the Taliban in \n     Afghanistan, giving its blessing to Uzbekistan providing a \n     base for a major U.S. military build-up in what was a former \n     Soviet republic. What we are witnessing is nothing less than \n     a revolution in Russia's relations with the West. Even the \n     People's Republic of China appears as an ally for, like \n     Russia, she feels threatened by the spread of Islamic \n     fundamentalism on her borders.\n       The 15 nations of the European Union have pledged their \n     full support for America and the 19 NATO allies have vowed to \n     stand right behind her. What this will mean in practical \n     terms remains to be seen. As someone once very truly \n     remarked: ``It is only at the height of the storm, by the \n     lightning's flash, that you can turn round and see your \n     friends''.\n       In recent years it has become fashionable among the \n     chattering classes on both sides of the Atlantic to declare \n     that the ``Special Relationship'' between the United States \n     and Great Britain was something of the past, indeed \n     effectively dead. Well, to paraphrase Mark Twain, events of \n     the past month have only gone to show that reports of its \n     death were ``greatly exaggerated''.\n       Today, as action continues against the Taliban regime of \n     Afghanistan, United States and British forces stand shoulder \n     to shoulder once again, united as never before. Britain has \n     in place a military force of 24,000 Army, Navy and Air Force, \n     deployed to southern Arabia. Our nuclear submarines, H.M.S. \n     Triumph and Trafalgar, have already engaged the enemy with \n     Tomahawk cruise-missiles, elements of our Special Air Service \n     have undoubtedly, for some time now, been covertly on the \n     ground inside Afghanistan, while our air and ground forces \n     are standing by to attack.\n       Despite the brave words of support from other nations, it \n     is likely, at the end of the day, that the bedrock for any \n     military action in the prosecution of this war against \n     terrorism--and of those states that harbour and support \n     terrorists--will be the British/American alliance, just as it \n     has been British and American pilots alone who, in the wake \n     of the Gulf War and to this day, have risked their lives \n     enforcing the ``No-Fly'' zones over Northern and Southern \n     Iraq.\n       President Bush wasted no time in picking up the gauntlet \n     cast down by the terrorists on 11 September, but perhaps not \n     in the way that Bin Laden imagined. It was doubtless one of \n     his prime aims to provoke the United States into a wild, \n     furious reaction, which would--at a stroke--unite Islam and \n     all Islamic states against America and, in the process, bring \n     about the downfall of the West's friends in the Arab world, \n     including the Saudi monarchy and the Gulf Sheikhdoms, and the \n     pro-Western governments of Pakistan and Egypt.\n       But the President, while declaring war on terrorism and its \n     supporters, has been meticulous and measured in his response. \n     Thus far, the Administration has handled this unprecedented \n     crisis with consummate skill. He has rightly--and \n     repeatedly--gone out of his way to stress that this is a war \n     against terror, not against Islam.\n       He has emphasized that the more than 6 million Moslems and \n     Arabs living in America are, overwhelmingly loyal, patriotic \n     Americans, who love their adoptive country and who are \n     appalled by the actions of those extremist fanatics who, in a \n     telling phrase of the President, are trying to ``hijack \n     Islam'' for their own purposes. The President has set a fine \n     example by extending the hand of friendship to members of \n     America's Islamic community, as has Prime Minister Blair to \n     the 2 million Moslems living in Britain.\n       It is clear that, if we are to win this war against Islamic \n     fundamentalist terrorism--and, though we are told that such \n     terminology is not politically correct, I use those words \n     advisedly--it will only be if we can win and retain the \n     support of moderate Islamic states, and the hearts and minds \n     of the overwhelming majority of Moslems in our own countries \n     and around the world.\n       It is essential that we persuade them to join with us in \n     lancing this boil of fanatical extremism and to destroy the \n     incubus of terror that poses such a mortal threat, not only \n     to Western civilisation, but also to all moderate Arab and \n     Islamic states who are, each and every one of them, our \n     natural partners in this battle. This explains the trouble \n     and effort the Administration has taken to build up a \n     coalition of nations to fight the menace of terrorism. Their \n     support is vital--and I believe it can be won.\n       But we must also realise the extent to which we are walking \n     on eggshells. In my days as a war correspondent in the 1960s, \n     I saw both sides of war. I have seen it from the cockpit of \n     U.S. Air Force Phantom and Super Sabre fighter-bombers, while \n     taking part in air strikes in Vietnam.\n       I have also, at the time of the Nigeria/Biafra civil war, \n     been on the receiving end. I have seen the bomb-bay of an \n     Iluyshin bomber opening up above my head and the bombs \n     cascading down to land a few hundred yards down the street on \n     a maternity clinic, killing dozens of nursing mothers and \n     their babies.\n       Together with New York Times correspondent, Lloyd Garrison, \n     I had the horrific task of reporting and photographing the \n     consequences of a deliberate raid by another Iluyshin on a \n     market place containing some 2,000 civilians, the great \n     majority of them women and children. It was by far the most \n     harrowing task I have ever undertaken in my life and one, \n     which I shall never forget.\n       Those were, of course, the days before the omni-presence of \n     CNN, and before such graphic scenes of horror could be \n     transmitted to our homes in real time. Today it would take \n     only one or two such outrages, in which a school or hospital \n     was hit by accident, for Mr. Bush's elaborately constructed \n     coalition of moderate Islamic states to fall apart and for \n     support to start ebbing away in Europe and even on the home \n     front.\n       It is impossible to guess how long it will take to \n     apprehend Bin Laden and his henchmen, and bring them to \n     justice. That it will be done in time, I have no doubt. \n     Meanwhile the overthrow of the cruel, barbaric Taliban \n     regime, which harbours him, is clearly the top priority. This \n     is an alien regime, established only in the past five years, \n     with funding and arms from Arab countries, by way of \n     Pakistan, which acted as ``godfather'' to the Taliban.\n       Their rule has been so brutal and disastrous that an \n     estimated one in four Afghans have fled as refugees to Iran \n     or Pakistan, creating a massive humanitarian crisis in the \n     region. Once the Taliban have been overthrown, a high \n     priority must be to cut off the funding, not only for the \n     terrorists, but also for the fundamentalist madrassas--the \n     theological schools, established in numerous countries around \n     the world, where the gospel of Islamic purity and anti-\n     Western hatred is preached.\n       Unbelievable though it may seem, no country has been more \n     responsible for this than Saudi Arabia--the West's principal \n     ally in the Middle East. In order to appease and deflect \n     criticism of their pro-Western leanings and opulent \n     lifestyle, the Saudi ruling family--in an act of consummate \n     folly--has poured vast resources into the establishment of \n     these schools and religious universities, in their own \n     country and overseas. They now\n\n[[Page S11609]]\n\n     find that they are riding a tiger of extremist \n     fundamentalism, entirely of their own creation, which \n     threatens the very foundations of their hold on power. As a \n     result, today almost half the young Saudi males coming onto \n     the jobs market have only religious qualifications, making \n     them not only unemployed, but unemployable. In consequence, \n     barely one in four is able to find a job. The rest make a \n     fertile field of disaffection, from which bin Laden is able \n     to recruit new generations of suicide-bombers, hijackers and \n     terrorists, and it is no coincidence that many of last \n     month's hijackers were Saudis.\n       More horrifying yet, if estimates attributed to the CIA are \n     to be believed, in recent years some 70,000 militants have \n     passed through bin Laden's terrorist training camps in \n     Afghanistan and are currently dispersed across no fewer than \n     55 countries around the world, including our own. New attacks \n     are inevitable--and some, undoubtedly, will succeed--\n     before this hydra-headed monster of international \n     terrorism is destroyed.\n       While it will be difficult for the Saudi government to \n     bring it's extremist theological schools under control and \n     integrate them within the state education system, if it fails \n     to do so, it is inevitable that the Saudi ruling family will, \n     sooner or later, forfeit its hold on power, and be drowned by \n     a tidal wave of fundamentalism.\n       Beyond that, intense international and economic pressure \n     will have to be brought to bear on those powerful Islamic \n     states that provide bases and backing for terrorism, \n     especially Iraq, Iran, Syria and Sudan, some of which--such \n     as Iraq--have been working for 30 years or more on obtaining \n     or developing weapons of mass destruction.\n       Indeed, as long as twenty years ago, I was the first to \n     report in the London Times that the French Government, in an \n     act of breath-taking irresponsibility, had sold Saddam \n     Hussein 72 kilograms--or some 160 lbs.--of weapons-grade \n     uranium, sufficient for the manufacture of three nuclear \n     bombs. It was this that, a few months later, prompted the \n     long-range strike by Israeli Air Force jets that took out \n     Saddam's Osirak reactor.\n       Some of these rogue states are already in a position to \n     equip terrorists with weapons of mass-destruction, especially \n     with agents of chemical and biological warfare. Meanwhile, \n     they are themselves working on--or seeking to acquire from \n     North Korea--intermediate or long-range missiles, with which \n     to threaten their neighbours, including Israel and Saudi \n     Arabia, as well as Western Europe.\n       It would be a mistake for the United States and her close \n     allies to set out their full agenda but, where peaceful means \n     prove inadequate to ensure the ending of these programmes \n     that potentially menace millions of innocent civilians, we \n     shall have no choice but to do so by military action.\n       There will be those, both in America and in Britain, who \n     will not have the stomach for such a fight, and there will be \n     many of our coalition partners, not only in the Middle East, \n     but also in Europe, who will fall by the wayside as the \n     campaign expands in scope. But, come what may, we must have \n     the courage and resolve to see this through to victory.\n       Horrific though the attacks were, that were wrought against \n     innocent civilians on 11 September, can anyone doubt that \n     what we saw in New York and Washington a month ago was but a \n     foretaste of far, far worse to come?\n       It is certain that if we do not have the courage to \n     extirpate this cancer of terrorism once and for all, that our \n     children and grandchildren will live to see whole cities \n     consumed by fire and large numbers of their fellow-citizens \n     struck down by devastating, and incurable, plagues. We shall \n     not be talking of a few thousands or tens of thousands of \n     civilians being blown away in an instant, but rather of \n     millions. This has indeed been a wake-up call from hell and \n     we have no option but to heed the warning.\n       At the same time it is vital that we appreciate exactly \n     what we are up against and just how high are the stakes for \n     which we are playing. In the 1930s it was fashionable to \n     dismiss Hitler's declared aims as the ravings of a mad man. \n     He was not a mad man. He was a deeply flawed genius, who came \n     within a hair's breadth of victory.\n       By the same token, it would be a terrible mistake to \n     dismiss Osama bin Laden as no more than a mad mullah hiding \n     out in some cave in Afghanistan. He is a brilliant but evil \n     man, with a limitless well of hatred for everything that \n     constitutes the values of Western society, all that we hold \n     dear: freedom, democracy, prosperity and tolerance.\n       His aim is to garner the resources that would enable him to \n     inflict infinitely greater damage upon the United States and \n     her allies, including especially Israel. Already bin Laden \n     and the Taliban, which works hand-in-glove with him, control \n     70 percent of the world's opium production. By way of \n     example, 90 percent of heroin sold on the streets of Britain \n     today comes from Afghanistan and it is this that constitutes \n     the primary source of funding for his campaign of terror \n     against the West. But his ambition ranges far higher. Can \n     anyone doubt but that he has his sights set on the nuclear \n     arsenal of Pakistan and the oil wealth of Arabia?\n       The importance of seeing this war through to victory cannot \n     be overstated. The price of failure would be terrible: far, \n     far more terrible than stopping half way to Baghdad, as we \n     did in the Gulf War. If, for example, faced with mounting \n     casualties--to our forces in the field and to our civilian \n     population at home, as a result of further terrorist \n     outrages--we were to falter or fail, let no one doubt what \n     would be the consequence.\n       Were we to withdraw leaving the job unfinished, bin Laden \n     and his henchmen would be the heroes of Islam. America and \n     her allies would be seen as no more than paper tigers. \n     President Pervaiz Musharraf and the pro-Western elements in \n     Pakistan's armed forces would be swept aside, while those who \n     have long had close links with the Taliban would seize power. \n     At a stroke, bin Laden would have secured control of Islam's \n     one and only nuclear power, estimated to have some 30 \n     tactical nuclear warheads each with the power of 2\\1/2\\ \n     Hiroshima bombs.\n       Nor would that be the end of his ambition. He has avowed \n     his determination to purge his native Saudi Arabia of the \n     infidel American presence which, in his eyes, defiles the \n     Holy Land of Islam. A crisis in the ruling Al Saud dynasty, \n     could pave the way for their violent overthrow by \n     fundamentalist forces linked to bin Laden.\n       Armed with the oil-wealth of Arabia--amounting to one \n     quarter of the world's reserves--the drug-wealth of \n     Afghanistan and the nuclear capability of Pakistan, in \n     addition to a terrorist network with tentacles in 55 \n     countries, bin Laden would constitute a desperately grave \n     threat to the entire Western world. Now that battle is \n     joined, we have no choice but to see it through to victory, \n     however long the road, however great the cost.\n       Since the words and spirit of my Grandfather have been \n     invoked already many times in the past month, I can do no \n     better than to conclude with a quote from Winston Churchill's \n     first address to the House of Commons on becoming Prime \n     Minister in May 1940:\n       ``You ask what is our policy? I will say: It is to wage war \n     by sea, land and air, with all our might and with all the \n     strength that God can give us: to wage war against a \n     monstrous tyranny, never surpassed in the dark, lamentable \n     catalogue of human crimes. That is our policy.\n       ``You ask: What is our aim? I can answer in one word. It is \n     victory. Victory at all costs, victory in spite of all \n     terror. However long or hard the road may be; for without \n     victory there is no survival.''\n       I say to our friends and allies in Europe and around the \n     globe, this is not America's battle alone; it is a battle on \n     behalf of the whole world, and on behalf of generations yet \n     unborn. Together we have overcome far more powerful enemies \n     than those that assail us today. I have every confidence \n     that, in confronting this new challenge, America and \n     Britain--together with our allies--can prevail and shall \n     prevail, just as together we have triumphed in the past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/08/senate-section/article/S11609-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11609-S11610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    30TH ANNIVERSARY OF CENTER POINT\n\n Mrs. BOXER.

These efforts not only \nserve to rescue individual lives, they have the power to heal families \nand ultimately transform whole communities.\n  I believe strongly in the work being done at Center Point and at \nsimilar facilities around California and the Nation. We need to \nencourage and enable these programs that are making a difference. I \nintroduced my Treatment on Demand Assistance Act this year to do just \nthat. My bill would double the Federal Government's funding for drug \nand alcohol treatment over 5 years, from the current $3 billion to $6 \nbillion. It also provides for incentives to States that have instituted \na policy of emphasizing treatment over incarceration for non-violent \ndrug offenders.\n  Treatment works. When we invest in it and other programs proven to \nimprove lives, we are investing in a safer, healthier future for us \nall. Center Point has been proving this for 30 years.\n\n[[Page S11610]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/08/senate-section/article/S11610-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT JEFFREY HOJNACKE\n\n Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Madam President, I would like to take \nthis opportunity to pay tribute to Oregon native, Sergeant Jeffrey \nHojnacke, a member of the 3rd United States Infantry, better known as \n``The Old Guard.'' Sergeant Hojnacke's accomplishments while serving as \na sentinel at the Tomb of the Unknowns personify the hallowed \nprinciples of duty, honor, and country. After joining ``The Old Guard'' \nin 1995, Sergeant Hojnacke performed his first ``walk'' at the Tomb of \nthe Unknowns in Arlington National Cemetery in May 1996. Completely \nselfless and dedicated, Sergeant Hojnacke never missed a day of duty, \nand routinely filled in for others. On October 17, 2001, after over 5 \nyears of duty standing watch over the most sacred of American shrines, \nSergeant Jeffery Hojnacke completed his 1,500th and last ``walk'' at \nthe Tomb of the Unknowns. To put this accomplishment into perspective, \nvery few sentinels in the history of the Tomb of the Unknowns have \nreached the coveted ``1000 walk'' mark, and no one has come close to \nthe 1,500 walks completed by Sergeant Hojnacke. This is a record that \nwill undoubtedly stand for many years.\n  On behalf of a grateful nation, let the record show the Congress of \nthe United States of America honors the selfless service and \naccomplishments of Sergeant Jeffrey Hojnacke, an American hero, patriot \nand ``Iron-Man'' of the Tomb of the Unknowns.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/08/senate-section/article/S11610-2", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/08/senate-section/article/S11610-3", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/08/senate-section/article/S11610-4", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11610]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCALENDAR YEAR 1999 REPORT ON ACTIVITIES UNDER THE NATIONAL TRAFFIC AND \n MOTOR VEHICLE SAFETY ACT OF 1966, THE HIGHWAY SAFETY ACT OF 1966, AND \n  THE MOTOR VEHICLE INFORMATION AND COST SAVINGS ACT OF 1972--MESSAGE \n                       FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 55\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n\n       To the Congress of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith the Department of Transportation's Calendar Year \n1999 reports on Activities Under the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle \nSafety Act of 1966, the Highway Safety Act of 1966, and the Motor \nVehicle Information and Cost Savings Act of 1972.\n                                                      George W.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \ncertain interstate conduct relating to exotic animals; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Captive \nExotic Animal Protection Act. This legislation was first introduced in \nthe 104th Congress by former Senator Frank Lautenberg and I am pleased \nto be here today continuing his legacy.\n  The Captive Exotic Animal Protection Act would make it illegal to \nknowingly transfer, transport, or possess in interstate commerce of \nforeign commerce, a confined exotic mammal for the purposes of allowing \nthe killing or injuring of that animal for entertainment or for the \ncollection of a trophy. The bill protects exotic mammals that have been \nheld in captivity for the shorter of a. the greater part of the \nanimal's life, or b. a period of one year, whether or not the defendant \nknew the length of the captivity. This bill is intended to prevent the \ncruel and unsporting practice of what we have come to know as ``canned \nhunts.''\n  Words cannot describe a ``canned'' hunt. The images that I have seen,\n\n[[Page S11613]]\n\nfootage taken surreptitiously at these ranches, provides evidence that \nthe treatment of these animals is troubling. Today, at more than 1,000 \ncommercial canned hunt operations across the country, trophy hunters \npay a fee to shoot captive exotic animals, from African lions to \ngiraffes, blackbuck antelope, assorted African goats and sheep, a \nCorsican ram, or a boar, in fenced-in enclosures. The hunting of these \nanimals typically occurs in a fenced enclosure and is often in a \n``guaranteed kill'' arrangement meaning that a hunter by virtue of the \nfact that he has paid his fee is assured of a kill.\n  Now hunting is a sport and if you ask any of the hunters in my home \nState of Delaware or elsewhere about this they will tell you that there \nis an ethic of hunting that involves consideration of fair chase, \naffording the animal the opportunity to evade or elude the hunter. \nCanned hunts, in fenced-in enclosures, weigh the odds so heavily in \nfavor of the hunters that it essentially eliminates the fair chase \ncomponent. In addition, these animals on hunting ranches are often fed \nby hand, in a sense domesticated, and have little or no fear of humans. \nThey don't run when they see a human being in front of them. This \npractice is unfair and unsportsmanlike.\n  But it is not just about the fact that this practice is inhumane, \nthere are also other concerns. Clustered in a captive setting at \nunusually high densities, confined exotic animals often attract disease \nmore readily than more widely dispersed native species who roam freely. \nThese exotics then interact with native species through fences, \njeopardizing the health of deer, elk, and other native species. Animal \ndisease places hunting programs and wildlife watching programs, that \ngenerate millions of dollars in economic activity, at risk.\n  While a number of States have taken action to prohibit the practice \nof canned hunts, California, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Maryland, \nMassachusetts, Montana, Nevada, North Carolina, New Jersey, Oregon, \nRhode Island, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming have passed such \nstatutes, that is only a small segment of the country. Unfortunately, \nthe regulation of the transport and treatment of exotic animals on \nshooting preserves falls outside the traditional domains of State \nagriculture departments and State fish and games agencies. The Captive \nExotic Animal Protection Act is specifically designed to address this \nproblem, which directly involves an issue of interstate commerce.\n  This is sensible legislation that is backed by responsible hunters, \nanimal protection advocates, wildlife scientists, environmentalists and \nzoological professionals. The Boone and Crockett Club and the Izaak \nWalton League of America, nationally recognized hunting clubs, have \npolicy positions affirmatively opposing canned hunts. In addition, this \nlegislation is supported by the Humane Society of the United States, \nthe Doris Day Animal League, the Fund for Animals, and the Animal \nProtection Institute.\n  I want to say to my colleagues who may have questions about this \nlegislation that the Captive Exotic Animal Protection Act is limited in \nits scope and purpose and will not limit the licensed hunting of any \nnative mammals or any native or exotic birds. The bill is directed at \ntrue ``canned'' hunts and covers only exotic mammals, or those not \nhistorically indigenous to the United States. Birds, native or non-\nnative, and indigenous mammals, such as white tail deer and bears, are \nnot covered by the bill. This legislation is a federal remedy and \nproposed specifically to deal with the purely commercial interstate \nmovement of exotic animals destined to be killed at canned hunting \nranches.\n  I hope you will join me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1656. A bill to provide for the improvement of the processing of \nclaims for veterans compensation and pension, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I am proud today to introduce the \nVeterans Benefits Administration Improvement Act of 2001, a bill that \naims to decrease the amount of time it takes the Veterans Benefits \nAdministration, VBA, to process veterans' claims. I am pleased to be \njoined by the senior Senator from Utah, Senator Hatch. He had long been \na strong advocate for our veterans.\n  In 1999, there were 309,000 backlogged claims at the VBA. Today, that \nnumber stands at 533,000. It now takes an average of 202 days to \nprocess disability compensation and pension claims. This figure is \nexpected to grow to more than 270 days by 2002. Many of the claims that \nare awaiting action have been filed by World War II and Korean War \nveterans; our World War II veterans are dying at the rate of about \n1,500 a day. The VBA must take action to improve this dismal record.\n  I have traveled throughout Wisconsin and met with veterans. This \nproblem is consistently one of their top concerns. They are angry and \nfrustrated, with justification, about the amount of time it takes for \nthe VBA to process their claims. In some instances, veterans are \nwaiting well over a year. Telling the men and women who served their \ncountry in the armed forces that they ``just have to wait'' is wrong \nand unacceptable.\n  The VBA Improvement Act will require the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs to submit a comprehensive plan to Congress for the improvement \nof the processing of claims for veterans compensation and pension. In \naddition, every six months afterwards the Secretary must report to \nCongress about the status of the program.\n  While I am pleased that Secretary Principi has acknowledged that \nimproving claims processing is a priority for the VA, nevertheless it \nis time for Congress to hold the Department of Veterans Affairs \naccountable. Our veterans are unable to wait for additional \nrecommendations from more reports or task forces. It is time for \nCongress to hold the VA accountable. Our veterans deserve no less.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. DeWine, and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1658. A bill to improve Federal criminal penalties on false \ninformation and terrorist hoaxes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, today Senator DeWine and I are \nintroducing a bill that will address what has sadly become a very \nserious problem. Since September 11, the number of terrorist hoaxes has \nincreased dramatically.\n  The bill that we introduce today would fill a gap in the law by \nexplicitly making the commission of a terrorist hoax illegal and \npunishable by up to five years in jail.\n  The last seven weeks have been difficult for all Americans. By \nnature, we Americans are tough. But many of us, myself included, are \nalso a little more anxious than usual. That is understandable. But what \nis not understandable, in fact what is barely conceivable, is that some \npeople think it is funny to take advantage of that fear.\n  Each terrorist hoax means a waste of valuable law enforcement time \nand scarce resources.\n  Our police officers and the FBI are already working around the clock \nto catch and arrest everyone involved in the September 11 attack, to \nfind the perpetrators of the anthrax attacks, and to prevent future \nattacks from taking place.\n  Wasting law enforcement's time and resources by committing terrorist \nhoaxes takes away from their ability to protect us. So in many ways, \ncommitting a terrorist hoax is an extension of terrorism itself.\n  Beyond that, each terrorist hoax mocks the loss of thousands of lives \nin the September 11 attack and the recent deaths from anthrax.\n  In the first three weeks of October alone, the FBI has responded to \nmore than 3,300 cases relating to weapons of mass destruction, \nincluding 2,500 threat assessments involving suspected anthrax \nincidents. Normally, they deal with 250 of these cases in an entire \nyear. The last thing the FBI and the police have time for is a \nterrorist hoax.\n  Unfortunately, many of my fellow New Yorkers can attest to the fear \nand the commitment of resources caused by one of these terrorist \nhoaxes.\n  In Nassau County, on October 16, a Federal Express deliveryman placed \na white powdery substance inside a computer package. That led to an \nunderstandably frantic phone call. Seven officers and three vehicles \nwere dispatched in response to this anthrax hoax.\n\n[[Page S11614]]\n\n  On October 26, a Staten Island man sent a threatening letter in a \npowder-laced envelope to his girlfriend.\n  An apparent hoax diverted a Dallas-bound American Airlines flight \nfrom New York's LaGuardia Airport to Washington, DC's Dulles Airport on \nOctober 29 after a threatening note was found on board. The passengers \nand flight crew were all forced to evacuate on the runway. The impact \non the entire airport's operations were disrupted, and the entire \nnational air traffic control system had to deal with this.\n  On October 17, a 17-year-old brought an envelope with the words \n``Death to All Who Open This'' to Kingston High School in the Hudson \nValley. The envelope contained white, powdery material. According to \nschool officials, approximately 3,000 students and staff were held in \nlock-down for 90 minutes while some 50 local police, fire, and \nemergency response personnel assessed the situation.\n  Now more than ever, we need to send a loud and clear message to the \nperpetrators of hoaxes of all kinds: Your behavior is wrong. It is \ndisgusting. And it is a serious crime.\n  The legislation that Senator DeWine and I are introducing today sends \nthat message.\n  Anyone convicted of committing a hoax terrorist attack involving a \nfake explosive incendiary, biological, chemical, or nuclear device, or \nfalsely reporting one of these attacks, will be punished by a prison \nsentence of up to five years as well as stiff monetary fines.\n  In addition, anyone convicted of committing a terrorist hoax would be \nheld responsible for reimbursement for all expenses resulting from the \nhoax.\n  This bill makes it clear that committing a terrorist hoax is no \nlaughing matter.\n  My hope is that by sending a strong message today and in the weeks to \ncome, those who are thinking about committing a terrorist hoax will \nthink twice before diverting the police and FBI from focusing all of \ntheir time and energy on protecting us from real threats, and before \nanother hoax puts us on edge, yet again.\n  Mr. DeWINE. Madam President, I rise today to discuss a distressing \nproblem facing our citizens, our Nation's law enforcement officers, and \nour public health officials. This problem is the growing threat of \nbioterrorism and other weapons of mass destruction--both real and \nperceived.\n  The recent bioterrorist attacks affecting the media, Congress, and \nthe U.S. Postal Service have spawned a great number of anthrax hoaxes \nacross the Nation. These hoaxes, aside from adding to the widespread \npublic panic over terrorism, have created another serious problem: They \nare taxing our already strained emergency management and public health \nresources, which are vital to protect our national security.\n  Suprisingly, there is no existing Federal code that directly \nprohibits biological, chemical, or nuclear weapon hoaxes. Therefore, \nthere is no Federal law that directly punishes the current anthrax \nhoaxes. These acts waste scarce Federal resources, negatively affecting \ninterstate commerce and national security interests. Yet, there is no \nFederal law on the books to prosecute these offenders.\n  In all likelihood, the current anthrax hoaxes will be prosecuted \nunder a provision for ``mailing threatening communications'' or \nthreatening the ``use of certain weapons of mass destruction,'' 18 USC \n876, 2332a. The problem with prosecuting the anthrax hoaxes under these \nstatutes is that they require the prosecutor to prove that the offender \nhas crossed a threshold of threatening language. But what constitutes \nsufficiently threatening language?\n  Unfortunately, not all of these hoaxes meet this threshold. For \nexample, under current law, it is difficult to prosecute the acts of an \neighth-grade science teacher in Ohio. This teacher placed powered lime \nin a school envelope and attempted to mail it through the postal system \nto her brother in another city. The envelope was found en route at the \nschool, before it could leave the building. The school was evacuated, \nfrightening hundreds of already shaken children and parents. Emergency \nmanagement teams wasted valuable time and resources testing the site.\n  Right now, this woman faces a State charge of inducing panic. That is \nit; no other charges are pending. There is no clear Federal law on the \nbooks to prosecute her offense, because there was no threat. Had there \nbeen an actual incident where anthrax was released while police and \nemergency crews were tied up looking into this hoax, who knows how \nwidespread the damage could have been. Many people could have been \ninfected in the time that it took emergency crews to clear up this \n``joke.''\n  So far, the U.S. Postal Service reports that it has evacuated over \n353 postal facilities for varying amounts of time as a result of more \nthan 8,600 hoaxes, threats, and suspicious incidents related to anthrax \nsince just mid-October. That is an average of 578 a day for an agency \nused to dealing with only a few hundred such calls a year. In my home \nState of Ohio, alone, health officials have tested nearly 800 \nsuspicious specimens from around the State, but have found no anthrax \nor other dangerous substances. A significant number of those reports \nappear to have been hoaxes. On a national scale, the financial and \nphysical strain imposed by hoaxes on our national law enforcement and \npublic health systems have been enormous. In regard to our citizens, \nthese pranks cause great panic and are really acts of terrorism.\n  That is why, along with my colleagues, Senator Schumer and Ranking \nMember Hatch, I have introduced a bill that would create a new crime \nfor hoaxes involving the purported use of a weapon of mass destruction. \nThis bill will prohibit any conduct that gives the false impression \nthat a biological, chemical, or nuclear weapon may be used, when it is \nreasonable to assume that there will be an emergency response. The \nrequired conduct may involve the communication of information, whether \nin written or verbal form, as well as physical actions. Under our bill, \nthere is no legal burden to identify a specific threat. For example, we \nwould be able to prosecute someone who mails an envelope of white \npowder with a note that says, ``Smile, you have been exposed to \nanthrax.''\n  Furthermore, anyone convicted under this bill would be responsible \nfor the reimbursement of expenses incurred in responding to a hoax, \nincluding the cost of any response by any Federal military or civilian \nagency to protect public health or safety during the course of an \ninvestigation. Convicted cohorts also would share in financial \nliability for such a hoax.\n  The Ohio Department of Health, alone, has spent more than $500,000 of \nthe taxpayers' money investigating false anthrax claims--a large \npercentage of which were hoaxes. This bill would discourage hoaxes, \nwhile helping to alleviate the financial burden that these pranks and \nfalse reports are imposing on our Federal, State, and local government \nagencies.\n  It is indeed shocking that some people want to capitalize on the \nrecent horrific acts of terrorism in order to play a joke or \nintentionally cause widespread panic, or worse, inflict physical harm. \nUnfortunately, this is the reality we confront today. To deal with this \nthreat, we need to give our Federal Government the necessary tools to \nprosecute those who would stage these hoaxes and disrupt the sense of \nnormalcy that we have all struggled to recover since September 11th.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HUTCHINSON (for himself and Mr. Session):\n  S. 1659.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n\n[[Page S11615]]\n\n       (1) the expert resources available to the Government to \n     deal with Federal crimes involving actual or potential \n     chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons are limited;\n       (2) false reporting of such crimes almost invariably \n     requires the attention of Federal investigative, scientific, \n     and public health officers and employees, thereby needlessly \n     diverting them from work that is vital to the national \n     security and dangerously impairing the Government's ability \n     to deal with real situations;\n       (3) recent episodes amply demonstrate that even isolated \n     false reports can have a substantial adverse effect on \n     interstate and foreign commerce, causing needless worry or \n     even panic in the general public, and encouraging copycat \n     episodes; and\n       (4) a comprehensive prohibition on such false reports is \n     necessary to preserve scarce and vital Federal resources, to \n     avoid substantial adverse effects on interstate and foreign \n     commerce, and to protect the national security of the United \n     States.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROHIBITION.\n\n       (a) Prohibition on Hoaxes.--Chapter 41 of title 18, United \n     States Code, is amended by adding after section 880 the \n     following:\n\n     ``Sec. 881.

False information and hoaxes.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Kyl):\n  S. 1661. A bill to set up a certification system for research \nfacilities that possess dangerous biological agents and toxins, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I rise to introduce legislation, \ncosponsored by Senator Kyl, to prohibit individuals from possessing \nanthrax, smallpox, and three dozen other of the most dangerous \nbiological agents and toxins.\n  To date, 17 people have confirmed anthrax infections, four of whom \ndied from inhalation anthrax. This toll, though tragic, could have \ngrown exponentially if the perpetrators had used a more sophisticated \ndelivery system.\n  Despite anthrax's and other agents' potential for weaponization, our \ngovernment does not keep track of who possesses them. No special \ncertification is required to possess these agents. Nor are background \nchecks conducted on the laboratory personnel who handle or have access \nto these agents.\n  This situation must change.\n  The legislation I am introducing expands upon the antiterrorism bill \nCongress passed and the President signed just days ago. That bill \nprohibited an individual from possessing anthrax or other potential \nweapons of bioterror unless the individual could show legitimate \npurpose for holding the substance once caught. This standard of \n``legitimate purpose;' is not defined, and will put the burden on \ncourts and law enforcement to determine what a ``legitimate purpose'' \nis.\n  The fact is that current law still does not adequately prevent \nindividual possession of these dangerous agents.\n  During a hearing in the Technology and Terrorism Subcommittee of the \nJudiciary Committee yesterday, it became clear to those of us on the \ncommittee that law enforcement does not know who has anthrax, where it \nis stored, or what is being done with it.\n  When asked if domestic laboratories were the source of the anthrax \nsent to Senator Daschle's office, the FBI witness said the FBI didn't \nknow.\n  When asked how many labs in the United States handle anthrax or are \ncapable of developing the highly refined anthrax used in the Daschle \nletter, the FBI answered again that it did not know.\n  When asked how many labs in the United States handle anthrax or are \ncapable of devlopoing the highly refined anthrax used in the Daschle \nletter, the FBI answered again that it did not know.\n  And the same goes for more than three dozen other dangerous agents \nlike small pox, ebola virus, and ricin.\n  Under our legislation, no individual could possess any of these \ndangerous agents, period.\n  Any medical or research lab wishing to possess or use these dangerous \nagents must first be certified by the United States Department of \nHealth and Human Services.\n  Individuals in those labs who handle or who have access to these \nagents must undergo background checks, and the labs themselves must \ninstitute strict safety precautions.\n  And every single research lab, medical office, or other entity \nwishing to possess any one of these 40 some agents ruled dangerous by \nthe CDC must demonstrate to the Secretary a legitimate purpose for that \npossession.\n  The purpose of the legislation is to assure that law enforcement and \npublic health officials know much more about who has these agents, \nwhere and how they are stored, and what is being done with them.\n  Right now, we do not have this information.\n  Moreover, the bill will make it harder for terrorists to get access \nto these agents by requiring background checks and assuring that labs \npossessing these agents have adequately security safeguards.\n  I can think of no legitimate reason why an ordinary person needs to \npossess his or her personal cache of anthrax, small pox, or ebola \nvirus.\n  According to the calculations of some experts, biological weapons are \npound for pound potentially more lethal even than thermonuclear \nweapons.\n  For instance, a 1993 report by the U.S. Congressional Office of \nTechnology Assessment estimated that between 130,000 and 3 million \ndeaths could follow the aerosolized release of 100 keg of anthrax \nspores upwind of the Washington, DC area--lethally matching or \nexceeding that of a hydrogen bomb.\n  It is time to acknowledge that we live in a world where the \ngovernment must take responsibility in protecting the public from those \nwho would misuse these materials. No longer can we stand by and let the \nbalance tip towards free possession of dangerous, even deadly, \nbiological agents.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. Feingold:\n  S. 1664. A bill to require country of origin labeling of raw \nagricultural forms of ginseng, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. Feingold. Madam President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat addresses the increased amount of smuggled and mis-labeled ginseng \nentering this country.\n  This legislation is similar to a bill that I introduced in the last \nCongress, but is strengthened with a number of provisions based on the \nsuggestions from ginseng growers and the Ginseng Board of Wisconsin.\n  In addition to proposing a refined process of country-of-origin \nlabeling for ginseng products, my new legislation closes a loophole in \nthe regulations governing dietary supplements, where producers of \nproducts other than ginseng are currently advertising them as a type of \nginseng.\n  In order to coordinate the efforts to eliminate the practice of \nginseng smuggling, this legislation also requires the Department of \nJustice, EPA, and other Federal agencies to coordinate their efforts to \ncrack down on smuggled ginseng, which often contains pesticides that \nare banned for use in the United States.\n  Chinese and Native American cultures have used ginseng for thousands\n\n[[Page S11616]]\n\nof years for herbal and medicinal purposes.\n  In America, ginseng is experiencing a newfound popularity, and I am \nproud to say that my home State of Wisconsin is playing a central role \nin ginseng's resurgence.\n  Wisconsin produces 97 percent of the ginseng grown in the United \nStates, and 85 percent of the country's ginseng is grown in Marathon \nCounty.\n  The ginseng industry is a economic boon to Marathon County, as well \nas an example of the high quality for which Wisconsin's agriculture \nindustry is known.\n  Wisconsin ginseng commands a premium price in world markets because \nit is of the highest quality and because it has a lower pesticide and \nchemical content.\n  With a huge market for this high-quality ginseng overseas, and \ngrowing popularity for the ancient root here at home, Wisconsin's \nginseng industry should have a prosperous future ahead.\n  Unfortunately, the outlook for ginseng farmers is marred by a serious \nproblem--smuggled and mislabed ginseng. Wisconsin ginseng is considered \nso superior to ginseng grown abroad that smugglers will go to great \nlengths to label ginseng grown in Canada or Asia as ``Wisconsin-\ngrown.''\n  Here's how the switch takes place: Smugglers take Asian or Canadian-\ngrowing ginseng and ship it to plants in China, allegedly to have the \nginseng sorted into various grades.\n  Whle the sorting process is itself a legitimate part of distributing \nginseng, smugglers often use it as a ruse to switch Wisconsin ginseng \nwith the Asian or Canadian ginseng considered inferior by consumers.\n  The smugglers know that while Chinese-grown ginseng has a retail of \nabout $5-$6 per pound, while Wisconsin-grown ginseng is valued at \nroughly $16-$20 per pound.\n  To make matters even tougher for Wisconsin's ginseng farmers, there \nis no accurate way of testing ginseng to determine where it was grown, \nother than testing for pesticides that are legal in Canada and China \nbut are banned in the United States.\n  And in some cases, smugglers can even find ways around the pesticide \ntests. Last year, a ConsumerLab.com study confirmed that much of the \nginseng sold in the U.S. contained harmful chemicals and metals, such \nas lead and arsenic.\n  That is because the majority of ginseng sold in the U.S originates \nfrom countries with lower pesticide standards, so it's vitally \nimportant that consumers know which ginseng is really grown in \nWisconsin.\n  Some domestic and foreign countries are also labeling certain \nproducts as ginseng when they are in fact a distinctly different \nproduct. Due to a loophole in the regulations governing dietary \nsupplements, products other than ginseng are currently advertising \nthemselves as a type of ginseng. For example, some products claim to \ninclude a product known as ``Siberian Ginseng,'' which is actually Eleu\ntherococcus, a bush that is a distinctly different product from \nginseng.\n  Ginseng is a root, not a bush, and consumers have the right to know \nthat when they reach for a high quality ginseng product, they are \nbuying just that--gingseng, not some ground up bush.\n  For the sake of ginseng farmers and consumers, the U.S. Senate must \ncrack down on smuggled and mislabeled ginseng.\n  Without adequate labeling, consumers have no way of knowing the most \nbasic information about the ginseng they purchase, where it was grown, \nwhat quality or grade it is, or whether it contains dangerous \npesticides.\n  My legislation proposes some common sense steps to address two of the \nchallenges facing the ginseng industry, and none of these proposals \ncosts the taxpayers a dime.\n  The first section requires mandatory country of origin labeling at \nthe port of entry, to prevent the practice of mixing foreign ginseng \nwith domestic ginseng. This would allow buyers of ginseng to more \neasily prevent foreign companies from mixing foreign produced ginseng \nwith ginseng produced in America. The country of origin labeling is a \nsimple but effective way to enable consumers to make an informed \ndecision.\n  This legislation also closes a loophole in U.S. law that allows \nproducts other than ginseng to advertise themselves as a type of \nginseng. Under my proposal, when a consumer purchases a product labeled \nas containing ginseng, they will know what they are buying.\n  This legislation also requires the Department of Justice, EPA, and \nother Federal agencies to coordinate their efforts to crack down on \nsmuggled ginseng, which often contains pesticides that are banned for \nuse in the United States. The lax enforcement of smuggled ginseng also \nputs our producers on an unfair playing field. The mixing of superior \nWisconsin ginseng with lower quality foreign ginseng root penalizes the \ngrower and eliminates the incentive to provide the consumer with a \nsuperior product.\n  We must give ginseng growers the support they deserve by implementing \nthese common sense reforms that also help consumers make informed \nchoices about the ginseng that they consume.\n  We must ensure when ginseng consumers reach for a quality ginseng \nproduct, such as Wisconsin grown ginseng, that they are getting the \nreal thing, not a cheap imitation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BIDEN (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1665. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, with respect \nto false information regarding certain criminal violations concerning \nhoax reports of biological, chemical, and nuclear weapons; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BIDEN. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Protection \nAgainst Terrorist Hoaxes Act of 2001. I am honored to have the ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, as an original co-\nsponsor of this legislation. This bill would amend title 18 of the \nUnited States Code to, for the first time, make it a Federal crime to \nknowingly make a hoax report, involving a biological, chemical, nuclear \nweapon, or other weapon of mass destruction. Likewise, it would make it \na criminal offense to knowingly send such a hoax weapon to another.\n  Since the unspeakable terrorist attacks of September 11, our nation \nhas witnessed a mind-boggling number of anthrax hoax reports. This in \nturn has triggered an equally large number of reports of suspected \nbiological agents. No part of the Nation has been spared, and my home \nState of Delaware has had several hundred reports of possible \nbiological agents. Just this week, the FBI reported to Congress the \nstaggering statistic involving these bioterrorism hoaxes and other \nreports of suspected biological agents. Prior to September 11, the FBI \nhad responded to about 100 cases involving potential use of ``weapons \nof mass destruction,'' 67 of which involved alleged biological weapons. \nSince mid-September, however, that number has increased by 3,000 \npercent! As of today, the FBI reported that they have responded to \n7,089 suspicious anthrax letters alone, 950 incidents involving other \nsuspected weapons of mass destruction, and an estimated 29,331 \ntelephonic calls from the public about suspicious packages.\n  The good news is that most of these reports were hoaxes, or reports \nmade by well-meaning people whose suspicions were raised. The bad news \nis that any hoax reports were made in the first place, triggering panic \non the part of the public, and often forcing the Federal, state, and \nlocal governments to waste valuable time and resources responding to \nthem. In one particularly egregious case, it has been reported that an \nemployee of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection \nfalsely reported to security that he had found a yellowish-white powder \non his desk with the misspelled label ``ANTHAX.'' The employee, a 48-\nyear-old solid waste management analyst, knew the material was not \ntoxic, it was determined to be coffee creamer, but persisted in the \nfalse account. 800 State employees were evacuated from the building for \n2 days while law enforcement officials tested the building, at a cost \nof $1.5 million in lost workers' time, another $40,000 in \ndecontamination costs, and an undisclosed amount of money spent on \nrescue and law enforcement. The employee is being charged in Federal \ncourt, not for the hoax report, but for lying to Federal officials \nafter the fact.\n\n  Indeed, the Justice Department reported to Congress this week that\n\n[[Page S11617]]\n\nthere is a gap in the existing Federal law regarding the prosecution of \nbioterrorism hoaxes. That is, while it is a crime to threaten to use, \nfor example, anthrax as a weapon against another person, it is not a \ncrime to make a hoax anthrax report. Accordingly, the Justice \nDepartment called upon Congress this week to enact legislation which \nspecifically addresses hoaxes which involve purported biological \nsubstances, as well as chemical, nuclear and other weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  We should answer that call and act now to give the law enforcement \nthe tools they need to combat these despicable crimes. I introduced a \nbioterrorism bill, S. 3202, in the 106th Congress which contained an \nanti-hoax provision. Had that bill been enacted into law, Federal \nprosecutors would have the means to prosecute bioterrorism hoaxes. The \nneed for a Federal anti-hoax provision has never been more clear than \nin the last several weeks. The Federal interest is indisputable, as \nStates and localities are simply not equipped with the expertise or \nresources to evaluate and respond to these hoaxes. A comprehensive \nprohibition on such false reports is necessary to preserve scarce and \nvital federal resources.\n  Accordingly, as chairman of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and \nDrugs, I introduce a bill today which contains both criminal provisions \nand civil penalties for the hoax reporting of bioterrorism incidents. \nMy bill simply says that if you knowingly engage in conduct, such as \ndeliberately sending baking powder through the mail to your Congressman \nor calling 911 to falsely report the presence of anthrax in a public \nbuilding, that is likely to create the false impression concerning the \npresence of anthrax, or other similar things, that you have committed a \nFederal offense, punishable by up to 5 years in jail. Moreover, such a \nperson may be fined the greater of either $10,000 or the amount of \nmoney expended by the government to respond to the false information. \nFinally, such a person may also be ordered to reimburse the government \nif costs were incurred in responding to the false hoax. Let me be \nclear, this bill will not target innocent mistakes or people who make a \nreport concerning a suspected substance; it is aimed, rather, at \ndeliberate hoax reports by those who know they are spreading false \ninformation.\n  I have said many times on the floor of this body that the terrorists \nwin if they succeed in sowing seeds of panic into our daily lives. We \ncannot and will not let that happen. Similarly, we will not let these \nhoaxers get away with words and deeds which have the same effect.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 1666. A bill to prevent terrorist hoaxes and false reports; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I rise to introduce the Anti-Terrorist \nHoax and False Report Act of 2001. The bill would provide a new tool \nfor law enforcement to deal with the problem of serious hoaxes and \nmalicious false reports relating to the use of weapons of mass \ndestruction, or biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons. These so-\ncalled ``hoaxes'' inflict both mental and economic damage on victims. \nThey drain away scarce law enforcement resources from the investigation \nof real terrorist activity. They interrupt vital communication \nfacilities. Finally, they feed a public fear that the vast majority of \nlaw abiding Americans are working hard to dispel.\n  Federal, State, and local law enforcement already have statutes which \nthey have been using aggressively to prosecute those who have taken \nadvantage of these times to perpetrate hoaxes about anthrax \ncontamination. Existing statutes create serious penalties for threats \nto use biological, chemical, or nuclear weapons, for sending any \nthreatening communication through the mail, or for making a willful \nfalse statement to federal authorities.\n  For example 18 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 175, 229, 2332a, and 831 all have \ntheir own threat provisions punishable by up to life imprisonment. In \naddition, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 876 makes it a five year felony to mail a \nthreatening communication of any type; and 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1001 makes it \na five year felony to willfully make any false statement, or even \nwillfully omit a material fact in a matter under the jurisdiction of a \nfederal agency.\n  In a recent Subcommittee hearing of the Judiciary Committee, James T. \nCaruso, the Deputy Assistant Director of the FBI's Counter-terrorism \nDivision, stated that there are at least 11 Federal hoax cases which \nhave actually been charged under existing statutes since September 11, \n2001. Just last week a Federal conviction was obtained in Oakland, \nCalifornia under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 175, which carries a statutory maximum \npenalty of life imprisonment, for an anthrax hoax which occurred back \nin January of 1999. Thus, existing Federal statutes are already being \nemployed to prosecute these cases when Federal prosecution is \nappropriate. In addition, numerous State provisions are available and \nare being used to prosecute these cases at the State and local level.\n  Indeed, current Federal threat laws do not require that the defendant \nhave either the intent or present ability to carry out a threat, which \nenables prosecutors to use such laws to prosecute these serious hoaxes. \nAt the same terrorism hearing, Deputy Assistant Director Caruso made it \nclear that authorities are able to prosecute even ``non-credible'' \nthreats under current Federal laws. However, while they carry high \npenalties, including a maximum of life imprisonment, at the same \nhearing James Reynolds, from the Department of Justice's Section on \nTerrorism and Violent Crime, indicated that these statutes can \nsometimes be awkward when applied in the hoax context.\n  What this bill provides, is a well tailored statute that deals \nspecifically with the problem of biological, chemical, mass \ndestruction, and nuclear ``hoaxes'', that is, actions taken with the \nmalicious intent to deceive the victim. For instance, it gives \nprosecutors a means to distinguished between a person who is actually \nthreatening to use anthrax on a victim on one hand, and a person who \nnever intends to use it, but truly wants the victim or the police to \nthink they have done so, on the other. In the later case the statute \ncreates a new five year felony.\n  The bill requires that the defendant act ``knowingly and \nmaliciously,'' so that we do not federalize juvenile pranks or the \nmisguided though innocent spreading of rumors. For instance, a local \nprosecutor in Chicago recently placed an envelope containing sugar on a \ncolleague's desk. He was administratively punished by being forced to \nresign from his job. In Utah, a disabled miner was charged locally \nbecause he put sugar and Nesquik into a junk mail envelope. In Anne \nArundel County, MD, two juveniles were arrested after they placed \npowder in an envelope and did not even mail it, but it was found by \nsomeone else and reported, engendering an unintended emergency \nresponse. In Ohio, a security guard ``super-glued'' a telephone in a \ncounty welfare building, and when the glue left a powdery residue it \ncaused a anthrax scare. In Williamsport, PA a firefighter is being \nprosecuted locally on a felony charge for claiming that he received a \nletter containing white powder at his home. These types of incidents do \nnot merit a lengthy term in Federal prison. As the examples I have \nlisted above demonstrate, we have appropriately serious ways to deal \nwith cases when Federal criminal prosecution is not needed.\n  Indeed, law enforcement agencies or private companies of the conduct \n``readiness testing'' so that they will be able to deal with serious \nchemical or biological weapon threats. For instance, three weeks ago a \nKentucky sheriff conducted such a readiness drill by leaving an \nenvelope filled with crushed aspirin on a desk at a county courthouse \nin order to test the response. Requiring a malicious mens rea will \nensure also that we do not criminalize or chill this type of admirable \nproactive effort. In sum, malicious acts deserve Federal felony \nprosecution; innocent bad judgment and juvenile behavior do not, and \nneither do laudable efforts by police and private actors to preserve \nreadiness for biological or chemical attack.\n  Another provision in the bill would provide for mandatory restitution \nto any victim of these crimes, including the costs of any and all \ngovernment response to the hoax. An earlier Administration proposal, \noffered during the debate over the terrorism bill, would have limited \nsuch restitution to only the federal government. As we know all too \nwell from recent events, however,\n\n[[Page S11618]]\n\nit is state and local authorities, along with private victims, who are \noften the first responders and primary victims when these incidents \noccur. This bill would provide a mechanism so that they too can be \nreimbursed for their expenses.\n  For all of these reasons, I am pleased to introduce this legislation \nand I urge its swift enactment into law.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1666\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to ensure that nuclear energy continues to contribute \nto the supply of electricity in the United States; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I rise to introduce a modified version \nof my Nuclear Energy Electricity Supply Assurance Act of 2001. When I \nfirst introduced this measure, S. 472, it contained a provision known \nas Section 127, relating to special demonstration projects for the \nuranium mining industry.\n  This section was intended to create cooperative, cost-shared, \nagreements between the Department of Energy and the domestic uranium \nindustry to identify, test, and develop improved in-situ leaching \nmining technologies. In addition, I intended that this initiative apply \nto low-cost environmental restoration that may be applied to sites \nafter completion of in-situ leaching operations. Finally, Sec. 127 was \nintended to fund competitively-selected demonstration projects with the \ndomestic uranium mining industry relating to enhanced production with \nimproved environmental protection, restoration of well fields, and \ndecommissioning and decontamination activities.\n  I believe that the intent and spirit of Sec. 127 still have \nsubstantial merit. I hope that we can provide incentives for improved \nmining techniques and improved environmental restoration. However, Sec. \n127 was subject to substantial mis-interpretation, especially among \nmany people in the Navajo Nation in northwest New Mexico. It was \nclaimed that this Section was directed toward helping a single company \nthat might use it to expand in-situ mining near the Navajo Nation's \nborders. It was further claimed that such an approach might over a long \nperiod of time contaminate drinking water in the area.\n  At no time was my bill intended to help any specific company. At no \ntime did we intend anything other than improving environmental \nrestoration and giving some hope to the domestic uranium industry that \nit might find an environmentally sound way to produce more domestic \nproduct.\n  However, after discussing this issue with the president of the Navajo \nNation and other members of the nation, I have decided that the best \ncourse, in order to put to rest all of the concerns expressed, is to \nsimply strike Section 127 from my bill. I should add that some members \nof the Navajo Nation supported Section 127; but, the clear message from \nmy friends on the Navajo Nation is that they would prefer, in order to \navoid any confusion, that I delete Section 127 from my bill.\n  Thus, the modified Act that I introduce today is identical to S. 471, \nwith the exception that I have deleted entirely Section 127, relating \nto special demonstration projects. I talked to the president of the \nNavajo Nation this afternoon and he thanked me for this action.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1667\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the standard of living for citizens of the United \n     States is linked to the availability of reliable, low-cost, \n     energy supplies;\n       (2) personal use patterns, manufacturing processes, and \n     advanced cyber information all fuel increases in the demand \n     for electricity;\n       (3) demand-side management, while important, is not likely \n     to halt the increase in energy demand;\n       (4)(A) nuclear power is the largest producer of essentially \n     emission-free electricity;\n       (B) nuclear energy is one of the few energy sources that \n     controls all pollutants;\n       (C) nuclear plants are demonstrating excellent reliability \n     as the plants produce power at low cost with a superb safety \n     record; and\n       (D) the generation costs of nuclear power are not subject \n     to price fluctuations of fossil fuels because nuclear fuels \n     can be mined domestically or purchased from reliable trading \n     partners;\n       (5) requirements for new highly reliable baseload \n     generation capacity coupled with increasing environmental \n     concerns and limited long-term availability of fossil fuels \n     require that the United States preserve the nuclear energy \n     option into the future;\n       (6) to ensure the reliability of electricity supply and \n     delivery, the United States needs programs to encourage the \n     extended or more efficient operation of currently existing \n     nuclear plants and the construction of new nuclear plants;\n       (7) a qualified workforce is a prerequisite to continued \n     safe operation of--\n       (A) nuclear plants;\n       (B) the nuclear navy;\n       (C) programs dealing with high-level or low-level waste \n     from civilian or defense facilities; and\n       (D) research and medical uses of nuclear technologies;\n       (8) uncertainty surrounding the costs associated with \n     regulatory approval for siting, constructing, and operating \n     nuclear plants confuses the economics for new plant \n     investments;\n       (9) to ensure the long-term reliability of supplies of \n     nuclear fuel, the United States must ensure that the domestic \n     uranium mining, conversion, and enrichment service industries \n     remain viable;\n       (10)(A) technology developed in the United States and \n     worldwide, broadly labeled as the Generation IV Reactor, is \n     demonstrating that new designs of nuclear reactors are \n     feasible;\n       (B) plants using the new designs would have improved \n     safety, minimized proliferation risks, reduced spent fuel, \n     and much lower costs; and\n       (C)(i) the nuclear facility infrastructure needed to \n     conduct nuclear energy research and development in the United \n     States has been allowed to erode over the past decade; and\n       (ii) that infrastructure must be restored to support \n     development of Generation IV nuclear energy systems;\n       (11)(A) to ensure the long-term viability of nuclear power, \n     the public must be confident that final waste forms resulting \n     from spent fuel are controlled so as to have negligible \n     impact on the environment; and\n       (B) continued research on repositories, and on approaches \n     to mitigate the toxicity of materials entering any future \n     repository, would serve that public interest; and\n       (12)(A) the Nuclear Regulatory Commission must continue its \n     stewardship of the safety of our nuclear industry;\n       (B) at the same time, the Commission must streamline \n     processes wherever possible to provide timely responses to a \n     wide range of safety, upgrade, and licensing issues;\n       (C) the Commission should conduct research on new reactor \n     technologies to support future regulatory decisions; and\n       (D) a revision of certain Commission procedures would \n     assist in more timely processing of license applications and \n     other requests for regulatory action.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to strengthen \nthe limitations on the holding of any license permit, operating \nauthority by a foreign government or any entity controlled by a foreign \ngovernment; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, today I reintroduce legislation to \nclarify rules governing the takeover of U.S. Telecommunications \nproviders by companies owned by foreign governments. The original rules \nin this area were established by statute in the 1930s, and while the \nlaw has not changed, the FCC's interpretations of this statute has.\n  Today's legislation is almost identical to the legislation that I \nintroduced last year on this topic. I am pleased to announce that this \nyear I am joined in the effort by the Chairman of the House Energy and \nCommerce Committee, Billy Tauzin.\n  In the intervening year the FCC has approved several transactions \ninvolving foreign governments. I am disappointed by these actions and \nbelieve that they involve a misreading of the current statute.\n  The legislation I introduce today will bar outright the transfer or \nissuance of telecommunications licenses to providers who are more than \n25 percent owned by a foreign government. It would also bar the \ntransfer of such licenses to companies controlled by a foreign \ngovernment.\n  My reasons for introducing this legislation have not changed from \nlast year. Nevertheless the events of the past year confirm more than \never my conviction that foreign governments should not be permitted to \nown U.S. telecommunications licenses.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HOLLINGS (for himself and Mr. McCain) (by request):\n  S. 1669. A bill to authorize appropriations for hazardous material \ntransportation safety, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, as a courtesy to President Bush and \nSecretary of Transportation Mineta, I am today introducing their \nproposed legislation to reauthorize hazardous materials programs.\n  While I appreciate the Administration's willingness to offer a \nreauthorization plan, I disagree strongly with several of its \nprovisions. I plan to work with other members of the Commerce Committee \nto write and introduce legislation to reauthorize the Hazardous \nMaterials Transportation Act later this Congress.\n  Every year, our Nation transports 4 billion tons of hazardous \nmaterials via 800,000 shipments. In 2000, there were 17,347 hazardous \nmaterials incidents related to transportation in the United States: \n1,419 via air transportation, 14,861 via highway transportation, 1,052 \nvia railway transportation, and 15 via water transportation. These \nincidents are mostly minor releases of chemicals; 244 incidents caused \ninjuries, and there were 13 deaths, 12 deaths via highway \ntransportation, and 1 death via railway transportation. Of course, one \ndeath is too many. That is why we must recommit ourselves to the \nprotection of the brave workers who take on the risks of transporting \nthese dangerous materials and the communities in which these products \nare produced and through which they are moved.\n  I am concerned about several provisions of the administration plan, \nincluding one that would effectively eliminate the authority of the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration, OSHA, to protect workers \nthat handle and transport hazardous materials. It is important that \nworkers are protected and appropriate standards for the handling of \nhazardous materials are established, including rules for personal \nprotective equipment and the monitoring of exposure levels and medical \nconditions. Protecting the people that handle and transport these \nhazardous materials must remain paramount.\n  The proposed legislation also increases from 2 to 4 years the time \nbetween reviews for exemptions from hazardous materials regulations. In \nour current security environment, creating more exemptions from \nhazardous materials regulations may not be the most prudent course of \naction. We also must maintain funding for non-profit organizations to \ntrain workers in the handling of hazardous materials.\n  On another matter, the Administration plan also would repeal some of \nthe requirements Congress has placed on the Department of \nTransportation in managing these hazardous materials programs. I would \ncaution the Transportation Department not to seek repeal of the \nrequirements and actions that we in Congress have requested of them. We \nmandated those actions for a reason, and we expect that they will be \ncarried out.\n  As I work with my colleagues to write a hazardous materials \nreauthorization bill, we will take into account the recently exposed \nvulnerabilities of hazardous materials to terrorist attacks. The 1,000 \npages of Federal Hazardous Materials Transportation Regulations were \ndesigned primarily to promote safety during transportation, not to \nensure security and reduce risks from terrorist attacks. Unattended \nparked vehicles and routing are just two examples of the security \nconcerns associated with the transportation of hazardous materials. We \nare considering a range of options to address these security threats. \nWe also must increase funding for training local emergency response \nunits to handle hazardous materials accidents.\n  While we may disagree over how to approach some of these hazardous \nmaterials issues, I thank the administration for offering their \nproposal. I look forward to working with them in the coming months to \nmake the transportation of hazardous materials a safe endeavor for both \nhazardous materials workers and the public.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the administration's bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1669\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Hazardous material; civil penalty.''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I am pleased to join Chairman Hollings \nin introducing the Hazardous Materials Transportation Safety \nreauthorization Act of 2001 at the request of the Administration. This \nmeasure is a good start toward improving and strengthening the safe and \nsecure transport of our nation's hazardous materials. In addition\n\n[[Page S11630]]\n\nto authorizing funding for hazardous materials transportation safety \nprograms, this legislation addresses concerns arising since the attacks \nof September 11. Among other things, this bill would strengthen the \nauthority of Department of Transportation (DOT) inspectors to inspect \npackages being transported, and provide those inspectors with the \nauthority to stop unsafe transportation. This measure would also \nincrease the maximum civil penalty for violations of hazardous \nmaterials regulations from $27,500 to $100,000. It would expand the \nrequirements for training persons involved in the transportation of \nhazardous materials and strengthen the enforcement authority of State \nenforcement officials.\n  The hazardous materials transportation safety program reauthorization \nis long overdue. The most recent authorization expired September 30, \n1998. Since then, attempts at reauthorization have failed due to \nobjections within Congress and an inability to reach an agreement on \ncertain proposals with the former administration. Now, however, it is \nappropriate to attempt to move forward and address identified safety \nproblems and improve safety for all Americans. I am hopeful that the \nSenate will act quickly to take the necessary action to improve \nhazardous materials transportation safety before we are forced to \nrespond to another attack making use of our nation's transportation \nsystem.\n  Annually, more than four billion tons of hazardous materials--about \n800,000 shipments daily--are transported by land, sea, and air in the \nUnited States. Among these materials are flammable liquids, combustible \nsolids, gases, and corrosive materials. Despite the wide variety and \namount of shipments, the hazardous materials transportation industry \nhas a notable safety record, due in large part to the safety efforts of \nthe individuals and companies involved in transporting these materials. \nIn 1999, for instance, there were five hazardous materials related \nfatalities, down from thirteen in 1998 and twelve in 1997. However, in \nlight of the attacks of September 11, it is more important than ever to \nreauthorize this important program. Reauthorization should include new \nauthority for enforcement officials and clarify existing authority for \nthe federal agencies that administer the programs responsible for \nhazardous materials transportation safety.\n  The Federal Government has four roles related to hazardous materials \ntransportation: regulation, enforcement, emergency response, and data \ncollection and analysis. The DOT performs the largest role of \nestablishing and enforcing Hazmat regulations, while the Research and \nSpecial Program Administration (RSPA), and to a lesser extent other \nagencies within the Department, are charged with more specific roles.\n  RSPA is responsible for the regulation and identification of \nhazardous materials including hazardous materials handling and \nshipments, the development of container standards and testing \nprocedures, the inspection and enforcement of multimodal shippers and \ncontainer manufacturers, and for data collection. This legislation \nwould provide authority to RSPA to continue its hazardous materials \nsafety activities. In addition, the measure would grant the United \nStates Postal Service (USPS) similar authority to DOT and its agencies \nto collect civil penalties and recover costs and damages for violations \nof its hazardous materials regulations.\n  With this bill, jurisdiction between the DOT and the Occupational \nSafety and Health Administration (OSHA) would be clarified as it \npertains to hazardous materials transportation. Dual jurisdiction over \nhandling criteria registration, and motor carrier safety would be \neliminated, leaving DOT with sole jurisdiction over these programs. \nHazardous materials transportation employee training and occupational \nsafety and health protection of employees responding to a release of \nhazardous materials would remain under the jurisdiction of both DOT and \nOSHA.\n  I hope this Congress will act expeditiously to approve comprehensive \nhazardous materials transportation safety legislation. We simply cannot \nafford another missed opportunity to address transportation safety \nshortcomings. We must do all we can to ensure the safe transport of \nthese materials, including providing the needed resources to the \nagencies charged with oversight of this industry. The Administration is \ncorrect in asking Congress to address hazardous materials \ntransportation reauthorization. I will be working with Chairman \nHollings and look forward to hearings in the near future to address \nthis important reauthorization proposal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/08/senate-section/article/S11630-1", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 81--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS TO \n   WELCOME THE PRIME MINISTER OF INDIA, ATAL BIHARI VAJPAYEE, ON THE \nOCCASION OF HIS VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES, AND TO AFFIRM THAT INDIA IS \n   A VALUED FRIEND AND PARTNER AND AN IMPORTANT ALLY IN THE CAMPAIGN \n                    AGAINST INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM\n\n  Mr. BIDEN (for himself, Mr. Helms, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \nSarbanes, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Allen, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. \nKerry) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                            S.

If too general, this summary will be disapproved by \n     the Judge. If too specific, this summary will compromise the \n     underlying classified information.\n       (11) The notice provisions of the Alien Terrorist Removal \n     Court should be modified to remove the barrier to the Justice \n     Department's effective use of the Court.\n       (c) Alien Terrorist Removal Hearing.--Section 504(e)(3) of \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1534(e)(3)) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by striking ``(A) Use.--''.\n       (2) by striking ``other than through reference to the \n     summary provided pursuant to this paragraph''; and\n       (3) by striking subparagraphs (B) through (F).\n       (d) Reports to Congress.--Beginning 6 months after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, and every 6 months thereafter, the \n     Attorney General shall submit a report to Congress on the \n     utilization of the Alien Terrorist Removal Court for the \n     purposes of removing alien terrorists from the United States \n     through the use of classified information.\n                                  ____\n\n  SA 2115.

BROWNLEE OF VIRGINIA TO BE UNDER SECRETARY OF THE \n                                  ARMY\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I express my appreciation to our distinguished acting \nmajority leader tonight for his courtesy. Senator Levin has now joined \nme on the floor. I defer to the chairman to lead off.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think it is particularly appropriate, given the very \nspecial relationship Senator Warner has had in particular with Les \nBrownlee, for him to lead off. I will just add a few comments to what \nthe Senator says.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my good friend and chairman, Mr. Levin. We have \nserved 23 years together, and throughout this day we met four or five \ntimes on the conference report and other matters. It is an \nextraordinary opportunity to serve America with such fine people as \nSenator Levin, Senator Reid, and others.\n  Anyway, to the matter at hand.\n  Madam President, I will start off. I wish to address the Senate with \nregard to the nomination by the President of the United States, of \nColonel Les Brownlee, United States Army, Retired.\n  I cannot in words express my gratitude to this wonderful American for \nhis service to the Senate, to the Committee on the Armed Services, and \nto me personally over these 18 years that he has been a Member of the \nSenate family and organization.\n  When I introduced him to the committee today, I reflected that some \n32 years ago I sat in the same seat before the committee. Senator \nThurmond was a member of the Committee, and I believe Senator Byrd may \nwell have been a Member at that time; I would like to check the record \non that. But there I was as a young man taking on the job as Under \nSecretary of the Navy, as my dear friend Colonel Brownlee is now taking \non the job as Under Secretary of the Army.\n  The war at that time was raging in Vietnam. A war tonight is raging \nbeyond our shores, in the area of Afghanistan, where men and women of \nthe Armed Forces are risking their lives. So he joins the Department of \nDefense at a critical time, as did I.\n  While I came up sort of through the political ranks, he came up \nthrough the ranks as a professional soldier and 18 years of service to \nthe Senate. It was on those qualifications that I was privileged to \nrecommend him to the President. The recommendation was accepted and \ntonight he was confirmed by the Senate.\n  It is an important day for Les Brownlee. It is an important day for \nthe Senate and for our committee. I may say that his son, John, and his \ndaughter, Tracy, and other family members are present at this time.\n  Les has a distinguished career in the U.S. Army. He served in \nVietnam. Our periods somewhat overlapped. For 5 years and 4 months I \nwas in the Pentagon. During that period, or prior thereto, Les won the \nSilver Star with Oakleaf Cluster. That means two Silver Stars. He won \nthe Bronze Star with two Oakleaf Clusters. That means three Bronze \nStars. And, he won the Purple Heart.\n  Les and I have a very close personnel relationship. We've traveled \nthe world together on behalf of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \nThere are times when we have strongly disagreed on subjects. At those \ntimes, we go into a room; he takes off his colonel's insignia and I \ntake off the U.S. Senate insignia, and we have at it. Most often we \nreach a mutual decision. Occasionally, Judy Ansley, who moves up from \nDeputy to Staff Director, has arbitrated our disputes. Nevertheless, \nwe've had a marvelous relationship in which he's given me the \nunvarnished truth and advice.\n  Les Brownlee's record and knowledge about the Department of the Army \nis second to none. It is extraordinary. He returns to the service of \nthe Army, an organization for which he expressed his love today in \nthose very words, at a time when the Army is going through a very \nsignificant period of transition--transitioning in a manner to \nrecognize the changed world in which we live. That world was beginning \nto change long before September 11 of this year.\n  Our committee has been working with the previous Secretaries of the \nArmy and Defense, and previous Army Chiefs of Staff. It has been a long \nevolution. But largely, under the current Chief of Staff and the \ncurrent Secretary of the Army, one of the major elements of that \ntransformation will take place, and Les Brownlee will be right there to \nassist and to provide the knowledge.\n  He sent a note of humor about how he is in all probability returning \nto the very same office from whence he departed, to come to the Senate, \n18 years ago having served as the principal military aid to the then-\nUnder Secretary of the Army. What a fascinating coincidence.\n  He will also be entrusted with the issues involving homeland defense. \nThe Department of the Army has a very special mission in this area.\n  Fortunately, the Senate Armed Services Committee established some \nyears\n\n[[Page S11634]]\n\nago a subcommittee to take over certain responsibilities on emerging \nthreats as best we could see them at that time. None of us could \nenvision the events of September 11. Nevertheless our committee, under \nmy chairmanship, following with the chairmanship of our distinguished \nSenator from Michigan, we continued that work.\n  Les takes great credit, together with other staff members, in laying \nout the platforms and the goals of that subcommittee which we achieved \nin large measure.\n  I also think, very clearly with a sense of humility, that he \nexemplifies the extraordinary quality of individuals who come to the \nSenate to work as staff members. He just gives those people \ninspiration. As that room was filled today in the hearing, you could \nsee in their hearts and their minds--there were probably 30 to 40 of \nthem assembled there--that someday any one of them could be sitting \nwhere he is.\n  We are privileged in our committee to have had a number of our staff \nmembers move on into Presidential appointments in both administrations, \nRepublican and Democrat.\n  So it is a great day. Chairman Levin presided over it with his usual \ndignity and feeling.\n  At this moment, I yield the floor so that perhaps he can add his own \nobservations.\n  We are joined in the Chamber by a very fine staff person, Judy \nAnsley, who, as I noted earlier, will succeed Les as Chief of Staff. \nMrs. Ansley has been his Deputy for a number of years. I am pleased to \nrecognize her presence here today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Thank you, Madam President. I thank Senator Warner.\n  When my career here is over and I look back on it, one of the real \nhighlights will always be that I came with Senator Warner and that we \nhave served together on the Armed Services Committee--both as chairman, \nalways as friends, always with total trust, not always with total \nagreement, but always having our singular goal of a bipartisan security \npolicy for this Nation.\n  Senator Warner has been an extraordinary member of that committee. I \nwatched him through the years as he has pulled together people with \ndiverse views to reach a common goal.\n  It was a pleasure to join with him as he recommended to the President \nthe nomination of Les Brownlee to be Under Secretary of the Army.\n  It is always a special day for the committee when one of our staff is \nnominated to a high position in the executive branch. This is a special \nday for us.\n  We hate to lose Les. He has been of tremendous and inestimable value \nin the committee and to both sides of the aisle when we bring our bills \nto the floor.\n  This is a committee that I think sets the standard for how we should \noperate in a bipartisan manner in this Senate. It has always had that \ntradition. Senator Warner maintained that tradition beautifully. I seek \nto emulate that kind of a role model that he and many Senators before \nhim set when they were chairmen of that very special committee.\n  Les will be leaving us. He will be crossing the Potomac. He will be \nback in his beloved Army. I can't think of anyone better qualified to \nserve in that position than Les because of the experience, which \nSenator Warner has outlined, and what Les brings to the job his \ncommitment, spirit, and love for the Army. We always rely on our staff \nto give us their total loyalty and their total commitment. Les is \nsurely a shining example of that. But first and foremost, that loyalty \nis to this country. Les has always shown that loyalty.\n  The staff director for the majority, David Lyles, is also on the \nfloor, as are other members of the Armed Services Committee staff. Not \nonly have we looked to Les for unvarnished and straight advice, we have \nalways looked to him and David Lyles when they were staff directors, \nfirst, for the majority, and then for the minority, to work together to \nbring the committee a joint bill that we could all support and that \nwould help bring us together.\n  Our staffs have not only given us advice and guidance, they have \ntruly been instrumental in making this committee a bipartisan example \nof what security policy should be and what this Senate strives to be, \nwhether it is in the area of defense or any other area.\n  I noted what Senator Warner said about Les returning perhaps \nphysically to the same office that he left. I understand he was the \nmilitary executive to the Under Secretary of the Army. The very \nposition that he was the executive to will now be filled by him. So \nthere is a certain symmetry, and a certain wonderful roundness, to \nLes's confirmation.\n  As Senator Warner said, we are now engaged in a military campaign. \nColonel Brownlee was engaged in Vietnam. He served two tours in Vietnam \nwith extraordinary distinction and heroism. He brings to this current \nchallenge an experience that is invaluable so that we do not repeat the \nmistakes that were made in Vietnam, and so that we avoid any of the \npitfalls that faced us as a nation in that war in which so many men and \nwomen served so valiantly, with so much honor, and with not nearly \nenough reward or recognition by their own countrymen back here at home.\n\n  What Les brings to this current challenge is of tremendous value. I \nknow, as Senator Warner said, that we speak for every member of our \ncommittee and for our staffs when we say how proud we are of Les. We \nare proud of not only what he has done for the committee, but we also \nare very confident of what he will do for the Army and for the Nation \nin his new capacity.\n  We wish him all the best. We know we will see a lot of him. To him \nand his family, we can only say we are sad to see him go, but we are \nsurely glad that he will occupy the position that he will assume. This \nnation is safer because it will be in his hands.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank my very valued and long time \nspecial friend, the Senator from Michigan, for his very kind remarks. I \nreciprocate with equal feelings toward him.\n  We struggle together, and we are going to succeed. We have a big \nmission ahead of us in this committee with this conflict. We are behind \nour President. We want to give him that type of support, and the men \nand women of the Armed Forces fighting this engagement.\n  In relation to what the Senator stated, it was Under Secretary James \nAmbrose with whom Les served.\n  I appreciate Senator Levin singling out his combat record. The men \nand women of the Armed Forces, across the board, are trained to go into \ncombat situations. Relatively few of them, however, certainly in recent \nyears, because of the nature of combat, are put into those positions.\n  I was combat trained in World War II, but I did not go into combat. I \ndid visit the battlefields more than once in Korea, but my military \ncareer pales in the face of Les Brownlee's and those of the men and \nwomen who have really gotten into the thick of it, have been tested, \nand proved not only to survive, but continue their leadership. They \nhave earned the recognition of their peer group through their personal \ndecorations.\n  I have a tremendous amount of respect for Colonel Brownlee and, \nindeed, for many other Members of the Senate with whom I have been \nprivileged to serve in the past and today who have earned those \ndecorations.\n  While we acknowledge the long list of Colonel Brownlee's accolades, \nwe recognize that the challenges of life are most successfully \naccomplished as a team effort. Colonel Brownlee's family have shared \nthe challenges and rewards of both his professional military career and \nhis career in the Senate. The journey which brought Colonel Brownlee to \nthis prestigious nomination would not have been possible without the \nunconditional and loving support of his family.\n  From the first day that Les and I began working together, he has \nalways been guided by what he thought was in the best interest of our \nNation's security, the best interest of the men and women of our Armed \nForces, and in the best interest of the Senate. On behalf of a grateful \nnation, we congratulate Les on his nomination and thank him for his \nservice to the United States Senate. Les brings a special dimension to \nthe Army secretariat, and we wish him well.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Madam President, I think that concludes the matters, and we can go to \nthe standing order.\n\n[[Page S11635]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/11/08/senate-section/article/S11633-5", "month": "11", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11633-S11635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n NOMINATION OF R.L. BROWNLEE OF VIRGINIA TO BE UNDER SECRETARY OF THE \n                                  ARMY\n\n  Mr. WARNER. I express my appreciation to our distinguished acting \nmajority leader tonight for his courtesy. Senator Levin has now joined \nme on the floor. I defer to the chairman to lead off.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I think it is particularly appropriate, given the very \nspecial relationship Senator Warner has had in particular with Les \nBrownlee, for him to lead off. I will just add a few comments to what \nthe Senator says.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my good friend and chairman, Mr. Levin. We have \nserved 23 years together, and throughout this day we met four or five \ntimes on the conference report and other matters. It is an \nextraordinary opportunity to serve America with such fine people as \nSenator Levin, Senator Reid, and others.\n  Anyway, to the matter at hand.\n  Madam President, I will start off. I wish to address the Senate with \nregard to the nomination by the President of the United States, of \nColonel Les Brownlee, United States Army, Retired.\n  I cannot in words express my gratitude to this wonderful American for \nhis service to the Senate, to the Committee on the Armed Services, and \nto me personally over these 18 years that he has been a Member of the \nSenate family and organization.\n  When I introduced him to the committee today, I reflected that some \n32 years ago I sat in the same seat before the committee. Senator \nThurmond was a member of the Committee, and I believe Senator Byrd may \nwell have been a Member at that time; I would like to check the record \non that. But there I was as a young man taking on the job as Under \nSecretary of the Navy, as my dear friend Colonel Brownlee is now taking \non the job as Under Secretary of the Army.\n  The war at that time was raging in Vietnam. A war tonight is raging \nbeyond our shores, in the area of Afghanistan, where men and women of \nthe Armed Forces are risking their lives. So he joins the Department of \nDefense at a critical time, as did I.\n  While I came up sort of through the political ranks, he came up \nthrough the ranks as a professional soldier and 18 years of service to \nthe Senate. It was on those qualifications that I was privileged to \nrecommend him to the President. The recommendation was accepted and \ntonight he was confirmed by the Senate.\n  It is an important day for Les Brownlee. It is an important day for \nthe Senate and for our committee. I may say that his son, John, and his \ndaughter, Tracy, and other family members are present at this time.\n  Les has a distinguished career in the U.S. Army. He served in \nVietnam. Our periods somewhat overlapped. For 5 years and 4 months I \nwas in the Pentagon. During that period, or prior thereto, Les won the \nSilver Star with Oakleaf Cluster. That means two Silver Stars. He won \nthe Bronze Star with two Oakleaf Clusters. That means three Bronze \nStars. And, he won the Purple Heart.\n  Les and I have a very close personnel relationship. We've traveled \nthe world together on behalf of the Senate Armed Services Committee. \nThere are times when we have strongly disagreed on subjects. At those \ntimes, we go into a room; he takes off his colonel's insignia and I \ntake off the U.S. Senate insignia, and we have at it. Most often we \nreach a mutual decision. Occasionally, Judy Ansley, who moves up from \nDeputy to Staff Director, has arbitrated our disputes. Nevertheless, \nwe've had a marvelous relationship in which he's given me the \nunvarnished truth and advice.\n  Les Brownlee's record and knowledge about the Department of the Army \nis second to none. It is extraordinary. He returns to the service of \nthe Army, an organization for which he expressed his love today in \nthose very words, at a time when the Army is going through a very \nsignificant period of transition--transitioning in a manner to \nrecognize the changed world in which we live. That world was beginning \nto change long before September 11 of this year.\n  Our committee has been working with the previous Secretaries of the \nArmy and Defense, and previous Army Chiefs of Staff. It has been a long \nevolution. But largely, under the current Chief of Staff and the \ncurrent Secretary of the Army, one of the major elements of that \ntransformation will take place, and Les Brownlee will be right there to \nassist and to provide the knowledge.\n  He sent a note of humor about how he is in all probability returning \nto the very same office from whence he departed, to come to the Senate, \n18 years ago having served as the principal military aid to the then-\nUnder Secretary of the Army. What a fascinating coincidence.\n  He will also be entrusted with the issues involving homeland defense. \nThe Department of the Army has a very special mission in this area.\n  Fortunately, the Senate Armed Services Committee established some \nyears\n\n[[Page S11634]]\n\nago a subcommittee to take over certain responsibilities on emerging \nthreats as best we could see them at that time. None of us could \nenvision the events of September 11. Nevertheless our committee, under \nmy chairmanship, following with the chairmanship of our distinguished \nSenator from Michigan, we continued that work.\n  Les takes great credit, together with other staff members, in laying \nout the platforms and the goals of that subcommittee which we achieved \nin large measure.\n  I also think, very clearly with a sense of humility, that he \nexemplifies the extraordinary quality of individuals who come to the \nSenate to work as staff members. He just gives those people \ninspiration. As that room was filled today in the hearing, you could \nsee in their hearts and their minds--there were probably 30 to 40 of \nthem assembled there--that someday any one of them could be sitting \nwhere he is.\n  We are privileged in our committee to have had a number of our staff \nmembers move on into Presidential appointments in both administrations, \nRepublican and Democrat.\n  So it is a great day. Chairman Levin presided over it with his usual \ndignity and feeling.\n  At this moment, I yield the floor so that perhaps he can add his own \nobservations.\n  We are joined in the Chamber by a very fine staff person, Judy \nAnsley, who, as I noted earlier, will succeed Les as Chief of Staff. \nMrs. Ansley has been his Deputy for a number of years. I am pleased to \nrecognize her presence here today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Thank you, Madam President. I thank Senator Warner.\n  When my career here is over and I look back on it, one of the real \nhighlights will always be that I came with Senator Warner and that we \nhave served together on the Armed Services Committee--both as chairman, \nalways as friends, always with total trust, not always with total \nagreement, but always having our singular goal of a bipartisan security \npolicy for this Nation.\n  Senator Warner has been an extraordinary member of that committee. I \nwatched him through the years as he has pulled together people with \ndiverse views to reach a common goal.\n  It was a pleasure to join with him as he recommended to the President \nthe nomination of Les Brownlee to be Under Secretary of the Army.\n  It is always a special day for the committee when one of our staff is \nnominated to a high position in the executive branch. This is a special \nday for us.\n  We hate to lose Les. He has been of tremendous and inestimable value \nin the committee and to both sides of the aisle when we bring our bills \nto the floor.\n  This is a committee that I think sets the standard for how we should \noperate in a bipartisan manner in this Senate. It has always had that \ntradition. Senator Warner maintained that tradition beautifully. I seek \nto emulate that kind of a role model that he and many Senators before \nhim set when they were chairmen of that very special committee.\n  Les will be leaving us. He will be crossing the Potomac. He will be \nback in his beloved Army. I can't think of anyone better qualified to \nserve in that position than Les because of the experience, which \nSenator Warner has outlined, and what Les brings to the job his \ncommitment, spirit, and love for the Army. We always rely on our staff \nto give us their total loyalty and their total commitment. Les is \nsurely a shining example of that. But first and foremost, that loyalty \nis to this country. Les has always shown that loyalty.\n  The staff director for the majority, David Lyles, is also on the \nfloor, as are other members of the Armed Services Committee staff. Not \nonly have we looked to Les for unvarnished and straight advice, we have \nalways looked to him and David Lyles when they were staff directors, \nfirst, for the majority, and then for the minority, to work together to \nbring the committee a joint bill that we could all support and that \nwould help bring us together.\n  Our staffs have not only given us advice and guidance, they have \ntruly been instrumental in making this committee a bipartisan example \nof what security policy should be and what this Senate strives to be, \nwhether it is in the area of defense or any other area.\n  I noted what Senator Warner said about Les returning perhaps \nphysically to the same office that he left. I understand he was the \nmilitary executive to the Under Secretary of the Army. The very \nposition that he was the executive to will now be filled by him. So \nthere is a certain symmetry, and a certain wonderful roundness, to \nLes's confirmation.\n  As Senator Warner said, we are now engaged in a military campaign. \nColonel Brownlee was engaged in Vietnam. He served two tours in Vietnam \nwith extraordinary distinction and heroism. He brings to this current \nchallenge an experience that is invaluable so that we do not repeat the \nmistakes that were made in Vietnam, and so that we avoid any of the \npitfalls that faced us as a nation in that war in which so many men and \nwomen served so valiantly, with so much honor, and with not nearly \nenough reward or recognition by their own countrymen back here at home.\n\n  What Les brings to this current challenge is of tremendous value. I \nknow, as Senator Warner said, that we speak for every member of our \ncommittee and for our staffs when we say how proud we are of Les. We \nare proud of not only what he has done for the committee, but we also \nare very confident of what he will do for the Army and for the Nation \nin his new capacity.\n  We wish him all the best. We know we will see a lot of him. To him \nand his family, we can only say we are sad to see him go, but we are \nsurely glad that he will occupy the position that he will assume. This \nnation is safer because it will be in his hands.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank my very valued and long time \nspecial friend, the Senator from Michigan, for his very kind remarks. I \nreciprocate with equal feelings toward him.\n  We struggle together, and we are going to succeed. We have a big \nmission ahead of us in this committee with this conflict. We are behind \nour President. We want to give him that type of support, and the men \nand women of the Armed Forces fighting this engagement.\n  In relation to what the Senator stated, it was Under Secretary James \nAmbrose with whom Les served.\n  I appreciate Senator Levin singling out his combat record. The men \nand women of the Armed Forces, across the board, are trained to go into \ncombat situations. Relatively few of them, however, certainly in recent \nyears, because of the nature of combat, are put into those positions.\n  I was combat trained in World War II, but I did not go into combat.
