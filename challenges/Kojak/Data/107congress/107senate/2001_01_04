It is a hand of comfort as You tell us again that You \nwill never leave nor forsake us. It is a hand of conscription calling \nus to be ``Aye ready!'' servants who receive from You the orders of the \nday. It is a hand of courage that gives us daring to take action \nbecause You have taken hold of us. It is a hand of correction alerting \nus to what may be less than Your best for us or our Nation. It is a \nhand of confidence to press forward. Your faithfulness fails not; it \nmeets the problems of today with fresh guidance for each step of the \nway. So we will be all the bolder; Your hand is upon our shoulders. We \nwill not waver; You are our Lord and Saviour.

Mr. President, parroting Patrick Henry: Peace, peace, \neverywhere man cried peace, but there is no peace. Surplus, surplus, \neverywhere men cry surplus, but there is no surplus. That is the point \nof my comments this afternoon. I have to embellish it or flesh it out \nso you will understand the reality, that ``it is not the economy, \nstupid,'' rather it is the real economy.\n  During Christmas week, I picked up USA Today. A headline read \n``Surplus soars despite the slump.'' That is dangerous. People think we \nhave a surplus and everybody is running around: Whoopee, cut all the \nrevenues; wait a minute, if you don't cut it, those Democrats are going \nto spend it. Let's have tax cuts, tax cuts.\n  This morning, I picked up Roll Call. It had a very interesting \narticle by Stuart Rothenberg, one of the best of the best. Not quoting \nthe entire article, he had a little squib about our new colleague and \nmy friend, Senator Tom Carper of Delaware. I quote part of the article \nas of this morning:\n\n       Delaware Senator Tom Carper's record in the House is not \n     easy to pigeonhole. During a six-year period, from 1983 \n     through 1988, his U.S. Chamber of Commerce ratings ranged \n     from 38 to 64, his liberal Americans for Democratic Action \n     ratings ranged from 55 to 80 and his AFL-CIO ratings ranged \n     from 59 to 86.\n       The Delaware Democrat tended to be more moderate on \n     economic issues, but that generally reflected his aggressive \n     efforts to cut the budget deficit. Since that's no longer a \n     problem, he will face a different set of legislative \n     priorities on the economy, possibly altering his image.\n\n  I will repeat that: ``Since that's no longer a problem . . .'' The \ndeficit has been solved, according to this morning's Roll Call. Not at \nall. We had that\n\n[[Page S20]]\n\nbalanced budget agreement in 1997, so you would think that the budget \nwould have been balanced in 1998. To the contrary.\n  In 1998, according to the Congressional Budget Office, we had a \ndeficit of $109 billion, not a surplus. In 1999, we had a deficit of \n$127 billion, not a surplus.\n  For the year 2000, just 3 months ago, fiscal year ending September \n30, 2000, I quote from page 20, table 6 of the final monthly Treasury \nstatement by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. It shows that the \nagency securities issued under special financing authorities at the \nbeginning of fiscal year 2000 was 5 trillion 606 some-odd billion \ndollars, whereas on September 30, it was 5 trillion 629 some-odd \nbillion dollars. That is a deficit, not a surplus, of $23 billion.\n  If there is any doubt, the distinguished Presiding Officer and I were \nhere when we worked out the last surplus under President Lyndon Baines \nJohnson. That was in 1968-1969. That was before we changed the old \nfiscal year to October 1. It used to begin July 1. In December, early \nthat first week, if I remember correctly, George Mahon, who was then \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, and all of us called over to \nMarvin Watson and said: Ask the chief if we can cut another $5 billion, \nand we did. We got permission.\n  Does my colleague know what the budget was for fiscal year 1968-1969 \nfor Social Security, Medicare--go right on down the list--guns and \nbutter, the war in Vietnam? The civil economy was $178 billion. The \ninterest now is $365 billion, $1 billion a day; just the interest \ncarrying charges, not for Government, just for past profligacy.\n  I have a list of the Presidents from Truman through Clinton and their \ncorresponding budget information; these are Congressional Budget Office \nfigures. I ask unanimous consent this table be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n

Government FY 1998; Beginning in 1962 CBO's 2001 Economic and Budget Outlook.\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, this shows how when President Clinton \ncame to office in January of 1993, in fiscal year 1992, the last year \nof President George Herbert Walker Bush's term, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, there was a deficit of $403,600,000. We \nwere spending $400 billion more than we were taking in that year.\n  Since Clinton has taken office, we have reduced that deficit from \n$403 billion to $23 billion. We were headed in the right direction.\n  I hope Mr. Rothenberg, Roll Call, USA Today, and the free press will \nfinally get the truth to the American people. That is all we want. We \nhave to\n\n[[Page S21]]\n\nbe talking and singing from the same hymnal. Everybody is running \naround saying: Yes, I am for a tax cut, but not quite as big; I am for \nthis; I am for that. We don't have any taxes to cut. To put it another \nway, the best tax cut is to reduce the deficit.\n  If one reads the Internet site of the U.S. Treasury--\npublicdebt.treas.gov--the public debt to the penny, as of 11 o'clock--\nwhich is when they changed it--is 5 trillion 728 some-odd billion \ndollars. At the close of fiscal year 2000 on September 30, it was \n$5.674 trillion, and it has gone up to $5.728-some-odd trillion.\n\n  So you can see, not only did we end fiscal year 2000 with a deficit--\nnot a surplus--of $23 billion--but in 3 months of this fiscal year, \nPresident Bush is going to be submitting his budget, talking about tax \ncuts, loss of revenues; and the deficit is already $54 billion. And \nthat is without factoring in the $30 billion we appropriated before we \nwent home for Christmas.\n  So don't give me all of this talk about fiscal responsibility and \neverything else. The only responsible thing we had, of course, was \nPresident Clinton's and the Democrats' 1993 economic program that cut \nspending, that increased taxes, and cut the size of Government.\n  Yes, I stand on the floor and publicly acknowledge I voted for an \nincrease in taxes on Social Security. We were told by my distinguished \ncolleague from Texas, Senator Gramm, that they would be hunting us down \nin the street, us Democrats, and shooting us like dogs if we increased \nthe Social Security tax.\n  We increased the tax on gasoline. We cut, as I say, the size of \nGovernment. But they want to keep talking, particularly the media. We \npoliticians do a little liberality, and, well, they call it spin. They \neven have a program called ``Spin'' now on national TV. But we are \nentitled to a little spin. We run for public office, and we have to \nexplain a lot of things we do--but not the media; they are supposed to \ngive us the exact truth.\n  There is a recent book called ``Maestro'' by Bob Woodward about Alan \nGreenspan. I refer to page 95. I am not going to read the whole thing, \nobviously, but I quote at the bottom of page 95, about our Chairman of \nthe Federal Reserve Board, Mr. Alan Greenspan. I am quoting from the \nWoodward book:\n\n       The long-term rates--the 10-year and longer rates--were an \n     unusual 3 to 4 percent higher than the short-term Fed funds \n     rate, at about 7 percent. The gap between the short-term rate \n     and the long-term rate, Greenspan lectured, was an inflation \n     premium being paid for one simple reason. The lenders of \n     long-term money expected the federal deficit to continue to \n     grow and explode. They had good reason, given the double-\n     digit inflation of the late 1970s and the expanding budget \n     deficits under Reagan. They demanded the premium because of \n     the expectation of new inflation. The dollars they had \n     invested would, in the near and distant future, be worth less \n     and less.\n       Perhaps no single overall economic event could do more to \n     help the economy, businesses and society as a whole than a \n     drop in the long-term interest rates, Greenspan said. The Fed \n     didn't control them. But credible action to reduce the \n     federal deficit would force long-term interest rates to drop, \n     as the markets slowly moved away from the expectation of \n     inevitable inflation. Business borrowing costs, mortgages and \n     consumer credit costs would go down. Clinton was so sincere \n     and attentive, and full of questions and ideas, that \n     Greenspan continued. Establishing credibility about deficit \n     reduction with the markets would lower rates and could \n     trigger a series of payoffs for the economy, he said.\n       Greenspan outlined a blueprint for economic recovery. Lower \n     long-term rates would galvanize demand for new mortgages, \n     refinancing at more favorable rates and more consumer loans. \n     This would in turn result in increased consumer spending, \n     which would expand the economy.\n       As inflation expectations and long-term rates dropped, \n     investors would get less return on bonds, driving investors \n     to the stock market. The stock market would climb, an \n     additional payoff.\n\n  That is the end of the quote. You can read on.\n  I am for a tax cut, too, but how do you get it? Not estate taxes. \nGiving millionaires' heirs millions of dollars, tax free, is not going \nto recover the economy and have a good effect.\n  Interestingly, the one thing that really is being spent on Social \nSecurity--the payroll tax--nobody wants to cut. That is the crowd that \nis really getting ripped off. Otherwise, you do not hear anything about \nthe Social Security taxes, that they were going to hunt us down in the \nstreet like dogs and shoot us for increasing. They do not say, cut \nSocial Security taxes. But they come with things like the estate tax, \nmarriage penalty, and everything else of that kind. They talk of a $1.3 \ntrillion tax cut that would return us back to where we were in 1993.\n\n  Yes, the Federal Reserve, Greenspan, they reduced the Fed rate a half \na percent yesterday. That was fine business. That is the short-term \nrates, but that does not affect the overall economy.\n  The long-term, we cannot tinker with that except to set generally \nfiscally sound policy, put the Government on a pay-as-you-go basis.\n  I have been up here 34 years, and we did it in 1968, 1969. We had a \nbalanced budget. I got the first AAA credit rating for the State of \nSouth Carolina from Standard & Poor's and Moody's back in 1959, 1960--\n40 years ago. But it is a tremendous frustration to this particular \nSenator to hear everyone crying surplus.\n  What is the monkeyshine? The monkeyshine is, you can look right at \nthe front page of the same Treasury report. And you ought to read that. \nAs of the final monthly Treasury statement--highlighted--I quote: This \nissue includes the final budget results and details, a surplus of $237 \nbillion for fiscal year 2000.\n  And then, as old John Mitchell would say, don't watch what we say, \nwatch what we do. You turn to page 20, table 6, and there is no surplus \nat all. On the contrary, there is a deficit of $23 billion.\n  How do they do that saving face? I will tell you how they do it. They \ndo it, No. 1, by taking from the trust funds, Social Security.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis document entitled ``Trust Funds Looted to Balance Budget.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  TRUST FUNDS LOOTED TO BALANCE BUDGET\n                      [By fiscal year, in billions]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                   1999    2000    2001\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSocial Security.................................     855   1,009   1,175\nMedicare:\n  HI............................................     154     176     198\n  SMI...........................................      27      34      35\nMilitary Retirement.............................     141     149     157\nCivilian Retirement.............................     492     522     553\nUnemployment....................................      77      85      94\nHighway.........................................      28      31      34\nAirport.........................................      12      13      14\nRailroad Retirement.............................      24      25      26\nOther...........................................      59      62      64\n                                                 -----------------------\n      Total.....................................   1,869   2,106   2,350\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, at the end of fiscal year 2000--last \nSeptember--we owed Social Security some $1.009 trillion. We owed \nmilitary retirement $149 billion, and civilian retirement $522 billion. \nYou can go right on down.\n  Now, as projected by the Congressional Budget Office, we are going to \nborrow $244 billion more this fiscal year 2001 from these trust funds. \nWhen the day of reckoning comes, who is going to raise the taxes? Who \nis going to issue the bond and raise the taxes at that particular time \nto pay for the benefits?\n  All we need to do to make Social Security fiscally sound is quit \nspending it. I have a lockbox, a true lockbox written by Ken Apfel of \nthe Social Security Administration. I couldn't get a vote on it all \nlast year or the year before. I will put it up again this year.\n  If you want to have truth in budgeting, please see my staffer, Mr. \nBarry Strumpf, and join with me in a bipartisan fashion to get at least \ntruth in budgeting. We are going to offer an amendment calling for a \nbudget freeze because we still play this game here of surplus, surplus. \nWe put in an amendment to the budget resolution year before last in \nthat last session of Congress, and we got 24 votes for the Greenspan \nstay the course. Alan Greenspan, at that time, said: Stay the course \nand just take this year's budget for next year. If you did that, you \ncould save some $50 billion.\n  As a Governor, I had to do that. Many a mayor this year will do just \nthat. He will go before his council and say: We don't want to fire the \nfiremen. We don't want to fire the policemen. We are getting along \nwell. Let's just take this year for next year. If we did that at the \nFederal level, we would save $50 billion.\n  The other way in which they play this game of public debt and \nGovernment debt is not only to borrow from\n\n[[Page S22]]\n\nall these trust funds--like borrowing from yourself, like taking your \nMasterCard and paying off your Visa card--but they are also projecting \nno new spending. The CBO will adjust their economic assumptions to \naccommodate the $1.3 trillion tax cut. You can see what is going on.\n  I don't think the economy can stand it. I think the best tax cut and \nthe way to get on top of long-term interest rates is to do exactly what \nwas done back in 1993.\n  I will make one more reference. Two weeks ago, in an issue of \nNewsweek they had an article on page 58: ``Boy Did We Know Ye,'' \ncomments by members of the Clinton administration, by Stephanopoulos, \nLeon Panetta, and several others. I will read just this one little \nparagraph by Bob Rubin.\n\n       The moment that most sticks in my mind was the meeting we \n     had with Clinton on Jan. 7, 1993 in Little Rock.\n\n  I read that because this is just about January 7 in the year 2001.\n  Reading further:\n\n       We met with him for six and a half hours on what the budget \n     strategy ought to be. From the beginning what we [the \n     economic team] recommended was that there ought to be a \n     dramatic change in policy, with the view that deficit \n     reduction should create lower interest rates and spur higher \n     confidence. Before the meeting, George Stephanopoulos told me \n     that was going to be hard, [that Clinton] would have to make \n     that decision over time, but after about a half hour at the \n     meeting, Clinton turned to us in the dining room of the \n     governor's mansion in Little Rock. He said, ``Look, I \n     understand what deficit reduction means [in terms of public \n     criticism for program cuts], but that's the threshold issue \n     if we're going to get the economy back on track. Let's do \n     it.''\n\n  And we did it, and that is why we have had the good economy. We are \nabout to go the other direction on this tax cut, returning to the \nincreased deficits of the Reagan years. We had less than a trillion-\ndollar debt when President Reagan took office in 1981. For 200 years--\nincluding all the wars, the Revolution, Spanish American, World War I, \nII, Korea, Vietnam--we accumulated less than a trillion-dollar debt. We \nnow have a debt without the cost of a war--the Saudis took care of \nDesert Storm--of 5 trillion 700-some-odd billion. We can't stand that \nany longer.\n  I thank the distinguished Chair for indulging me, but the truth has \nto come out. I hope Members on both sides of the aisle will work with \nus to reduce the deficit and reduce the debt. Let us get to work on it \nand quit playing games with the American public.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Reid). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Before the Senator from South Carolina leaves the floor, I \nwill reflect with him a minute on some of the struggles we have had the \nlast several years.\n  Remember, there was an effort by the Republican majority to pass a \nconstitutional amendment to balance the budget. The Senator from South \nCarolina remembers that battle, where he and this Senator and a number \nof others started out as a very small group opposing it. We said, if \nyou want a constitutional amendment to balance the budget, you should \nhave one that excludes the surpluses of Social Security. Remember the \nbattle there. We were able to stop them from getting enough votes to \npass that.\n  What would that have done to this country if that foolish \nconstitutional amendment had passed?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. It would constitutionalize the profligacy and the waste \nand the reckless fiscal conduct that we engage in here, and you \nwouldn't have any control over it because everybody would say: There is \nthe Constitution. And you would read the first page of the Treasury \nreport, how we have a surplus of $237 billion, when the truth of the \nmatter is, if you look in the report, we have a $23 billion deficit. \nWhen you constitutionalize, you dignify the blooming thing. That was \nthe ultimate. I couldn't go along with that game.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend's courage and \nleadership on these fiscal issues. He has the ability, because of his \nexperience, to see what is going to happen in the future, to be a \nlittle ahead of most everyone around here on these financial issues. I \nappreciate the Senator recognizing the tough vote we took in 1993 on \nthe Clinton budget deficit reduction act. Members of the House of \nRepresentatives lost their elections; they lost their political careers \nfor having voted for that. But they should know that they did the right \nthing.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. They did the right thing. There is no question.\n  Mr. REID. We have a new Member of the Senate today--she was sworn in \nyesterday--Maria Cantwell from the State of Washington. She was a \nfreshman Member of the House of Representatives, and she, with courage, \nwalked up and voted for that Clinton deficit reduction plan. She lost \nher election because of that. The people of the State of Washington now \nknow that she did the right thing and now she is a Senator from the \nState of Washington. Again, I commend and applaud the Senator from \nSouth Carolina for his statement today but mostly for his leadership on \nthese fiscal issues during the entire time I have been in the Senate.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I thank the distinguished leader. The truth will out, \nis what the distinguished Senator from Nevada is saying. I am glad we \nhave Senator Cantwell here. It was another Representative from \nPennsylvania, I remember we had to finally get her vote and she lost. \nShe was a distinguished Member.\n  Mr. REID. Her name was Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. That is it. She had the courage to do it. But here we \nare in January, seeing this binge that we are on and the only argument \nis how are we going to spend a so-called surplus. How many tax cuts are \nwe going to get to buy the people's vote. That is the best thing, \nrunning on TV, saying: I voted for tax cuts, I am for tax cuts. That is \nthe only thing that holds that crowd in office.\n  Mr. REID. The biggest tax cut this country could get is reducing the \n$5 trillion debt we have. Will the Senator agree?\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Very much so. That is the tax cut I favor. That is the \nway to give to middle America so they get a lower mortgage rate and \nlower financing rate on the refrigerator, the stove, et cetera. That is \nwhat Greenspan told them, and I hope Greenspan will get back and say \nthe same thing here, some 7, 8 years later, that what we really need to \ndo is hold the line.\n\n  I had the privilege of sitting there with Don Evans, the new \nSecretary of Commerce-designate, the best friend of President-elect \nBush. One sentence I got, over all the things he said with respect to \ntrade, competition, trade and technology, there is one sentence: tell \nthe President rather than, by gosh, all these tax cuts, just come in \nand hold the line, stay the course as Greenspan recommended last year \nand take this year's budget for next year.\n  Don't start us pell-mell down the road to loss of revenue and \nincreasing the deficit, increasing the debt, when we are telling the \npeople that this is going to lower the debt and lower the deficit. It \nis pure folly.\n  Mr. REID. The people who met yesterday with the President-elect in \nTexas, these rich people--and I have nothing against rich people; I am \nhappy he is meeting with them--I hope some of them realize the biggest \ntax cut anyone will ever get in their entire professional career is if \nwe reduce the deficit.\n  We talk about across-the-board tax cuts; that will give an across-\nthe-board tax cut because everything they do, from buying a new piece \nof land to paying their mortgages, will be cheaper.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. I looked at that list and it looks to me like a bunch \nof corporate heads who are interested in sales. They are not interested \nin the economy and the market; they are corporate heads interested in \nsales. It is like asking children if they want broccoli or spinach, or \ndo you want a dessert. They are in Austin saying whoopee, give me \ndessert.\n  I know the advice that crowd will give. Tell them to start talking to \nthe Bob Rubins. This action yesterday by the Federal Reserve and \nGreenspan will influence the short-term but not the long-term rates.\n  I thank the distinguished leader, and I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/04/senate-section/article/S22-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S22-S23]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENTS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have served with the distinguished \nPresiding Officer for a number of years. We served together a number of \ntimes in the Congress during his service in the other body, in fact, on \nconference committees on rural issues, agricultural issues, and other \nissues. The distinguished Presiding Officer would agree with me that \nyesterday was something unique as we watched the opening of the \nsession.\n  I was glancing through the Congressional Record. We are blessed with \nthe finest reporters of any parliamentary body in the world; it is very \naccurate, but the one thing it cannot show is some of the facial \nexpressions and some of the other features of the session.\n  It was such a unique situation. The First Lady was elected Senator. \nHer husband, the President of the United States, and daughter were in \nthe visitors gallery. I should note for the Record, while they sat in \nthe visitors gallery, they were given front row seats, probably \ncoincidental, probably alphabetically, but somehow it was arranged.\n  The usual thing that happens is a motion is made to notify the \nPresident of the United States that we have gone back into session and \nwe have assembled with a quorum present. The majority leader, Senator \nDaschle, moved to notify the President of the United States, and I \nheard a voice in the back of the Chamber say: Well, he's sitting right \nup there; you don't have to do that.\n  These are the interesting things, seeing so many new Members come in, \nthe largest number of women in the Senate. When I first came to the \nSenate, there were none. It shows, though, even with 13 women Senators, \nwe have a long way to go. We should have a lot more, and I expect we \nwill. It shows a change in the Senate.\n  The thing I want to reflect on is the 50-50 Senate. Certainly not in \nthe last two centuries have we seen this. This can be a glass half full \nor a glass half empty. I like to think of it as a glass half full.\n  We have fallen on very contentious times in the Senate. We had \npartisanship in the Senate and the other body of the most contentious \nnature that I have seen in my 26 years here. Following the impeachment \nprocess and the lame-duck House just over 2 years ago, we have never \nseemed to recover fully. I think all of us were hurt in some ways, but \ncertainly the American people were hurt.\n\n  I have said many times, I believe the Senate can be and should be the \nconscience of the Nation. When you think of what we have here--a nation \nof 280 million Americans--there are only 100 of us who get the \nopportunity to serve at any given time. With all of our talents, with \nall of our frailties, only 100 of us can represent those 280 million \nAmericans at any given time. We have a responsibility to all of them, \nnot just to our own State--of course, we have a major responsibility to \nour State--but to all of the country.\n  I think in this 50-50 Senate we have a unique ability to carry out \nthat responsibility. I hope we will see Senators working to form \nbipartisan cooperation, finding those things that unite us rather than \ndivide us--as some have said in campaigns--that we know we should do.\n  The closest friendships I have had in my life have been formed in \nthis body, with Members on both sides of the aisle. It frustrates me to \nthink we have to either support or reject an idea simply because of its \nparty's origin.\n  That does not mean Republicans should automatically adopt whatever \nDemocrats want or Democrats ought to automatically adopt what \nRepublicans want. But we can do something in this body to set an \nexample for the new President, somebody who comes in carrying some \nnearly unique electoral factors. He received half a million votes fewer \nthan the man he defeated. He won by one electoral vote, after the U.S. \nSupreme Court stopped the recount in the State of Florida. But he will \nbe our President on January 20, and we will all accept that.\n  We will feel, at least initially, some of the pain from some of the \ncampaigns and some of the elections on both sides. But ultimately we \nhave to look out at what is, in many ways, the most wonderful country \nhistory has ever talked about--our own--and think of what we can do to \nmake it better.\n  I am not suggesting a litany of areas in which to go. But we will see \nwhat happens during the hearings on Presidential nominees during the \nnext couple weeks and those that will continue thereafter. It is a \nchance for us, at least in the Senate, to try to work together. Will we \nalways agree? No. Can we agree a lot more than we have in the past? \nYes.\n  We have two extremely hard-working leaders in Senator Daschle and \nSenator Lott. Both have different philosophies. Both have entirely \ndifferent types of caucuses to lead. But they are two leaders who \nrespect the fact that the Senate can do better, should do better, and I \nbelieve will do better.\n  So I think it will be a very interesting year. I wrote in my journal \nyesterday, I could not think of anywhere on Earth I would have rather \nbeen than in this body yesterday at noon. And I think of how fortunate \neverybody was who was in attendance to see history being made.\n  With that, Mr. President, I have gone over my time--although I have \nnot seen any wild stampede of Senators coming on the floor seeking \nrecognition--and I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/04/senate-section/article/S23-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S23-S25]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, this Saturday, January 6, there will be \nan extraordinary event--which occurs every 4 years--created by our \nConstitution. There will be the count of the vote of the electoral \ncollege, the official determination of the identity of the next \nPresident of the United States.\n  Probably this year more than most, we are sensitive to this matter, \nand we understand what led up to it--a historic election where the \nDemocratic candidate for the President, Al Gore, outpolled the \nRepublican candidate for President, George W. Bush, by over 400,000 \nvotes nationwide and lost the election.\n  It is not the first time in American history this has occurred. If I \nam not mistaken, it is the fourth time we have elected a President who \nfailed to win the popular vote.\n  But the rules of the game and the rules of this election were \ndictated by those who wrote the Constitution many years ago when they \nmade it clear that the process would not be by a popular vote but, \nrather, by the vote of electors in an electoral college.\n  What is the electoral college?\n  I think we can recall from our earliest civics classes that it is a \ncreation of the Constitution which assigns to every State an elector \nfor each Member of Congress and for the two Senators.\n  In my home State of Illinois, with 20 Members of the House and 2 \nSenators, we have 22 electoral votes. The State of Wyoming, with one \nCongressman and two Senators, has three electoral votes.\n  So the voters who cast their votes at the polls in Arkansas, \nIllinois, and Wyoming on November 7 were not voting for Al Gore, George \nBush, Ralph Nader, or anyone else. They were voting for electors--men \nand women who then came and ultimately cast their votes in State \ncapitols a week or so ago. Those votes will be counted in the House \nChamber this coming Saturday.\n  I, for one, believe this is a system which should be abolished.\n  The electoral college has been in place for over 200 years. You might\n\n[[Page S24]]\n\nwonder how men who wrote the Constitution, in their infinite wisdom, \ncame up with this idea that the American people would not elect the \nPresident of the United States but the state legislatures would appoint \nelectors in each State, who would then elect the President of the \nUnited States.\n  Today, by state laws, the people elect the electors on a winner-take-\nall basis in each state. There are two exceptions. Two States, Maine \nand Nebraska, allocate their electors by congressional districts. But, \nby and large, every other State has a winner-take-all situation.\n  The reason this was created by our Constitution is interesting. We \ngenerally think of elections in a democracy where people cast their \nvotes and a majority will win. That applies to almost every election, \nwhether it is for school board, or for mayor, or for county official, \nor for Governor, or for Senator, or for Congressman. But in the \noriginal Constitution, the men who wrote that document in the name of \ndemocracy showed a distinct fear of democracy, because they did not \ngive the power to the people or the power to the voters in America to \nchoose Federal offices in most cases.\n  In fact, in two out of three cases where the American people were \ngiven the right under this Constitution to choose a Federal officer, \nthey were to do it indirectly, not directly--indirectly in the case of \nthe President with the electoral college, and in the original \nConstitution indirectly when it came to this Chamber.\n  The Senators were not elected by the people of the United States \nunder this Constitution. No. They were chosen by State legislatures. It \nwasn't until the 17th amendment to the Constitution in 1913, after a \ngreat deal of corruption and scandal, that we decided to change that \nand create a direct vote where the people of the United States each \nchoose their two Senators to represent their States. It was a \nbreakthrough, really, democratizing the electoral process.\n\n  When they, of course, empowered the people in each congressional \ndistrict to choose a Member of the House of Representatives, that was a \ndirect vote--the only direct vote in the Constitution given by our \nFounding Fathers in this democracy.\n  Out of the three opportunities--for President, for Senators, and for \nthe House of Representatives--our Founding Fathers said in two out of \nthree in this document: We don't trust the people to make this choice \ndirectly.\n  Why not? Why wouldn't they trust the voters in a democracy?\n  Their reasoning in creating the electoral college was very clear. \nThey said first: How in the world can a voter in the State of Virginia \never come to know a candidate for President from a State as far away as \nMassachusetts? He--because they were all men--may never hear of this \ncandidate and may never meet this candidate. So we had better create a \nsystem where it isn't a direct vote by a voter for a President but, \nrather, an indirect vote.\n  Secondly, of course, there was a concern not only that there wouldn't \nbe this knowledge of the candidate, but a concern that they had to get \nthe Constitution ratified, and the smaller States in this new national \nconsolidation were concerned about their power. So the people who wrote \nthe Constitution said in the electoral college, the States will decide. \nWe will give more power to smaller States. That is why we have an \nelectoral college today.\n  Some people like the electoral college. A lot of people from smaller \nStates like the old electoral college. Let me illustrate for a moment \nwhy. If there are 281 million people in America, which is a rough \nestimate of our population, and we have 538 electoral votes, which is \nthe subtotal of the membership of the House of Representatives and the \nSenate plus 3 for the District of Columbia, then we roughly have about \n522,000 Americans for every electoral vote cast for President. That is \nkind of the standard by which to judge.\n  On a clear equality of this system, each electoral vote should be \nrepresented by 522,000 Americans. Take a State such as Wyoming. Wyoming \nhas a population of about 480,000 people. Wyoming has three electoral \nvotes. So if one lives in Wyoming, you are a bonus voter for President. \nEvery 160,000 population in Wyoming gives one electoral vote for \nPresident. I live in the State of Illinois with 12 million people and \n22 electoral votes, about 550,000 people per electoral vote for \nPresident.\n  We can see the distinction, the difference. Why should some get a \nbonus in voting for President because they live in the State of Wyoming \nas opposed to living in any other State? That was created by the \nConstitution.\n  I am not raising this issue in this question because of this specific \nelection. Some might think, standing on the Democratic side of the \naisle, that is what it is about. I first raised the issue in 1993, and \nI raised it again a week before the election in November of this last \nyear. I understood, and I hope others do, what is at issue here goes \nway beyond any single election and the election of any single person. I \nhappen to believe that in a democracy, one that I respect and thank God \nI had a chance to be born into, that the people should speak through \ntheir votes, and a majority vote should rule, as it does in virtually \nevery democratic institution.\n  That is not the case when it comes to the electoral college. In fact, \nwe have an indirect system, a winner take all system, where States are \nvoting in disproportionate strength based on their population. Smaller \nStates like it because they have more power. They believe it attracts \nmore attention to them during the course of a national campaign. From \nthat perspective, it is hard to argue. From the perspective of a nation \nthat is trying to say to every American, we want to be able to say you \nelected the President, how can you do that under an electoral college \nsystem which gives bonus votes, triple the voting power, in some \nStates, over other States? That is exactly what happened in this \nelection and every single election since our Constitution was enacted \nso many years ago.\n  So on a bipartisan basis Congressman Ray LaHood, a Republican from \nPeoria, IL, and I have introduced a proposed constitutional amendment \nto abolish the electoral college and to say that to be elected \nPresident of the United States you will be elected by popular vote of \nthe people nationwide, and you must win at least 40 percent of the \nvote. If any candidate fails to win 40 percent of the vote, then the \ntop two candidates have a runoff election a short time after the \noriginal election.\n  It is different, but I think it reflects more what a democracy should \nrepresent, the voice of the people and the vote of the people, instead \nof an electoral college which has become a constitutional dinosaur.\n  I hope families across America will take some time on Saturday to \nturn on C-SPAN and have their children sit down and watch the vote of \nthe electoral college. It will be like watching a dinosaur roam through \nthe jungle because that is what we have as a system to elect the \nPresident of the United States.\n\n  Now, having stated my views on this issue and why I feel this way, \nlet me give a candid political analysis. I don't have a chance in \npassing this constitutional amendment. I have to bring this amendment \nto the floor of the Senate where the small States have the same number \nof votes. The smaller States will stop us in our tracks. If there was \nsome miracle of miracles and we passed it through the Senate and the \nHouse, where do we send it? To the States, where we need three-fourths \nof the States to approve it, and the smaller States will stop us there.\n  That is why there have been more proposed amendments to this section \nof the Constitution than any other, and none of them have passed. It is \nan interesting academic discussion. I hope it doesn't end there, \nbecause if it ends there it is academic and does not help us understand \na frustration that voters feel as to what happened on November 7 of \nthis year.\n  Let me suggest that what Maine and Nebraska have done, other States \ncan do: Allocate electoral votes by congressional district that gets \ncloser to the people's will. In those States, if a candidate for \nPresident wins the votes in a congressional district, he received that \nvote, and the one who won a majority of the votes in the State wins the \ntwo votes that are allocated for the Senators. At least there would be \nsome allocation of votes within a State that would be closer to the \nwill of the people.\n  Let me also add that I think we would be derelict in our duty if we \noverlooked the reality of the failure of\n\n[[Page S25]]\n\nour election process on November 7, the failure of a process which \ngenerated some $3 billion in spending by candidates and barely brought \nout a scant majority of voters in the United States who participated. \nThink of all the attention paid to that Presidential campaign and \nelection after November 7 with the recounts, the court cases, the \nSupreme Court, on and on and on. Half the people in this country really \ndidn't have much of a reason to watch it because they hadn't voted in \nthe first place. They were observing something that was as foreign as \nwatching an Australian rules football game, trying to understand what \nthis is all about.\n  We ought to be reflecting on the fact that so few people participate \nin our elections. I think it is important to think anew in this new \nmillennium, in this new century, as to how we will make America not \nonly more democratic in name but more democratic in practice; what we \ncan do to make our elections more effective, to bring more people to \nthe polls. I think we ought to approach it with an open mind.\n  Why do we vote on Tuesday? I don't know. Somebody thought Tuesday was \na good day at one point in time. But is it a good day now for most \nAmericans, or is there a better day? Could we find a way to vote on a \nweekend without, perhaps, raising some religious objections from some \ngroups? I hope so. Can we find ways to vote that are more convenient \nfor voters? In States such as Oregon and Washington, more and more \npeople vote by mail. In fact, in Oregon virtually all the ballots were \ncast by mail. My brother-in-law lives in the State of Washington. He is \na permanent absentee voter. He always receives his ballot by mail and \nreturns it. You can do that in Illinois, but it is pretty difficult. We \nshould be trying to establish a national means by which people can vote \nwithout these obstacles.\n  And let's talk about the voting machinery. In my home State of \nIllinois, and in 40 percent of the polling places across America, they \nhave these infamous Votomatic punch systems. I have been through enough \nelection contests as a staffer, as an attorney, and as an elected \nofficial, that by the time I finish punching my ballot out, I stop for \na minute, turn it to the light, I knock off the chads. I know what to \nlook for. I know what can disqualify my vote. How many Americans know \nhow to do that? Probably more today than last year. Still, an awful lot \nhave gone to the polls and made a personal sacrifice to do their civic \nduty to cast their vote and have their vote be heard, when it comes to \nthe election of the President, only to learn afterwards that tens, if \nnot hundreds of thousands, of ballots have been voided, possibly their \nown. That is not fair. It is not American. It is not something we ought \nto tolerate. I think it is more than a coincidence that the biggest \nbreakdown in disqualification of these ballots turns out to be in \ninner-city precincts. I don't think that is any accident. In many \ninstances, that is where we have the oldest voting equipment, we have \nless attention paid to the education of voters, and, as a consequence, \nfolks who are making a genuine effort to do their best and do their \ncivic duty are denied that opportunity.\n\n  By and large, this decision on how to run a campaign and how to \nmanage an election is a State and local responsibility, as it should \nbe. But my colleague from the State of New York, Senator Schumer, who \nsits next to me, has proposed that we bring forward a fund for \nelectoral reform across America and create incentives and opportunities \nfor States and localities to upgrade their voting equipment.\n  Let me tell you about a piece of voting machinery that is used in \nSouth America. It is a piece of machinery where you have indicated the \nname of the candidate and the office and a symbol for the candidate's \nparty. When you vote and push on the screen for your choice, up pops \nthe picture of the candidate to verify that you picked the person for \nwhom you want to vote. Doesn't that sound modernistic and futuristic? \nYou may be surprised to know the equipment is produced in the United \nStates. It is sold in South America, but it has not become popular here \nin this country. But think of the unlimited possibilities for us to \ncreate a system that is honest and fair and helpful to voters, instead \nof one creating obstacles and problems that can be strewn in their \npaths so they would leave the polling place uncertain and maybe \nfrustrated.\n  During this great debate over the election of November 7, 2000, with \nthis electoral vote next Saturday and the swearing in of President \nGeorge W. Bush on January 20, in just a few weeks, if we do not stop to \nthink about the long-term impact of the integrity of voting in America, \nI think we are derelict in our duty as elected officials. I hope, if we \nare not going to amend our great Constitution to eliminate the \nelectoral college, we will at least dedicate ourselves, on a bipartisan \nbasis, to modernizing the machinery of elections across America so the \nnext election in 2 years or beyond will be a fair election, a more \nhonest election, and one that creates more opportunities.\n  I do not believe there is a partisan spin to this. I believe \nRepublican candidates, Democratic candidates, and independent \ncandidates alike can all be disadvantaged by the uncertainties of the \ncurrent election system. We need to encourage more people to be \ninvolved, and we need to say to them: We are doing everything within \nour power to use the technology and resources of America to make \nelections in this country an even better experience for all Americans.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson).

In \n1980 and 1981, our friend and colleague from the House, J.C. Watts, was \nquarterback and did a great job. I remember those Orange Bowls in 1980 \nand 1981. J.C. Watts was not only an outstanding quarterback but also \nis an outstanding Congressman. I was with him last night to watch the \nSooners win their seventh, well-deserved national championship.\n  The Sooners went to the Orange Bowl with a perfect 12-0 record. They \ndefeated several outstanding teams including the once number one ranked \nNebraska, the University of Texas, and Kansas State. Although we did \nnot play them before last night, Bobby Bowden, head coach for Florida \nState has an outstanding football team and an outstanding program.\n  I congratulate the Sooners.\n  I congratulate Coach Bob Stoops, who only in his second year at the \nUniversity of Oklahoma was named the ``AP Coach of the Year''--a well-\ndeserved honor, and it is certainly a well-deserved honor for the \nentire Oklahoma Sooner football team.\n  In addition, I wish to congratulate my friend and our former \ncolleague in the Senate, David Boren, who is the President of the \nUniversity of Oklahoma. All people in Oklahoma can say he is doing a \nfantastic job not only scholastically but athletically as well.\n  My congratulations to the team and to their leader.\n  From the entire State, we are all very proud of the University of \nOklahoma for once again becoming the national champions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this past weekend, our nation lost \none of its finest public servants with the passing of former California \nSenator Alan Cranston.\n  Senator Cranston served California well, and our hearts and thoughts \ngo to his son Kim and the rest of his family at this difficult time.\n  Senator Cranston holds the distinction of being the only Democrat in \nour State's history to win four terms to the United States Senate, \nserving 24 years.\n  Born in Palo Alto, California in 1914, Alan Cranston was a tireless \nchampion for peace, justice, and human rights. He was also a steadfast \nadvocate for the poor and oppressed.\n  Senator Cranston was educated at Stanford University where he \nexcelled as both a student and athlete. After graduating, Senator \nCranston worked as a correspondent for the International News Service \nand then served his nation well in the U.S. Army in World War II.\n  In 1939, Alan Cranston edited the first unexpurgated English \ntranslation of Adolf Hitler's ``Mein Kampf'' published in the U.S. in \nan effort to alert Americans to the dangers of the Third Reich.\n  In fact, Senator Cranston had the very unique experience of being \nsued by Hitler for copyright violation for his work on this editing \nproject--and in true Alan Cranston form--he wore this as a badge of \nhonor and demonstrated that he would stand up to anyone in pursuit of \nDemocratic principles and ideals.\n  His first service in elected office was when he won his race for \nCalifornia State Controller in 1962. He then ran successfully for the \nSenate in 1968 and was elected seven times as party whip.\n  He was called by many as one of the best ``nose counters'' in the \nSenate. My esteemed colleague and former Senate Majority Leader Robert \nByrd said of Senator Cranston, ``He is absolutely superb when it comes \nto knowing how the votes will fall in place on a given issue.''\n  Senator Cranston also was a strong leader in an effort to protect our \nenvironment. I am proud to say that he was the original author of the \nDesert Protection Act and he called me shortly after I won election to \nthe Senate in 1992 to ask me if I would take over the effort to get the \nbill approved. In 1994, we amended the bill a number of times but were \nable to get it passed and make the legislation a reality.\n  This landmark measure created two new national parks--Death Valley \nand Joshua Tree--and one national preserve--the Mojave. In total, the \nmeasure has permanently saved and protected over 7 million acres of \npristine California desert wilderness for all time.\n  As Thomas Jefferson said in 1809 that ``the care of human life and \nhappiness, and not their destruction, is the first and only legitimate \nobject of good government,'' it appears to me that Senator Cranston \ndemonstrated this view with strong and forceful advocacy of arms \ncontrol.\n  In the Senate, Alan Cranston played a leading role in moving the SALT \nand START arms control treaties through this body, and he drafted the \nfirst bill to eliminate funding for the Vietnam War.\n  In 1983, Alan Cranston said that ending the arms race would be the \nparamount goal of his run for the Presidency. That effort was not \nsuccessful, but his effort to promote an honest dialogue on this issue \ngrew and he continued to work toward a more peaceful planet right up \nuntil the time of his death.\n  In 1996, he became chairman of the Gorbachev Foundation USA based in \nSan Francisco, founded by former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and \ndevoted to nuclear disarmament.\n  More recently, he served as President of the Global Security \nInstitute, a think tank devoted to same end. The Institute recently \npersuaded more than 100 international civilian leaders, including 44 \nformer presidents and prime ministers, to sign on to its nuclear weapon \nelimination initiative.\n  Signators included former President Jimmy Carter, former Defense \nSecretary Robert McNamara, Nobel Laureates Kenneth Arrow and Elie \nWeisel, Coretta Scott King, astronaut Sally Ride and retired Supreme \nAllied Commander General Andrew Goodpaster.\n  Former Representative Lionel Van Deerlin describes Senator Cranston's \ndevotion to nuclear disarmament well when he said, ``He's got to be \nremembered for pioneering, when the Cold War was still on, limiting the \nworst weapons ever conceived.''\n  In summing up the career of Senator Alan Cranston, I believe a recent \neditorial in the Los Angeles Times aptly sums up his life and his \nservice to our Nation:\n\n       [Senator Cranston] toiled in the trenches during a long \n     political career in behalf of California and world peace. The \n     value of his efforts and dedication was not fully appreciated \n     at the time and was overshadowed by his departure from the \n     Senate. It's that body of work that should be remembered and \n     celebrated now.\n\n  Mr. President, our Nation is no doubt a better place because of \nSenator Alan Cranston's service, and we will miss him deeply.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/04/senate-section/article/S26-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S26]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CONCEALED WEAPONS LAW\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am very disappointed that the Governor \nof Michigan chose to sign a bill that will increase the number of \nconcealed weapons on our streets by tens of thousands.\n  On New Year's Day, Governor Engler signed into law House Bill 4530, \nwhich takes discretion away from local gun boards and requires that \nauthorities must issue concealed weapons licenses to those who meet \ncertain requirements.\n  On December 13, 2000, I wrote a letter to the Governor asking him to \nveto the legislation. I asked the Governor to support our law \nenforcement personnel who believe the concealed weapons bill will make \nthem and the public less safe. These groups include the Michigan \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police and the Michigan Police Legislative \nCoalition, which includes the Michigan State Police Troopers \nAssociation, the Michigan State Police Command Officers Association, \nthe Michigan Association of Police, the Police Officers Labor Council, \nDetroit Police Lieutenants and Sergeants Association, Detroit Police \nOfficers Association, Warren Police Officers Association and Flint \nPolice Officers Association.\n  I support the position of law enforcement groups in this matter and I \nbelieve the people of Michigan do also. Local gun boards should retain \ncontrol of these often life and death decisions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/04/senate-section/article/S26-3", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S26-S27]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         KENNEDY CENTER HONORS\n\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Madam President, each year since 1978 our capital city \nhas inaugurated its season of celebration with the Kennedy Center \nHonors, a joyful celebration of the lifetime achievements of our \ngreatest performing artists. The whole nation shares in that \ncelebration during the CBS broadcast of the Honors Gala, which this \npast year was on December 27.\n  All Americans should be grateful to CBS for its commitment to what \nhas become an American institution, our highest honor for the \nperforming artists who do so much to define our national spirit and our \nidentity around the world.\n  Our deepest gratitude goes to those talented individuals who \nconceived the Honors and have produced it for more than two decades. \nGeorge Stevens, Jr., Washington's own showman who came here in the \nKennedy Administration to\n\n[[Page S27]]\n\nwork with Edward R. Murrow and who has since given us a remarkable \nseries of Emmy Award-winning films, created the Honors with the great \nHollywood showman Nick Vanoff, one of the shaping influences of popular \ntelevision. They produced the show for years--and since Nick's death, \nGeorge has produced the show each year with Don Mischer, who has given \nthe world other extraordinary broadcasts from the Emmy Awards to the \nOpening Ceremonies of the Olympic Games. Their artistic genius \nconstantly renews the Honors, fills it with fresh delights and gives us \nan evening that is both entertaining and equal to the Pantheon of \nartists it celebrates.\n  This year's show honored Mikhail Baryshnikov, Chuck Berry, Placido \nDomingo, Clint Eastwood, and Angela Lansbury--again illuminating the \nspan and sparkle of America's talent. I think how proud President \nKennedy would have been of this ceremony which, like the Kennedy Center \nitself, fulfills his hope for ``an America that will not be afraid of \ngrace and beauty and which will reward achievement in the arts as we \nreward achievement in business or statecraft.''\n  So for all they do to make that dream come true, I want to take this \nopportunity to acknowledge the Chairman of the Kennedy Center, James A. \nJohnson, and the impresarios of the Honors, George Stevens, Jr. and Don \nMischer. For so many years, they have graced the stage of the Kennedy \nCenter with this great celebration; they have graced the life of our \nnation by marking out the heights of its history in the performing \narts. May the show go on and on.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/04/senate-section/article/S27-1", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S27]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JACK BASSO\n\n Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to an \noutstanding public servant, Peter ``Jack'' Basso, Assistant Secretary \nfor Budget and Programs at the U.S. Department of Transportation. Jack \nis retiring after more than 35 years in government service and moving \non to a second career with the American Association of State Highway \nand Transportation Officials.\n  Throughout his 36-year career with the federal government, Jack Basso \nhas distinguished himself for his leadership, commitment and dedication \nto public service and to making government work better. Beginning as a \nfinancial program analyst at the Federal Highway Administration, he \nquickly advanced through the ranks to positions in senior management at \nan FHWA regional office and at the agency's headquarters. He served as \nDeputy Chair for Management at the National Endowment for the Arts, \nAssistant Director for General Management at OMB, and Deputy Assistant \nSecretary for Budget and Programs before being nominated by President \nClinton to his present position as Assistant Secretary for Budget and \nPrograms and Chief Financial Officer at the U.S. DOT.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee which has \njurisdiction over the nation's transit programs, I came to know Jack, \nas many other Members of Congress did, during the crafting of the \nIntermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) and \nits successor, the Transportation Efficiency Act for the 21st Century \nor TEA 21. Jack put in countless hours running the tables, advising the \nCommittees and individual Members, and helping to work out the \ncompromises that ultimately resulted in the enactment of these landmark \npieces of legislation and record budgets for financing the Nation's \ntransportation infrastructure. I have enormous respect for the \nprofessionalism, ingenuity, and integrity which he brought to the \npositions in which he has served and greatly value the assistance he \nhas provided to me and my staff over the years. The replacement of the \nWoodrow Wilson Bridge and many other transportation projects in \nMaryland and throughout the Nation would not be taking place, but for \nhis persistent efforts.\n  Jack Basso's contributions and accomplishments in these positions \nhave been recognized through many prestigious awards including the \nPublic Employee's Roundtable Chairman's Award for Distinguished Public \nService, the Presidential Rank Award, the Government Technology E-\nCommerce Leadership Award, and the General Services Administration's \nTravel Manager of the Year Award for two years running. His abiding \nsense of responsibility and commitment have earned him the respect and \nadmiration of everyone with whom he has worked.\n  It is my firm conviction that public service is one of the most \nhonorable callings, one that demands the very best, most dedicated \nefforts of those who have the opportunity to serve their fellow \ncitizens and country. Throughout his career Jack Basso has exemplified \na steadfast commitment to meeting this demand. I want to extend my \npersonal congratulations and thanks for his many years of hard work and \ndedication and wish him well in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/04/senate-section/article/S27-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S27]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n\n                       executive message referred\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/04/senate-section/article/S27-3", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S27]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:04 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolution, without amendment.\n\n       S.

Madam President, I would be happy to yield to the \nassistant Democratic leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the leader, I have had a number of inquiries today \nas to whether or not votes may be required tomorrow. I heard you say we \nmay have at least one very important vote tomorrow that is possible. Is \nthat true?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct.\n  The possibility exists that a request for a rollcall vote could occur \non the organizing resolution. And were that to take place, of course, \nwe would set a time certain for that matter to be voted upon, which \nwould include, of course, some time for debate.\n  Mr. REID. I ask one further question. If, in fact, that vote is \nrequired, it would be on organizing the Senate, which is a very \nimportant vote. Is that also a fair statement?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. That is correct.\n  As all of our colleagues know--the distinguished Senator knows \nprobably better than anybody on our side--this has been a matter that \nSenator Lott and I have been working on now for over 2 months. We have \nbeen in constant consultation with our colleagues on both sides, and \nwith our more senior Members even more frequently.\n  So this is a very important matter, and I hope people would treat it \nas such. It is critical we continue our work here so that we can \norganize the Senate, that we can appoint Members to appropriate \ncommittees, and that we can take the business of the committees as \nseriously as that business requires, given hearings and other issues \nthat need to be resolved at an early date. So it is very important for \nus to conduct our business throughout the rest of the month.\n  I appreciate very much the assistant majority leader's comments and \nquestions in that regard.\n  I now yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/01/04/senate-section/article/S28-2", "month": "01", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S28]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10:30 A.M.
