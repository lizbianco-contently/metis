Mr. President, may I inquire of the Senator how long he \nintends to speak?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. About 3 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, Floridians who travel \nInterstate 4 between Tampa and Orlando need relief. The congestion they \nencounter on the I-4 corridor is paralyzing, and it is not just a \nproblem for our residents in Florida. It is also a nuisance for the \nmillions of tourists who visit central Florida each year. With each new \ntourist attraction comes another traffic snarl. We must find ways to \nrelieve the gridlock, but double-decker highways are not the answer.\n  Last year, Florida's voters approved an initiative in a statewide \nreferendum that requires the State to build a high-speed train linking \nfive of our largest urban areas, and the spending measure that is now \nbefore the Senate, particularly today--and we hope to complete\n\n[[Page S8080]]\n\nit today--will begin to start helping Florida meet that goal.\n  I am very grateful to our colleagues for including in this \nTransportation appropriations bill $4.5 million for bullet train \nplanning in the corridor from Orlando to Tampa. Senator Graham and I \nfought for this funding because we knew that our traffic problems could \nnot be solved by adding more lanes to our highways. And we have an \nexcellent opportunity in this high-traffic corridor between Tampa and \nOrlando, where you can't build your way out of the problem with new \nlanes, of creating a model for a new kind of transportation corridor \nwith specialized lanes and a high-speed rail running down its center.\n  The State of Florida has also committed $4.5 million in planning \nmoney to a high-speed rail authority, and with this kind of partnership \nbetween the State government and the Federal Government, we can make \nthis high-speed train a reality in that corridor that needs it so \ndesperately. The benefits could be enormous. A high-speed train between \nTampa and Orlando could travel more than 120 miles an hour, providing \ncommuters with a safer and faster alternative to their daily battles \nwith the traffic gridlock and the traffic jams.\n  I commend the Senator from Washington, the chairman of the \nappropriations subcommittee, and her ranking member, the Senator from \nAlabama. I am so pleased the committee has provided this important \nfunding, and I am going to continue to work with my colleague from \nFlorida to see that this money is included in the final version of this \nbill.\n  Mr. President, I thank you very much for this opportunity to state \nsomething that is so important to Florida.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1030\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, now that we have again called up the \nTransportation bill, I want to take some time to address the issue of \nMexican trucks. This issue was discussed yesterday evening by a number \nof Senators, and I thought it would be valuable to take some time to \ndiscuss the provisions in the committee bill and explain to my \ncolleagues why it is so critical that the Senate include these strong \nsafety requirements in the bill we send to conference.\n  The ratification of NAFTA 7 years ago anticipated a period when \ntrucks from the United States, Canada, and Mexico would have free rein \nto service clients from across the three countries. This was not really \na change in policy as it pertained to Canada, since the United States \nand Canada had reciprocal trucking agreements in place long before \nNAFTA was ratified. However, it did require a change when it came to \ntruck traffic between the United States and Mexico.\n  For several years, the opening up of the border between these two \ncountries was effectively put on hold by the administration due to \ntheir concerns over the absence of reasonable safety standards for \ntrucks operating in Mexico. While Mexican trucks have been allowed to \noperate between Mexico and a defined commercial zone along the border, \nthe safety record of those trucks has been abysmal. The Department of \nTransportation inspector general, the General Accounting Office, and \nothers have published a number of reports documenting the safety \nhazards presented by the current crop of Mexican trucks crossing the \nborder.\n  At a hearing of the Commerce Committee last week, the inspector \ngeneral testified about instances where trucks have crossed the border \nliterally with no brakes. Officials with the IG's office have visited \nevery border crossing between the United States and Mexico, and they \nhave documented case after case of Mexican trucks entering the United \nStates that were grossly overweight, that had no registration or \ninsurance, and that had drivers with no licenses.\n  This chart to my left displays the likelihood that trucks will be \nordered off the road by U.S. truck inspectors, and I think the numbers \nspeak for themselves. According to the Department of Transportation's \nmost recent figures, Mexican trucks are 50 percent more likely to be \nordered off the road for severe safety deficiencies than United States \ntrucks, and Mexican trucks are more than 2\\1/2\\ times more likely to be \nordered off the road than Canadian trucks.\n  Equally troubling is the fact that Mexican trucks have been routinely \nviolating the current restrictions that limit their area of travel to \nthe 20-mile commercial zones. The DOT inspector general found that 52 \nMexican trucking firms have operated improperly in over 26 States \noutside the four southern border States. An additional 200 trucking \nfirms violated the restriction to stay within the commercial zone in \nthe border States.\n  Mexican trucks have been found to be operating illegally as far away \nfrom the Mexican border as New York State in the Northeast and my own \nState of Washington in the Northwest. The inspector general reported on \none shocking case where a Mexican truck was found on its way to Florida \nto deliver furniture. When the vehicle was pulled over, the driver had \nno logbook and no license. As I said, there have been experiences such \nas this in half the States in the continental United States. Given this \ndeplorable safety record, the official position of the U.S. Government \nsince the ratification of NAFTA was that the border could not be open \nto cross-border trucking because of the safety risks involved.\n\n  Two things have caused a change in this policy: First, a new \nadministration has come into power, one that believes the border should \nbe opened. Second, the Mexican Government successfully brought a case \nbefore a NAFTA arbitration panel. That panel ruled the U.S. Government \nmust initiate efforts to open the border to cross-border trucking.\n  This new policy brought about a frenzy of activity at the Department \nof Transportation so that the border could be opened to cross-border \ntrucking as soon as this autumn. The agency has hastily cobbled \ntogether a series of measures intended to give United States citizens a \nfalse sense of security that this new influx of Mexican trucks will not \npresent a safety risk. These measures have been reviewed by both the \nHouse and Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittees and have \nbeen found to be woefully inadequate.\n  When the House debated the Transportation appropriations for fiscal \nyear 2002, its concerns about the inadequacy about the DOT safety \nmeasures were so grave that they resulted in an amendment being adopted \non the floor of the House that prohibited the Department of \nTransportation from granting operating authority to any Mexico-\ndomiciled trucking company during fiscal year 2002.\n  That amendment passed by a 2-to-1 margin, 285-143. Moreover, by the \ntime the Transportation bill left the House, it had been stripped of \nevery penny of the $88 million the administration requested to improve \nthe truck safety inspection capacity at the United States-Mexico \nborder.\n  The administration's approach is to allow Mexican trucks to come in \nand to inspect them later. At the other extreme, the House approach is \nto prevent Mexican trucks from coming in and to refuse to inspect them \nat all.\n  What Senator Shelby and I have done is to write a commonsense \ncompromise that will inspect all Mexican trucks and then let them in. \nJust as we require Americans to pass a driving test before they get a \nlicense, the bipartisan Senate bill before us requires Mexican trucks \nto pass an inspection before they can operate on our roads.\n  First, the bill includes $103 million--$15 million more than the \nPresident's request--for border truck safety activities.\n  Second, the bill establishes several enhanced truck safety \nrequirements that are intended to ensure that this new cross-border \ntrucking activity does not pose a safety risk.\n  The enhanced safety provisions included in the Senate bill were \ndeveloped based on the recommendations that the committee reviewed from \nthe DOT inspector general, the General Accounting Office, and law \nenforcement authorities, including the highway patrols of the States \nalong the border.\n  They will ensure there is an adequate safety regime in place before \nour borders are opened to cross-border trucking. The provision was \napproved unanimously by both the Transportation Appropriations \nSubcommittee and the full Appropriations Committee.\n\n[[Page S8081]]\n\n  In a moment, I will review the committee's safety recommendations in \ndetail, but first I want to address the issue of compliance with NAFTA.\n  I have heard it alleged that the provision adopted unanimously by the \ncommittee is in violation of the NAFTA. Nothing could be further from \nthe truth. I voted for NAFTA, and I support free trade. My goal is to \nensure free trade and public safety progress side by side. But rather \nthan take my opinion or that of another Senator, we have a written \ndecision by an arbitration panel that was charged with settling this \nvery issue. That arbitration panel was established under the NAFTA \ntreaty, and it is that panel's ruling that decides what does and does \nnot violate NAFTA when it comes to cross-border trucking.\n  I want to read a quote from the findings of the arbitration panel. \nThat quote is printed on this chart. I want to read it to my \ncolleagues:\n\n       The United States may not be required to treat applications \n     from Mexican trucking firms in exactly the same manner as \n     applications from United States or Canadian firms . . . U.S. \n     authorities are responsible for the safe operations of trucks \n     within U.S. territory, whether ownership is United States, \n     Canadian, or Mexican.\n\n  The arbitration panel made clear that under NAFTA, the United States \nis within its rights to impose whatever safety regimen it considers \nnecessary to ensure safety on U.S. highways.\n  While the Department of Transportation has stated it is seeking to \ntreat U.S., Mexican, and Canadian trucks in the same way, the fact is, \nwe are not required to treat them in the same way. Where greater safety \nrisks exist, we are entitled under NAFTA to impose stricter safety \nconditions. That is what the provisions adopted unanimously by the \nAppropriations Committee do. They establish stricter safety conditions \nfor those Mexican trucks that want to travel anywhere in the United \nStates.\n  It is a very convenient argument for the administration to claim \nthese safety provisions somehow violate NAFTA. They make that argument \nfor one reason and one reason only: because they want to convince \nSenators they must choose between safety and free trade. I am not \nfooled. The Committee on Appropriations and its Subcommittee on \nTransportation were not fooled, either. I voted for NAFTA, but I also \nread the arbitration panel's decision that made clear we are within our \nrights to impose whatever safety requirements are necessary to protect \nour highways. The safety requirements that the Department of \nTransportation has proposed are grossly inadequate.\n  Now, lest anyone thinks this is partisan, I make clear I think the \ntruck safety record under the Clinton administration was not any \nbetter. We have a lot to do in terms of moving the safety agenda \nforward, not just in terms of Mexican trucks but all trucks.\n  Let me take a few moments to discuss in detail the truck safety \nprovisions that were reported in the committee bill. First, inspectors \nmust be on duty. The provision adopted unanimously by the committee \nrequires Mexican trucks cross the border only at those points where \ninspectors are actually on duty.\n  The DOT inspector general found that Federal and State border \ninspectors were on duty 24 hours a day at only two border crossings. \nMexican trucks crossing the border during off hours are not subject to \ninspection. The committee provision requires that Mexican trucks cross \nthe border only at those inspection stations where inspectors are \nactually on duty. How can anyone possibly argue that our safety is \nbeing protected if these trucks are rolling across the border where no \nsafety inspector is on duty? Yet that is currently the case at certain \ntimes of the day at 25 of the 27 border crossings.\n  The inspector general has compiled data that shows conclusively that \nthere is a direct correlation between inspection staffing levels at the \nborder crossings and the quality of trucks that cross at those border \ncrossings. Put simply, trucks that need to worry about being inspected \ntend to cross the border at those crossings where an inspector is not \non duty. That is a loophole that must be closed.\n  Second, Mexican truck companies must have thorough compliance \nreviews. The DOT plans to issue conditional operating authority to \nMexican truck companies based on a simple mail-in questionnaire. All \nthat the Mexican truck companies will need to do under their plan is to \ncheck a box saying they have compiled with U.S. regulations and their \ntrucks will start rolling across the border. In fact, under the DOT \nplan, Mexican trucking companies would be allowed to operate for at \nleast a year and a half before they would be subjected to any \ncomprehensive safety audit by the Department of Transportation. Under \nthe committee provision, no Mexican trucking firm will be allowed to \noperate beyond the commercial zone until inspectors have actually \nperformed a compliance review on that trucking company. This review \nwill look at the conditions of the trucks and the recordkeeping. They \nwill determine whether the company actually has the capacity to comply \nwith U.S. safety regulations.\n\n  Once they have begun operating in the United States, Mexican trucking \nfirms will undergo a second compliance review within 18 months. That \nsecond review will allow the DOT to determine whether the Mexican \ntrucking firm has complied with U.S. safety standards. It will allow \nthem to review accident and breakdown rates, their drug and alcohol \ntesting results, and whether they have been cited frequently for \nviolations.\n  Third, compliance reviews of Mexican trucking firms must be performed \nonsite. Every time a U.S. motor carrier safety inspector performs a \ncompliance review on a U.S. trucking firm, it is done at the trucking \nfirm's facility. Every time a U.S. motor carrier safety inspector \nperforms a compliance review on a Canadian trucking firm, it is done at \nthe Canadian trucking firm's facility. When it comes to Mexico, the \nDepartment of Transportation wants to allow compliance reviews to be \nconducted at the border. This is a farce. A compliance review by \ndefinition requires the inspector to carefully review the trucking \nfirm's vehicles, record books, logbooks, wage and hour records, and \nmuch, much more. You cannot perform a compliance review at a remote \nsite. It is not even a poor substitute.\n  At the same time as the DOT claims it wants to provide for equal \ntreatment between U.S. trucking firms, Mexican trucking firms, and \nCanadian trucking firms, they want to establish a huge loophole where \nMexican trucking firms don't have to be subject to inspection. There is \na long list of abuses that could result if inspectors never visit a \ntrucking company's facility. For the life of me, I cannot imagine why \nthe DOT wants to allow those potential abuses on the part of Mexican \ntrucking firms while insisting every compliance review in the United \nStates and in Canada is performed onsite.\n  Fourth, we must verify all documents at the border. The provision \nthat has been reported by the committee requires that the license, \nregistration, operating authority, and insurance of every Mexican truck \nbe verified at the border. This is absolutely essential if we are to be \nsure that the vehicles crossing the border are being driven by \nexperienced drivers, with safe driving records, and that the vehicles \nare insured and registered.\n  It is well understood that, while the condition of a truck is \nimportant when it comes to maintaining safety, the capabilities of the \ndriver are far more important when it comes to minimizing the risk of a \nfatal accident. Our experience in dealing with illegal immigration and \nillegal drug trafficking across the United States-Mexico border has \nshown that there is a recurring problem of forged documents among \npeople crossing the border.\n  We cannot allow individuals with forged documents to drive 18-\nwheelers anywhere in the United States. It is simply common sense that \nwe make the extra effort to verify the license, insurance, and \nregistration of the trucks when they cross the border.\n  Fifth, we must require scales and weigh-in-motion machines at the \nborder. The provision passed unanimously by the committee requires all \nborder crossings to be equipped with both scales and weigh-in-motion \nmachines.\n  At present, vehicles in Mexico are allowed to operate at weights that \nare far in excess of permissible weights in the United States. There \nare no weigh stations currently operating in Mexico. None. The reasons \nfor requiring both weigh-in-motion machines and scales at each border \ncrossing are simple: to\n\n[[Page S8082]]\n\nmove trucks rapidly while keeping overweight trucks out of the United \nStates. It would be very time consuming to put every truck on scales as \nthey cross the border. However, weigh-in-motion machines allow our \ninspectors to pull out of the line only those few trucks that they \nsuspect to be overweight. At present, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration will not allow an enforcement act to be taken against an \noverweight truck based on the findings of a weigh-in-motion machine, so \nscales are necessary for the DOT to actually enforce U.S. weight \nrestrictions. There is no point in weighing the vehicles if you are not \nprepared to take enforcement action against those that are overweight.\n  Recently, the DOT praised extensively the border safety regime in \nplace at the Otay Mesa border crossing in California. Otay Mesa has \nboth weigh-in-motion machines and scales to conduct enforcement actions \non overweight trucks. That is the model that the committee provision \nwould extend to other border crossings between the United States and \nMexico.\n  Sixth, we must require Mexican firms to have U.S. insurance. The \nprovision adopted unanimously by the committee requires Mexican \ntrucking firms to obtain insurance, and their insurer must be licensed \nto operate within the United States.\n  This is the requirement that currently pertains to Canadian trucking \nfirms seeking to operate in the United States. We do not understand \nwhy, if the requirement is good enough for the Canadian trucking \ncompanies, the DOT thinks it's too onerous for the Mexican trucking \ncompanies.\n  There could be significant hurdles and challenges to collecting \ninsurance claims from Mexican insurers. American motorists who have \nbeen injured by Mexican trucks could face serious jurisdictional \nhurdles to getting compensated for their injuries.\n  We will also be able to verify the solvency of these insurance \ncompanies writing these insurance policies if they are operating in the \nUnited States. We will not have that capability when it comes to \nMexican insurance companies.\n  At present, the Mexican trucks crossing the border legally into the \ncommercial zone purchase insurance policies that last only 1 day. These \ninsurance policies are granted by Mexican insurance companies routinely \nwithout any knowledge of the condition of the truck.\n  Do we really want a situation where a Mexican trucking firm heading \nto Chicago and back has an insurance policy that is only 5 days long \nwith the trucker getting a different policy from a different insurance \ncompany every time he crosses the border?\n  We must make sure that the Mexican trucking companies operating in \nthe U.S. have the kind of insurance that is verifiable, sustainable, \nsolvent, and cooperative when it comes to paying off claims made by \nU.S. motorists and U.S. companies that have been injuried by Mexican \ntrucks.\n  Seventh, we must ensure rules are in place before the border is \nopened. The provision unanimously adopted by the Appropriations \nCommittee requires that critically important safety rules are completed \nby the DOT before the border can be opened. These rules were not \nrandomly selected. The rules that we require to be published before the \nborder can be opened are targeted at the specific safety concerns \nsurrounding Mexican trucks.\n  The rules that would be required to be published before the border \ncan be opened include: Rules mandating that foreign trucking companies \nincluding Mexican trucking companies be aware of U.S. safety standards; \nrules establishing minimum training standards for U.S. truck \ninspectors; rules requiring the development of staffing standards to \ndetermine the appropriate number of inspectors at the Mexican border; \nrules prohibiting foreign motor carriers, including Mexican trucking \ncompanies, from leasing their vehicles to another trucking company if \nthey have been subjected to a suspension, restriction, or limitation on \ntheir right to operate in the U.S.; and rules permanently disqualifying \nany foreign motor carrier that is found operating illegally in the \nUnited States.\n  All of these rules are specifically pertinent to the safety \nchallenges presented by Mexican trucks.\n  All of these rules were called for in the Motor Carrier Safety \nImprovement Act that was signed into law over a year and a half ago.\n  But the DOT wants to put the cart before the horse. The DOT wants to \nallow Mexican trucks across the border first and then develop the \npertinent safety standards later.\n  When the Congress passed the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act, we \ndid so with the knowledge that we would be facing a day in the future \nwhen Mexican trucks may be allowed free access into the United States. \nThat is why the strong safety requirements were put into that bill.\n  Now the DOT wants to let the Mexican trucks across the border without \nimplementing these new requirements. The DOT is arguing that it may \ntake a year or two to finalize these regulations and to put these rules \ninto place.\n  If it requires an extra 12 months so that safety is not undermined by \nthe influx of Mexican trucks, then it will be worth the wait.\n  Eighth, inspector positions must be filled by trained inspectors. The \nprovision adopted unanimously by the committee fully funds the DOT's \nrequest for 80 additional inspectors for the Mexican border.\n  The committee provision also includes a requirement to ensure the DOT \ndoes not fulfill the requirement by simply moving safety inspectors to \nthe border from elsewhere in the country.\n  We have Federal Motor Carrier Safety Inspectors in my State and every \nother State, and they are charged with maintaining truck safety in \nthose states. I don't think that any of us want to see all our truck \nsafety inspectors throughout the U.S. move down to the Mexican border \njust so the DOT can allow trucks to be moving across the border by this \nfall.\n  Ninth, our borders must have adequate inspection capacity. The DOT \nInspector General found that in 47 percent of the border crossings, \nFederal and State inspectors had space to inspect only one or two \ntrucks at a time. At more than half of the border crossings, inspectors \nhad only one or two spaces to park out-of-service trucks. That fact \nseverely undermines their ability to order trucks off the road.\n  It is one thing to say that you have inspectors on duty, and it is a \nvery different thing to say that there is sufficient capacity at the \nborder to do meaningful inspections and, if need be, order trucks off \nthe road.\n  The provision, reported unanimously by the committee, requires the \nDOT inspector general to certify that the inspection stations have \nsufficient capacity to conduct meaningful inspections and the ability \nand capacity to order trucks off the road if necessary.\n  Tenth, we must have adequate data systems in place. The provision \nadopted unanimously by the committee requires the inspector general to \ncertify that the database that is being compiled on Mexican trucking \nfirms and Mexican drivers is sufficiently accurate and accessible to \nallow U.S. law enforcement authorities to conduct their work.\n  These databases are key if we are going to be able to monitor the \nsafety performance of Mexican trucking firms and Mexican truck drivers.\n  The DOT inspector general found significant problems with the \naccuracy and completeness of the law enforcement databases on Mexico-\ndomiciled trucking companies.\n  In fact, they found that there were 900 Mexican trucking companies \nthat could not be accounted for between the database on insurance and \nlicensing and a separate database that houses identification numbers.\n  While it is true that the Mexican Government is starting to compile \nits own databases, it is widely recognized that there is not nearly \nenough information in the database to enable U.S. law enforcement to \ngather any information on the safety record of Mexican trucking firms \nand Mexican drivers.\n  The committee provision requires the DOT inspector general to certify \nthat these databases are actually functioning in a way where U.S. law \nenforcement can do its job.\n  It is not enough to have the computers operating. There needs to be \nsufficient information to allow U.S. law enforcement to keep unsafe \nMexican trucking firms and unsafe Mexican drivers off our roads.\n\n[[Page S8083]]\n\n  Eleventh, we must be able to enforce license revocation. When our \ncolleague Jack Danforth was in the Senate and serving as chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee, he made a great many contributions to \ntransportation safety.\n  One of his greatest contributions was the law requiring a uniform \ncommercial drivers license here in the United States. That requirement \ncame in the wake of numerous horror stories where U.S. truckdrivers had \ntheir licenses revoked and then got new licenses in other states so \nthey could continue driving.\n  Jack Danforth put a stop to all of that. He put a system in place in \nthe United States where we monitor the issuance of commercial drivers \nlicenses in all 50 States, to make sure that multiple licenses aren't \nbeing issued to the same driver.\n  There is no such system in Mexico. In fact, there is hardly any \ncomputerized data on who is getting a commercial driver's license in \nMexico. There is almost no data on the driving record history of \nMexican drivers within the Mexican system.\n  The provision unanimously adopted by the committee requires the DOT \ninspector general to certify that there are mechanisms in place within \nMexico to ensure that Mexican drivers with insufficient driving records \nhave their licenses revoked and cannot get a new license through \nsurreptitious means.\n  The DOT claims that it supports subjecting Mexican drivers and \nCanadian drivers to the exact same standards as U.S. drivers. Yet there \nis absolutely no mechanism in place in Mexico to make that into a \nreality.\n  No one in Mexico is monitoring the safety record of Mexican drivers \nto any degree of accuracy. As of today, there is no capability of U.S. \nlaw enforcement authorities to tap into a database that is sufficiently \ncomprehensive to give a clear picture of an individual's driving record \nin Mexico.\n  It is going to take several months for the Mexicans to compile such a \ndatabase and, even then, its accuracy is going to be questioned.\n  None of us wants a catastrophic truck accident in our State and to \nfind out that it was the driver's fourth or fifth accident. If we are \nserious about subjecting all truckdrivers to the same safety standards, \nthen there needs to be some mechanism in place to ensure that the \ndriving performance of Mexican truckers is being monitored as it is \nhere in the United States.\n  Twelfth, the California inspection plan. The final provision I would \nlike to discuss is the pending amendment before the Senate. It is \nsponsored by Senator Shelby and myself. We laid the amendment down last \nFriday when the bill was first brought up in the Senate.\n  We think it is an important measure that strengthens the truck safety \nprovisions in the underlying bill.\n  During the hearings last week in both the House and Senate \nauthorizing committees, much attention was paid to the inspection \nsystem that has been implemented by the State of California to handle \nthe safety deficiencies posed by Mexican trucks. The California system \nrequires every truck seeking to cross the border to be fully inspected \nat least every 90 days. This requirement is dramatically more stringent \nthan currently exists at the border with Texas, Arizona, or New Mexico.\n  As a result of this stronger enforcement effort, the percent of \nMexican trucks ordered off the road has dropped to a level that is \nbetter than that of other border crossings.\n  The provisions in the bill already reported by the committee require \nstrict new measures to verify the licenses, registration, operating \nauthority, and insurance of all Mexican trucks crossing the border.\n  This additional amendment will impose the California plan at all \nborder crossings between the U.S. and Mexico.\n  It is my understanding that the administration supports the \nimposition of this new inspection regime. I think it strengthens the \nbill in an important way that will better protect the safety of our \nconstituents.\n  Finally, it has been alleged that all of the safety measures that \nhave been included in the committee bill will cost more money than has \nbeen provided to date.\n  If the DOT needs more money to ensure the safety of America's \nhighways, then I believe that Secretary Mineta and OMB should come \nforward with a request for the additional funds.\n  The appropriations bill reported by the committee already provides \n$15 million more for the border truck safety activities than was \nrequested by DOT. If the DOT comes forward with a formal request for \nmore resources, the committee will work with the Department to find the \nnecessary resources. It will be money well spent.\n  For several years, our country has been looking for a way to balance \nthe open trade--called for by NAFTA--with the safety we expect on our \nhighways.\n  We understand that commerce must move, but we are concerned about the \nsafety of Mexican trucks--especially since they are 50 percent more \nlikely to violate our safety standards.\n  After a lot of hard work, after listening to the safety experts, the \nDepartment of Transportation, the GAO and the industry, we have come up \nwith a plan that allows both goals--free trade and safe roads--to \nprogress side by side.\n  This bill will not violate NAFTA. The arbitration panel already told \nus that we can take steps to ensure our safety.\n  Let me repeat that. The official panel that determines compliance \nwith NAFTA has already told us we can take the safety measures we need. \nThis bill does not violate NAFTA.\n  This bill won't stop trade across our border, but it will stop unsafe \ndrivers and unsafe trucks from threatening the American public.\n  Under our bill, when you are driving on the highway and there is an \n18-wheeler with a Mexican license plate in front of you, you can feel \nsafe.\n  You will know that the truck was inspected.\n  You will know that the company has a good track record.\n  You will know that an American inspector visited their facility--on \nsite--and examined their records, just as we do with Canadian trucking \nfirms.\n  You will know that the driver is licensed and insured.\n  You will know that the truck was weighed and is safe for our roads \nand bridges.\n  You will know that we are keeping track of which companies and which \ndrivers are following our laws--and which ones are not.\n  You will know that if a driver is breaking our laws, we will revoke \nhis license.\n  You will know that the truck didn't just cross our border unchecked \nbut crossed where there were inspectors on duty, ensuring our safety.\n  That's a real safety program.\n  This is a solid compromise. It will allow robust trade while ensuring \nthe safety of our highways.\n  I appreciate that some Members want to take a different approach. I \nam here, and I am willing to listen to constructive ideas.\n  But as a country, we should not move toward weaker safety standards.\n  And as a Senator I will not help the Senate weaken the standards that \nensure the safety of the American public.\n  We can have free trade and safe highways--and this bill shows us how.\n  It sets up a real safety program that will keep Americans safe and it \nfully complies with NAFTA.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this pro-safety, pro-trade bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, be immediately recognized after my \nremarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I know that we have and will hear a \ngreat deal about Mexican trucks during the consideration of the \nTransportation appropriations bill, and much of the information will \nseem to be inconsistent or contradictory. In the interests of a \nmeaningful and productive discussion of the issue, I would like to \nsummarize what we do know about Mexican trucks.\n  According to the Department of Transportation inspector general, \nduring Fiscal Year 2000, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration reports show that Federal and State inspectors performed \n46,144 inspections on Mexican trucks at the border and within the \ncommercial zones. For those inspected, the out-of-service rate declined \nfrom 44 percent in fiscal year 1997 to 36 percent\n\n[[Page S8084]]\n\nin fiscal year 2000. By comparison, United States trucks' out-of-\nservice rate for fiscal year 2000 was 24 percent.\n  Clearly, the data we do have indicates that the out-of-service rate \nfor Mexican trucks in 50 percent higher than our own domestic truck \nfleet. Accordingly, we need to do more to inspect trucks entering the \nUnited States at the Mexican border.\n  The President's budget request and the committee reported \nTransportation appropriations bill does do more: the President's budget \nrequested $88 million for inspectors and new border inspection \nfacilities and the committee reported bill provides a minimum of $103 \nmillion for inspectors, safety grants to states, and new border \nfacilities--quite an increase.\n  In the near term, developing an inspection capability that includes \nproviding inspectors and inspection facilities at the border crossings \nis central to ensuring compliance with United States safety \nregulations.\n  Unfortunately, those capabilities, necessary regulations, forms and \nfacilities are not yet in place to provide an inspection and \nenforcement regime that can assure Americans that Mexican trucks \nentering the United States, including the commercial zone, can match \nthe out-of-service rates of the United States trucking fleet, much less \nthe Canadian trucks operating in the United States.\n  No one should believe that Mexican trucks are inherently any better \nor any worse than trucks from any other country--the United States or \nCanada.\n  But unless a Mexican inspection regime is in place in that country \nthat can give Americans the confidence that trucks from Mexico are \nstatistically as safe as trucks operating in this country, we must \nprovide an inspection and regulatory system that insures that trucks \nentering from Mexico meet a minimum level of fitness to operate on our \nhighways.\n  There has been a clamor that somehow providing an inspection and \nregulatory regime for Mexican trucks entering the United States \nviolates NAFTA. As a Senator who did not support NAFTA, I do not \nbelieve that NAFTA should dictate what the United States Congress can \nand cannot do regarding the safety of vehicles operating on our \nhighways.\n  In fact, NAFTA itself provides that motor carriers entering a NAFTA \ncountry must comply with the safety and operating regulations of that \ncountry. Accordingly, requiring that Mexican truck drivers have a valid \ncommercial driver's license or that Mexican-domiciled trucks are safe \nis clearly within the spirit and the letter of NAFTA.\n  The NAFTA arbitration panel held:\n\n       The U.S. authorities are responsible for the safe \n     operations of trucks within U.S. territory, whether ownership \n     is United States, Canadian, or Mexican.\n\n  It is the duty, I believe, of the U.S. Congress to provide the policy \nguidance for those U.S. authorities. The committee-reported bill takes \nthe appropriate steps to provide that policy guidance.\n  Let me briefly describe the Murray-Shelby language that is in the \ncommittee-reported bill and the amendment to that language currently \nbefore the Senate.\n  In addition to the minimum of $103 million for inspectors, safety \ngrants to States, and new border facilities, under the committee-\nreported bill:\n  We require the Department of Transportation to only allow Mexican \ntrucks to cross the border at inspection facilities where inspectors \nare present and on duty;\n  Further, we require the Department of Transportation to allow the \nfull opening of the border only--yes, only--when the inspector general \ncertifies that all of the 80 new inspectors provided under the \ncommittee funding recommendation are fully trained as safety \nspecialists capable of conducting compliance reviews;\n  Further, we require the Department of Transportation to perform a \nfull safety audit of each Mexican trucking firm before any conditional \noperating certificate is granted and then to perform a full followup \ncompliance review again within 18 months before granting a permanent \noperating certificate;\n  Further, we require that all safety audits of Mexican trucking firms \ntake place on-site at each firm's facilities;\n  We prohibit the full opening of the border until the inspector \ngeneral certifies that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration \nhas implemented a policy to ensure compliance on the part of Mexican \ntruckers with pertinent hours-of-service rules;\n  Further, we prohibit the full opening of the border until the \nInspector General certifies that the information infrastructure of the \nMexican authorities is sufficiently accurate, accessible, and \nintegrated with that of U.S. law enforcement authorities to permit the \nverification of the status and validity of licenses, vehicle \nregistration, operating authority, and insurance of Mexican-domiciled \nmotor carriers while operating in the United States;\n  Further, we prohibit the full opening of the border until the \nDepartment of Transportation requires checks of Mexican-domiciled \ntrucks by federally funded inspectors for violations of applicable \nFederal regulations;\n  Further, we prohibit the full opening of the border until the \ninspector general certifies that there is adequate capacity to conduct \na sufficient number of truck inspections to maintain safety;\n  Further, we prohibit the full opening of the border until the \nDepartment of Transportation equips all Mexican border crossings with \nweigh-in-motion systems as well as fixed scales for enforcement action;\n  Further, we prohibit the full opening of the border until the \ninspector general certifies that there is an accessible database \ncontaining sufficiently comprehensive data to allow for safety \nperformance monitoring of all Mexican drivers entering the United \nStates; and\n  We prohibit the full opening of the border until the inspector \ngeneral certifies that the Department of Transportation has published \ncertain overdue regulations relating to motor carrier safety.\n  In addition, the pending Murray-Shelby perfecting amendment improves \nthe inspection requirement in the Mexican truck provisions in the \ncommittee-reported bill to require the inspection of all Mexican trucks \nthat do not display a current Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance--\nCVSA--inspection decal--and requires renewal of those decals every 90 \ndays.\n  This is the so-called California standard, and adding it to the \nunderlying inspection and enforcement regime included in the committee-\nreported bill, we believe, improves the overall inspection process.\n  According to the Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, current data and \ninformation on Mexican companies, who intend to travel internationally \nfrom Mexico to the United States, is quite limited. This is because:\n  First, there have been few safety regulatory requirements placed on \nthe industry until very recently;\n  Second, there are a limited number of personnel trained and \ncontinually performing oversight functions; and\n  Third, the information infrastructure has not been in place to \ncapture and record the results of the current limited oversight being \nperformed by the Mexican Government.\n  Given the shortcomings in the inspection and regulatory regime for \nMexican trucks and the immediacy of the Mexican truck issue, the \nMurray-Shelby approach is one way to move this issue forward while \nbalancing the need to foster safety on our highways without closing the \nborder to Mexican trucks.\n  While this is an emotional issue for many, the Murray-Shelby approach \nis a dispassionate treatment of the core issues related to inspection, \nborder and information infrastructure investment, and providing a \nrational playing field for international trucking activities. I stand \nready, with the Senator from Washington, to work with interested \nMembers and the administration to move this legislation to conference.\n  In conference, we will continue to work with all interested parties \nto make sure that the requisite investments and safety protections are \nin place to further the Nation's interests in a safe, economically \nviable, and fair international truck inspection system.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that following \nthe remarks of the Senator from North Dakota, the Senator from Colorado \nbe allowed to speak for 10 minutes.\n\n[[Page S8085]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, this is a very interesting and a very \nimportant issue. There are a number of ways to address this issue. One \nmethod is to address it in the manner chosen by my colleagues, Senator \nMurray and Senator Shelby. Another method would be the approach chosen \nby the House of Representatives that passed by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, \na provision that simply prohibits the use of funds in the next fiscal \nyear to license trucks to go beyond the 20-mile limit that are doing \nhauls out of Mexico.\n  Let me describe this issue, if I might, so that we all get an \nunderstanding of what is happening. We are trying to plug together two \neconomies with NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement. I did \nnot vote for NAFTA. I did not think it was a good trade agreement. I \nthought it was terribly negotiated, badly negotiated on our behalf. And \nI think evidence suggests that has been the case.\n  We took a trade relationship with Mexico, which had a small surplus \nfor us, and turned it into a very large deficit that is growing and \ngrowing and growing. We took a deficit with Canada and doubled it, and \nthen some. So I do not think NAFTA turned out very well for a range of \nreasons.\n  We were told, when we passed NAFTA: NAFTA will allow the product of \nunskilled labor from Mexico to be moved into the United States; and \nthat is essentially what will happen with respect to the trade coming \nfrom Mexico. In fact, since NAFTA was passed, what are the most common \nimports and the largest imports from Mexico to the United States? The \nproduct of skilled labor--automobiles, automobile parts, and \nelectronics--exactly the opposite of what was suggested when NAFTA was \nenacted.\n  But aside from all of that, aside from the fact that it has taken \nskilled jobs away from the United States and moved them to Mexico; \naside from the fact that it has turned a surplus with Mexico into a \nhuge trade deficit, we are now told by a panel that negotiates these \nissues of trade compliance that we must allow Mexican long-haul \ntruckers into this country.\n  We have, since the NAFTA agreement, prohibited Mexican long-haul \ntruckers from going beyond the 20-mile limit established by the \nprevious administration. We are now told that must change, and we must \nallow access to the United States by Mexican long-haul truckers. Many \nare concerned about that, myself included.\n  Let me give you just an example of why one might be concerned.\n  The San Francisco Chronicle did a piece by sending a reporter to \nMexico, who spent 3 days on the road with a Mexican long-haul trucker. \nI thought it would be interesting to discuss what happened with that \nMexican long-haul trucker. It was described in a rather interesting and \nuseful piece in the San Francisco Chronicle.\n  This was a trucker who went from Mexico City to Tijuana. That is the \nequivalent of driving from the bottom of Texas to the northern part of \nNorth Dakota; it is a very long trip. This driver traveled 3 days, \n1,800 miles; and during the 3 days he slept 7 hours. Let me say that \nagain. This person drove 1,800 miles and was awake 21 hours a day. No \nlogbooks. No minimum hours of service. No drug testing. No inspections \nfor safety.\n  The question is this, for this country: With such a different set of \nstandards as relates to Mexican trucks versus United States trucks, and \nthe Mexican trucking industry versus the United States trucking \nindustry, do you want to drive down an American highway and in your \nrearview mirror see an 80,000-pound 18-wheeler behind you that may or \nmay not have been inspected, and may or may not have brakes, and may or \nmay not have been driven by somebody driving for 18 hours straight? Is \nthat what you want for you and your family to see in your rearview \nmirror? Is this just sort of scare nonsense that we talk about? No, not \nat all.\n  Look at the difference in standards. We take great care in this \ncountry to describe very specific requirements for trucking firms and \ntheir drivers in the United States. They must have logbooks to describe \nhow long they have driven and where they have driven. They must have \nsafety inspections. They must take drug tests. They must have safety \ninspections on the equipment. There are minimum hours of service. There \nare a whole series of requirements they must meet. Why? Because in this \ncountry we decided long ago that if we are going to share our \nhighways--and we must--with this very important part of our \ntransportation system--trucks--then we want to be sure that some 2-door \ncompact car sharing that highway with an 18-wheeler carrying 80,000 \npounds--we want to make sure that safety is a preeminent condition in \nthis country. So we established regulations. Some say all regulations \nare bad. I don't believe that. I think some regulations are critically \nnecessary--for safe food, healthy drinking water, safe highways. On the \nissue of safe highways, we decided long ago with respect to our \ntrucking industry what kind of requirements they must meet, and we have \nthe inspectors, we have the investigators, we have the entire system in \nplace.\n  This book is the ``Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations,'' \nJanuary 1, 1999, last revised. This is from the Department of \nTransportation. This rather large, imposing book is full of \nregulations. Why? It is to provide for public safety on America's \nroads. Now if that is what we do in this country, what happens in \nMexico? Nothing equivalent to this happens in Mexico. Some say: Well, \nyou know what you are doing. NAFTA was a trade agreement between the \nUnited States, Mexico, and Canada, and you are coming to the floor only \ntalking about Mexico. Why not Canada?\n  The reason is obvious. Canada has a rather similar economy to ours. \nThey have similar trucking regulations and safety requirements to ours, \nbut there is nothing that is remotely similar with respect to Mexico. \nSo we must, it seems to me, be concerned about the lifting of this 20-\nmile limit of Mexican long-haul trucks coming into this country. \nPresident Bush indicates he wants to do that on January 1. I disagree. \nThe authors of the Transportation appropriations bill have a provision \nin this bill that says to the President: You can only do this under \ncertain circumstances and under certain certifications. I happen to \nthink that is a step in the right direction. I would much prefer, \nhowever, that we simply shut off funds for this purpose in the coming \nfiscal year. I have seen people certify anything--Republican and \nDemocratic administrations. They have certified many things. If we say \nyou must certify with respect to drugs in Mexico, they do it. If we say \nyou must certify that El Salvador, in the 1980s, was responsible for \nhuman rights violations, they certify it.\n\n  I am worried about anything that requires anybody to certify because \nI think there are people here who will certify to almost anything, who \nwill sign a blank sheet of paper. We are nowhere near ready to allow \nMexican long-haul trucks into this country. We had a hearing in the \nCommerce Committee last week. I am a member, and I sat there all \nmorning. I inquired of the witnesses. Some of the witnesses were the \nSecretary of Transportation, the inspector general, the head of the \nTeamsters Union, and so many others. I inquired of those witnesses, and \nthe one conclusion with which I think everyone came away from that \nhearing is that there isn't a ghost of a chance of this country being \nready to allow Mexican long-haul trucks into this country without \ncompromising basic safety on American roads.\n  Let me cite some examples. This is the inspector general report of \nthe Department of Transportation. He talks about the capability of \ninspecting Mexican trucks coming into this country. I think we have 27 \nborder crossings. Only two of those border crossings have full-time \ninspectors 24 hours a day. So out of all the border crossings that \nwould allow Mexican trucks to come in, only two have inspectors 24 \nhours a day. At 20 of the crossings, the inspectors who were there--and \nthere are only a few of them--didn't have dedicated phone lines to \naccess any databases so they could validate a simple thing like a \ncommercial driver's license. At 19 of the locations, the inspectors had \nspace to inspect 1 or 2 trucks at a time. At 14 of the locations, \ninspectors had 1 or 2 spaces to park vehicles placed out of service.\n  The inspector general talked to us about having to turn Mexican \ntrucks\n\n[[Page S8086]]\n\nback. He said: You know, we have a problem if we don't have a place to \npark them. I said: Why can't you turn them around? He said: For \nexample, we have a Mexican truck come to the border and it is \ninspected--incidentally, 2 percent are inspected, so most of them are \nnever inspected--but we inspect it. I said: Why can't you turn it back? \nHe said: No, we have to park it. I said: Why? He said: Because it had \nno brakes. So we have an 18-wheel truck, with no brakes, trying to get \ninto the United States, but they can't turn it back to Mexico because \nit has no brakes. To the extent that they have insurance, they buy 1 \nday of insurance.\n  So, look, the testimony by the Secretary of Transportation, the \ninspector general, and others demonstrates clearly that we are nowhere \nnear being ready to allow Mexican long-haul trucks into this country.\n  This IG's report is a fascinating document that I suggest all of my \ncolleagues read. Thirty-six percent of the Mexican trucks are turned \nback for serious safety violations--serious violations--and most of the \ntrucks are not inspected at all. The implication is that we will \nsomehow have the capability on January 1 to have a rigorous inspection \nand compliance program with respect to these Mexican trucks. There is \nnothing like that that is capable of being done between now and January \n1. That won't be done between now and 2 years from now, in my judgment.\n  The only way you can possibly do this is if you have enough \ninspectors at the border and compliance officers to go down and \nactually make onsite compliance inspections of the Mexican trucking \nfirms. There aren't anywhere near the resources to do that. Even the \nresources requested by the administration in this year's budget come up \nshort of doing what they say they will or must do in order to be ready \nfor January 1. They talked about the number of inspectors they would \nneed--139--and then the IG said, by the way, that is the minimum \nnumber, that it would actually be more than that. The administration \nrequested that number, and they came up 40 inspectors short because \nthey are using the number twice for inspectors and compliance officers.\n  The point is that none of this adds up. It is fuzzy math, fuzzy \npolicy. It is plain bad policy, in my judgment, to suggest we are \nanywhere near the time when we should allow Mexican long- haul trucks \ninto this country.\n  The hearing we held last week persuaded me that we need to take \naggressive and bold action. I am going to file an amendment--I do not \nknow at this moment whether I will call it up--I am going to file an \namendment this morning that will allow the Senate to vote on the House \nlanguage.\n  The House language says simply: There shall be no funding allowed for \nthe processing of applications for these trucks or licenses for these \ntrucks to exceed the 20-mile limit in the coming fiscal year.\n  Is that going to change anything? No, because there is not a ghost of \na chance of anyone being able to comply or to certify that we have the \ninspectors or the ability to allow these trucks into the country in the \nfirst place and still maintain safety on America's roads.\n  The fact is, even with the 20-mile limit--on this chart the States \noutlined in red are where Mexican trucks have been seen and Mexican \ntruckdrivers stopped by law enforcement authorities. These are just the \nones that have been stopped. Yes, it includes North Dakota.\n  I am constrained to say, as bad as this trade agreement was which \nhurts us on the northern end by allowing unfairly subsidized Canadian \ngrain to come into this country, that what we will have now is the \nperverse circumstance, perhaps, of unsafe Mexican trucks hauling \nsubsidized Canadian grain to American cities. Talk about a hood \nornament for foolishness, that is it.\n  The States in red are where we have already seen Mexican trucks \nmoving into this country, in violation of the law, I might add. The \nadministration's proposal is to on January 1 open it up completely.\n  The DOT Office of Inspector General mentioned 36 percent of the \nMexican trucks that were inspected were placed out of service. In fact, \nit said something more than that; it said serious safety violations. I \nmentioned one example of why they could not move the truck back into \nMexico. They had to park it because it had no brakes.\n  A 1998 estimate was that 139 inspectors were needed. That is a \nconservative number. That number is based on conditions in 1998 and did \nnot account for changes, such as expanded hours of operation and growth \nin commercial traffic.\n  They are 40 short of this number, but even that number, the IG says, \nis short of what is needed. Currently, the only permanent inspection \nfacilities at the United States-Mexico border are the State facilities, \ntwo of them in California. Excluding those two crossings, they observed \nthe following conditions: At 20 crossings, inspectors did not have \ndedicated phone lines. I mentioned that. At 19 crossings, they had the \ncapability to inspect only 1 or 2 trucks.\n  All of us understand, we are talking about a Presidential veto. God \nforbid the President should veto this bill. It does not matter to me if \nhe vetoes this bill. What matters to me is that we do good public \npolicy that ensures the safety of the American people. That is all I am \ninterested in.\n  The first and most important step we should take in the Senate, in my \njudgment, is to take the House language, put it in the Senate bill, and \ngo to conference, and the House and Senate will have said: We will not \nallow funds to be used in this fiscal year to allow Mexican trucks to \ncome into this country beyond the 20-mile border because it will \njeopardize the safety of American highways.\n  Senator Murray and Senator Shelby have put a provision in their bill, \nand if the provision works as it is written, I expect it will do the \nsame as I propose to do with the House language.\n\n  My great fear is we have too many people in this town who will \ncertify to almost anything, and an administration that wants to open it \nup on January 1, very likely, unless we prohibit the expenditure of \nfunds to do so, will find a way to open that border. In my judgment, \nthat will jeopardize safety on American highways.\n  I will conclude where I started. Some of the best evidence is \nanecdotal evidence. We have some information about accidents and the \ncondition of Mexican trucks and the fact that there is very little done \nwith respect to logbooks. In fact, Mexico requires logbooks, but they \ndo not enforce it.\n  It is like when the maquiladora plants hosted American companies that \nwanted to build manufacturing plants to manufacture south of the \nborder, and they said: Well, gosh, Mexico has very strict environmental \nlaws with respect to polluting the air and water. Sure they do. They \njust do not enforce them. So what if they have the laws? It is totally \nirrelevant. You can have all kinds of laws on the books; if you have a \nblind eye to the enforcement, it is totally irrelevant.\n  With respect to this issue of logbooks and other things, some say: \nMexico requires logbooks. Yes, they sure do; and nobody has them, and \nnobody cares.\n  I started with the anecdotal piece about the San Francisco Chronicle, \nand I will finish with that.\n  It is not, I am told, out of the ordinary for long-haul trucks in \nMexico to be driven by Mexican drivers who are paid $7 a day, driving \n15, 20--in this case, nearly 21--hours a day for 3- or 4-day trips.\n  The San Francisco Chronicle talked about the truckdriver who left \nMexico City and drove to Tijuana. He drove 3 days. That driver slept 7 \nhours in 3 days, making $7 a day, driving a truck that would not have \npassed inspection in this country with a cracked windshield. No \nlogbook, no drug inspection, no mandatory safety inspection on the \nvehicle.\n  Is that really what we want to allow to come into our country at this \npoint? I think not. It has nothing to do with who it is. It has \neverything to do with whether it is safe.\n  The answer is, until the country of Mexico not only has regulations \nand standards that we can count on and rely on and that are enforced, \nand enforced rigorously, we ought to decide we will not let safety on \nAmerica's highways be jeopardized, and the way to do that is, in my \njudgment, to pass the House prohibition on funding.\n  As I indicated, I am filing the amendment this morning. I am \nobviously going to continue to talk to colleagues.\n\n[[Page S8087]]\n\n I share the same concern and interests that my two colleagues do. I \nthink the language they have written is good language. I just believe \nin the end we will have people certifying to anything and the \nadministration will find a way to allow these trucks to come in on \nJanuary 1. That will be a giant step in the wrong direction for safety \non America's highways.\n  We ought not ever engage in trade agreements that would in any way \nforce us or squeeze us to compromise safety in this country. It does \nnot matter whether it is food safety or highway safety, nothing in \ntrade agreements ought to require us to diminish our standards that we \nhave established for people in this country. That is why I am so \nconcerned about this issue.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nColorado is recognized.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Madam President, after listening to my colleague from \nNorth Dakota, I could say ditto and let it go at that because I \ncertainly agree with his comments. I am inclined to tell the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, if he offers the amendment mirroring the House \nlanguage, I would probably support that.\n  I want to speak today in support of Chairman Murray's language in the \nfiscal year 2002 Transportation appropriations bill, and I want to \nspeak in favor of this language for a couple of minutes.\n  First and foremost, the safety of every American who travels on our \nstreets and highways must not be compromised by vehicles that are \nunsafe by American standards, despite trade relations.\n  All of us in the Senate make our decisions based on a personal frame \nof reference, and certainly my frame of reference includes the 6 years \nI drove as a professional driver while I was putting myself through \ncollege years ago. In fact, I am still probably the only Member of the \nSenate who has a commercial driver's license and, in fact, still \ndrives, more as an escape from the tediums of the Senate work than \nanything else, but I still get out on the road pretty regularly. I \nspeak to drivers and spend a great deal of time at truckstops and \nplaces where they frequent, listening to their concerns.\n  I know the safety requirements that each American driver must adhere \nto are very complete. I am concerned that without the language provided \nin this bill and report, Mexican drivers will not be subject to the \nsame standards. I am sure there are some very skilled and talented \nMexican drivers, and we have to be very careful to make sure we do not \ndo a blanket indictment on the Mexican trucking industry. My comments \nare certainly not meant to do that.\n  The standards between the equipment and the monitoring between \ndrivers in the United States and Mexico, unlike the drivers of the \nUnited States and Canada, are worlds apart. This is an enormous safety \nissue, as my colleagues have already mentioned, and I do not think we \nshould ignore this for a minute.\n  Mile for mile, American truckdrivers are much safer than drivers of \nautomobiles. The single drivers are averaging about 5,000 miles a week \nin the trucks and, if they are team drivers, probably 10,000 miles a \nweek. They have to be safe drivers.\n\n  Certainly those who have driven or have been around accidents \ninvolving trucks know that many of the trucks from Mexico are not in \ngood repair. The average fleet of the American trucking industry, I am \ntold, is 3 to 6 years old. These are figures I quote from the American \nTrucker's Association. The average Mexican fleet is 15 years old. When \naveraging 100,000 miles a year, it does not take much math to figure \nthere is a huge difference in upkeep and maintenance on a truck \ntraveling that much more over a period of 15 years. Wear and tear on \nthe truck is huge.\n  In a truck-auto accident, obviously, the trucker will not get hurt--\n80,000 pounds versus 3,000 pounds. The law of physics says whoever is \nin the smaller vehicle will receive the most damage. Passenger vehicles \ndriving alongside a truck face serious safety hazards if the truck is \nnot in good repair. My concerns regard the unsafe trucks that are not \nbeing regulated.\n  American truckers, to be qualified for CDL, have to pass eight \nwritten tests, several driving tests, a physical every 2 years, and \nongoing training in the company, which is in turn federally regulated. \nIt is very easy to lose their license for any small infraction dealing \nwith alcohol, drugs, or unsafe driving. There is almost zero tolerance \nallowed to remain a professional driver.\n  To my knowledge, Mexican drivers are not restricted to hours of \nservice. This has been mentioned before. The U.S. truckdrivers are \nrestricted. Each American truckdriver has specific regulations as to \nhow long he is allowed to drive, how many hours he can be at the wheel, \nand he has to keep meticulous records in a logbook dealing with every \nsingle minute he is behind that wheel. The record is checked on a \nregular basis, and significant fines are levied to both the drivers and \nthe owners of the vehicles who violate the service regulations.\n  By the way, I am holding one of the books of regulations, 1,112 pages \nlong. There are seven of these books. This is title 49, section 171-\n180, and it is one of the sections dealing with transportation. This \nsimply deals with transportation of hazardous materials. All American \nshippers, all carriers, and all drivers have to comply with the rules. \nWho in the heck will monitor compliance for the Mexican trucks? I can \nread English and speak it pretty well, but one must read some of the \nsections three or four times to understand the nuances of the \nregulations. I defy anybody to tell me the trucks coming from Mexico \nwill comply with the letter of the law and the regulations as American \ndrivers do.\n  The Mexican truck drivers are under no safety regulations, no \nincentive to adhere to our regulations, as I understand it. I raised \nthese concerns as the Senator from North Dakota did when we were \ndiscussing the NAFTA treaty several years ago. We simply convinced very \nfew people there were real dangers and of the unintended consequences \nof both fast track and the NAFTA agreement. Of course, it was shooed \nin. We are going to visit another agreement very shortly. I hope most \nof my colleagues in the Senate recognize sometimes in this pellmell \nrush to increase trade we have to revisit issues because we are not at \nall supportive at a later date.\n  The Mexico-based registered trucks are authorized to operate in a 20-\nmile border, as Senator Dorgan mentioned. This was provided under the \noriginal NAFTA agreement. They have been spotted, however, in 30 \nStates, which I think is a clear violation of that trade agreement. \nCertainly it has not been addressed. Common sense demands the matter be \naddressed before we allow more uninspected trucks to enter our country.\n\n  Opponents of the Murray language point out the outstanding fine the \nU.S. must pay for violating truck agreements under NAFTA. I would like \nto know what the penalties have been for the Mexican trucks we have \nfound all over the United States. This isn't an issue of discrimination \nor adherence to trade agreements, although they would like to reduce it \nto such, but an issue of safety for every American who travels the \nroads of America and an issue of fairness. A loaded tractor-trailer \noperating at highway speed is especially dangerous if the vehicle has \nworn brakes, bad steering, or any weaknesses in the integrity of the \ntruck. We demand very strict safety guidelines, but clearly rollover \nrisks are more acute when a truck is involved in an accident. A loaded \nsemitruck of 80,000 pounds does not stop like a family sedan, but takes \nup to 10 times longer to stop.\n  I refer to an article in Land Line Magazine, and I ask unanimous \nconsent it be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit No. 1.)\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. This article in Land Line Magazine reports four members \nof the House Subcommittee on Highways and Transit, headed by \nsubcommittee chairman Thomas Petri, and the ranking member, \nRepresentative Robert Borski, recently conducted a factfinding mission \non border inspection stations. The purpose of the mission was to view \nthe station and consider the possibility of opening new ones. The \nmembers were impressed the way the inspection stations of California,\n\n[[Page S8088]]\n\nwhich have about a 25 percent out-of-service rate for the trucks from \nMexico, similar to the ones in the United States. In other words, about \none-fourth of the trucks, whether American or Mexican trucks, did not \ncomply with the American safety standards. When it came to Texas, the \nresults were vastly different because Texas doesn't have State \nfacilities for inspecting. Clearly, if a trucker knows he will be \nstopped at one inspection system, he will go to the area of least \nresistance.\n  I refer to a paragraph in that article, quoting Representative \nBorski:\n\n       ``Texas' inspection system is virtually nonexistent . . . \n     Trucks pour over the border there. They may be safe and may \n     be not.''\n       ``Texas has no infrastructure to look at trucks,'' he \n     added. ``During our visit, we were shown two parking spaces \n     for inspecting trucks two at a time with 4,000 trucks per day \n     at that crossing. The out-of-service rate was staggering. \n     Texas Department of Public Safety Major Coy Clanton told us \n     if they looked at seven or eight trucks, they would take five \n     out of service for significant safety violations. I think the \n     key is that a truck that isn't inspected will be neglected. I \n     think that's the biggest danger.''\n\n  I hope, when asked to vote for fast track, that we recognize the \ndanger of simply reducing ourselves to rubber stamps for any \nadministration. I voted against NAFTA, as did my colleague from North \nDakota. I recognize that is the law now. We have to abide by the \nagreement.\n  However, let me also refer to some of the comments made by Jim Hoffa, \nthe general president of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, \nthat he provided in a hearing before the Senate Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation on July 18:\n\n       . . . the United States is under no legal obligation to \n     implement the findings of the NAFTA panel. Under U.S. law, \n     the health, safety and welfare of the U.S. citizens is \n     paramount and to the extent NAFTA conflicts with any U.S. law \n     dealing with health, environment and motor carrier/worker \n     safety, U.S. law prevails. Even under the terms of NAFTA, the \n     U.S. is entitled to disregard the panel's recommendation, and \n     simply allow Mexico to take equivalent reciprocal measures or \n     negotiate compensation or a new grant of some trade benefits \n     to Mexico. Indeed, the United States has not traditionally \n     allowed foreign countries or international bureaucracies to \n     dictate its domestic policy, particularly where the health \n     and safety of U.S. citizens is concerned . . .\n\n  Some would say that Mr. Hoffa, as the president of the Teamsters, may \nbe somewhat of a protectionist. He has every right to be. By some \nestimates, the United States has lost 800,000 manufacturing jobs since \nNAFTA was implemented. Certainly the loss of jobs, although secondary \nto the safety of our people, is important. I think the language of this \nbill is vital to the health and safety of all of us. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the Murray provisions of this bill.\n  I challenge the opponents of this position to explain why we should \nallow 80,000 pound accidents waiting to happen to drive the same roads \nour families drive.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                             Exhibit No. 1\n\n                      [From Land Line, July 2001]\n\n Congress Fact-Finding Committee Visits U.S.-Mexico Border Inspection \n                                Stations\n\n                          (By Rene Tankersley]\n\n       Four members of the House Subcommittee on Highways and \n     Transit recently visited border inspection stations in San \n     Diego, CA, and Laredo, TX, as part of a fact-finding venture \n     to determine the safety of Mexican trucks crossing into the \n     United States.\n       Subcommitee Chairman Rep. Thomas Petri (R-WI), ranking \n     minority member Rep. Robert A. Borski (D-PA), Rep. Bob Filner \n     (D-CA) and Rep. Tim Holden (D-PA) toured the border \n     inspection stations May 19-20.\n       Land Line talked with Reps. Petri and Borski about what \n     they saw and how it affected their outlook on the possible \n     opening of the U.S.-Mexico border. Both Petri and Borski \n     seemed thoroughly impressed with California's state-owned \n     inspection station at the border between San Diego and \n     Tijuana, Mexico. The state-operated station inspects trucks \n     and truckdrivers for safety and compliance with state motor \n     vehicle laws.\n       ``California's very comprehensive truck inspection program \n     applies to all trucks, Mexican and American,'' Petri said. \n     ``Trucks must have an inspection sticker, which is renewed \n     every three months at the border station. If inspectors find \n     problems with the equipment, the drivers either fix the \n     problem there or receive an order, and sometimes a fine, to \n     fix the problem and be re-inspected on their next trip to the \n     border station.''\n       Borski agreed, and added that the out-of-service rate at \n     the California station is average. ``California's inspection \n     station has about a 25 percent out-of-service rate for trucks \n     from Mexico, which is similar to the rate for U.S. trucks,'' \n     Borski said.\n       The party of four also visited the federal border \n     inspection station in San Diego. Here federal inspectors \n     examine trucks for contraband, both illegal aliens and drugs, \n     using their new laser x-ray machines x-ray the entire truck.\n       The federal government has about 15 contraband stations in \n     Laredo due to the larger volume of goods coming through this \n     border by truck and rail. The congressional party visited \n     Laredo's newest facility, which inspects and x-rays boxcars \n     and trailer piggyback units.\n       With the overwhelming workload at the U.S. Customs \n     contraband stations, Borski is concerned with how opening the \n     border will affect the officials there. ``Government \n     officials working down there are overwhelmed already,'' \n     Borski said.\n       Texas does not have a state facility at the border crossing \n     to inspect trucks for compliance with Texas motor carrier \n     laws.\n       ``Texas' inspection system is virtually nonexistent,'' \n     Borski said. ``Trucks pour over the border there. They may be \n     safe and may be not.''\n       ``Texas has no infrastructure to look at trucks,'' he \n     added. ``During our visit, we were shown two parking spaces \n     for inspecting trucks two at a time with 4,000 trucks per day \n     at that crossing. The out-of-service rate was staggering. \n     Texas Department of Public Safety Major Coy Clanton told us \n     if they looked at seven or eight trucks, they would take five \n     out of service for significant safety violations. I think the \n     key is that a truck that isn't inspected will be neglected. I \n     think that's the biggest danger.''\n       Petri believes the Bush administration has planned for the \n     needed improvements to the truck inspection system.\n       ``President Bush in his budget provided for $100 million to \n     improve inspections at the U.S.-Mexico border,'' Petri said. \n     ``We think they're in the process of replicating California's \n     inspection station in Texas. It will be like anything else. \n     If people know, the word goes out loud and clear that they \n     are going to be inspected, or going to be fined or sent back, \n     they'll get their equipment up to standard very quickly.''\n       Borski agreed the California system should be replicated, \n     but is concerned with the length of time it would take to \n     build such a facility.\n       ``They should set up a system like California's facility, \n     or we shouldn't open the border,'' Borski said. ``It will \n     take at least 18 months to build an inspection station.''\n       ``In California the border is narrow, but in Texas there's \n     maybe 15 crossings with virtually no inspection,'' Borski \n     explained. ``I don't think the border should be open in Texas \n     any farther than that 20-mile radius until we get a better \n     inspection system.''\n       Borski and 30 other representatives are co-sponsoring a \n     resolution to urge the president not to open the border until \n     safety inspection concerns are adequately addressed. ``You \n     can be for NAFTA and still insist on trucks being \n     inspected,'' Borski said. ``It's a safety question, not a \n     trade question.''\n\n\n         Two bills would bar Mexican trucks until they are safe\n\n       The Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association is \n     supporting legislation currently moving through both the U.S. \n     Senate and House targeting truck safety under NAFTA.\n       House Resolution 152, introduced May 24 by U.S. Rep. James \n     Oberstar (D-MN) and Rep. Jack Quinn (R-NY), would delay \n     granting Mexican trucks authority to operate in the U.S. \n     under NAFTA until a prescribed comprehensive plan to ensure \n     their safety is in place. Thirty-one additional lawmakers are \n     listed as original cosponsors of the Oberstar resolution.\n       Sen. Byron Dorgan's (D-ND) bill, introduced May 25, would \n     halt cross-border operations until the Mexican trucks can \n     meet safety standards. SB965 is cosponsored by Sen. Harry \n     Reid (D-NV).\n       ``Only about 1 percent of Mexican trucks entering the \n     United States are inspected by the United States at the \n     border, but 36 percent of those that are inspected are turned \n     back for serious safety violations,'' Sen. Dorgan says. \n     ``Mexico does not have the same safety standards we have in \n     the United States, ``he said as he introduced the bill. \n     ``There are no minimum safety standards for trucks or \n     equipment, no limit on the hours a driver can stay on the \n     road, no drug testing. These trucks will put people on \n     America's highways at serious risk. The American people don't \n     want to drive down the highway and find they are alongside a \n     severely overloaded truck with someone in the driver seat who \n     may have been on the road for 20 hours or more.''\n       Dorgan said ample evidence from California, Nevada and \n     other states documents a significant number of Mexican trucks \n     are regularly turned back at the U.S. Mexico border for \n     serious safety violations, even under the current rules.\n       ``Every day, every hour, these unsafe trucks are coming \n     across our border, and that will only increase if the \n     Administration plans are allowed to go forward,'' he said. \n     Even the Department of Transportation acknowledges its \n     enforcement program, which is seriously under-staffed, cannot \n     assure the safety of Mexican trucks entering the United \n     States.\n       ``The serious shortcomings of trucks from Mexico is a \n     problem that too many lawmakers are ingnoring.'' said OOIDA \n     President Jim Johnston. ``There is a great deal of\n\n[[Page S8089]]\n\n     opposition and concern among many people across the country \n     for the current plan to open the border at the end of this \n     year without appropriate safety measures in place.''\n       OOIDA maintains that, while the Federal Motor Carrier \n     Safety Administration has proposed several rules it claims \n     will allow verification of Mexican carrier compliance with \n     U.S. safety rules, the proposals only touch upon a fraction \n     of the issues raised by the opening of the border. OOIDA \n     points out other issues that will demand increased government \n     supervision will be in the areas of Customs and Immigration, \n     and compliance with all federal and state licensing, \n     registration, permitting, environmental and user fee and tax \n     requirements as every U.S. truck is required to do. Also left \n     unanswered is how to process a Mexican truck or driver in \n     violation of NAFTA trade rules or our safety standards.\n       ``American truckdrivers must comply with enormous numbers \n     of safety rules and regulations to operate legally on our \n     highways,'' OOIDA's Johnston says. ``These include a \n     stringent physical examination and drug and alcohol testing \n     of drivers, truck weight limits, and hours-of-service rules. \n     Mexico does not impose the same rules on their trucks and \n     drivers. It makes no sense, is reckless, and is completely \n     unfair to create exceptions to these rules for Mexican \n     carriers. That's what we will be effectively doing if we open \n     the border before Mexico imposes equivalent rules and we are \n     prepared to ensure their carrier's compliance with them.''\n\n\nOfficial NAFTA plan nearing completion: Democratic Senators ask Bush to \n                       hold off on Mexican trucks\n\n       The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration says the \n     official North American Free Trade Agreement implementation \n     plan is now nearing completion. FMCSA spokesman David Longo \n     expects it to be available in mid-June. Meanwhile, more \n     Washington lawmakers are voicing concerns about cross-border \n     trucking. Fearing a compromise of safe roads, 10 Democratic \n     senators have made the latest news, asking that the plan to \n     allow Mexican trucks full access to U.S. highways be \n     reconsidered.\n       In a letter sent June 11, the senators assured the \n     president they are supporters of NAFTA, but said that \n     granting access to U.S. roads could ``seriously jeopardize \n     highway safety, road conditions and environmental quality.\n       A NAFTA arbitration panel ruled in February that the United \n     States was violating the treaty by not opening the border per \n     provisions of the treaty, and the Bush administration \n     launched a plan to comply. The Bush administration and \n     transportation officials currently are establishing rules for \n     cross-border trucking and want them finished in time to let \n     the trucks operate in the United States before the end of the \n     year. The public has until July 2 to comment on the proposal \n     that would require all Mexican trucks to apply for permission \n     to operate in the United States. A safety audit would be \n     conducted within 18 months, but the senators are concerned \n     about the interim.\n       The letter was signed by Sens. John Kerry (D-MA), Max \n     Baucus (D-MT), Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), Tom Harkin (D-IA), Tom \n     Daschle (D-SD), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Ted Kennedy (D-MA), Evan \n     Bayh (D-IN), Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) and Richard Durbin (D-\n     IL).\n  Mr. SHELBY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Murray). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I rise in support of the Murray \namendment that is pending, as well as the underlying bill. I think \nSenator Murray deserves to be commended because she has taken on what \nis a huge safety issue for the people of our country, and she has done \nit in a way that has been open and transparent and she has listened.\n  I think with the additional amendment that she has at the desk right \nnow--which really, in a sense, adopts a procedure we are using in \nCalifornia to inspect trucks to give them a decal so we know they are \nsafe--adds immeasurably to her language that is already in the \nunderlying bill.\n  I think the subject of NAFTA trucks is a very big issue because it \nisn't a theoretical issue anymore. It is a question of whether these \ntrucks are safe. The Commerce Committee just held a hearing on the \ncoming of the NAFTA trucks through the Mexican border.\n  I am a member of the Commerce Committee, and I will tell you right \nnow, from a lot of hearings, I am relieved that the problem I am \nlooking at is actually not as bad as I thought. In this case, I was far \nfrom relieved. It is much more worrisome, after having heard the \ntestimony of Cabinet Secretary Mineta and the inspector general of the \nDepartment of Transportation.\n  The issue of the safety of what I call the NAFTA trucks is not about \nfree trade, nor is it about protectionism.\n  I know that Senator Murray, who is shepherding this bill through and \nwho is now presiding over the Chamber, is a tremendous advocate of free \ntrade. I think back. I can't truly think of a time when she didn't come \ndown on that side. She is taking the leadership on the safety question. \nThat is really what it is. That is the bottom line.\n  Why should the Senator from California be concerned about this border \ntruck issue? Clearly, my State has about 23 percent of all the NAFTA \ntruck traffic. If it turns out that the trucks coming in are not safe, \nit is going to have a devastating effect on the people of California. \nThat is something that is of great concern to me.\n  In 1999, there were 4.5 million commercial motor vehicles crossing at \nthe California-Mexico border. It is estimated that most of these \ncrosses were made by 80,000 trucks. The opening of the border is \nexpected to increase the number of NAFTA trucks. For example, we have \n190 applications awaiting full access to our highways at the DOT. \nUnless our safety standards are improved and--this is really the big \nword--``enforced,'' the result will be that Californians, whether \ndriving to work, or a soccer mom driving her kids, or whoever happens \nto be in that motor vehicle, will be next to a truck that may not meet \nour standards or that may have a driver who is exhausted. I will \nexplain why that is apt to be the case.\n  If I went along with the Bush administration, I would be putting \nthose people at risk.\n  There is nothing more sacred to an elected official than protecting \nthe health and safety of the people he or she represents.\n  This issue is very important to me. I want to show you a chart, which \nI will summarize. It will be very hard for the Presiding Officer to \nidentify it from there. I will explain why the issue of NAFTA trucks is \nso important.\n  When former Congressman Mineta, now Secretary Mineta, was before the \nCommerce Committee, he said: Don't worry, Senator. We are going to \nenforce our own laws on the Mexican trucks and on the NAFTA trucks as \nthey come through.\n  Then the logical question is, How many of these trucks have been \ninspected to date by the Federal Government? The answer is 2 percent of \nall the trucks that are coming in are being inspected.\n  Then you say: All right. In those inspections, how many of those \ntrucks are passing the safety inspections?\n  The answer is 23 percent.\n  Let me go through that again.\n  The DOT is only inspecting 2 percent of the NAFTA trucks that are \ncoming in across the Mexican border. Out of that, 23 percent failed \ninspection. It could be assumed that is the average that failed the \ninspection. Imagine how many trucks we would catch if we inspected 100 \npercent. How many people are in danger because we are not inspecting \n100 percent? Therefore, those trucks are on the road.\n  Secretary Mineta says: Don't worry, be happy. We are going to put the \nAmerican law into place on these inspections. Yet we don't have the \ninspectors. Oh, they will have them by January, they say.\n  I don't believe it. It isn't going to happen. As a matter of fact, I \nasked: What would happen if California then said in January we are \ntired of spending millions of dollars on our own inspections, and we \nare going to allow the Federal Government to inspect?\n  The inspector general said: We would be in big trouble.\n  Talk about an unfunded mandate, I think California is spending $30 \nmillion or $35 million on an inspection regime that is so good, by the \nway, that Senator Murray takes the decal plan. That is the amendment \nthat is pending. But even with that, how many are we inspecting in \nCalifornia? Also, about 2 percent. We are only inspecting 2 percent of \nthe trucks in California. Everyone says California is doing the best.\n  It is a harrowing issue for all of us. Those trucks are going to wind \nup all over the country--in Illinois and on the east coast. They are \nalready showing up there, by the way. They are breaking the law. They \nare only supposed to go 20 miles from the border. But they\n\n[[Page S8090]]\n\nare breaking through, and they are showing up.\n  How about this for one question--it was actually Senator Allen who \nasked the question of the inspector general: Why don't we just have \nthose trucks turn around and go back to Mexico when they don't pass the \ninspection?\n  Do you know what the inspector general said? Because they have no \nbrakes. They have no brakes.\n  Let me tell you why we have a problem. We have not checked these \ntrucks as they come in. We are inspecting 2 percent. We can't get ready \nto inspect all the trucks by January 1.\n  Now I have a better chart to show you. It is the same thing but a \nlittle bit bigger. This is much better.\n  Here is our problem. In the United States, a truckdriver is allowed \nto drive up to 10 consecutive hours, work up to 15 consecutive hours \nwith a mandatory 8 hours of rest, and cannot drive more than 70 hours \nduring each 8-day period.\n  Some people think that schedule is too harsh. There are issues in our \nown country about driving up to 10 hours consecutively, working up to \n15 consecutive hours with the mandatory 8 hours of rest, and not \ndriving more than 70 hours during each 8-day period. There are some in \nour country, including a lot of the safety experts, who say that we are \ntoo weak; that our drivers are too tired; and that there are too many \naccidents. Yet we are about to allow Mexican trucks in because we can't \nenforce any of this at the border when they have none of these \nrestrictions.\n  Let me repeat. There are no restrictions on Mexican drivers in terms \nof how many hours they have to work and on how many consecutive hours. \nThere is no requirement of rest and no restrictions.\n  If you are only inspecting 2 percent of the trucks at the border, you \napply this, and you find someone who has been driving, say, for 20 \nhours straight, there is really nothing you can do if that individual \njust gets right through the border.\n  We have random drug tests for our drivers. In Mexico, they do not \nhave random drug tests.\n  Medical conditions and qualifications: Absolutely, in the United \nStates, if you have certain medical conditions, you cannot get your \nlicense. In Mexico, there are no such qualifications.\n  The driving age for interstate driving in America is 21. In Mexico, \nit is 18.\n  You are going to have an 18-year-old driving big-rig trucks and not \ngetting any rest, who was never subjected to a random drug test, who \nmight have a medical condition, and who is never disqualified. And \nSecretary Mineta says: Don't worry, be happy; We will catch them at the \nborder. But we do not because we do not have enough inspectors. That is \nwhy Senator Murray's language in the bill is so important because she \nis going to say: Look, we are not putting an arbitrary date on you, but \nyou are not going to do this. You are not going to have this situation \nuntil you are ready to inspect all of these vehicles.\n\n  Let's look at the next chart.\n  Let's compare truck safety regulations. In the United States, there \nare comprehensive standards for components such as antilock brakes, \nunderride guards, night visibility, and front brakes.\n  In Mexico, it is not as strong a test; there are less vigorous tests. \nFor example, front brakes are not required. The maximum weight for a \ntruck in the United States is 80,000 pounds; in Mexico it is 135,000 \npounds.\n  For any of you who know the issue of what happens when these heavy \ntrucks are on our roads in terms of what happens to our roads, we even \nhave troubles today because people are saying our trucks are too heavy. \nIn Mexico, it is a 135,000-pound limit.\n  Hazardous material rules: In America: strict standards, training, \nlicensure, and an inspection regime. In Mexico it is very lax; there \nare fewer identified chemicals and substances and fewer licensure \nrequirements.\n  Roadside inspections--you see those stops where trucks have to pull \nto the side and get inspected--we have them in the United States. They \ndo not have them in Mexico.\n  Why is it important we show these differences? Because people say: We \ndo not have problems with Canada. The thing is, in Canada they have \nregulations like ours. So inspecting all those trucks is not the same \nproblem. When you have free trade between countries that have different \nrules and regulations as to the safety of the trucks, the safety of the \ndrivers, it is a different situation.\n  So the reason we have shown all this to you--and I will again show \nyou the first chart--is because we have drivers coming in our country \nin these NAFTA trucks who may be driving--how many hours consecutively \nin one case?--up to 20 hours without a rest. They were not subjected to \na random drug test in their country. They slip through the border \nbecause we are only inspecting 2 percent of the vehicles. And they \ncould have a medical problem from which, if they had it in this \ncountry, they would have been disqualified. They could be 18 years old.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article that \nappeared in the San Francisco Chronicle.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the San Francisco Chronicle, Mar. 4, 2001]\n\nMexico's Trucks on Horizon: Long-Distance Haulers Are Headed Into U.S. \n                        Once Bush Opens Borders\n\n                          [By Robert Collier]\n\n       Altar Desert, Mexico.--Editor's Note: This week, the Bush \n     administration is required by NAFTA to announce that Mexican \n     long-haul trucks will be allowed onto U.S. highways--where \n     they have long been banned over concerns about safety--rather \n     than stopping at the border. The Chronicle sent a team to get \n     the inside story before the trucks start to roll.\n       It was sometime way after midnight in the middle of \n     nowhere, and a giddy Manuel Marquez was at the wheel of 20 \n     tons of hurtling, U.S.-bound merchandise.\n       The lights of oncoming trucks flared into a blur as they \n     whooshed past on the narrow, two-lane highway, mere inches \n     from the left mirror of his truck. Also gone in a blur were \n     Marquez's past two days, a nearly Olympic ordeal of driving \n     with barely a few hours of sleep.\n       ``Ayy, Mexico!'' Marquez exclaimed as he slammed on the \n     brakes around a hilly curve, steering around another truck \n     that had stopped in the middle of the lane, its hood up and \n     its driver nonchalantly smoking a cigarette. ``We have so \n     much talent to share with the Americans--and so much \n     craziness.''\n       Several hours ahead in the desert darkness was the border, \n     the end of Marzquez's 1,800-mile run. At Tijuana, he would \n     deliver his cargo, wait for another load, then head back \n     south.\n       But soon, Marquez and other Mexican truckers will be able \n     to cross the border instead of turning around. Their feats of \n     long-distance stamina--and, critics fear, endangerment of \n     public safety--are coming to a California freeway near \n     you.\n       Later this week, the Bush administration is expected to \n     announce that it will open America's highways to Mexican \n     long-haul trucks, thus ending a long fight by U.S. truckers \n     and highway safety advocates to keep them out.\n       Under limitations imposed by the United States since 1982, \n     Mexican vehicles are allowed passage only within a narrow \n     border commercial zone, where they must transfer their cargo \n     to U.S.-based long-haul trucks and drivers.\n       The lifting of the ban--ordered last month by an \n     arbitration panel of the North American Free Trade \n     Agreement--has been at the center of one of the most high-\n     decibel issues in the U.S.-Mexico trade relationship.\n       Will the end of the ban endanger American motorists by \n     bringing thousands of potentially unsafe Mexican trucks to \n     U.S. roads? Or will it reduce the costs of cross-border trade \n     and end U.S. protectionism with no increase in accidents?\n       Two weeks ago, as the controversy grew, Marquez's employer, \n     Transportes Castores, allowed a Chronicle reporter and \n     photographer to join him on a typical run from Mexico City to \n     the border.\n       The three-day, 1,800-mile journey offered a window into a \n     part of Mexico that few Americans ever see--the life of \n     Mexican truckers, a resourceful, long-suffering breed who, \n     from all indications, do not deserve their pariah status \n     north of the border.\n       But critics of the border opening would also find proof of \n     their concerns about safety:\n       --American inspectors at the border are badly undermanned \n     and will be hard-pressed to inspect more than a fraction of \n     the incoming Mexican trucks.\n       California--which has a much more rigorous truck inspection \n     program than Arizona, New Mexico or Texas, the other border \n     states--gave full inspections to only 2 percent of the \n     920,000 short-haul trucks allowed to enter from Mexico last \n     year.\n       Critics say the four states will be overwhelmed by the \n     influx of Mexican long-haul trucks, which are expected to \n     nearly double the current volume of truck traffic at the \n     border.\n       --Most long-distance Mexican trucks are relatively modern, \n     but maintenance is erratic.\n\n[[Page S8091]]\n\n       Marquez's truck, for example, was a sleek, 6-month-old, \n     Mexican-made Kenworth, equal to most trucks north of the \n     border. But his windshield was cracked--a safety violation \n     that would earn him a ticket in the United States but had \n     been ignored by his company since it occurred two months ago.\n       A recent report by the U.S. Transportation Department said \n     35 percent of Mexican trucks that entered the United States \n     last year were ordered off the road by inspectors for safety \n     violations such as faulty brakes and lights.\n       --Mexico's domestic truck-safety regulation is extremely \n     lax. Mexico has no functioning truck weigh stations, and \n     Marquez said federal police appear to have abandoned a \n     program of random highway inspections that was inaugurated \n     with much fanfare last fall.\n       --Almost all Mexican long-haul drivers are forced to work \n     dangerously long hours.\n       Marquez was a skillful driver, with lightning reflexes \n     honed by road conditions that would make U.S. highways seem \n     like cruise-control paradise. But he was often steering \n     through a thick fog of exhaustion.\n       In Mexico, no logbooks--required in the United States to \n     keep track of hours and itinerary--are kept. Marquez slept a \n     total of only seven hours during his three-day trip.\n       ``We're just like American trucks, I'm sure,'' Marquez said \n     with a grin. ``We're neither saints nor devils. But we're \n     good drivers, that's for sure, or we'd all be dead.''\n       Although no reliable statistics exist for the Bay Area's \n     trade with Mexico, it is estimated that the region's exports \n     and imports with Mexico total $6 billion annually. About 90 \n     percent of that amount moves by truck, in ten of thousands of \n     round trips to and from the border.\n       Under the decades-old border restrictions, long-haul trucks \n     from either side must transfer their loads to short-haul \n     ``drayage'' truckers, who cross the border and transfer the \n     cargo again to long-haul domestic trucks. The complicated \n     arrangement is costly and time-consuming, making imported \n     goods more expensive for U.S. consumers.\n       Industry analysts say that after the ban is lifted, most of \n     the two nations' trade will be done by Mexican drivers, who \n     come much cheaper than American truckers because they earn \n     only about one-third the salary and typically drive about 20 \n     hours per day.\n       Although Mexican truckers would have to obey the U.S. legal \n     limit of 10 hours consecutive driving when in the United \n     States, safety experts worry that northbound drivers will be \n     so sleep-deprived by the time they cross the border that the \n     American limit will be meaningless. Mexican drivers would \n     not, however, be bound by U.S. labor laws, such as the \n     minimum wage.\n       ``Are you going to be able to stay awake?'' Marcos Munoz, \n     vice president of Transportes Castores jokingly asked a \n     Chronicle reporter before the trip. ``Do you want some \n     pingas?''\n       The word is slang for uppers, the stimulant pills that are \n     commonly used by Mexican truckers. Marquez, however, needed \n     only a few cups of coffee to stay awake through three \n     straight 21-hour days at the wheel.\n       Talking with his passengers, chatting on the CB radio with \n     friends, and listening to tapes of 1950s and 1960s ranchera \n     and bolero music, he showed few outward signs of fatigue.\n       But the 46-year-old Marquez, who has been a trucker for 25 \n     years, admitted that the burden occasionlly is too much.\n       ``Don't kid yourself,'' he said late the third night. \n     ``Sometimes, you get so tired, so worn, your head just \n     falls.''\n       U.S. highway safety groups predict an increase in accidents \n     after the border is opened.\n       ``Even now, there aren't enough safety inspectors available \n     for all crossing points,'' said David Golden, a top official \n     of the National Association of Independent Insurers, the \n     main insurance-industry lobby.\n       ``So we need to make sure that when you're going down \n     Interstate 5 with an 80,000-pound Mexican truck in your \n     rearview mirror and you have to jam on your brakes, that \n     truck doesn't come through your window.''\n       Golden said the Bush administration should delay the \n     opening to Mexican trucks until border facilities are \n     upgraded.\n       California highway safety advocates concur, saying the \n     California Highway Patrol--which carries out the state's \n     truck inspections--needs to be given more inspectors and \n     larger facilities to check incoming trucks' brakes, lights \n     and other safety functions.\n       Marquez's trip started at his company's freight yard in \n     Tlalnepantla, an industrial suburb of Mexico City. There, his \n     truck was loaded with a typical variety of cargo--electronic \n     components and handicrafts bound for Los Angeles, and \n     chemicals, printing equipment and industrial parts for \n     Tijuana.\n       At the compound's gateway was a shrine with statues of the \n     Virgin Mary and Jesus. As he drove past, Marquez crossed \n     himself, then crossed himself again before the small Virgin \n     on his dashboard.\n       ``Just in case, you know,'' he said. ``The devil is always \n     on the loose on these roads.''\n       In fact, Mexican truckers have to brave a wise variety of \n     dangers.\n       As he drove through the high plateaus of central Mexico, \n     Marquez pointed out where he was hijacked a year ago--held up \n     at gunpoint by robbers who pulled alongside him in another \n     truck. His trailer full of canned tuna--easy to fence, he \n     said--was stolen, along with all his personal belongings.\n       What's worse, some thieves wear uniforms.\n       On this trip, the truck had to pass 14 roadblocks, at which \n     police and army soldiers searched the cargo for narcotics. \n     Each time, Marquez stood on tiptoes to watch over their \n     shoulders. He said, ``You have to have quick eyes, or they'll \n     take things out of the packages.''\n       Twice, police inspectors asked for bribes--``something for \n     the coffee,'' they said. Each time, he refused and got away \n     with it.\n       ``You're good luck for me,'' he told a Chronicle reporter. \n     ``They ask for money but then see an American and back off. \n     Normally, I have to pay a lot.''\n       Although the Mexican government has pushed hard to end the \n     border restrictions, the Mexican trucking industry is far \n     from united behind that position. Large trucking companies \n     such as Transportes Castores back the border opening, while \n     small and medium-size ones oppose it.\n       ``We're ready for the United States, and we'll be driving \n     to Los Angeles and San Francisco,'' said Munoz, the company's \n     vice president.\n       ``Our trucks are modern and can pass the U.S. inspections. \n     Only about 10 companies here could meet the U.S. standards.''\n       The border opening has been roundly opposed by CANACAR, the \n     Mexican national trucking industry association, which says it \n     will result in U.S. firms taking over Mexico's trucking \n     industry.\n       ``The opening will allow giant U.S. truck firms to buy \n     large Mexican firms and crush smaller ones,'' said Miguel \n     Quintanilla, CANACAR's president. ``We're at a disadvantage, \n     and those who benefit will be the multinationals.''\n       Quintanilla said U.S. firms will lower their current costs \n     by replacing their American drivers with Mexicans, yet will \n     use the huge American advantages--superior warehouse and \n     inventory-tracking technology, superior access to financing \n     and huge economies of scale--to drive Mexican companies out \n     of business.\n       Already, some U.S. trucking giants such as M.S. Carriers, \n     Yellow Corp. and Consolidated Freightways Corp. have invested \n     heavily in Mexico.\n       ``The opening of the border will bring about the \n     consolidation of much of the trucking industry on both sides \n     of the border,'' said the leading U.S. academic expert on \n     NAFTA trucking issues, James Giermanski, a professor at \n     Belmont Abbey College in Raleigh, N.C.\n       The largest U.S. firms will pair with large Mexican firms \n     and will dominate U.S.-Mexico traffic, he said.\n       But Giermanski added that the increase in long-haul cross-\n     border traffic will be slower than either critics or \n     advocates expect, because of language difficulties, Mexico's \n     inadequate insurance coverage and Mexico's time-consuming \n     system of customs brokers.\n       ``All the scare stories you've heard are just ridiculous,'' \n     he said. ``The process will take a long time.''\n       In California, many truckers fear for their jobs. However, \n     Teamsters union officials say they are trying to persuade \n     their members that Marquez and his comrades are not the \n     enemy.\n       ``There will be a very vehement reaction by our members if \n     the border is opened,'' said Chuck Mack, president of \n     Teamsters Joint Council 7, which has 55,000 members in the \n     Bay Area.\n       ``But we're trying to diminish the animosity that by \n     focusing on the overall problem--how (the opening) will help \n     multinational corporations to exploit drivers on both sides \n     of the border.''\n       Mexican drivers, however, are likely to welcome the \n     multinationals' increased efficiency, which will enable them \n     to earn more by wasting less time waiting for loading and \n     paperwork.\n       For example, in Mexico City, Marquez had to wait more than \n     four hours for stevedores to load his truck and for clerks to \n     prepare the load's documents--a task that would take perhaps \n     an hour for most U.S. trucking firms.\n       For drivers, time is money. Marquez's firm pays drivers a \n     percentage of gross freight charges, minus some expenses. His \n     three-day trip would net him about $300. His average monthly \n     income is about $1,400--decent money in Mexico, but by no \n     means middle class.\n       Most Mexican truckers are represented by a union, but it is \n     nearly always ineffectual--what Transportes Castores \n     executives candidly described as a ``company union.'' A few \n     days before this trip, Transportes Castores fired 20 drivers \n     when they protested delays in reimbursement of fuel costs.\n       But Marquez didn't much like talking about his problems. He \n     preferred to discuss his only child, a 22-year-old daughter \n     who is in her first year of undergraduate medical school in \n     Mexico City.\n       Along with paternal pride was sadness.\n       ``Don't congratulate me,'' he said. ``My wife is the one \n     who raised her. I'm gone most of the time. You have to have a \n     very strong marriage, because this job is hell on a wife.\n       ``The money is OK, and I really like being out on the open \n     road, but the loneliness . . .'' He left the thought \n     unfinished, and turned up the volume on his cassette deck.\n       It was playing Pedro Infante, the famous bolero balladeer, \n     and Marquez began to sing.\n       ``The moon of my nights has hidden itself.\n       ``On little heavenly virgin, I am your son.\n       ``Give me your consolation,\n       ``Today, when I'm suffering out in the world.''\n       Despite the melancholy tone, Marquez soon became jovial and \n     energetic. He smiled\n\n[[Page S8092]]\n\n     widely and encouraged his passengers to sing along. Forgoing \n     his normal caution, he accelerated aggressively on the \n     curves.\n       His voice rose, filling the cabin, drowning out the hiss of \n     the pavement below and the rush of the wind that was blowing \n     him inexorably toward the border.\n\n\n               How NAFTA Ended the Ban On Mexico's Trucks\n\n       The North American Free Trade Agreement, which went into \n     effect in January 1994, stipulated that the longtime U.S. \n     restrictions on Mexican trucks be lifted.\n       Under NAFTA, by December 1995, Mexican trucks would be \n     allowed to deliver loads all over the four U.S. border \n     states--California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas--and to \n     pick up loads for their return trip to Mexico. U.S. trucking \n     firms would get similar rights to travel in Mexico. And by \n     January 2000, Mexican trucks would be allowed throughout \n     the United States.\n       However, bowing to pressure from the Teamsters union and \n     the insurance industry, President Clinton blocked \n     implementation of the NAFTA provisions. The Mexican \n     government retaliated by imposing a similar ban on U.S. \n     trucks.\n       As a result, the longtime status quo continues: Trucks from \n     either side must transfer their loads to short-haul \n     ``drayage'' truckers, who cross the border and transfer the \n     cargo again to long-haul domestic trucks.\n       The complicated arrangement is time-consuming and \n     expensive. Mexico estimates its losses at $2 billion \n     annually; U.S. shippers say they have incurred similar costs.\n       In 1998, Mexico filed a formal complaint under NAFTA, \n     saying the U.S. ban violated the trade pact and was mere \n     protectionism. The convoluted complaint process lasted nearly \n     six years, until a three-person arbitration panel finally \n     ruled Feb. 6 that the United States must lift its ban by \n     March 8 or allow Mexico to levy punitive tariffs on U.S. \n     exports.\n\n\n                     COMPARING TRUCKING REGULATIONS\n\n       The planned border opening to Mexican trucks will pose a \n     big challenge to U.S. inspectors, who will check to be sure \n     that trucks from Mexico abide by stricter U.S. truck-safety \n     regulations. Here are some of the differences:\n     Hours-of-service limits for drivers\n       In U.S.: Yes. Ten hours' consecutive driving, up to 15 \n     consecutive hours on duty, 8 hours' consecutive rest, maximum \n     of 70 hours' driving in eight-day period.\n       In Mexico: No.\n     Driver's age\n       In U.S.: 21 is minimum for interstate trucking.\n       In Mexico: 18.\n     Random drug test\n       In U.S.: Yes, for all drivers.\n       In Mexico: No.\n     Automatic disqualification for certain medical conditions\n       In U.S.: Yes.\n       In Mexico: No.\n     Logbooks\n       In U.S.: Yes. Standaridized logbooks with date graphs are \n     required and part of inspection criteria.\n       In Mexico: a new law requiring logbooks is not enforced, \n     and virtually no truckers use them.\n     Maximum weight limit (in pounds)\n       In U.S.: 80,000.\n       In Mexico: 135,000.\n     Roadside inspections\n       In U.S.: Yes.\n       In Mexico: An inspection program began last year but has \n     been discontinued.\n     Out-of-service rules for safety deficiencies\n       In U.S.: Yes.\n       In Mexico: Not currently. Program to be phased in over two \n     years.\n     Hazardous materials regulations\n       In U.S.: A strict standards, training, licensure and \n     inspection regime.\n       In Mexico: Much laxer program with far fewer identified \n     chemicals and substances, and fewer licensure requirements.\n     Vehicle safety standards\n       In U.S.: Comprehensive standards for components such as \n     antilock brakes, underride guards, night visibility of \n     vehicle.\n       In Mexico: Newly enacted standards for vehicle inspections \n     are voluntary for the first year and less rigorous than U.S. \n     rules.\n\n  (Mr. DURBIN assumed the chair.)\n  Mrs. BOXER. It goes through the story of a driver who came across the \nborder and who was completely exhausted. The article says:\n\n       It was sometime way after midnight in the middle of \n     nowhere, and a giddy [truck driver] was at the wheel of 20 \n     tons of hurtling, U.S.-bound merchandise.\n       The lights of oncoming trucks flared into a blur as they \n     whooshed past on the narrow, two-lane highway, mere inches \n     from the left mirror of his truck.

The title of it is ``Mexico's Trucks on \nHorizon, Long-distance haulers are headed into U.S. once Bush opens \nborders.''\n  What the Murray language does in this bill is make sure, before this \ndriver gets through the checkpoint, we can test him, we can talk to \nhim, and we can tell him to get a rest. We can inspect his truck and \nsee whether it meets the standards. That is why it is so important.\n  Quoting from the article:\n\n       A recent report by the U.S. Transportation Department said \n     35 percent of Mexican trucks that entered the United States \n     last year were ordered off the road. . . .\n\n  I was told 25 percent, but it looks like it is 35 percent of the \ntrucks were ordered off the road.\n  Now remember, we are only inspecting a couple percent, but out of \nthat 35 percent were ordered off the road.\n  In Mexico, no logbooks are required. They are required in the United \nStates. The driver has to keep track of his hours and itinerary.\n  It says this driver slept a total of 7 hours during his 3-day trip.\n  I know that young people have good instincts, but I would say, if \nsomebody sleeps for 7 hours on a 3-day trip, I do not want them driving \nnext to a family in Washington State or Illinois or California or \nanywhere on our highways. It is a disaster waiting to happen.\n  The Murray amendment is very important--the one pending--and the \nunderlying language in the bill to make sure there is not a premature \nrush to say open the borders, everyone is coming in, until we have done \ncertain important things. And those things are outlined in the Murray \nbill. I am going to go through what they are.\n  The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration must perform a full \nsafety compliance review of the Mexican truck company, and it must give \nthe Mexican truck company a satisfactory rating. And now with the added \ndecal, we know those trucks will be inspected every 90 days. Federal \nand State inspectors must verify electronically the status and validity \nof the license of each driver of a Mexican truck crossing the border. \nIt goes on.\n  We are going to make sure, before we open up this border completely--\nand right now what we are doing is we are allowing those trucks to \ndrive just 20 miles from the border--before we open them up completely, \nthey will be safe.\n  They talk about, in this article, the fact that these drivers are \ntaking stimulant pills. In this particular case, the driver said he did \nnot do that; he just needed a few cups of coffee to stay awake.\n  Actually, before this reporter went on this long-haul trip with the \ndriver--\n\n       [The] vice president of Transportes Castores jokingly asked \n     a Chronicle reporter . . . ``Do you want some pingas?''\n\n  ``Pingas'' is slang for ``uppers.'' So they did not even hide the \nfact that their drivers are using these pills.\n  Then the driver is quoted--this is really an incredible story; that \nis why I put it in the Record--as saying: ``Don't kid yourself.'' He \nsaid this late on the third night. ``Sometimes you get so tired, so \nworn, your head just falls.'' ``Your head just falls.''\n  So here the driver is coming in because of a free trade agreement, \nand the President of the United States, George Bush, has said he is \npicking a January 1 start date for them to have complete access to our \nhighways. And if it was not for the Murray language, I will tell you, I \nthink I would--there is an expression of throwing yourself in front of \na truck--I would not go that far, but I would certainly use every \nlegislative tool I had to stop that from happening because we know how \ndangerous it is.\n  The driver says--he has a religious statue in his truck-- ``Just in \ncase, you know. The devil is always on the loose on these roads.''\n  They talk about the wide variety of dangers that these drivers face.\n  So I would just have to say, in conclusion, that we have a very \nimportant set of standards that we have developed in our country for \nboth drivers and for the trucks they drive. Therefore, when we allow a \nwhole other set of trucks and a whole other set of drivers into our \nNation, where, in that country, they have nowhere near our standards \nfor the drivers and the trucks, we have to make sure that we can, in \nfact, check those trucks and check those drivers to make sure that we \nare not putting our citizens at risk.\n  People who are for 100-percent free trade always say: Cheap goods, \ncheap goods for our people. And in many cases, it is true. But I will \ntell you, if you start losing a life on the road, and\n\n[[Page S8093]]\n\nmore lives than 1 or 2 or 10 or 100 or 1,000, it does not matter if you \nhave a cheap T-shirt or a cheap appliance, or anything, if you cannot \nlive long enough to enjoy it.\n  So to those free trade advocates who absolutely come to this \nChamber--and there is nothing they will see that will take them off \ntheir blind path of free trade--let me just simply say to them: You \nbetter imagine what could happen if we have a series of accidents where \ntrucks do not have brakes, where drivers are exhausted and they are \nfalling asleep at the wheel, where the trucks weigh 135,000 pounds, \nswaying on our freeways. This is crazy. In the name of free trade and \nGeorge Bush's decision that January 1 is the magic date--not on my \nwatch, Mr. President. Twenty-three percent of those trucks come into \nCalifornia. Not on my watch.\n\n  Now, the House took more drastic action-- I would go so far as to \nsupport that--which simply says we are cutting off the money until we \nbelieve we are ready for this influx of trucks. Good for them over \nthere. They are right. This is that dangerous. Once we have our regime \nin place, once we have these trucks inspected, once these drivers live \nby our rules, once we have enough enforcement, once we are ginned up at \nthe border to do this right, I will be the first one here saying: good \nwork, let's go.\n  But my colleagues ought to listen to the IG and his comments about \nhow ill-prepared we are as of this date to accept this kind of influx.\n  So until we can guarantee the safety of these trucks and the \ncondition of these drivers, until we can make those promises to our \npeople, then I say that free access beyond that 20-mile border should \nnot be granted. And until the Murray language is really carried out, I \nam going to do everything I can to make sure we do not allow in these \nkinds of truckdrivers who can barely keep their heads up. I am \noptimistic that our friends in Mexico will eventually adopt more \nrigorous standards. I am confident we will eventually be able to have \ndrivers who are, in fact, not exhausted and not popping pills trying to \nkeep awake. Eventually, it will happen. It will be good.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend if he has a question.\n  (Mr. EDWARDS assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I followed the Senator's statement. I am \nglad she made this a part of the Record. I hope she believes, as I do, \nthat the chair of this important Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator \nMurray, has included very valuable language in this legislation which \nwill establish some standards once and for all in terms of Mexican \ntrucks coming across the border into the United States.\n  I would like to ask the Senator from California the following \nquestion. Recently, the Ambassador of Mexico came to my office and we \ntalked about the truck issue. I said to him: Will your country, Mexico, \nagree that whatever trucks you send across the borders and whatever \ntruckdrivers you send across the borders, they will meet the same \nstandards of safety and competence as American trucks and American \ndrivers? He said: Yes, we will agree to that standard.\n  I ask the Senator from California, based on the experience in \nCalifornia, whether that has happened, whether or not she has found in \nthe inspection that the drivers and the trucks meet the standard of \ncompetency and safety that we require of American trucks and American \ntruckdrivers.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Unfortunately, I say to my friend, it has been a \ndisaster. Although we have inspected approximately 2 percent of the \ntrucks coming across, out of those, 35 percent have failed. They have \nfailed the inspection, which means that either the driver doesn't meet \nour standards--he may be 18 years old or may have a medical condition--\nor the truck itself fails--maybe it is 135,000 pounds or more than the \n80,000 pounds.\n  Prior to my friend walking in, I said I strongly support what Senator \nMurray is doing. I would even go further. I am glad her amendment takes \nus further. I commend her for what she has done. In terms of what the \ngentlemen told you in your office, if they have made that change, it is \nnot a fact in evidence up until this point.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I also ask the Senator from California this, if she will \nfurther yield for a question. What the Senator is seeking, as I \nunderstand it, is at least the enforcement that Senator Murray has \nincluded in this Transportation appropriation bill, which includes, if \nI am not mistaken--and I stand to be corrected if I am--that we would \nin fact go into Mexico to the trucking firms, see these trucking firms, \ninspect their trucks in Mexico, understand the standards they are using \nfor hiring drivers and the like; secondly, that all of the trucks \ncoming in from Mexico would be subject to inspection in the United \nStates.\n  It is my understanding, from Senator Murray's bill, that of the 27 \npoints of entry in the United States, there are only 2 currently \ninspecting trucks on a 24-hour basis--2 out of 27. So we have a system \nwhere, frankly, many thousands of trucks come in from Mexico without \nthe most basic inspection in terms of safety.\n  I ask the Senator from California if she believes this would move us \ntoward our goal of having safer trucks and truckdrivers coming in from \nMexico.\n  Mrs. BOXER. There is no question. Under the Murray language, she is \nvery clear to state that the Federal Motor Carrier Administration must \nperform a full safety compliance review of the Mexican truck company, \nand it must give the Mexican truck company a satisfactory rating before \ngranting conditional or permanent authority outside the commercial \nzone--meaning that 20-mile zone--and the review must take place onsite \nat the Mexican truck company's facility. That is absolutely accurate.\n  Again, the best of all worlds would be--and it would be terrific--if \nin Mexico they upgraded their laws to conform with American laws. We \ncannot force that, but I say as a friend of Mexico--a good friend--that \nis what they ought to do because then their people would be safer and \nwe would not have to have all of this enforcement activity. But until \nthey have brought their laws up to our level in terms of the trucks and \ndrivers, we must enforce.\n  What I like about the Murray amendment--and I understand Senator \nShelby had a hand in this amendment, and I thank him from the bottom of \nmy heart because 23 percent of that traffic comes right into my State. \nWithout this amendment--and just setting an arbitrary date is a \nfrightening thought--all these trucks would be coming in and we can \nonly inspect 2 or 3 percent of them. God knows, we all fear what could \nhappen in our States--a devastating accident with trucks that don't \nhave brakes, drivers who have fallen asleep at the wheel, et cetera.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator for taking the floor and bringing \nthis to our attention. We all encourage a free market economy and \nbargaining, but we don't want to bargain health and safety. We draw a \nline there. We hold other countries to the same standards to which we \nhold American trucking companies and American truckdrivers. Senators \nMurray and Shelby have, I think, included language that moves us toward \nthat goal.\n  I thank the Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Durbin for entering into \nthis colloquy, and, again, I thank Senators Murray and Shelby, and also \nSenator Dorgan, who has been working hard on the Commerce Committee. I \nalso thank Senator Fritz Hollings, who, at my request in the Commerce \nCommittee, did hold a hearing on this issue of NAFTA trucks. It was an \neye-opener for us all. When you hear an inspector general talk about \nhow a lot of these trucks don't have any brakes and they are trying to \nget into our country, that is a very frightening thought.\n  In conclusion, for those people who are free trade advocates--and my \nrecord on trade is I am for fair trade, which leads me to sometimes \nsupport trade agreements and sometimes not to. But for those who say \n``free trade at any price,'' let me tell you this is too high a price \nto pay. If you want to deal a blow to free trade, work against the \nMurray-Shelby amendment. If you work against that language in this \nbill, and we have a situation where this President can open up this \nborder and we start to have a series of tragic accidents, I will tell \nyou, that will be the biggest setback for free trade. You really want \nto advance free and fair trade and support this decal language in the \namendment pending and support the language in the underlying bill.\n\n[[Page S8094]]\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak today about two amendments that I have \nfiled and will call up later. I recognize now we are dealing with an \namendment concerning the trucks from Mexico. I wish to speak about a \ndifferent issue, and that is something that is tucked into the Senate \nappropriations bill that deals with aviation in the Greater Chicago \narea.\n  I have been working with my colleague, Senator Durbin, almost since \nthe day I came to the Senate, to find a resolution to the air traffic \nproblems in the Chicago area. Senator Durbin has included language in \nthe appropriations bill, as it was reported from the Transportation \nAppropriations Subcommittee, that addresses aviation transportation in \nthe Chicago area.\n  This is the language that appears in this fiscal year 2002 \nTransportation appropriations bill concerning the Chicago-area \naviation: Section 315 says:\n\n       The Secretary of Transportation shall, in cooperation with \n     the Federal Aviation Administrator, encourage a locally \n     developed and executed plan between the State of Illinois, \n     the City of Chicago, and affected communities for the purpose \n     of modernizing O'Hare International Airport, addressing \n     traffic congestion along the Northwest Corridor including \n     western airport access, and moving forward with a third \n     Chicago-area airport. If such a plan cannot be developed and \n     executed by said parties, the Secretary and the Administrator \n     shall work with Congress to enact a Federal solution to \n     address the aviation capacity crisis in the Chicago area.\n\n  In Chicago, aviation is the No. 1 issue. In fact, throughout northern \nIllinois, that is what my constituents are talking about. O'Hare \nAirport, which is one of the finest airports in the world, has been at \ncapacity since 1969, and in recent years the traffic congestion has \ngotten worse than ever. I attribute a lot of that to a decision \nCongress made 2 years ago to lift the delay controls at LaGuardia and \nChicago O'Hare Airports. After they lifted the delay controls which had \nbeen in effect since 1969, we started to see delays at O'Hare and \nLaGuardia go up exponentially.\n  As a result of those delays, now many people are trapped waiting on \nthe tarmac at O'Hare and LaGuardia for their planes to take off. In \nfact, when I returned to Washington on Sunday evening, I was trapped on \na United Airlines plane on the tarmac at O'Hare for at least 2 hours. I \ndid not get into Washington until close to midnight.\n  This is becoming the norm that people experience as they travel \nthrough O'Hare, particularly in the summer months. Often, as we know, \nthose airplanes are very uncomfortable, particularly in the hot \nweather, while you are waiting on the tarmac at O'Hare.\n  Last night, Senator Durbin's office and my office had a softball game \non The Mall. I am much chagrined to report that Senator Durbin's office \nbeat us by one run. I think the score was 9-8. But if we had been able \nto take one of the 22- or 23-year-old interns off Senator Durbin's team \nand substitute that star athlete with Senator Durbin, as my team was \nrequired to have me play, my team might have been more competitive. But \nSenator Durbin spent, I believe, 3 hours on the tarmac at O'Hare \nyesterday and was unable to make that game. This is how it is when you \ntravel through O'Hare.\n  I compliment Senator Durbin on being active in trying to resolve the \nproblems. Clearly, we are both interested in finding a solution, though \nwe may have a different perspective on the solution.\n\n  One of the amendments I will later offer will add language to this \nsection 315 that encourages any Federal, State, or local solution that \ncomes out of this process to consider using the Rockford Airport.\n  Rockford is, I believe, the second largest community in the State of \nIllinois. It is on the Northwest Tollway, northwest of the city of \nChicago. The Northwest Tollway runs from the Chicago loop out to O'Hare \nAirport and then it goes beyond, out to Rockford Airport.\n  Rockford Airport, which I visited a few weeks ago, is right now not \nbeing used, even though it is a wonderful facility with annual capacity \nfor 237,000 operations a year. The airport has two magnificent runways: \none 10,000 feet, another 8,200 feet. Right now the airport is being \nused for cargo operations. It is a hub for United Parcel Service, and \nthey have been doing very well right there.\n  There is no reason the Rockford Airport should not be used to \nalleviate air traffic congestion in Chicago. Many of the solutions that \nothers have proposed--expanding or modernizing O'Hare, tearing it up, \nrebuilding it so it can handle more flights, or building a third \nairport--those may all someday come to fruition, but all of those \nsolutions will take years, if they ever happen at all, and they will \ncost hundreds of millions, even billions, many billions of dollars.\n  Meanwhile, just outside O'Hare, we have a fabulous airport that is \nalready built, that does not require the expenditure of any money to \nget it used to alleviate air traffic congestion at O'Hare. The airport \nis being used sometimes to land planes from Midway or O'Hare when there \nis bad weather in the area and those planes have to land.\n  This chart is a schematic of the Greater Rockford Airport. We can see \nthere are two runways that are already built, a 10,000-foot runway and \nan 8,200-foot runway. They also have plans for a future runway someday. \nTheir passenger terminal is capable of handling 500,000 passengers per \nyear. Their runways are state of the art. They have even, I am told, \nlanded the Concorde at Rockford Airport. As far as I know, this airport \nis able to land any plane flying today.\n  It is superior in that respect--at least its runways are--to \nChicago's Midway Airport, which was the busiest airport in the world \nbefore O'Hare was built in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The runways \nat Midway are only about 6,000 feet, and it makes it very difficult to \nhave long-haul operations out of Midway.\n  I am going to offer language to section 315 that would encourage the \nuse of Rockford. This is the wise thing to do for aviation consumers in \nthe Chicago area and especially for the taxpayers, but it will not cost \nany money.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator object to my being shown as a cosponsor \nto the amendment?\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I agree to that, Mr. President.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I make that unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will further yield for a question, would \nthe Senator not agree that when it comes to this Rockford Airport--we \nmay have disagreements on O'Hare; we may have disagreements about other \nairports; but we are in agreement that Rockford has an extraordinary \nfacility currently not utilized by any commercial air carrier. Senator \nFitzgerald has contacted airlines and I have contacted them as well.\n  My understanding is one of the major airlines in our country visited \nRockford this week. We all believe this is a resource that should be \navailable, no matter what we do in Chicago with O'Hare or even in \nPeotone. We are 5 to 10 years away from seeing any significant change. \nIn the meantime, Rockford is a resource that should be examined and \nutilized to try to reduce congestion and delays at O'Hare and to \nprovide quality air service to the people living in and around the \nRockford area.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I thank my colleague from Illinois. I thank Senator \nDurbin for joining as an original cosponsor of this amendment and also \nfor working with me. This is absolutely one of the bright spots on the \naviation picture in Illinois today, one of the issues on which we hope \nto agree. It is one of the wonders of the world, in my judgment, that \nRockford is not being used right now when it is so close to O'Hare. It \nis an easy answer, in my judgment, to alleviating traffic congestion at \nO'Hare.\n  I wish to point out a few things. In addition, there are 740,000 \npeople living\n\n[[Page S8095]]\n\nand working within 25 miles of Rockford Airport. Beyond that, there are \n2.2 million people living within a 45-minute drive of Rockford Airport. \nThere are probably not that many large cities in this country that \nwould have that many people within a 45-minute drive of their airport.\n  Another point I have not made is that over 400,000 airline passengers \na year depart from Rockford's market service area via bus to access the \nair transportation system at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. \nBoth American and United Airlines, which control almost all the \noperations at O'Hare, run several passenger shuttle buses to the \nRockford Airport every day and funnel from there 400,000 passengers a \nyear into their hub operation at O'Hare. That further congests O'Hare. \nIn addition, I am told 800,000 people a year drive their cars from the \nRockford area to get to O'Hare. There are 1.2 million people coming \nfrom the Rockford Airport--not using the Rockford Airport but coming \nout of Rockford to further congest O'Hare. It makes common sense we \nmake greater use of the Rockford Airport.\n  I see Senator Gramm is on the floor. I told him I would be happy to \nallow him to speak for a few minutes. With the approval of the Chair, I \nwould like to come back and continue my discussion of Chicago aviation \nafter Senator Gramm has had an opportunity to speak.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask for 2 minutes on this issue?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we now will be addressing the issue of \nMexican carriers. It is going to be, I assure the managers, a subject \nof extended debate. We believe also that we will have sufficient votes \nto sustain a Presidential veto if it comes to that.\n  The Senator from Texas and I will be speaking on the substance of \nvarious amendments we will have. We expect, unfortunately, extended \ndiscussion on this issue.\n  I wish to discuss the lack of negotiation on this issue. The Senator \nfrom Washington and the Senator from Alabama have refused to sit down \nand talk to us about this issue. I am deeply disappointed in that. I \nhave done a lot of business on the floor of the Senate recently on some \nvery difficult issues. On each of those occasions we have at least had \na dialog in negotiations to see if we could not find common ground. \nUnfortunately, the managers of the bill have not allowed such a \ndiscussion or debate.\n  I say to the Senator from Washington, I worked closely with her on an \nissue very important to her and her State because of a tragedy that \ntook place on pipeline safety. No, I didn't always agree with the \nSenator from Washington, but we sat down and we worked together at \nhearings before the committee. I tell the Senator from Washington, I am \nvery disappointed neither she nor her staff would sit down and discuss \nthis issue with us so we could try to attempt to find common ground. I \ndon't think we need a confrontation on this issue. I don't think the \ndifferences between the so-called Murray language and what the Senator \nfrom Texas and I are doing are that far apart. Now we have had to get \nthe White House involved, the threat of a Presidential veto, and \nextended debate on this issue.\n  I ask again the managers of the bill: Could we please have a \ndiscussion and at least find common ground on this issue? So far, there \nhas been an adamant refusal to enter into a discussion. I must say, I \nam very disappointed, especially on an issue of this importance, at \nleast in my view, to the people of my State as well as the people of \nthis country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me give an outline of where we are and how we got \nhere. I will be happy to yield the floor and let the distinguished \nsubcommittee chairman speak.\n  The House of Representatives, following a policy of the Clinton \nadministration, voted to deny the President the ability to implement \nNAFTA. I remind my colleagues that we entered into an agreement with \nMexico and Canada to form the North American Free Trade Agreement and \nto form the largest free trade area in the world. Part of that \nagreement was to have free trade not just in goods but in services. \nPart of that agreement is we set a timetable during which we would \nallow trucks to cross the border within a certain distance for border-\ntype trade and then we would set up a phase-in process whereby trucks \ncould go back and forth across the border between Mexico and Canada, \nMexico and the United States, the same way they do between the United \nStates and Canada.\n  The deadline for that agreement to be fully implemented was on the \nverge of passing when George Bush became President. He made it clear in \nthe campaign and he made it clear when he became President that he felt \nobligated to live up to the agreements we had made with Mexico and \nCanada in NAFTA. Those agreements gave us the ability to set safety \nstandards with regard to Mexican trucks that basically were similar to \nwhat we have with Canadian trucks and our own trucks. It did not give \nus the ability to have discriminatory standards.\n  The Teamsters Union had consistently opposed the implementation of \nthis agreement. They opposed it, and President Clinton refused to begin \nthe phase-in process, refused to start the inspection process, and now \nwe are down to the moment of truth as to whether we are going to live \nup to the agreement we made in NAFTA.\n  I remind my colleagues, as tempting as it is for our own advantage, \nat least our perceived political advantage, to go back on the \ncommitment we made to NAFTA--first of all, in doing so we are \ndiscriminating against our Mexican neighbor because we are treating \nthem differently than we are treating our Canadian neighbors.\n  Secondly, all over the world, legislative bodies are debating whether \nor not to go back on agreements they have made with the United States. \nOne of reasons I feel so strongly about this issue, I believe the \ncredibility of the American nation is on the line as to whether we will \nlive up to the agreement we have made.\n  Now, there is no question about the fact that the White House, after \nhaving an absolute prohibition on the implementation of the treaty in \nthe House, the White House was delighted to see a similar action not \ntaken in the Appropriations Committee. In that case, it was the lesser \nof what they perceived to be the two evils.\n  The problem is, when we look at the amendment currently in this bill, \nthere are several provisions that clearly violate NAFTA, several of \nthem violate GATT, and all of them represent a procedure whereby we \ntreat Mexico very differently than we treat Canada.\n  Let me give three examples of provisions in the bill that clearly \nviolate NAFTA.\n  The first is a provision in the bill that requires that Mexican \ntrucks be insured by American insurers--not just insurers who are \nlicensed in the United States but insurers who are domiciled in the \nUnited States. That is a clear violation of NAFTA and a clear violation \nof GATT because it basically denies national treatment standards to \nwhich we agreed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate is \nscheduled to stand in recess at 12:30.\n  Mr. GRAMM. I ask unanimous consent I might have 5 additional minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, how much time does the Senator from Texas \nrequire at this time?\n  Mr. GRAMM. I have asked for 5 additional minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I would like 2 minutes to respond when \nthe Senator from Texas concludes. Does the Senator from Alaska wish to \nmake a statement?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Not during the lunch hour, no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAMM. Let me review the three areas that are clear violations of \nNAFTA in this provision before us. The first is a provision requiring \ncompanies to buy American insurance. It is one thing to say they have \nto have insurance licensed in the United States. That would conform \nwith NAFTA. But to say they have to buy insurance from companies \ndomiciled in the United States is a clear violation of NAFTA, it is a \nclear violation of GATT, and it violates the national treatment \nstandards\n\n[[Page S8096]]\n\nthat we have set out in trade. This is critically important to America \nbecause all over the world we have American business interests that \nwould be jeopardized if other countries engaged in similar activities \nagainst America.\n  Another provision which clearly singles out Mexican truckers, where \nAmerican truckers are not affected by a similar provision and neither \nare Canadian truckers, is a punitive provision that says if you are \nsubject to suspension or restriction or limitations, you can't lease \ntrucks to anybody else. No such requirement exists in American law. No \nsuch requirement exists with regard to Canadian trucks. But there is \nsuch a limitation in this amendment, and that limitation clearly \nviolates NAFTA by denying Mexican economic interests the same \nprotection of the law that American economic interests and Canadian \neconomic interests have.\n  Another provision of the law which is totally different from the way \nwe treat American trucks and the way we treat Canadian trucks is that \nif a foreign carrier is in violation, a foreign carrier can be \npermanently banned from doing business in the United States. Where is a \nsimilar provision with regard to Canadian trucks and American trucks?\n  Let me summarize, since I am running out of time, by making the \nfollowing points: No. 1, I am for safety. I have more Mexican trucks \noperating in my State than any other person in the Senate, other than \nSenator Hutchison, who represents the same State I do. I am concerned \nabout safety, but I do not believe we can sustain in world public \nopinion a provision that discriminates against our neighbors in Mexico, \na provision that treats Canadians under one standard and Mexicans under \nanother. If we want temporary measures whereby we can get Mexican \ntrucks up to standard, that is something with which I can live. But \npermanent provisions where we are treating Mexico different than \nCanada, that is something with which I cannot live.\n  I think it is important that we try to work out a compromise. But I \ncan assure you, given that the administration believes this issue is \ncritical to the credibility of the United States in negotiating trade \nagreements and enforcing our trade agreements around the world, Senator \nMcCain and I and Senator Lott intend to fight to preserve the \nPresident's position.\n\n  Some suggestion has been made that we just would do a cloture on the \namendment of Senator Murray. I remind my colleagues, the amendment is \namendable. If it were clotured, we would have 30 hours of debate on \ncloture, and there would then be three other cloture votes on this \nbill. I do not think that is a road we want to go down.\n  What is the solution? The solution is to have strong safety \nstandards, but you have to apply the same safety standards to Canadian \ntrucks that you do to Mexican trucks. We do not have second-class \ncitizens in America, and we are not going to have second-class trading \npartners. We cannot set one standard for Mexicans and one standard for \nCanadians in a free trade agreement that involves all three countries.\n  So Senator McCain and I are for safety, but we are not for \nprotectionism. We are not for provisions that make it impossible for \nthe President to provide leadership to comply with NAFTA, and we are \nwilling to fight to preserve the President's ability to live up to our \ntrade agreements.\n  I hope something can be worked out. I am not sure where the votes \nare. What I see happening is that protectionism is being couched in the \ncloak of safety. We are willing to have every legitimate safety \nprovision for Mexican trucks that we have for Canadian trucks and for \nAmerican trucks. We are willing to have a transition period where we \nhave more intensive inspection. But in the end, in a free trade \nagreement involving three countries, we have to treat all three \ncountries the same. What we cannot live with is discrimination against \nour trading partner to the south.\n  I appreciate the Chair's indulgence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator from Washington has 2 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I heard the comments of the Senators from \nArizona and Texas. I want to make it very clear, I have never been \nagainst discussion. We put this bill out on the floor last Friday. It \nhas been out here for 3 days. I have continually said I am happy to \nlook at any language any Member brings me on any item of discussion \nunder transportation. What I am against is weakening any of the safety \nprovisions we have included in the committee bill.\n  The proposal that was given to me by the Senator from Arizona \nconsiderably weakens and actually guts many of the safety provisions \nthat Senator Shelby and I put into the underlying bill. That simply is \nnot a path we are going to take on the Senate floor. Our provisions \nwere adopted unanimously in the Appropriations Committee. I am not \ninterested in going into a back room and negotiating a sellout of the \ncommittee or of the safety provisions that I believe are extremely \nimportant. That is simply a nonstarter for me as manager of this bill.\n  I do remind all Senators they can offer amendments and this Senator \nis happy to consider them as the rules allow. As far as the NAFTA \nprovisions are concerned, I will remind all of our colleagues once \nagain, the underlying bill is not a violation of NAFTA. That is very \nclear. I set that out in my remarks this morning, and I am to go \nthrough that again this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15, when the Senate \nreconvenes, the Senator from Illinois be allowed 20 minutes to discuss \nhis issue that he would like to present to us and then Senator Bill \nNelson from Florida be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senator from \nIllinois was to be recognized for 20 minutes.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent I be permitted \nto proceed now for 5 minutes, and then return to the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, it isn't that this subject matter \nshould be dealt with briefly, but I think I can express my concerns in \n5 minutes. I hope others are as concerned as I about this issue.\n  Senator Murray is here on the floor. She is the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Transportation. She has worked very hard to accommodate \nthis bill through language with reference to Mexico and Mexican \ntrucking and busing between our borders under NAFTA. She has worked \nvery hard to get something much better than that which was passed in \nthe House and she kept things from passing in our subcommittee that \nwould be much worse than the arrangement we now have in the bill with \nher amendment.\n  I would like to say that the United States should be quite pleased \ntoday that we have a new relationship growing between the Republic of \nMexico and the United States. It is obvious everywhere you go in Mexico \nwith everyone you talk to, and with everyone you talk to in the border \nStates, that the arrival of President Fox has brought a whole new \nattitude between these two great countries.\n  For instance, in the 29 years or so that I have been here, there have \nbeen four Presidents of Mexico, but not a single one was willing to say \nthat the economic problems of Mexico are not America's problems, and we \nhave to solve our own. President Fox is the first President to say we \nhad better improve the permit system for people coming from his country \nto work here because he believes they should do this in a legal manner \ninstead of a manner that leaves many Mexicans here in positions of \nhiding out while they hold jobs and they can't return home--some \nwonderful ideas about what should happen on our border in terms of \ncleaning up the border which has grown topsy-\n\n[[Page S8097]]\n\nturvy. Law enforcement can now trust Mexican law enforcement for the \nfirst time in modern times. The litany goes on.\n  I, for one, hope the Senators from both sides of the aisle will find \na way to sit down and draft a provision on the busing and trucking \naccess to the United States pursuant to the NAFTA arrangements. There \nare some who have said their trucks aren't safe enough, that they don't \nhave the right kind of insurance--and a rather major litany.\n  I suggest we had better be careful that we are not couching these \nthings in a way so as to avoid what it really is. It appears to me it \nis borderline discrimination against Mexican enterprise. There has to \nbe a better way to solve it than we have solved it in this \nTransportation bill, but in a way that will let Mexico and Mexico's \nleaders say we are equal partners with the United States, and that we \nare going to be treated the same way as Canada. Canada, America, and \nMexico are the three partners. I believe to do otherwise is to say to \nthe Mexican people and the new President: We don't care about you; we \ndon't even care if we discriminate against you; we have a hot issue, \nand we are going to pass something; and maybe in a few years we can \nwork something out with you, Mr. President of Mexico, as a NAFTA \npartner of the United States.\n  I believe the time is now, on this bill. The President has said he \nwill veto the bill with the Murray language in it. That is official. We \nought to sit down and work out something for them so it won't be \nvetoed.\n  There are great American transportation issues and problems for every \nSenator and for every State. We ought to get the bill passed. The way \nto get it passed is not to send it to the President with language he \nalready said he will veto and offend Mexico unjustifiably. What we are \ndoing is unjustifiable. Let's get it resolved.\n  There is a simple proposition around. Let's come up with a California \nsolution. I am pretty familiar with the various solutions. Let us in \nthe Senate say we stand ready to help.\n  I hope we can do this and pass the bill in due course--the full \nbill--and put some legislation in it that will protect Mexico against \ndiscrimination in trucking and busing and allow them to grow and \nprosper, but at the same time offer as much assurance as we can that \ntheir vehicles are going to be safe, and include whatever other \nrequirements we need to ensure they are treated like trucks coming from \nCanada.\n  Mr. President, I stand in strong support of permitting Mexican motor \ncarriers full access to the United States in a safe, fair, and timely \nmanner.\n  The North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect in January \n1994. The agreement calls on each country to apply national treatment \nto services of each of the trading partners. NAFTA required that \nMexican trucks have full access to the United States by January 1, \n2001.\n  Rather than prepare ourselves to meet this obligation, we foolishly \nprohibited our southern partner's trucks beyond 20 miles from the \nborder.\n  An arbitration panel ruled that the United States violated NAFTA, and \ntoday we face the possibility of trade sanctions in excess of $1 \nbillion per year of noncompliance.\n  Some hope to completely bar Mexican domiciled motor carriers, \nassuming that because they are Mexican, then they are necessarily \nunsafe.\n  I applaud Senator Murray's attempt to craft a balance to ensure that \nMexican trucks are safe, while meeting our national obligation.\n  As a Senator from a border state, I am deeply concerned about the \nsafety of Mexican trucks. However, I do not believe that we should use \nsafety as an excuse to inappropriately discriminate against Mexico.\n  As such, I have some fundamental concerns about the language of \nSenator Murray's proposal.\n  Principally, I am troubled that it seems to harbor a deep mistrust of \nMexico.\n  The United States and Mexico both agree that Mexico must comply with \nU.S. laws, and that it is the United States' right to enforce those \nlaws. Why then, must we impose additional and unreasonable requirements \nbefore permitting Mexican motor carriers access?\n  NAFTA requires that each member country give national treatment to \nthe other member countries. That means that Mexico and Canada must \nabide by U.S. safety standards when in the U.S.\n  Canada has been doing so for some time, and Mexico is prepared and \neagerly awaits the opportunity to do so. However, the current language \ncontains a host of provisions requiring the DOT Inspector General to \nreview the accuracy of Mexico's regulations and information.\n  These requirements are not only wholly offensive and paternalistic, \nbut fall far outside the purview of the IG.\n  Furthermore, the Department of Transportation inspects Canadian or \nU.S. motor carriers' facilities only when there is evidence of \nimpropriety or a record of safety violations. Yet, Senator Murray's \nprovisions would require that DOT inspect every Mexican carrier's \nfacilities before any permission is granted.\n  In short, this is discrimination, plain and simple.\n  The Administration recognized that the current Senate language is \ndiscriminatory and would violate NAFTA, and even issued a veto threat \nif such language is retained.\n  I understand that many are concerned about the safety of Mexican \ntrucks, particularly since some statistics show that they have greater \nout of service rates than U.S. trucks. I favor inspecting trucks to \nadvance legitimate safety concerns, and recognize that a direct \ncorrelation exists between the condition of Mexican commercial trucks \nentering the U.S. and the level of inspection resources at the border.\n\n  California is widely regarded as having the best inspection \npractices. As such, the out of service rate for Mexican trucks in \nCalifornia is commensurate to the rate for U.S. trucks.\n  Even the International Brotherhood of Teamsters support the \nCalifornia inspection system. In a letter to President Bush, Mr. James \nHoffa stated, ``Currently, California provides a model of what a proper \nborder inspection program can achieve.''\n  If we all agree that California's inspection system works \nefficiently, then perhaps we should model the Federal inspection \nprogram after it, and refrain from treating our southern NAFTA partner \nwith such distrust.\n  Mexico has not indicated that it is unwilling to abide by our laws. \nIn fact, Mexico has stated that it will subject its trucks to \ninspections more intense and more frequent than our own.\n  The issue is whether Mexican trucks on U.S. roads meet U.S. safety \nstandards. Inspecting trucks should be the focus of an inspection \nprogram, rather than inspecting facilities in Mexico without just \ncause.\n  Mr. President, I stand in strong opposition to language that would \ndiscriminate against our southern partners and support proposals that \nwould ensure the safety of U.S. highways in a fair and timely manner.\n  I am confident that an equitable solution may be reached that will \nensure safe roads and meet obligations under NAFTA, and diffuse the \nthreat of veto.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Presiding Officer for yielding me 5 \nminutes, and also the Senators who yielded me their time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. I thank the Chair and appreciate the Senator from \nWashington giving me the time to speak on a matter of great importance \nto the city of Chicago, and actually it is probably of some interest to \nthe Presiding Officer, as she grew up in the city of Park Ridge which \nis right next to O'Hare International Airport.\n  I hate to say it, but since the Presiding Officer grew up in Illinois \nwe have had problems at O'Hare. O'Hare has been at capacity since 1969. \nIn fact, it was in that year that the FAA first put delay controls in \nat O'Hare Airport. Unadvisedly, I think 2 years ago, Congress lifted \nthe delay controls at O'Hare and LaGuardia, and delays went up \nexponentially. That has kind of renewed and intensified the crisis we \nhave in aviation in this country.\n  Madam President, I have filed an amendment I will discuss later that \nI am continuing to work on with my colleague from Illinois, Senator \nDurbin. I hope we will be able to work out some arrangements, but my \namendment would restore a Chicago supplemental airport to the National \nPlan for Integrated Airport Systems around the\n\n[[Page S8098]]\n\ncountry, the so-called NPIAS list. For 10 years, Chicago had a \nsupplemental airport on the NPIAS list. It was taken off in 1997 by the \nFAA. I think it is time we put the Chicago supplemental airport back on \nthat nationwide plan for airports. There are several reasons that I say \nthat.\n  I want to first point out exactly where we have our airports in \nIllinois for those who are following this debate. I show you a map of \nthe Chicago area. We have O'Hare International Airport on 7,000 acres \non the northwest side of the city of Chicago. It is also bounded by the \ncities of Park Ridge, Des Plaines, Elk Grove, Wood Dale, and \nBensenville. We also have Midway Airport that prior to O'Hare's opening \nin the late 1950s, early 1960s, was the world's busiest airport, if you \ncan believe it. I think President Kennedy appeared at O'Hare's grand \nopening in 1963 and by 1969 O'Hare was at capacity.\n  But if you look at where these airports are located, you see that in \norder to get more capacity to expand these airports we are confronted \nwith a lot of problems. Midway Airport is right in the middle of a \ncongested area within the city limits of Chicago. In fact, I have never \nheard the mayor of the city of Chicago suggest expanding Midway to have \nlonger runways. The runways are only 6,000 feet at Midway, so it is \nvery difficult to do a long-haul flight out of that airport.\n  Recently, Southwest Airlines, and also ATA, have been doing very well \nat Midway. Midway is almost back to where it was in terms of capacity \nbefore O'Hare was built. It is pretty much full right now. Then, of \ncourse, we have O'Hare. O'Hare has seven runways.\n  I will show you a map of those seven runways. This is a blowup of \nO'Hare Airport. All of this land in the interior shown on the map is \nfilled with runways. In fact, O'Hare has more runways, as far as I \nknow, than any other airport in the country. It has seven runways. It \ndoes about 908,000 flights a year.\n  But when you get into expanding O'Hare, you are met with some real \nlogistical challenges. There is the Tri-State Tollway on the eastern \nboundary of O'Hare. You have the Northwest Tollway on the northern \nboundary of O'Hare, and you have Irving Park Road to the south, and you \nhave York Road--Route 83--to the west.\n  So a lot of people have been saying to me: Why don't we just put down \nmore runways at O'Hare? Many people think--and, in fact, some encourage \nthe perception--that putting in new runways at O'Hare would be as \nsimple as laying new sidewalks. But the fact is, it is very difficult \nto figure out how you get more capacity at O'Hare.\n  I show you on this map the existing configuration of the runways at \nO'Hare. This 7,000-acre field goes way back. The planning was started \nin the 1940s. It came on line in the late 1950s. I gather that the \nairport has had this runway configuration for many years--at least 30 \nyears, maybe more. But there are seven runways at O'Hare. One of them \nis one of the largest runways in the country.\n  I believe this runway--14R-32L--is one of the longest runways in this \ncountry, about 14,000 feet. The problem with these seven runways, \nthough, is that they are not really laid out properly. In fact, in an \noptimal configuration that would be done today in a new airport, they \nwould lay these runways out in a parallel fashion so they do not \nintercept. If you have a plane landing on this runway shown on the map, \nfor example, then another plane cannot be taking off on that runway.\n  So O'Hare's problem isn't that it does not have enough runways but \nthat they are not laid out right. In fact, Atlanta's Hartsfield \nAirport, which only has four runways--they are trying to build more \nnow--handles more flights now than O'Hare does, even though it only has \nfour runways. That is because those runways are laid out in a parallel \nfashion, and you can have simultaneous departures and landings on those \ndifferent parallel runways.\n  In any case, Mayor Daley has recently proposed getting more capacity \nout of O'Hare essentially by tearing all of this up and rebuilding it. \nIn fact, I think the mayor proposes tearing up three runways and \nbuilding four new ones. One of these runways--I think this runway, the \n14,500-foot runway--they would just tear up and demolish it. They would \nlay new runways all in a parallel fashion. But the problem is, this \nproject gets very expensive, and it would take a very long period of \ntime.\n  This is a diagram of Mayor Daley's proposed modernization of O'Hare, \nwhich really amounts to a tearing up and rebuilding of the airport. He \nwould eliminate this runway and this runway I show you on the map, and \nhe would lay parallel runways. He would leave this runway shown here in \nplace. You would essentially have six parallel runways here, and then \ntwo parallel in this direction shown here. Essentially, it is kind of \nlike a quad-four runway system. I think mainly these four parallel \nrunways would be the ones that would be used.\n  In addition, the mayor would add a western access to the airport. The \nPresiding Officer would be very interested to know that when she grew \nup in Illinois, it was much easier to get to O'Hare than it is today. \nIn fact, back in the 1950s and 1960s, there were just cornfields out in \nthat direction. The Northwest Tollway was built in the late 1950s \nduring the Eisenhower administration in 1958, and the development \nstarted occurring much later.\n  But now it is very difficult to get into O'Hare because there is not \nenough access. In fact, coming from my home in Inverness, which is only \n12 miles to the northwest, sometimes it takes an hour to go those 12 \nmiles east on the Northwest Tollway because of congestion.\n  So recognizing that congestion is a problem, the mayor would propose \ncreating a western access to the airport with another major expressway \ncoming into the west to relieve some of the bottleneck that enters now \nat the airport on the east.\n  Also, he would add a new terminal. I think basically what they have \nnow is the main terminals, which he would redo under a program called \nthe World Gateway Program that would cost $4 billion, or actually $3.8 \nbillion, to be exact. They would give United terminals 1 and 2, and \nAmerican terminals 3 and 4. My understanding of it is that most of the \nother airlines would be stuck at a desk out here on the west side of \nthe airport.\n  These are the various elements that would have to be done in order to \naccomplish Mayor Daley's expansion plan. They would close the 3 \nexisting runways, construct 4 new runways, make an extension of 4 \nrunways, construction of the west terminal, construction of western \nairport access, acquisition of 433 acres, acquisition of 303 homes, and \nacquisition of 240 rental units. The costs of this proposal have been \nall over the map. I think the mayor initially disclosed about $6 \nbillion. But that was pretty much just for tearing up and rebuilding \nthe runways. He did not include the $4 billion he is spending now on \nthe World Gateway Program. That brings it up, even by the mayor's cost \nestimates, to about a $10 billion reconstruction project.\n  The fact is, when you add in the cost of all the ancillary projects, \nincluding road building projects, you would probably have to expand the \nNorthwest Tollway and the expressway to accommodate more people. In \nfact, you can barely get into the airport right now, as I have said. \nImagine what it would be like trying to get into the airport after \ntwice as many people are being urged to go into the airport. So it \nwould be a very costly project--probably somewhere in the $15 billion \nrange, possibly up toward $20 billion. The Chicago Tribune has had \nestimates ranging from $6.3 billion to $18.9 billion.\n  My thought is this: I believe we have an aviation crisis in Chicago \nbecause we lack capacity. We have far greater demand than we have \ncapacity. O'Hare has capacity for about 908,000 flights a year. Mayor \nDaley's proposal of spending about $15 billion, and lasting at least 15 \nyears following the approval process, would get us up to 1.6 million \noperations a year. I favor, instead of going forward with that \nproposal, building a supplemental Chicago airport. The reason I favor \nthat is because it would bring far more capacity, far more quickly, at \nfar less cost.\n  This is a chart that shows what would be involved in expanding O'Hare \nvis-a-vis what would be involved in building a third airport in the \nChicago area. The cost could range from $13 billion to $26 billion for \nthe O'Hare expansion. The estimated cost of the third\n\n[[Page S8099]]\n\nairport, which would have six parallel runways and handle 1.6 million \noperations a year, would be only $5 billion to $6 billion--the same as \nDenver International Airport. Mayor Daley proposes adding 700,000 \nflights, or operations, a year for the money he proposes spending. For \na third of the cost, you could get 1.6 million more operations a year.\n  In contrast to the 15-years-plus it would take the city of Chicago to \ntear up and rebuild O'Hare--and God only knows what the delays would be \nlike while they were tearing up and rebuilding O'Hare--the State has \nestimated it could have the first phase of a third airport done in 3 to \n5 years following the approval. That would only be with one or two \nrunways to begin with; ultimate build-out would be six runways. There \nis great community support for the third airport. There is significant \ncommunity opposition around the expansion of O'Hare.\n\n  Also, competition. Surprise, surprise, but United and American oppose \na third airport. Well, United and American have at least 75 percent of \nthe operations. In fact, United and American oppose a third airport \nbecause they, right now, have 76 percent of the hub gates at Chicago's \nO'Hare Airport.\n  If you look around the country, you will see that we have a tendency \naround the whole United States toward having a local air carrier that \nhas a dominant position at a regional hub airport. If you look at \nAtlanta's Hartsfield, you have Delta with 62 percent of the hub gates. \nAt Dallas-Fort Worth, you have American Airlines and Delta together \ncontrolling 84 percent of the gates. In Denver, a brand new airport, \nUnited is already up to 57 percent of the gates. At Washington/Dulles, \nUnited is up to 65 percent of the gates.\n  So, surprise, United and American oppose a third airport. The reason \nfor that is they would not control the third airport in Chicago. There \nwould be new entrants that would be allowed to come in and compete with \nthem. It seems to me that we should not let that detour us because we \nare not representing the shareholders of the big six air carriers in \nthe Senate. We need to be worried about aviation consumers. Over the \nlast 20 years--in fact, since deregulation of the aviation industry in \nthe late 1970s--operations in aviation have gone up 80 percent in this \ncountry. Yet we haven't built a single new major airport, except for \nthe Denver Airport, which was simply a replacement for the old \nStapleton International Airport, which got shut down.\n  As you look around the country, big airlines that have a dominant \nposition in their market fight like the dickens to prevent another \nairport from being built because that would allow new entrants to come \ninto their territory, and it would force them to lower costs and \nimprove services or they lose new business to the new entrants.\n  Because United and American don't want new competitors coming into \ntheir marketplace where they have a duopoly should not deter anybody. \nWhat I think would be best for consumers in the Chicago area is if we \ndid have another major hub airport and we had other carriers coming \ninto compete with United and American. They are both good airlines. \nThey have wonderful employees and thousands of wonderful pilots, \nmechanics, and stewardesses; but I believe the consumers in the Chicago \narea would benefit by having new choices. I think there are \npossibilities, such as getting a wonderful new startup airline such as \na Jet Blue, or even a Southwest Airways, which is competing at Midway \nAirport in Chicago, but might someday enjoy having the opportunity to \nrun longer haul flights out of the Chicago area and compete more head-\non with United and American at O'Hare. To get one of those fine \nairlines in the new airport would be great for the Chicago area, and it \nwould help decongest O'Hare for the rest of the Nation.\n  Now, in the few moments I still have, I want to make one final point. \nIn this regard, I want to associate myself with my colleague from \nIllinois in the other Chamber, Jesse Jackson, Jr. For many years he has \nbeen a strong proponent of a third Chicago area airport. It is the \nsouth suburbs and the southern limits of the city of Chicago that he \nrepresents in Congress. He makes the point that we should not want all \neconomic activity in our State concentrated in one 7,000-acre site.\n  That is perhaps why I disagree with Mayor Daley, the mayor of the \ncity of Chicago. He has a different constituency than I. As mayor of \nthe city of Chicago, he wants to keep as much economic development as \npossible in the city of Chicago, and Chicago is a mighty fine city, and \nI hope it remains always strong.\n  Looking at this issue as a Senator with statewide responsibilities \nand concern for the whole State, I want other parts of Illinois to have \njobs, economic development, and an economic engine, too. I want the \nRockford area to have their airport used, I want jobs for the people in \nthe south suburbs, and I want some convenience for the 2 million-plus \npeople who live in the south suburbs who have to drive 2 hours or more \nto get to O'Hare on those crowded expressways.\n  Yesterday, there was a good column in the Chicago Tribune by a new \ncolumnist for the Chicago Tribune. Her name is Dawn Turner Trice. She \nanalogized this issue actually to the G8 economic summit that was just \nconcluded in Europe whereby the big G8 countries were talking about \nsharing the wealth with the rest of the world, forgiving some of the \ndebts that Third World nations have, turning loans into grants, \noutright grants to help some of the developing countries.\n  She said: Why aren't we looking at this airport issue the same way in \nthe State of Illinois? Why do we allow such a great concentration of \nwealth in one tiny 7,000-acre site and not worry about it anywhere \nelse? She is absolutely right on that and, in addition, those wealthy \ncommunities around the airport have said enough is enough. Their \nquality of life is now negatively impacted by the continual cramming of \neverything into O'Hare. The idea of dramatically increasing the number \nof flights at O'Hare beyond what they are now presents a real dilemma \nto the Chicago area. People do not know how they can get there now. \nThey cannot imagine what O'Hare would be like if the airport was \nexpanded further.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. FITZGERALD. Madam President, I thank you for this time, and I \nthank you for the opportunity to address this issue. I hope to be \nworking with Senator Durbin and my other colleagues to solve the \naviation crisis in the country, beginning in Chicago.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nFlorida is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1030\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I rise in support of the \nMurray-Shelby version of the question of Mexican trucks on American \nhighways that is in the Department of Transportation appropriations \nbill.\n  I support free trade, but free trade does not mean sacrificing the \nsafety of Americans on our highways.\n  If you will just look at the comparison of safety standards for \nAmerican trucks and Mexican trucks, the hours of service that a driver \ncan perform are unlimited under Mexican standards.\n  There are no random drug tests.\n  A medical condition that will disqualify in America does not \nnecessarily do so in Mexico.\n  The age for drivers of these trucks established in America is 21 and \nonly 18 in Mexico.\n  The maximum weight on our highways in America is 80,000 pounds. In \nMexico, it is 135,000 pounds.\n  As to vehicle safety standards, such as antilock brakes, in Mexico \nthey do not even have to have brakes on the front wheels.\n  And then as to the question of cargo, carrying of hazardous \nmaterials, we have very strict standards in this country. In Mexico, \nthey are very lax. There are fewer identified chemicals and fewer \nlicensure requirements.\n  If ever there has been a case where the commonsense standards, the \ndesires, and the wants of the American people are quite apparent, it is \nthe Americans who get behind the wheel and drive on our highways and on \nthe interstates and encounter huge trucks. How many times have we had, \nas a driver of a smaller vehicle, a concern about the safety of that \nbig truck that was in front of us or passing around us or that was \ncutting from one lane to another in front of us.\n  We have in the interest of free trade in America a proposal to \nseverely lower the standards of trucks coming from\n\n[[Page S8100]]\n\nMexico that we, as the consuming American public, as the driving \nAmerican public, will have to encounter.\n  This is not even speaking on the question of the environment. I have \nbeen speaking only on the question of safety. On the question of the \nenvironment and emission standards, we clearly have in the various \nStates different emission standards. In Mexico, those are much less.\n  I simply ask the question, Do we want to drive on our highways and \nencounter trucks with a driver who could be driving with no sleep; that \nbecause there was not a random drug test, that driver may be on drugs; \nhe may have a medical condition that impairs his safety; he is less \nthan 21 years of age; he is driving a truck of 135,000 pounds instead \nof 80,000 pounds; he does not have antilock brakes--indeed, no brakes \non the front wheels; and that truck is carrying significant hazardous \nmaterials, not even to speak of the fact he is spewing all kinds of \npollutants in that acrid smoke we all detest when we are behind a big \ntruck.\n  The case is quite compelling. I would even be for a more stringent \nstandard than the Senator from Washington has inserted into this bill, \nbut her compromise, along with Senator Shelby, is a good start in \nprotecting the American people on their highways.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nMissouri is recognized for 15 minutes.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair. I thank the managers of this bill, the \nChair, Senator Murray, and Senator Shelby for an outstanding bill. It \nis my pleasure to serve on the committee with them and to support this \nbill.\n  Senator Murray has been willing to accommodate many of the very \nimportant priorities submitted by the Bush administration, including \n$325 million for the U.S. Coast Guard Deep Water Systems Program, full \nfunding of the President's request for Coast Guard retired pay and \nReserve training, and certainly, as far as my State of Missouri, which \nis a very transportation- dependent State, we are very grateful for the \nrecognition in our State of the needs in transportation, whether it be \ntransit, buses in the metropolitan areas, transportation for the \nelderly and the disabled in rural areas, light rail, or a critical road \nproject in southwest Missouri on U.S. Highway 71.\n  These are all things that are extremely important, and we are, \nindeed, grateful for the careful attention the Chair and the ranking \nmember have provided to the needs of all of us in this body.\n  I have, however, raised a question at the subcommittee and full \ncommittee level at the request of the Secretary of Transportation. I \nraise this issue of the Mexican truck treatment. As we all know, in \n1994, the North American Free Trade Agreement went into effect \nfollowing congressional approval the previous year. I was here in 1993 \nand voted for this critically important trade agreement. Though I \nrecognize not all of my colleagues were here, and some who were here \ndid not support the agreement, the simple fact remains that NAFTA did \npass. It is now the law of the land. The result is we, as Members of \nthis body, have the responsibility to uphold the law and assure we take \nno deliberate action to violate it.\n  Unfortunately, we have received a Statement of Administration Policy, \ndated July 19, which, No. 1, commends the work that Senator Murray and \nSenator Shelby, the Chair and ranking member, have done to address \nthese many critical issues. They say the administration is pleased the \nSenate committee has provided necessary funding and staff to address \ncritical motor safety issues. It repeats that the administration is \ncommitted to strengthening the safety enforcement regime to ensure all \ncommercial vehicles operating on U.S. roads and highways meet the same \nrigorous safety standards. However, the Statement of Administration \nPolicy goes on to say, the advice from the administration is that the \nSenate committee has adopted provisions that could cause the United \nStates to violate commitments under NAFTA. Unless changes are made to \nthe Senate bill, the President's senior advisers will recommend the \nPresident veto the bill.\n  That is the situation in which we find ourselves. This is too good a \nbill to be lost. We want to work together to make sure we do not lose \nthe benefits of this bill or violate our agreements under NAFTA. We \nknow for a fact that the NAFTA international tribunal has already \nissued a decree we violated obligations and are subject to sanctions \nranging from $1 billion to $2 billion per year for continued \nviolations. These sanctions could certainly lead to multiple \nproblems, particularly in manufacturing, which has already seen three-\nquarters of a million jobs lost since 2000. The real fear in terms of \ntrade is that if the sanctions continue with alternative suppliers \nbeing found from the European Union or elsewhere, the job losses could \nbecome permanent.\n\n  To set the context for the Senate bill, our colleagues on the other \nside of the Capitol took a very stringent view that would prohibit the \nuse of any funds in the appropriations bill pending to process \napplications by Mexico domiciled motor carriers for conditional or \npermanent authority to operate beyond the commercial zone adjacent to \nthe border. In other words, the House-passed language, as amended on \nthe floor, effectively closes our borders to trade with Mexico while \nproviding no money to address any of the concerns noted by those \nsupporting the amendment. That is to assure safety for all trucks on \nthe highway.\n  This action not only constitutes a direct violation of NAFTA, but it \ndoes not do anything to address the safety issues associated with the \nstatus quo on the United States-Mexico border.\n  A few moments ago we heard questions raised about the weight of \ntrucks in Mexico, their brake systems, and other things. Let me go back \nto point out that under NAFTA and under the administration's policy, \nthe inspection regulations would require that the trucks coming in from \nMexico meet our standards. Whether it is weight, whether it is brakes, \nall of the safety standards that we impose on our trucks, that we \nimpose on Canadian trucks, would be imposed on Mexican trucks.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the provision in this bill, headed by the \nChair, Senator Murray, and Senator Shelby, made very significant \nimprovements in the legislation and added the money necessary to \nprotect others who travel on the highways. That has to be our first \nresponsibility. Everybody wants to make sure our highways and roads are \nas safe as possible. We are going to do that. What we need to do is \nfigure out how to do that.\n  I raise a concern that some of the provisions in this bill could \neffectively close our border to Mexican trucks. I am very pleased to \nsay we are expecting very shortly to be able to meet with the \nadministration to find out precisely the kind of language changes that \nare needed. I trust and I believe the leaders of this committee, the \nChair and the ranking member, will be able to work to find solutions to \nthe language problems and the practical problems that cause the \nadministration to believe this is a NAFTA violation. We do need to \nmaintain our standing in the international community and make a good-\nfaith effort to live up to our trading obligations. Certainly the \nobligation to open our borders to other countries that want to bring \ngoods into our country in exchange for opening their borders to allow \nus to take goods into their countries is very important.\n  Whether or not my colleagues supported NAFTA at its inception, there \nshould be no question that we should not do something in this body or \nin conjunction with the other body that would cause us to be in the \nposition of breaking our agreements. That, I am afraid, is the major \nproblem. We cannot and must not violate our agreements. The practical \nimpact of the provisions, unless we can work out a change before it is \nsent to the President, would be a veto of the whole bill. Senator \nMurray and Senator Shelby have worked too long and hard to get this \nbill together to lose it. Our agricultural exports, our manufacturing \nexports, the jobs for our farmers, the jobs for our workers, require we \ndo this job properly.\n\n  If you have, as I have, listened to the congressional debate on \nletting Mexican trucks travel U.S. roads, you might think the United \nStates is an unequipped, underdeveloped country. I pointed out that \nNAFTA permits us to require the same safety standards for trucks on \nhighways. We have had more\n\n[[Page S8101]]\n\nthan 7 years to prepare for the inspection of trucks to ensure they \nmeet U.S. safety standards as required by the North American Free Trade \nAgreement and as repeatedly requested by Mexico. Yet it appears the \nTeamsters Union and others with straight faces tell us that the world's \nwealthiest and most advanced nation does not have the resources to \nperform this relatively modest chore. That is the heart of their \nargument--U.S. inadequacy--and we should be ashamed of it, just as we \nshould be ashamed of other arguments being made: we cannot inspect \ntrucks coming across the border, not 7 million trucks; at maximum \n180,000, or 300,000 trucks might be the most.\n  We have the right and the obligation to inspect these trucks. We \nshould be ashamed of saying that we cannot inspect them. We have a lot \nof evidence already of trucks traveling on our highways. A Mexican \ntrucking fleet has long been allowed to traverse this country en route \nto Canada with no notable safety hazard resulting. Only if the Mexican \ntrucks want to stop to deliver goods throughout the United States do we \nwant to bar them. Maybe it is a question of whose jobs are being \nimpeded.\n  Mexican trucking firms can already travel throughout the United \nStates so long as the firms are U.S. owned and no serious issues have \nbeen raised about that. Only if the Mexicans own the companies do we \nprohibit their trucks. Something to do with competition maybe. That \nraises questions.\n  Older Mexican drayage trucks, those long allowed to make short hauls \nin the 20-mile ``commercial zones'' on either side of the border, are \nas safe as similar U.S. trucks. As the American Trucking Association \nhas noted, the Mexican vehicles are taken out of service for safety \nreasons at rates that are virtually identical to those at drayage \noperations at ports and intermodal facilities all across the United \nStates.\n  If we need more proof, we only need to look to California, the only \nState that inspects every Mexican vehicle crossing its border. The out-\nof-service rate for Mexican trucks there is virtually the same as that \nfor U.S. trucks. The president of the Teamsters, Mr. James Hoffa, calls \nCalifornia's program, which we propose for the rest of the border, ``a \nmodel of what a proper inspection program can achieve.''\n  What it has achieved is to show that we can, indeed, inspect Mexican \ntrucks. California does it in two modern facilities, built mostly with \nFederal funds, with inspectors chiefly paid with Federal dollars, and \nthose vehicles are as safe as U.S. trucks. How, then, can critics make \nthe claims about dangerous Mexican trucks?\n  First, they mix apples and oranges, comparing older drayage trucks, \nwhich have a higher out-of-service rate in both our nations, with all \nU.S. trucks. Thus, when critics say the out-of-service rate for trucks \nat the border is 36 percent, or half-again higher than the 24 percent \nfor all U.S. trucks, they are engaging in a little statistical sleight \nof hand. This, I find, is misleading.\n  In addition, there is a contention that under the administration's \nplan it would take 18 months to take any unsafe Mexican trucks off the \nroad. But that is how long it would take to go into Mexico and audit \nMexican firms' paperwork, maintenance records, drivers' logs and the \nlike, not to inspect their trucks.\n  What we are seeking funds for in this bill, and what the \nadministration has sought, is money for roadside truck inspections.\n  Similarly, as I said, many House Members signed a Teamster-generated \nletter that under NAFTA, 7 million Mexican trucks would be riding \nAmerican highways, while only 180 Mexican firms have applied, and there \nare only about a total of 300,000 commercial trucks in all of Mexico.\n  The chief danger in this debate is not Mexican trucks but U.S. \nprotectionism, which is already costing businesses and consumers \ndearly. About 75 percent of United States-Mexico trade, or about $195 \nbillion of goods moves by truck with cargoes transferred from long-haul \ntrucks to drayage trucks at the border and back to long-haul trucks for \nnationwide delivery. It is a senseless and expensive system that must \nbe ended--not for the least reason that it keeps the older, more \ndangerous drayage trucks targeted by critics on the road.\n  As one who comes from an agricultural State, and 75 percent of our \nexports go into Mexico by truck, we depend upon trucking because 12.5 \npercent of the American agricultural exports go to Mexico. That gives \nus a trade surplus in agriculture of over $1 billion.\n  If we put these barriers up to Mexican trucks as Secretary Mineta, \nthe Secretary of Transportation has noted, Mexico could impose \ncompensatory tariffs of $1 billion on U.S. goods. Many U.S. workers and \ncompanies would feel the pain if Mexico were to exercise this right.\n  Perhaps more costly, however, would be the damage to our U.S. drive \nto get other nations to keep their borders open and to keep their trade \ncommitments. As the world's largest exporter, we have the most at stake \nin this issue. Our case will be impossible if we violate our own word. \nI think it is past time. I hope we can very shortly work out something \nthat the President has suggested, the Teamsters endorse, many on this \nfloor have endorsed, and that is adopting the California model for all \nborder States to provide the funds for facilities and inspectors, to \nmake sure our highways are safe. That is No. 1. Every American has a \nright to demand that we ensure the safety standards for all the trucks \non our highways.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to work with the Chair and the ranking \nmember to ensure safety on America's highways while opening our borders \nto foreign trade, to assure compliance with our treaties, and to avoid \na veto.\n  People in my State want to trade with Mexico just as the people in \nthe rest of the country want to trade with Mexico. We can achieve safe \nhighways while maintaining open borders and avoiding trade sanctions by \napplying universal inspections and standards across the board. We can \nget the job done. I look forward to working with the Chair of the \nCommittee, Senator Murray, and Ranking Member Shelby in the coming \nhours and days in an effort to see that we can attain these very \nreasonable goals for all Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). The time of the Senator has \nexpired. Who seeks time? The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, I hope to clear the air somewhat with \nrespect to comments made by my distinguished colleague from Arizona. I \nserve with him on the Appropriations Committee. We both voted to report \nout this particular Transportation appropriations bill with the Murray \namendment. We reported it out unanimously.\n  The reason we did that is because the Senator from Washington, Mrs. \nMurray, and the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby, in a bipartisan \nmanner, went about this particular task in a very deliberate, studied \nway. In other words, they went to the Department of Transportation and \nthey went to the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999.\n  For example, the particular provisions I heard Senator Gramm of Texas \npoint out, there are two of them, relative to the leasing issue and the \ndisqualification of vehicles operating illegally. They are both \nsuspended upon implementation of the motor carrier provisions of NAFTA. \nThat says ``upon implementation.'' What the Senator from Texas was \ntalking about as an extreme, terrible thing and everything else, is \nactually required. These provisions are required under the Motor \nCarrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999 that passed this Senate by 99 \nvotes. Of course, I voted for it. The Senator from Texas and the \nSenator from Arizona voted for it, also.\n  It is talking of two particular provisions where, if you are found in \nviolation, for example, you cannot then go lease your equipment for \nsome other person to come in and do the job. That is provided for in \nthis Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999. I have it here in my \nhand, should there be any question.\n  Otherwise, the Senator from Texas was correct in a sense about \nleasing and domicile. When we drew up this provision, we checked with \nthe Transportation Safety Department. In fact, I thought I was \ncorrecting Secretary Mineta in our hearing last week when he attested \nto the fact it never should be required that it be domiciled. And I\n\n[[Page S8102]]\n\nsaid: Mr. Secretary, we got that from your Department.\n  Now the Department of Transportation says: Not quite. What they \nreally meant was license in the sense of domesticating, having an \nindividual in some State to be subject to service. In other words, if \nthere is an accident and some aggrieved party wants to serve the \nparticular--let's say Mexican truck--they have to have the State and an \noffice and an individual to be served, subject to service that we all \nknow about in the practice of law.\n  That could be corrected, as the Senator from Washington said, by \namendment. True it is that, yes, Vicente Fox, the new President of \nMexico, has given us hope with NAFTA. There is no doubt we have NAFTA. \nI opposed it as vigorously as anyone, but now we have to see that it \nworks.\n  In all candor, this is the first chance I have seen that we can make \nit work under the new President, particularly with his Foreign \nMinister, Jorge Castaneda, who has taught up here in the United States. \nHe has worked on this and I have talked to him about safety. Mexico \ndoes not really want to get embroiled in this. They are mostly \ninterested in immigration and industry and economic expansion and \neverything else, and they don't want to cross wires with the United \nStates on the matter of the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act Of \n1999.\n  He said that to me several times. I understand that. Neither do we, \nbecause this is a reciprocal thing. If we required something up here in \nthe United States that was untoward or discriminatory, they would \nrequire the same thing of us down in Mexico.\n  We are working this treaty out. These provisions under the Murray \namendment are all in conformance with NAFTA--and are required by the \nU.S. motor carrier act. I can tell you that right now.\n  Senator Murray and Senator Shelby should be commended for their \nthoughtful process. The President said we are going to license, and the \ntrucks can come over January 1st. The confrontational Sabo amendment in \nthe House said there will be no money to process applications and the \ntrucks would not be eligible to come over. It said we are going to save \nmoney by cutting funding off for the fiscal year 2002. That doesn't get \nus anywhere. If we take up Representative Sabo's legislative proposal, \nit will be another year and a half before we can address the issue. \nNothing would happen until October of next year.\n  Everybody wants to move along on this particular score. Jimmy Hoffa \ntestified at the hearing for this Murray amendment. We asked him about \nthese particular amendments because we wanted to be sure it was \ndeliberate and nondiscriminatory in the sense that it was required of \nthe U.S. motor carrier act. That is the way it has been provided.\n  The Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, was correct in saying that \nwe have every bit of hope and we are all working. But to say that it \nlooks like partial discrimination and that we were trying to get some \ntricky kind of things on behalf of the Teamsters, or that these \nrequirements cannot be complied with--it is totally out of whole cloth. \nI have never seen anybody work harder and give better leadership than \nthe Senator from Washington with this Murray amendment. It is the \nMurray-Shelby amendment. It is bipartisan. It should remain so. All of \nthis running around, I don't want to talk, or you don't want to talk, \nor whatever--that is nonsense. Put up the amendment so we can vote on \nthe amendment and move on.\n  I think the Senator from Washington ought to be commended for the \nvery studied way in which she has gone about this particular amendment \nand these requirements. Certainly once that gate is opened and the \ntrucks are coming over, then they are coming over in some 27 particular \nspots, and we have to provide checkpoints and personnel, training, and \neverything else ourselves. So it is not just the Mexicans preparing \nthemselves and so forth by January 1st, but us, too.\n  We don't make January 1st the drop-dead date under the Murray \namendment. We say all of these things cannot be licensed; the border \ncannot be opened until A, B, C, or D in the Murray amendment are \ncomplied with. That is the studied, deliberate way to go about \nregulating at this particular point on the appropriations bill. It is \nimportant that it be done that way rather than overall on the House \nside.\n  We are not looking for the President to veto it. President Bush is \nsmart. He is not going to veto safety. There is nothing in this \nparticular measure that would require a veto. Let's get on with \nlegislation in the particular appropriations bill.\n  I vetoed, like the distinguished Presiding Officer, for 4 years as \nthe Governor. You wake up, and you want to read that veto message very \nclearly so it can not only be sustained legally but in the public \ndomain. I can tell you that neither legally nor in the public domain \nthe veto of the Murray amendment will be sustained. Nobody is trying to \nsay we are going to stick it to you and we hope you veto it. None of \nthat is in here. It unfortunately has gotten way off track.\n\n  I am not a party or even a member of the Subcommittee on \nTransportation in the Appropriations Committee, but I have watched how \nit was done. Yes, our committee, the Committee of Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation, had a hearing with Secretary Mineta. Those kinds of \nthings were pointed out. I could go on at length about the hearings we \nhad.\n  For example, the Comptroller General said:\n\n       Strong enforcement will be needed for the minority of \n     carriers that are egregious offenders and a risk to public \n     safety. The Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999, \n     section 219, provides fines and disqualification sanctions \n     for Mexican carriers operating without authority or beyond \n     the authority in the United States. These fines range from \n     $10,000 to $25,000. However, the act's provision has not been \n     implemented, and this provision will expire when NAFTA's \n     cross border trucking provisions are implemented.\n\n  These are the kinds of things we had before us at the hearing of \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation with Secretary Mineta. It was an \nexcellent hearing.\n  We are ready to move on. I am convinced that we could report out a \nsimilar authorization bill this afternoon, if the committee met, \nsimilar to the Murray amendment. It would be right there, because we \nmade our suggestions as to changes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I know there is a discussion going on off \nthe floor with regard to coming to some resolution on the issue of \nMexican trucking. I hope we can find a way to resolve this \nprocedurally.\n  I applaud Senators Murray and Shelby and others who reached the \ncompromise that is now part of the bill, and I hope, whether we reach \nanother agreement or whether we can't reach agreement and simply have \nvotes, we can do that. I think we have made reasonably good progress \nbefore the August recess on appropriations.\n  I have had some discussions with the Republican leader, as well as \nwith our caucus and my leadership. We have discussed just what remains \nto be done prior to the time we leave. I think it is fair to say we are \nway behind the curve with regard to where we should be on the \nappropriations front. We have only completed three appropriations bills \nso far. I hope at the very least we can complete our work on at least \ntwo more--Transportation and HUD/VA. I have indicated to Senator Lott \nthat would be my desire. I have indicated to\n\n[[Page S8103]]\n\nmy caucus that there is no question that we ought to be able to do \nthose two. Senator Byrd, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, \nshares my view.\n  So my expectation and my determination is that we complete our work \non those two bills. We also have two emergency issues to deal with. \nFirst is the Agriculture supplemental authorization. It has already \npassed in the House. I am told that the Agriculture Committee is \nintending to vote on it tomorrow. It would be my expectation to take it \nup shortly after the committee action in an effort to get it through \nthe floor and into conference in time to bring it back prior to the \ntime we leave. That, too, is a very necessary piece of legislation, \nfirst, because of the relief it provides to millions of producers \nacross this country--producers that are not only incorporated into the \nfarm bill itself, but many other producers that do not have farm \nprograms per se. If we do not act before the August recess, we will \nlose the budget authority that is dedicated under the budget resolution \nto agriculture and disaster assistance. It would then be taken out of \nnext year's authorization.\n  We can't afford to lose the $5.5 billion authorization. But that is \nexactly what we face if we are not able to act. So I don't think we \nhave any alternative, any recourse, except to ensure that the work is \ncomplete before we leave for the August recess.\n  Finally, the Export Administration Act is also in peril. The act \nexpires during the August recess. The administration has indicated this \nis a high priority for them. It is a high priority for our caucus, but \nI think, on a bipartisan basis, Senators on both sides of the aisle \nhave indicated a strong desire not to allow this legislation to expire \nin August. So it is my expectation that it, too, must be dealt with \nprior to the time we leave.\n  In addition, our Republican colleagues have expressed a strong \ninterest in confirming additional nominees, and I have every \nexpectation that we will be doing that as well. In the past 2 weeks, \nthe Senate has now confirmed 77 nominees. I intend to move as many \nadditional nominees to the floor prior to the recess as we can. I have \ndiscussed the matter with each of our Chairs, and they have volunteered \nextensive cooperation in bringing additional nominees to the Executive \nCalendar so we can move on them once the work has been done. To my \nknowledge, except for those nominees for whom there is a Republican \nhold, there are few, if any, nominees who have been on the calendar \nmore than a couple of days. I do believe we owe every Senator the right \nto examine the nominees and to ensure that they are prepared to support \nthem. But I will press for consideration and ultimately confirmation of \nthose nominees prior to the time we leave.\n\n  All of us have August recess plans, but we have to accomplish these \nfour essential items, in addition to the nominations that I want to be \nable to move forward and confirm before we take a vacation. I think we \nhave a fundamental duty not only to build on what we have been able to \ndo in the appropriations process, but also to deal with the many other \nadditional requirements that are pending before the Senate prior to the \ntime we leave.\n  So just to sum up, it is my hope, even though we are not making a lot \nof progress today so far on the Transportation bill, that we can \ncomplete it. I see the distinguished Chair of the subcommittee on HUD/\nVA on the floor. She has indicated that she knows of no significant \nlegislative impediments to consideration of her appropriations bill. So \nat least those two bills will need to be addressed prior to the time we \nleave. And then, of course, as I said, there is the Agriculture \nauthorization supplemental. I can't imagine that anybody would want to \nhold it up or want to delay its implementation. As I have noted, the \nHouse has already acted. It would be our hope and expectation that we \ncannot only act but that we can work out our differences with the House \nin time to assure that this bill is sent to the President before we \nleave. If we fail to do that, of course, we then fail to allocate the \n$5.5 billion committed to emergency agricultural spending in the \nbudget.\n  The Export Administration Act, of course, is also something we need \nto consider. I see the Chair of the Banking Committee, whose \njurisdiction it is, and he has indicated as well his desire to \ncooperate and move forward in a bipartisan way to ensure that we attain \nthat goal.\n  So we have a lot of work to do in 2 weeks. I expect we are going to \nstay in late Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday nights. I think it is \nimportant for us to make full use of this week, and we will be doing \nso. If I am required to file cloture on Transportation by the end of \nthe day, I will do so. I am withholding that at this point because I \nhope that some accommodation can be reached on a vote on whatever \namendments may be offered on Mexican trucking. But we have to get on \nwith our work. We simply can't afford these long delays throughout the \nweek.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/24/senate-section/article/S8103-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8103-S8104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               IN MEMORY OF OFFICERS GIBSON AND CHESTNUT\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, in about 1 minute we will be observing a \nmoment of silence in memory of Officers Gibson and Chestnut.\n  As my colleagues will recall, it was 3 years ago to the minute these \nunfortunate and tragic deaths occurred. I ask at the appropriate time, \nwhich is now, that we observe a moment of silence.\n  (The Senate observed a moment of silence.)\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleagues' and \neveryone's attention. If I may say for a moment, I remember this day 3 \nyears ago as if it occurred just yesterday. I did not know Officers \nGibson and Chestnut personally, but I knew them, and as we all \nrecognize, we take for granted all too often the tremendous service \nprovided to us by our police and by those who guard our security each \nand every day.\n  The loss of life under circumstances such as this is all the more \ntragic when you appreciate their dedication to public service, their \ncommitment to our good health and security, and the recognition that \ntheir families still grieve their loss.\n  I know I speak on behalf of the entire Senate in wishing the families \nof Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut our very best and most \nheartfelt wishes and recognition, once again, of their tremendous \ndedication to public service and their commitment to us and to all \nthose who survive and continue to work each and every day, in keeping \nwith the spirit and dedication that they so ably demonstrated.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Will the distinguished leader yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I associate myself with the words of our \ndistinguished leader. I came over to the Senate for the express purpose \nof this moment.\n  Like the distinguished leader, I recall this tragedy. I had just \narrived in Vermont on that day, and I recall when the police officers \nin the airport said: Senator, have you heard what happened? Any of us \nwho has served in law enforcement has a sense of what goes through \neverybody's mind.\n  I thought of Officer Chestnut who just a few days before as I was \ngoing through the door stopped me and said my wife had just gone \nthrough. We were at some event up here. I do not even remember now what \nthe event was. He said: I sent your wife on up. He said as a joke: You \nmust be late because you are behind her. That is a family thing.\n  Detective Gibson traveled with different groups I had been with when \nwe had hearings outside Washington and had gone with Senators on \ndifferent events. A lot of times we were around when there would be \ndignitaries up here, and he would recognize the different Senators. It \nwas always the same thing: He would see us or a family member: Here, \ncome on through; and he would take care of us.\n  It can sometimes be very easy to take for granted the law enforcement \naround the Capitol. There is a significant law enforcement presence. It \nis, as the distinguished leader said, like family. We see them and are \nwith them, and yet when something such as this happens, you realize \nthey are the line of defense between us and that tiny, tiny, tiny \nfraction of people in this country who would do injury, not to us \nindividually but to really the symbols of our Government.\n  I thank the distinguished leader for his words. I know they are words \nthat\n\n[[Page S8104]]\n\nwill be joined by Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I thank the leader for offering this \nmoment of silence in honor of Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut and \nthe sacrifice they made. It represents the sacrifice so many men and \nwomen make each day in the Capitol so that the Nation's business is \ntransacted.\n  I know both their families, of course, and I know how much the loss \nimpacted them, how deeply they felt it. It is very fitting and \nappropriate that we should just bring our business to a halt, pause, \nand remember their tremendous contribution, their tremendous sacrifice, \nand that of many others who work here each and every day. I thank the \nleader for doing this.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I personally associate myself with the \nleader's remarks and that of my two colleagues. I also knew Officer \nChestnut. He was a Prince George's County guy. In fact, he was days \nfrom retirement. He would probably be fishing on the Chesapeake Bay now \nwith his grandchildren.\n  As we remark and express our gratitude for the men and women who \nprotect us every day, we also have to think about their spouses, and we \nneed to think about their children. They would not be here without \ntheir love and support. This is why, as we honor those who protect us, \nwe also remember the families who support them so they can do so.\n  I thank the leader for pausing, and God bless the souls of those men, \nand God bless the men and women who protect us and their families.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield to the Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, I had occasion with four distinguished \nSenators to travel through Vermont. We had Detective Gibson and Officer \nChestnut travel with us to ensure our security. They were wonderful and \nmost efficient. In fact, it is not easy to maneuver four Senators \naround and keep track of them and their spouses and keep them on \nschedule.\n  We got to feeling closer to them under those circumstances. They were \ntwo wonderful men. I feel a certain sadness of the memories connected \nwith that. They were truly wonderful, and their families, of course, we \nall got to know after this tragedy. They are fantastic people.\n  I echo the comments of the Senators from Maryland in making sure we \nwatch out for them.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Vermont.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson).

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \nwonderful American, an absolute giant in the field of journalism, and \nsomeone who broke through barriers for women all across this country, \nWashington Post publisher Katharine Meyer Graham.\n  There is little that has not been said over the last few days about \nKay Graham and the remarkable life she led as a citizen of the Nation's \nCapital and the world. Although she was born into a well-off family and \nattended exclusive schools, Kay Graham did not retreat into a world of \nprivilege and leisure. After graduating from the University of Chicago \nin 1938, she worked as a reporter for the San Francisco News. Not able \nto stay away from Washington for long, she returned the following year \nand took a job in the editorial and circulation departments of the \nWashington Post.\n  Kay Graham then began the next phase of her life, marrying Philip \nGraham who had clerked in the Supreme Court. Soon after their marriage, \nPhil Graham joined the Army Air Corps and Katherine followed him to \nmilitary posts in South Dakota and Pennsylvania. A devoted wife and \nmother, she dedicated the next 20 years to her family as she brought up \nher four children: Lally, Donald, William, and Stephen.\n  Tragedy thrust Kay Graham into a role she never envisioned for \nherself. After the death of her husband in August of 1963, she took \nover the helm of the Washington Post and then proceeded to build the \ncompany into one of the finest news organizations and businesses in our \ncountry. When she took over as president of the Post, it was still a \nrelatively small organization consisting of the newspaper, Newsweek \nmagazine, and two television stations. It was Kay Graham and her \nassociates who built the company into the publishing giant it is today. \nBy emphasizing both scrupulous news reporting and attention to the \nbottom line, she was able to attract advertisers, investors, and \nreaders alike, all while adhering to the highest journalistic \nstandards. Kay Graham built the Washington Post into a Fortune 500 \ncompany and she was the first woman to lead a Fortune 500 enterprise.\n  Despite, or perhaps because of, her dedication to the family \nbusiness, Kay Graham was willing to risk it all in pursuit of a news \nstory that needed to be told. Many have spoken of the courageous \neditorial decisions she made when the Washington Post published the \nPentagon Papers, and later when it led the investigation into the \nWatergate break-in. In both cases, Kay Graham bravely stood up to \npressure and, indeed, intimidation from the highest levels of \nGovernment, risking in a sense her livelihood to ensure that the public \nlearned the truth.\n  It is sometimes now difficult, being beyond that period, to \nappreciate the import and significance of those decisions. But at the \ntime, her decision to pursue those critical stories was filled with \nperil, and she set an example for the country by coming through that \ndifficult period like the true champion she was.\n  Kay Graham was an irreplaceable participant in the Washington \ncommunity and on the world stage. She formed close friendships with \npolitical leaders on both sides of the aisle, with business leaders, \nwith world dignitaries. Many of us had the privilege, on occasion, to \ndiscuss complicated and complex policy issues with Kay Graham, and we \ndeeply appreciated her keen intellect and her thoughtful insights into \nthe problems of the day. And throughout her life, she maintained a \ngrace and sense of humor that endeared her to all that had the \nprivilege of knowing Katherine Graham. She will be missed, not only as \na reporter of the news but also as someone who truly contributed to the \ndialog of world affairs.\n  In 1991, she stepped down as chief executive of the Washington Post, \nand in 1993 resigned her position as chair. Yet even ``in retirement'' \nshe remained an active member of the Post's board of directors, \nchairing its executive committee and maintaining an office at the \nWashington Post until her death last week. She also found time during \nthis period to write her memoirs, an exceedingly moving story entitled \n``Personal History,'' which won the Pulitzer prize for biography in \n1998.\n  The achievements of Kay Graham were tremendous and her dedicated \nservice to the Washington Post, to our Capital City, and to our Nation, \nare great indeed. She will be sorely missed by all of us. She kept us \ninformed, led our community, shared her wisdom, and was our friend.\n\n[[Page S8105]]\n\n  I extend my deepest sympathies to her family and her many devoted \ncolleagues at the Washington Post.\n  Mr. President, I have an editorial which appeared in the Baltimore \nSun about Kay Graham entitled ``Industry Titan, Publishers courage and \njudgment made one newspaper great, others stronger.'' It is a wonderful \ntribute, as it is from a peer. I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I close with this thought. It is \nindicative of her wonderful accomplishments with respect to the \nWashington Post that one can say, as I say now with confidence, that \nthe Post will continue to be a great newspaper. Kay Graham \ninstitutionalized the Washington Post as a great organ for truth and \nfor responsible journalism. As one thinks back on her legacy, perhaps \none of its most significant aspects is that we can look forward in the \nexpectation that the newspaper she built will continue to be one of the \nworld's great newspapers because of the standards she established and \nthe legacy she has left.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, July 18, 2001]\n\n                          Katharine M. Graham\n\n       Industry titan: Publisher's courage and judgment made one \n     newspaper great, others stronger\n       U.S. newspapers are better and stronger because of what \n     Katharine M. Graham did at the Washington Post. Her death at \n     84 deprives the industry of a giant.\n       The core of her achievement was in three gut-wrenching, \n     high-risk decisions made from 1971 to 1975.\n       In the first, she agreed over legal advice that the Post \n     would print the Pentagon Papers, prepared from government \n     documents detailing U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, \n     after the New York Times was enjoined from doing so. Other \n     papers followed, and the precedent of prior censorship was \n     undone.\n       The second was to support dogged investigative reporting of \n     the burglary of the burglary of the Democratic National \n     Committee, in behalf of President Richard Nixon, as it turned \n     out, during the 1972 election campaign. What the Post, courts \n     and Congress learned forced Mr. Nixon's resignation.\n       The third, in 1975, was to respond to sabotage of presses \n     by striking pressmen with a determination to publish with \n     nonunion pressmen and defeat such tactics.\n       The decision were connected. Without the first, she might \n     not have stuck with the second, or without that triumph, the \n     third.\n       Katharine Meyer, born in 1917, never intended such a role \n     in national life. Her financier father bought the failing \n     newspaper in 1933. She married a brilliant young lawyer, \n     Philip Graham, whom her father made associate publisher, \n     later publisher.\n       His progressive mental illness and suicide in 1963 \n     propelled her timidly into his shoes if only to save the \n     newspaper for the family. The rest is not merely history; it \n     is her 1997 Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir, Personal History.\n       As publisher and chief executive until turning power over \n     to her son, Donald, in 1991, Mrs. Graham built a media \n     empire. At its heart was a newspaper that penetrated its \n     market as no other and that grew into one of the world's \n     best.\n       Mrs. Graham was a power in Washington, and a force in \n     publishing--positive in both spheres--until her death \n     following a fall in Sun Valley, Idaho. Her good works survive \n     her.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I intend to speak on the pending Murray \namendment. I ask unanimous consent to take as much time as I might \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we just concluded a meeting with several \nMembers who were involved in this matter, including the distinguished \nminority whip, Senator Reid. I thank Senator Shelby, who was \nresponsible for this meeting. I think it was helpful. Representatives \nof the administration were there. I think at least we were able to \nestablish lines of communication and dialog on this important issue.\n  Before I discuss the proposed McCain-Gramm substitute that we may be \nproposing, depending on the status of negotiations, I wish to emphasize \nthe importance of this issue. Here we are on an appropriations bill--an \nappropriations bill--a piece of legislation that profoundly affects, in \nmy view and perhaps far more important the view of the administration, \nprofoundly affects a solemn trade agreement entered into between three \nnations: United States, Mexico, and Canada. Here we are debating a \nprovision on an appropriations bill that is supposed to pay for the \ntransportation needs of this country.\n  I say again to my colleagues, this is the wrong way to do business. \nSo, therefore, because of the deep concerns that I, Senator Gramm, \nSenator Bond, Senator Domenici, and many others have, we have to do \nwhat we can to see that this appropriations bill does not have language \nin it which, as I say, in my view and that of the administration and \nobjective observers, is in violation of the North American Free Trade \nAgreement. That is why we here have been tied up now for a couple of \ndays and will continue to be so, unless we can come to some agreement \nthat will satisfy the concerns we have that we would be violating the \ntrade agreement.\n  I remind my colleagues again, a panel already has declared the United \nStates is in violation of NAFTA because of our failure to allow carrier \ncrossings.\n  We could be subject to sanctions to the tune of billions of dollars \nimposed by the Mexican Government. I hasten to add the Mexican \nGovernment has not threatened us, but we could be liable for that.\n  I hope our negotiations can continue. I hope that the advice of the \nsenior advisers to the President recommending a veto of the bill in its \npresent form will not happen. There are much needed transportation \nprojects in this appropriations bill, and, in my own view, some that \nare not needed. But I will not go into that at this particular time.\n  The fact is that we need to negotiate. The areas of disagreement are \nnot that great, but they are significant.\n  There are 22 provisions in this legislation which cumulatively would \nensure that it would be impossible to implement the carrier truck \ncrossings for 2 or maybe as much as 3 years. I hope we can get this \nworked out. As I say, our differences are not that great.\n  Unlike the House provisions, this legislation provides significant \nfunding to enable the Department of Transportation to hire and train \nmore safety inspectors and to build more inspection facilities at the \nsouthern border. I strongly commend the committee for this action.\n  However, as I previously explained, I have concerns over a number of \nrequirements included in the bill that if enacted without \nmodifications, could effectively prevent the opening of the border \nindefinitely. My concerns are shared by other colleagues and the \nadministration.\n  The administration estimates the Senate provisions under section 343 \nwould result in a further delay in opening the border for another 2 \nyears or more. This would be a direct violation of NAFTA. It \neffectively provides a blanket prohibition from allowing any Mexican \nmotor carrier from operating beyond the commercial zones. This view is \nshared by a number of us, as well as the President's senior advisors, \nwho have clearly indicated they will recommend the President veto this \nif it includes either the House-passed or pending Senate language.\n  I recognize that at first glance, many of the requirements in section \n343 appear reasonable. However, I am informed by DOT officials that it \nsimply cannot fulfill all 22 requirements imposed by section 343 in the \nnear term. To quote from the Statement of Administration Policy, \ntransmitted to the Senate last Thursday.\n\n       The Senate Committee has adopted provisions that could \n     cause the United States to violate our commitments under \n     NAFTA. Unless changes are made to the Senate bill, the \n     President's senior advisors will recommend that the President \n     veto the bill.\n\n  There may be debate back and forth as to whether these provisions in \nsection 343 of the bill are in compliance with NAFTA. The fact is that \nthe senior advisers to the President of the United States have \ndetermined that it places us out of compliance. Therefore, that \ndiscussion becomes somewhat academic, if the President is going to veto \nthe bill.\n  I would like to discuss the provisions of concern, and explain how \nour amendment proposes to address those concerns while seeking to \nretain the underlying intent of the provisions, at\n\n[[Page S8106]]\n\nleast in the context of safety. It is very important to point out that \nlike the committee's approach, our amendment goes much further than the \nDOT had planned to go based on its May 2001, Federal Register notice of \nproposed rulemaking on how it would address cross border safety. But \nour approach would not prevent the border opening indefinitely.\n  First, section 343 requires the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration to conduct a full safety compliance review before \ngranting conditional operating authority and again before granting \npermanent authority and to assign a safety rating to the carrier. The \nreviews must be conducted onsite in Mexico.\n  The problem with that requirement is that a compliance review \nassesses carrier performance while operating in the United States. It \nis conducted when a carrier's performance indicates a problem--that it \nis at risk. As a technical matter, a full fledged compliance review of \na Mexican carrier would be meaningless since that carrier won't have \nbeen operating in this country and won't have the type of performance \ndata that is audited during a compliance review. If DOT is forced to \nconduct what would largely be a meaningless compliance review, every \ncarrier will receive a satisfactory rating because there will be no \nrecords or data from which to find violations of the Federal Motor \nCarrier Safety Regulations.\n  Further, DOT estimates it would cost $40 million if it is required to \nperform a compliance review of every carrier seeking operating \nauthority and another $10 million to perform such a review onsite. \nTherefore, the Senate bill would need an additional $50 million if DOT \nis to carry out this largely meaningless mandate.\n  A workable alternative, however, would be to require a safety review, \nas included in our amendment. It is far more prescriptive than the type \nof review mentioned in the May 2001, notice of proposed rulemaking \nregarding implementation of NAFTA's cross border provisions. It would \nprovide for a review of available performance data and safety \nmanagement programs, including drug and alcohol testing; drivers' \nqualifications; drivers' house-of-service records; vehicle inspection \nrecords, proof of insurance, and other information necessary to \ndetermine the carrier's preparedness to comply with Federal motor \ncarrier safety rules and regulations. If warranted by safety \nconsiderations or the availability of safety performance data, the \nreview should be conducted onsite.\n  I believe a safety review would go a long way in addressing the \nsafety considerations and would likely provide the verification of data \nthe managers of the bill are seeking. Frankly, it requires substantial \nanalysis that is not imposed upon United States or Canadian carriers, \nwho only need to complete an application available online and transmit \nit to DOT along with $300. I am very hopeful the Mexican Government \nwill be willing to accept the type of approach described in our \namendment, even though it would treat Mexican carriers substantially \ndifferent than United States or Canadian carriers.\n  Second, the administration has raised concerns with the proposed \nrequirement that each and every time a truck crosses the border, it \nmust electronically verify the driver's commercial driver's license, \nCDL. The DOT has expressed considerable concern that such a requirement \nwould significantly impede the flow of traffic and commerce at the \nborder. Backups can already exceed more than 4 hours at some crossings \nin Texas. DOT has estimated such backups would increase immensely. The \nidling vehicles would obviously have an enormous impact on the \nenvironment. DOT also estimates the cost of electronic verification at \nall 27 crossings at $14.6 million.\n  It is important to note, we do not verify every license of every \nCanadian driver that crosses the northern border. I believe it would be \ndiscriminatory to check every single Mexican driver's license when we \ndo not check other operators in this country. I believe it sends a \nsignal we do not want to send and strongly caution all of my colleagues \non this proposal.\n\n  As an alternative, our amendment would require that each truck that \nwill be operating beyond the commercial zones to be inspected prior to \noperating in this country and that during such an inspection, the \ninspector would verify the driver's CDL. Each vehicle must display a \nvalid Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance, CVSA, decal obtained as a \nresult of a level I or level V North American Standard Inspection. It \nis important to note that vehicles must be reinspected every 90 days to \nbe valid.\n  Let me point out the Senator from Washington has offered an amendment \nto also require vehicle inspections. I suspect she developed the \namendment after hearing last week that our amendment would include this \nimportant safety feature.\n  In further regard to verifying a driver's CDL, our amendment calls \nfor DOT to institute a policy for random electronic or other \nverification of the license of drivers crossing at the border. This \nwould be far less discriminatory, and would not have as great an impact \non crossing delays.\n  Let me also point out that the record of Mexican drivers is better \nthan that of either Canadian or United States drivers. Based on the \navailable data provided by DOT, the out of service rate for Mexican \ndrivers is 6 percent; it is 8 percent for United States drivers; and \n9.5 percent for Canadian drivers. If the managers of this bill are \nconcerned about drivers, perhaps they need to first focus on where the \ngreatest safety problem appears to exist.\n  Third, section 343 would require all border crossings be equipped \nwith both weigh-in-motion, WIM, systems and fixed scales and that every \ncommercial truck crossing the southern border must be weighed. This \nrequirement raises significant cost, space, and time considerations. \nDOT contends it would result in extensive construction and could \npostpone the border opening until 2003.\n  Weight enforcement has historically been a state enforcement \nresponsibility, which is one of the reasons weigh stations are located \nthroughout every state.\n  In the border States, for example, each State already has numerous \nweigh stations. California has 62 fixed scales and 10 weigh-in-motion \nsystems. Arizona has 20 fixed scales and 5 weigh-in-motion systems. New \nMexico has 12 fixed scales and 2 weigh-in-motion systems. Texas has 47 \nfixed scales and 2 weigh-in-motion systems.\n  The estimates cost of standard weigh-in-motion installation for a 4-\nlane configuration is $715,000. And while such systems help determine \nwhether a truck should be weighed, a citation cannot be issued off the \nreading of weigh-in-motion equipment. FHWA further estimates the cost \nof installing fixed scales approximately $2 to $3 million each.\n\n  I note such a requirement is not imposed on trucks entering the \nUnited States from Canada. Moreover, this mandate simply is not the \nbest use of limited resources. One crossing only had 198 trucks cross \nlast year. I question the logic of requiring both a fixed-scale and \nweight-in-motion system at such a location. At a minimum, shouldn't we \nfirst be concerned about those locations with the greatest volume of \ntraffic?\n  Our amendment would require each crossing to have a means of weighing \na carrier and for DOT to initiate a study to determine which crossings \nshould also be equipped with weight-in-motion systems that would enable \nState inspectors to verify the weight of each vehicle. It would not \nshift weight enforcement responsibilities from the States to the \nFederal Government, nor would it mandate that all 17 crossings have \nequipment that may not be needed.\n  Fourth, section 343 restricts a carrier's insurance provider to be \nbased in the United States. While I am not opposed to requiring proof \nof valid insurance and for the insurance provider to be licensed in the \nUnited States, limiting providers to only those based in the United \nStates would prevent a number of large providers from providing \ninsurance, including Lloyds of London which covers many Canadian \ncarriers. I am informed this could also raise issues with regard to \nNAFTA and WTO obligations. Therefore, our amendment would strike the \nproposed requirement for an insurance provider to be based in the \nUnited States.\n  Fifth, section 343 would prevent compliance with our NAFTA \nobligations until the Federal Motor Carrier Safety\n\n[[Page S8107]]\n\nAdministration completes six rulemakings or policy implementations \nrequired under the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999. \nClearly, an agency should be held accountable to fulfill the \nobligations imposed on it. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration is no exception.\n  Perhaps if the previous administration had ever nominated an \nAdministrator to provide leadership over this agency, the rulemakings \nwould have been carried out in a more timely manner. After all, the \ndriving force behind its creation was the overwhelming evidence that \nmotor carrier safety was in dire need of leadership. Yet President \nBush's nomination of Joe Clapp to be Administrator of the Federal Motor \nCarrier Safety Administration last week marks the first time we will \nhave had the opportunity to consider and confirm an administrator for \nthis critical post.\n  Perhaps if the Senate would confirm the pending nominee to head the \nDepartment of Transportation's General Counsel's Office, the Department \nwould be better equipped to complete these and other pending \nrulemakings. It is ironic to me that the proponents of section 343 are \ncritizincig the current administration for the lack of action by the \nformer, while at the same time holding up the current confirmation \nprocess.\n  Our amendment proposes to require DOT to issue several policies that \nwe believe can readily be issued before the end of the year, including \na policy requiring motor carrier safety inspectors to be on duty during \nall operating hours at all southern border crossings used by commercial \nvehicles; a policy to establish standards to help determine the \nappropriate number of Federal and State motor carrier inspectors for \nthe southern border; and a policy to prohibit foreign motor carriers \nfrom operating in the United States that are found to have operated \nhere illegally.\n  Our amendment further instructs the Department to complete the \nremaining three rulemakings listed in section 343. If the Department is \nunable to do so, which may be the case since there are holds on the \npending nominee responsible for the rulemakings, it is to transmit to \nthe Congress, within 30 days after the date of enactment of this act, a \nnotice in writing that it will not be able to complete any of the \nrulemakings prior to the opening of the border that explains why it \nwill not be able to complete the rulemaking, and the precise date it \nexpects to complete the rulemaking. I am concerned that as much as DOT \nmay want to finish these rulemakings, given the lack of a general \ncounsel and other staffing considerations as a result of the \ntransition, they simply might not be able to do so. Our ability to \nfulfill our NAFTA obligations should not be delayed by congressional \n``holds.''\n  Sixth, section 343 requires the DOT inspector general to certify in \nwriting that eight conditions have been met prior to permitting the \nPresident to open the border. Unfortunately, a number of the directives \nare, in my judgment, inappropriate requirements for an inspector \ngeneral. I do not believe it would be appropriate for the IG to be \nrequired to certify certain actions of the Mexican Government. Nor do I \nthink it would be appreciated if someone from the Mexican Government \nwere making pronouncements about our practices, all contingent upon \ncompliance with our NAFTA obligations.\n  Moreover, both the DOT Secretary and the DOT Inspector General \nbelieve these provisions call for inappropriate operational management \nby the inspector general. These proposed functions go beyond the scope \nof authorized activities in the Inspector General Act. Implementation \nof the NAFTA cross-border trucking provisions should not be conditioned \non actions by the Inspector General.\n  We have the greatest respect for the work of the Office of the \nInspector General. Therefore, our amendment would instead direct the \ninspector general to report on the number of Federal motor carrier \nsafety inspectors hired, trained as safety specialists, and prepared to \nbe on duty during hours of operation at the southern border by January \n1, 2002; and to provide periodic reports on several other border-\nrelated issues. These would include reporting on, No. 1, the adequacy \nof the number of Federal and State inspectors at the United States-\nMexican border; No. 2, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety \nAdministration's enforcement of hours-of-service rules; No. 3, whether \nUnited States and Mexican enforcement databases are sufficiently \nintegrated and accessible to ensure that licenses, vehicle \nregistrations, and insurance information can be verified at border \ncrossing or by mobile enforcement units; and No. 4, the level of \ncapacity at each southern border crossing used by commercial vehicles \nto conduct a sufficient number of vehicle safety inspections and to \naccommodate vehicles placed out-of-service as a result of the \ninspections.\n\n  We believe these reports would be very useful to the Secretary and \nthe Congress as we all work to ensure that adequate safety enforcement \nefforts by the States and Federal Government are being carried out as \nwe fulfill our NAFTA commitments.\n  Finally, section 343 would define the term ``Mexican Motor carrier'' \nas a ``Mexico-domiciled motor carrier operating beyond the United \nStates municipalities and commercial zones on the United States-Mexico \nborder.'' Based on this definition, nearly the entire section would \nonly be applicable to carriers that had been operating illegally in \nthis country and a few that have authority. I am confident this is not \nthe Appropriation Committee's intent and note there was an effort to \nstrike the definition with a technical amendment on Friday.\n  However, striking that definition might then impose many of the \nrequirements on those carriers that will only be operating in the \ncommercial zones, as well as on United States and Canadian vehicles. \nThe focus of this provision was to have been aimed at the long-haul \ncarriers. The definition must be modified to clarify the intent. The \nprovision should only apply to those motor carriers domiciled in Mexico \nthat seek authority to operate beyond municipalities and commercial \nzones on the United States-Mexico border and only to those vehicles \nthat will be operating beyond the municipalities and commercial zones.\n  We must allow Department of Transportation sufficient flexibility to \neffectively administer its motor carrier safety enforcement \nresponsibilities. The language in section 343 does not meet that \nstandard. I urge my colleagues to support modifications to section 343. \nWithout changes, we can look forward to a veto of this bill. I would \nnot suggest the managers take the risk that we would not have the votes \nto sustain the President's first veto.\n  Mr. President, I again thank Senator Reid, Senator Shelby, and others \nfor beginning a dialog on this very important issue. During the meeting \na suggestion was made that all of the provisions be dropped from the \nappropriations bill--which I think would be entirely appropriate \nbecause they are legislating on an appropriations bill--and the Senate \nand House go to conference with the onerous and unacceptable House \nprovision in it. That is perfectly acceptable to me because there is \nnothing I can do as a Member of this body to affect what the other body \ndoes.\n  But as long as we have these provisions, the 22 provisions which \ncumulatively, in the view of the senior advisers to the President, make \nNAFTA unable to be implemented for at least 2 or 3 years, then we shall \nhave to continue the parliamentary process.\n  So I think there are a number of options available, including \ndropping the entire language, which is what a senior Member has \nproposed, which I agree with, and let it go to conference with the \nother body, or accept specific amendments. Another amendment the \nSenator from Texas, Mr. Gramm, has is to make sure Mexico is treated, \nin whatever implementation of NAFTA is accomplished, on an equal basis \nwith the United States and Canada. I think that would be a very \nimportant amendment because we can't send a signal that we are somehow \ndiscriminating against one of the signatories of the North American \nFree Trade Agreement.\n\n  So I hope we can get this worked out. I hope my colleagues will \nunderstand, in our desire to complete this legislation, the importance \nof this issue to all Americans, but particularly those of us from \nborder States, because we are the ones who have been most impacted by \nthe North American Free Trade Agreement. We will be the most impacted \non the border with implementation of that\n\n[[Page S8108]]\n\nagreement, so we look with concern to the legislation before this body.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM.

Mr. President, 1 week ago today Katharine Graham died. \nYesterday, she was buried next to her husband, my half brother, Philip \nGraham. I have known Katharine for all but 3 years of my life. She \nmarried Phil in 1940, after what might be called a whirlwind courtship. \nAfter the honeymoon she came and, for the first time, visited her new \nin-laws. I was 3 years old at the time.\n  Mr. President, I was not a good boy at the age of 3. Some would \nsuggest that there has not been much improvement in the intervening \nyears. But my first encounter with Kay, as recorded in her memoirs, was \nas she sat at the desk writing her thank-you notes for her wedding. I \ntoddled up and, I regret to say, spat upon Kay. She went to my mother \nand asked what was the significance of this behavior. My mother said, \n``Don't worry, he does that to lots of people.'' Despite that \ninauspicious beginning, this became a wonderful relationship that added \nmuch to my knowledge, to my values, to my appreciation and joy of life.\n  I was one of many thousands who had the opportunity to know Katharine \nGraham and be influenced by her exceptional personality. There have \nbeen many statements made about Kay in the last week, describing her \nrange of accomplishments. I want to talk about Kay as a journalist and \nteacher. She understood the role of journalism in American life--to \nprovide people the knowledge they would require to be empowered to be \neffective citizens in a democracy.\n  It is not the purpose of journalism to tell people how to think, or \nto select what information should be available to them. Rather, it is \nthe purpose of journalism to provide the readers the full range of \ninformation from which they can make their own judgments.\n  Kay also led by example. The standards she set and lived by were \nthemselves an important part of her role as journalist and teacher.\n  She liked politicians. Those who attended or observed yesterday's \nfuneral service saw the number of people from this institution, current \nand past, and from other political segments of our society, who were \nthere to honor her and to represent the friendships they had \nestablished.\n  She understood, in a way that my brother Phil probably did not, that \npoliticians and journalists have different responsibilities in our \ndemocracy. Though they do not have to be adversaries, each side must be \ncareful not to compromise their particular responsibility in an effort \nto be excessively deferential or even excessively friendly with the \nother side of that delicate occasion.\n  I think if Kay were here, she might agree that there are some \nparticular aspects of her life which she has shared with people in our \nprofession of politics. She might even admit that those aspects provide \nlessons from which we can and should learn.\n  The first is the lesson of compromise. Midway through her remarkable \ncareer as publisher of the Washington Post, Kay wrote about the \nimportance of compromise in our democracy. This was at a time when some \nwere saying that compromise was a sign of weakness, and that to give in \nto the other side, to not demand absolute concurrence with your stated \nbeliefs, was a sign of weakness. As Kay so properly observed, that is a \ndistortion of democracy. Democracy is a government of the people. By \nnecessity, it requires all the people, representing all of their \ndifferent backgrounds, values, perspectives and aspirations, to find a \ncommon ground upon which we can then move forward. Compromise is not a \nsign of weakness, it is a sign of the strength of our unique form of \ngovernment.\n  Kay believed in this in her personal behavior. If you had been \nfortunate to have dinner at her table, there were a number of rules her \nguests were expected to follow. One of those rules was that you did not \nengage in a series of one-on-one conversations with the person who \nmight be seated to your left or to your right, but rather the whole \ntable was encouraged to bring the conversation to the center so that \neveryone would share what was being said, and by that sharing, the \nlevel of the conversation would be elevated and the value would be \nenhanced. Kay was a strong believer in encouraging effective \nparticipatory discussions, which would lead to those compromises and, \nin turn, lead to policies that would enhance our society.\n  Kay also was a person of great self-confidence. I believe one of the \ngreat attributes of a human being, particularly a human being who lives \nin the public arena, is non-arrogant self-confidence, which I would \ndefine as meaning that you have a set of core values, that you are not \na person who waits for the next wind to come and fill your sail, but \nthat you also understand your own limitations and are open to new \ninformation, to new perspectives on the information you already have. \nIf such a person can be convinced over time that a previous position \ndeserves to be modified based on new information, that person is \nprepared to do so.\n  Kay had many times in her life when she was challenged to exercise \nthat principle of non-arrogant self-confidence. Probably the most \nstressful period in her life, and the period of her life that has \nreceived great recognition now in her passing, was the time that \nsurrounded the Vietnam war through the Watergate era.\n  At one point, when things were particularly tense and it appeared as \nif the Washington Post alone--and she alone as the leader of the \nWashington Post--were under unusual duress, she asked of her colleagues \nat the Post: If we're so sure we're right, where is everybody else? Why \naren't there some other people, some other newspapers that are prepared \nto pick up this same cause? That question could have led to a decision \nto abandon the cause because of its loneliness. Instead, she saw it as \na challenge and recognized an even greater necessity to proceed.\n  We in politics from time to time may find ourselves as the only one \nor a member of a very small minority on a particular point of view. We \nmust have enough self-confidence in our judgment and values that we are \nprepared to persist, and frequently, by so persisting, we will alter \nthe opinion of others. At the very least, in the examination of \nhistory, we may have the experience of having our positions validated.\n  A third quality that Kay represented and which I suggest is a \nvaluable quality for those in the profession of politics is a \ncommitment to lifelong growth. There is a tendency in any area of human \nendeavor, but I think it is a particularly persistent one in politics, \nfor people to reach a certain level of achievement and accomplishment, \nthen say ``this is the position I will hold for the rest of my life.' \nOften, as people become more powerful in political positions, they also \nbecome narrower in terms of their own sense of the challenge of \nconstant growth.\n  The Greeks recognized this over 2,000 years ago. One of the ways they \ntried to overcome this tendency was to require that all of the citizens \nof Greece periodically leave behind their trappings of power, prestige, \nand wealth and take on all of the tasks the Greek Republic required. It \nmight be a menial task of working in the sewer plant of Athens, or it \nmight be as commander of the Athenian Navy. The belief was that any \nwell, liberally educated Greek citizen was capable of performing any \ntask that would be assigned to them.\n  In many ways, Kay lived a life that had that Athenian sense of what a \nliberated, educated Athenian could do and how they might live their \nlife in order to constantly challenge the perimeters that others would \nlike to put around them.\n  She lived, in essence, over her 84 years two lives. Her first life \nfor approximately 40 years was as a young\n\n[[Page S8109]]\n\ngirl born to privilege, a wife, a mother, a person content to live in \ncomfort, to live in the background, to eat at the women's table, to \nlive in a woman's world.\n  For the next 40 years, she was a woman, through tragedy, called upon \nto suddenly take on enormous responsibility. She had to learn, and \nlearn fast, about the business and about journalism. She had to learn \nabout the intersection of journalism and politics. She learned about \nthe reality of the role of women in all of these worlds, and she \nmastered them greatly.\n  In her seventies she learned about herself. She committed to write \nher memoirs with the idea that they would give to her children and \ngrandchildren and future generations an insight on her, her family, her \nhusband, her mother and father, those things that had influenced her \nlife. She decided to do this without the assistance of a ghostwriter or \nsomeone who would put her words on paper. Rather, she took up pen and \nyellow paper and for 7 years wrote her memoirs.\n  At the conclusion, she had accomplished her objective of having \nplaced for all time her life on paper. She also saw some results which \nwere probably unexpected. She changed the way that many women looked at \nthemselves and looked at their possibilities.\n  Yesterday, at the funeral, a woman in a wheelchair told me about how \nmuch Kay Graham's life had meant to her when she was unexpectedly \nhandicapped. She thought she had lost the opportunity to challenge \nherself or reach for her potential. Through Kay's example, she gained a \nrenewed confidence her own potential.\n  Kay's memoirs also changed the way in which we think about the \nwriting of autobiographies. It is not a book of histrionics. It is not \na book meant to make people necessarily feel good or to placate and to \nsoften events in the past. It is written with a directness of one \nfriend talking to another with great candor. And it also was a lesson \nof what is possible.\n  At the age of 80, after 80 years of living, including 7 years of \nwriting, Kay's memoirs won the Pulitzer Prize. What an enormous \nstatement about a life which at every stage is one of growth and \nunwillingness to accept limitations.\n  I believe these examples of the lessons of compromise, of self-\nconfidence, and of constant life growth are just part of the legacy \nthat Katharine Graham has given to our society. I believe in these she \nspeaks particularly to those in our profession of politics. Their \nproper learning and absorption will be of great value to us.\n  These are examples I will be honored to attempt to emulate. My only \nregret is that she will not be here to critique my performance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues today in \npaying tribute to a great woman, Katharine Meyer Graham, whose untimely \npassing saddens those of us who had the pleasure, indeed the privilege, \nof knowing her. Her courage, determination and style are an inspiration \nto all of us in public service.\n  There are far too many cynics in this town, and unfortunately, there \nis far too much to be cynical about. But, at the end of the day, it is \npeople like Kay Graham who have inspired and mentored a new generation \nof idealism, of American youths who strive to be the very best in all \ntheir chosen fields of endeavor. And that is the true story behind her \nunflagging support of two young, obscure, city-desk reporters who broke \na story that changed our Nation forever.\n  There is much I will miss about Kay Graham. I could talk for hours \nabout her many outstanding accomplishments, as a wife, a mother, and a \npublisher. But she was also a true and loyal friend to many, an \nincredible force for good. Kay was one of the most powerful women in \nour world, but what I remember most about her is that she was genuinely \na nice person.\n  And so, today, let us pay tribute to Kay Graham's greatness and \ngoodness, in public and in private. I hope the world will also learn a \nlittle more about her kindness, her humility, and the sense of charity \nthat never left her.\n  Mr. President, one of the most touching tributes I can recall vividly \ndescribes the cycle of life and our profound transition. It likens our \npassage to the journey of a magnificent sailing ship, gliding through \ndeep blue water, growing smaller and smaller as the sea meets the sky. \nAnd when the ship fades silently from sight, just as we think she is \ngone, we are reassured to know that on the opposite shore . . . she \nawaits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/24/senate-section/article/S8109-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

We \nknow of two amendments that will be offered. We will expect rollcall \nvotes on those amendments sometime after 6:30 this evening. Beyond \nthat, there may be other amendments as well. But we will have \nadditional votes tonight.\n  Senators ought to come to the floor. As I say, I reluctantly will \nfile cloture with the hope that perhaps it could be vitiated if we can \nreach some agreement. But barring that, we will expect a cloture vote \non Thursday. We would expect, as well, that Senators who have \namendments that may not be germane postcloture can come to the floor, \noffer them, have them debated, and certainly have a vote on them as \nwell.\n  So tomorrow we will be devoting time to amendments. If amendments are \nnot offered, it would be my expectation that we would take up at least \none, if not more, of the controversial nominations that might require \nsome debate time. But we will address that in greater detail at a later \nmoment.\n  At this point, I encourage Senators to come to the floor because we \nare entertaining amendments. We expect to offer a couple. As I said, we \nwill have rollcall votes later on this evening.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka). We are in a period of morning \nbusiness.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Murray. I commend her for \nthe excellent job she has done on this bill. This is an extremely \nimportant measure. She has done a first-rate job handling it. We \nappreciate it in the Pacific Northwest and across this country.\n  I want to take a few minutes tonight to discuss the situation that \nthe flying public is facing as they look at using our airlines and our \nsystem of aviation this summer. Unfortunately, so many Americans are \ngoing to face long and tedious hours stranded in overcrowded airports. \nIn many instances, they are not even going to have the basic courtesy \nof straight information about their flights, cancellations, and \nimportant details that are so essential to them when they make their \nplans.\n\n[[Page S8110]]\n\n  It seems to me the central aviation problem today is that there are \nno consequences for this flagrant mistreatment of passengers. There \nreally is no accountability. While this problem is extremely \ncomplicated, clearly demand exceeds supply in this country. We need \nmore runways. We need better air traffic control. But you do not have \nto pour more concrete to start telling passengers the truth about their \ntravel options in the United States.\n  Again and again we find that passengers are kept in the dark. They \nare not told when a flight is overbooked. For example, I have no \nproblem with the airline selling a ticket to a passenger on an \noverbooked flight, but I think the passenger has a right to know that \nflight is overbooked. The inspector general found repeatedly that the \nairlines would know hours ahead of time that a flight was going to be \nsignificantly delayed by 2 or 3 hours. Yet the airlines would not go \nout and change the departure board.\n  It seems to me what we ought to require, in an area that is extremely \ncomplicated, is that passengers at least have a right to know what \ntheir travel options are. Senator Reid and Senator McCain and I have \nbeen working together very closely for several years now. A bill has \ncleared the Senate Commerce Committee under the leadership of Chairman \nHollings and Senator McCain. Under normal circumstances I would offer a \nmeasure that would ensure passengers have these basic rights as they \nfly this summer in what proves to be a pretty exasperating travel \nseason for millions of Americans. But, frankly, I do not like to \nlegislate on an appropriations bill.\n  I think Chairman Hollings and Senator McCain and Senator Reid, our \nbipartisan group that has worked in this area, has put together a very \ngood bill. It has passed the Senate Commerce Committee unanimously.\n  Suffice it to say, the chair of the Senate Transportation Committee \nhas enough headaches in handling this legislation right now as to not \nput yet another challenge on the bill. But I will tell you my patience \nwith respect to this matter is growing pretty thin.\n\n  Senator McCain and I introduced the first bipartisan passenger rights \nlegislation back in 1999. The airlines then said there really was no \nproblem. They said this was just an anecdotal situation and there \nreally was not a problem.\n  Then, as the evidence began to pour in that this problem was \nsystemwide, they said the answer is a voluntary approach. Just keep the \nU.S. Congress out of it and everything is going to be fine. The \ninspector general came forward and did an analysis of the voluntary \napproach and saw that was not working particularly well. Then the \nairlines said it was the FAA's fault, the Federal Aviation \nAdministration.\n  The fact is, it has been a bottomless pit of excuses with respect to \nthis question of improving passenger service in this country. Now the \nairlines have basically said that if passengers want any rights, they \nshould basically go to court to try to get them. They will have a \nvoluntary program, but if the passengers want any rights they should go \nout and try to find somebody in the trial bar to get interested in a \nlawsuit.\n  Suffice it to say, this country needs a straightforward, enforceable \npackage of rights to protect the passenger.\n  I want to make it clear, I am not calling for a constitutional right \nto a fluffy pillow on your airplane flight or a legal right to a jumbo \nbag of peanuts. But I do think you ought to have a right to basic \ninformation such as when your flight is chronically delayed.\n  One of the areas the inspector general has felt most strongly about \nis a situation that would require airlines to inform a prospective \npassenger when a flight is going to be 2 or 3 hours late and has a \ntrack record of being that late 30 or 40 percent of the time.\n  I also think disclosing that information to the flying public would \ninject a bit of competition into the system because, if consumers could \nhave that kind of information, then they might choose another flight, \nsay, that was only late 10 percent of the time or they might choose \nanother travel option altogether. You could begin to hold the airlines \naccountable. You could begin to have some consequences for this shoddy \nservice to which the passengers are so often subjected.\n  The passenger bill of rights is really about the public's right to \nknow. It is about giving passengers information. I was told early on \nthat somehow giving passengers these rights was going to jack up the \nbills of consumers. It seems to me it only can be a force for holding \ncosts down because when you give passengers information about their \noptions, that helps to make the system more competitive and serves as a \nforce to drive prices down.\n  I hope we will not have to wait much longer to get an enforceable set \nof passengers' rights in place.\n  I do not quarrel in the least with the airlines' argument that we \nneed more funding for runways and air traffic control and \ninfrastructure. The airlines are absolutely right. Today, demand \nexceeds supply with respect to American aviation, but I will tell my \ncolleagues and the Senate that all the concrete in the world is not \ngoing to do it if the airlines are not required to give the passengers \nbasic information about their flight options that is now in their \npossession. I am continually struck how it can be that this industry, \nwhich has performed such technological miracles in so many other areas, \ncannot devote just a tiny bit of that talent and ingenuity to making \nsure that passengers are kept well informed.\n  It seems to me it is a basic sort of proposition of industry in this \ncountry that you try to treat the customer properly, that you tell \nsomeone what their options are. But essentially aviation is one of the \nfew industries--perhaps the only one--where you consistently can't get \nthe product for which you contracted. If the local movie house doesn't \nhave enough people for the 3 o'clock showing, the local movie house \ndoesn't go out and cancel the 3 o'clock showing. It has been found \nagain and again that is what airlines do when they don't think they \nhave sufficient people on a particular flight.\n  I am not going to offer the passenger bill of rights as an amendment \non Senator Murray's appropriations bill, but I wanted to come to the \nfloor and say this is an area where I think the Senate is ready to go \nwith the good work of Senator Reid and Senator McCain, and particularly \nSenator Hollings, who pulled together a bipartisan bill in the Senate \nCommerce Committee.\n  I think we are on our way to passing legislation that could make a \nreal difference. Given the fact that it will take some time to get that \nnew infrastructure which is needed in place--it is going to take time \nto get additional runways and improvements in air traffic control and \nother basic purposes--that is all the more reason to pass a passengers' \nrights bill now so that passengers, as we are building the additional \ninfrastructure, can know what their travel options are and know how to \nplan what is best for them and their families.\n  I again thank Senator Murray for the excellent job she has done on \nthis bill. I see Senator Shelby and others are here as well. Senator \nShelby was very involved in passing and supporting passenger rights as \nwell. I thank him for that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as the majority leader announced, we are \nmoving towards an amendment that will be voted on shortly. I understand \nthe Senator from New Jersey would like to speak for 12 minutes. I yield \nto the Senator from New Jersey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington \nfor yielding the time.\n  I rise in opposition to efforts by Senator Gramm and Senator McCain \nto strike the Murray language regarding access by Mexican motor \ncarriers to United States highways. In fact, while I commend Senator \nMurray for her efforts to reach compromise with regard to access to \nUnited States highways by Mexican truck companies--I am indeed even \nopposed to her compromise--I believe that any compromise is going to \nresult in danger to American motorists and believe the better course is \nfor the Senate to follow the leadership of the House of Representatives \nand ban these trucks unless and until we are certain that American \nmotorists can be safe.\n  Senator Dorgan and I have prepared such an amendment and are \nconsidering offering it. Obviously, that can\n\n[[Page S8111]]\n\nonly be done if, indeed, we begin by defeating Senator McCain's \nefforts.\n  While serving in the House of Representatives, I opposed the NAFTA \ntreaty. I believed then, as I believe now, that for all of the \nadvantages of integrating the economies of North America, NAFTA was a \nmissed opportunity. It was a missed opportunity to establish regulatory \nenvironmental and labor requirements that would protect both our \nnatural environment and also our human resources. Now we are about to \nmake the same mistake again at an enormous price.\n  I do not believe NAFTA or any international law imposes on the United \nStates an obligation to lower or ignore safety standards for our \ncitizens in the name of free trade. I believe in free trade. I have \noften voted for free trade. I believe its economic advantages to our \nNation are overwhelming. But our first obligation is always to protect \nthe health and well-being of American citizens.\n  If there is a question as to whether allowing Mexican trucks \nimmediate and unlimited access will endanger American citizens, one \nneed look no further than developments along our southern border in the \nlast decade.\n  Since the enactment of NAFTA, the number of Mexican commercial trucks \ncrossing between our countries has increased by 324 percent. There are \nover 4.5 million commercial truck crossings a year into our Southern \nStates. Only 1 percent of these vehicles are inspected by U.S. \npersonnel. Thirty-six percent of those trucks inspected failed basic \nsafety standards for such things as faulty brakes, broken lights, \nunsafe transportation, or dangerous cargo.\n  As this chart illustrates, the percentage of trucks ordered off the \nroads because of faulty brakes or hazardous and dangerous or toxic \ncargoes is 50 percent higher in Mexican trucks than in America trucks \nand nearly four times as high as with Canadian trucks. If you were to \nextrapolate this number on the basis of actually inspecting all those \ntrucks crossing the American border, 1.5 million truck crossings would \npose a safety hazard, the vast majority of which are obviously \nundetected. Public Citizen estimates that were we to do nothing, there \nwould be an additional 3 million truck crossings.\n  Using this 36 percent failure rate, that means, incredibly, that we \ncould expect 1 million hazardous truck crossings per year from Mexico \nto the United States. Based on our current experience, 1 million trucks \nare going to enter into the States that Members of this Senate \nrepresent with faulty brakes, hazardous cargo, unsafe lighting, and \nunsafe design.\n  How many lives will be consumed by 1 million faulty trucks on \nAmerica's highways? It is a question no one can answer. But every \nSenator can agree upon this: It is going to cost lives--not maybe, not \nperhaps. People will lose their lives. This problem is driven by \nsystemic flaws within the Mexican regulatory system which result in low \ncompliance, lax enforcement, and little or no sanctions for violations.\n  The chart on my left demonstrates the stark difference between \nAmerican and Mexican truck regulations, beginning with driver fatigue.\n  In order to assure that drivers are alert on American highways, \nAmerican truckdrivers are limited to 10 hours of consecutive driving. \nEven with this American limit of 10 consecutive hours on the road, \ndriver fatigue still causes one-third of all truck accidents in the \nUnited States.\n  Only months ago, Mexico instituted its first limitations on hours of \nservice. But most trucks in Mexico are exempt from the limitation. \nImagine American highways with Mexican truckdrivers who have no \nexperience with these limitations and who lack compliance with driving \nfor limited hours. Truckdrivers from Mexico earn, on average, $7 per \nday driving these truck rigs across the United States.\n  I can tell you this about a truckdriver who earns $7 a day to feed \nhis family. Having him stop driving after 10 hours when he lives in \nthose economic circumstances, not being accustomed to these \nregulations, having no history of them, with questionable enforcement--\nthese trucks are going to be driven for hours and hours past current \nregulations.\n  Second, logbooks: In the United States, all truckdrivers are required \nto keep detailed logbooks of their driving time, cargo, and destination \nand to present them, on demand, for safety.\n\n  In Mexico, the law for keeping logbooks is not enforced, and border \ninspectors have reported that virtually none of the Mexican drivers \nentering the United States uses these logbooks--virtually none.\n  Weight limits: American trucks cannot exceed 80,000 pounds and are \noften inspected by weigh stations throughout the Interstate Highway \nSystem. Eighty-three percent of the fatal truck accidents in the United \nStates involve trucks that are over 26,000 pounds, clearly establishing \nthat heavier trucks are the cause of most fatal truck accidents.\n  In Mexico, the weight limit is an incredible 135,000 pounds, or 28 \ntons higher than the American limit. Equally as disconcerting as this \nhigher weight limit is that even should the limit be reduced, there is \ninadequate infrastructure or even space along the border to perform \nweight compliance checks. Seventy percent of inspection sites in the \nUnited States have room for only one or two trucks. Not only are these \ntrucks out of compliance, not only are they dangerous, but even if we \nwere requiring compliance, we do not have the infrastructure to do it.\n  These trucks are coming to American roads. It is a safety problem, to \nbe certain, that is going to cause loss of life. It is also an \ninvitation to massive damage to American highways, massive damage to \nhighways and bridges that are not designed for these kinds of \nextraordinary weights.\n  Hazardous materials: In the United States, all hazardous materials \nmust be clearly marked with an official placard when transported, and \nall truckdrivers transporting hazardous materials must be specifically \nlicensed. This has been done to ensure safety that when hazardous \nmaterials go through our neighborhoods and our cities and our States, \nwe know the driver is competent, but we also know that driver is \ntraceable and responsible if those toxic or hazardous materials are \ndumped in water supplies or streams or neighborhoods because of a long \nproblem of criminal and even organized criminal activity in dumping \nthese hazardous materials.\n  Nearly a quarter of all trucks entering the United States from Mexico \nare transporting hazardous materials but only 1 out of 14 is properly \nidentified.\n  Age: The average age of a commercial truck in the United States is \n4\\1/2\\ years. In Mexico, the average truck is 15 years old. There are \nfew truck companies in America that operate any trucks that are 15 \nyears old. ``Average'' or ``median'' age means a significant portion of \nMexico's trucks is 20, 25, and 30 years old. By definition, such a \ntruck is not safe to be operating on the American Interstate Highway \nSystem.\n  Lest anyone think my concerns are solely on the Mexican side of the \nborder, let me discuss for a moment the failure of the United States to \nproperly prepare for an inspection program.\n  On the assumption that Senator McCain's efforts will fail, we are \nleft with Senator Murray's efforts to reach a compromise on this to try \nto improve this system. We hope she succeeds. But if she does, it will \nrequire a Federal inspection system.\n  Today, Federal and State inspectors are on duty 24 hours a day at \nonly 2 of the 27 border crossings with Mexico. If a Mexican truck \nenters a border crossing when no one is there, it is not subject to \ninspection.\n  The Department of Transportation, under these proposals, is going to \nissue operating certificates to Mexican firms based on their answers to \nquestionnaires. The Department will have 18 months to perform a safety \naudit on the firm. But the firm's trucks can freely travel throughout \nthe United States during this 18-month period when the questionnaires \nare being reviewed.\n  Second, the inadequacy of the U.S. inspection infrastructure is an \ninvitation to problems. Many State inspectors who augment Federal \ninspectors do not even routinely check for licenses and documents. Most \nborder crossings lack any telecommunications, so the inspection \npersonnel cannot even check on the validity of licenses and \nregistrations being offered at border crossings.\n  I make these points to demonstrate that the Mexican trucking industry \nas\n\n[[Page S8112]]\n\nwell as the American inspection system are not ready to protect the \nAmerican driving public. There is no infrastructure. There is \ninadequate personnel. There are not weigh stations. There are not even \ntelephones. There are not parking spaces. There is an avalanche of old \nMexican trucks, without requirements for safety or background or \ndesign, that are coming to the United States.\n  This Nation has spent more than 50 years modernizing its trucking \nindustry, learning about safety, training drivers, ensuring that they \nunderstand how to operate these rigs. After 50 years of experience, and \nlowering mortality rates, we are now opening our borders to Mexican \ntrucks.\n  I recognize that this issue is difficult because of our close \nrelations with Mexico and our obligations under NAFTA. Indeed, on \nFebruary 6 an international arbitration panel ruled that the United \nStates cannot bar all Mexican applicants from entering the United \nStates. The United States wants to comply with its international \nobligations. But the arbitration panel also found that because of vast \ndifferences between the two regulatory regimes, the United States did \nnot have to treat Mexican applicants the same as it did United States \nor Canadian applicants.\n  The panel indicated that NAFTA did not restrict the ability of the \nUnited States to implement measures to ensure that Mexican trucking \ncompanies and their drivers meet United States standards. I quote:\n\n       Nor does it (NAFTA) require that Mexican-domiciled firms \n     currently providing trucking services in the U.S. be allowed \n     to continue to do so, if and when they fail to comply with \n     U.S. safety regulations.\n\n  Later on the panel added:\n\n       U.S. authorities are responsible for the safe operation of \n     trucks within U.S. territory, whether ownership is American, \n     Canadian or Mexican.\n\n  I believe the authority of the U.S. Government in this area is clear. \nWe have the right--indeed, we have the obligation--to ensure that our \ncitizens are safe and our highways are operated to the very highest \nstandards. The record in the United States, for all of our efforts, is \nnot overwhelmingly positive. Despite 50 years of efforts, the highest \ndesign requirements in the world, the best training in the world, over \n5,000 Americans are killed every year and over 100,000 people are \ninjured on American highways because of accidents with heavy trucks.\n  There is no one in the Senate who can credibly argue that if Mexican \ntrucks are allowed in the United States without adequate inspection, \nwithout modernizing the infrastructure, without a tremendous change in \nthe operating performance of these old Mexican trucks, with poorly \ntrained drivers, and no experience with modern regulations, these 5,000 \ndeaths are not going to be increased and the loss of life will not be \nconsiderable.\n  Mr. President, I believe this case is compelling. There are few times \nMembers of the Senate can cast a vote knowing that the results are \npotentially so dramatic. The citizens of our States are already \nfrustrated with crowded highways that are deteriorating under heavy \nuse. The loss of life from accidents is inexplicable--100,000 injured \nAmericans.\n  To now open American highways to Mexican trucks, given their record \nof compliance, the failures of infrastructure, is to guarantee an \nincrease in this dangerous situation.\n  I urge defeat of Senator McCain's efforts. Then the Senate needs to \nseriously consider whether the compromise that is in the legislation is \nsufficient to protect American families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/24/senate-section/article/S8112-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in support of \nH.R. 2299, the Department of Transportation and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2002.\n  The bill provides $15.575 billion in discretionary budget authority, \nincluding $695 million for defense spending. The budget authority will \nresult in new outlays in 2002 of $20.257 billion. When outlays from \nprior-year budget authority are taken into account, discretionary \noutlays for the Senate bill total $52.926 billion in 2002. Of that \ntotal, $28.489 billion in outlays counts against the allocation for \nhighways spending and $5.275 billion counts against the allocation for \nmass transit spending. The remaining $19.162 billion in outlays, \nincluding those for defense spending, counts against the allocation for \ngeneral purpose spending. The bill is within its Section 302(b) \nallocations for budget authority and outlays for general purpose, \ndefense, highways, and mass transit spending. In addition, the \ncommittee once again has met its target without the use of any \nemergency designations.\n  Once again, I would like to commend Chairman Byrd and Senator \nStevens, as well as subcommittee Chairwoman Murray and Senator Shelby, \nfor their efforts to work cooperatively and expeditiously to move this \nlegislation. The bill provides important new resources across all \ntransportation modes.

Mr. President, yesterday, writer Eudora Welty, a native of \nMississippi, passed away at the age of 92. Miss Welty was best known \nfor her short stories and the way they captured the life of the \nAmerican South. Miss Welty had a gift in telling of the traditions and \nthe relationships of her native south, and she received worldwide \nrecognition for her work which helped make Southern writing a focus in \n20th century literature. Many people do not know that she was also an \naccomplished photographer.\n  Miss Welty is considered by many literary authorities to be the \ngreatest American writer of our time. She grew up in Jackson, \nMississippi, and attended public schools. She often recalled trips to \nthe Jackson library with her mother that began her love for literature. \nShe attended Mississippi University for Women, where she was first \npublished in the school newspaper, and went on to graduate from the \nUniversity of Wisconsin. She returned to her native state in 1923 to \nlive and write in the Belhaven neighborhood of Jackson, Mississippi, \nthe remainder of her life.\n  Miss Welty began her career with the publishing of her first short \nstory, ``Death of a Traveling Salesman'', which appeared in 1936. The \nOptimist's Daughter, published in 1972, earned Miss Welty the 1973 \nPulitzer Prize for Fiction. Her 1984 autobiography, One Writer's \nBeginnings, was a New York Times bestseller. Her stories are primarily \nset in Mississippi, and she had a special knack for writing about the \npeople and places of home.\n  Mr. President, Miss Welty received numerous literary awards during \nher lifetime, including four O. Henry Prizes, the National Book \nFoundation Medal, and the American Academy of Arts' and Letters' \nWilliam Dean Howells Medal. Her work has been adapted to Broadway \nstages, television, and movies. She received the Freedom Medal of Honor \nfrom Presidents Carter and Reagan, as well as Lifetime Achievement \nAwards from the National Endowment for the Humanities, National \nGovernors Association, and\n\n[[Page S8114]]\n\nAmerican Association of University Women.\n  Miss Welty's writing had an influence on the lives of Mississippians \nand Southerners alike. Her gift of capturing the human spirit made her \nbeloved by the nation and the world, as well. She was a great \nMississippian who gave back to her community, and she will be missed by \nthe entire literary world.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am sure most Senators have heard by \nnow, or read in the newspapers, that Eudora Welty died yesterday in \nJackson, MS. She was 92.\n  Miss Welty was a wonderful person and one of America's best writers. \nShe was well known around the world for the excellent quality of her \nstories, and she was also appreciated in Mississippi for her \ngenerosity, warmth and good humor.\n  For several years my wife and I lived in her neighborhood, the \nBelhaven section of Jackson, and when we would see her she was always \ngracious and friendly. Everyone I knew loved her. So, it is not an \nexaggeration to say that the entire State of Mississippi is in mourning \ntoday.\n  She may have been every writer's idol, but she was every \nMississippian's friend.\n  When I was a student in Europe in 1963 and was introduced to one of \nDublin's leading artists, he said, ``If you are from Jackson, \nMississippi, then you must know Eudora Welty.'' At that time I really \ndidn't know her very well, and I admitted it. Then he said, ``Well, you \nmust get to know her. She is, you know, the greatest living writer in \nthe world today.''\n  ``Goodness,'' I thought. I didn't know she was that great. I had read \n``Delta Wedding'' and a few of her short stories, but I didn't \nappreciate her widespread popularity and reputation until I spent a \nyear abroad.\n  Her writings of course are widely read, well known and respected \neverywhere, including Mississippi. She has been honored at home and \nthroughout the world. But it is in Mississippi that she was loved for \nher personal qualities as well as for her talent as a writer.\n  Tomorrow her body will lie in state at the old State capitol and on \nThursday a memorial service will be held at Galloway Memorial Methodist \nChurch where she was a member.\n  I ask unanimous consent that articles from today's Jackson daily \nnewspaper, The Clarion-Ledger, which chronicle her writing, photography \nand the numerous awards she received be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Author Gone, But Words Live On, Eudora Welty Remembered\n\n                           (By Billy Watkins)\n\n       She would quietly slip into Lemuria Book Store and head \n     straight for the mystery section. No fanfare, no attention \n     drawn to herself.\n       ``I can still see her, dressed in her beige trench coat, \n     standing over in a little nook of the store and browsing \n     through the books like any other customer,'' said Lemuria \n     owner John Evans. ``She loved books, and she loved book \n     stores. And I used to just sit and watch her and think how \n     cool it was that Eudora Welty was in my book store.\n       ``It doesn't get much better than that.''\n       Welty, a world-renowned writer who was born in Jackson and \n     lived here most of her life, died Monday at 12:25 p.m. at \n     Baptist Medical Center. She was 92.\n       Welty was hospitalized Saturday suffering from pneumonia.\n       Welty will lie in state at the Old Capitol Museum from 2-5 \n     p.m. Wednesday. It is open to the public.\n       On Thursday, visitation is set for 1 p.m. at Galloway \n     Memorial United Methodist Church followed by a memorial \n     service at 2:30 p.m.\n       Burial arrangements are incomplete.\n       Patti Carr Black, a long-time friend and one of Welty's \n     editors, was in Welty's hospital room a half-hour before she \n     died.\n       ``She was not apparently conscious,'' Black said, ``but \n     doctors say that people who are in that situation know when \n     others are in the room with them. I hope that's true.''\n       Welty was famous for her short stories, novels and essays. \n     Among her most notable works: The Ponder Heart; Why I Live at \n     the P.O.; One Writer's Beginnings, her autobiography that was \n     the longest-running book on the New York Times bestseller \n     list in 1984; and The Optimist's Daughter, which won her a \n     Pulitzer Prize in 1973.\n       Her literary career spanned eight decades, beginning in \n     1936 with the publication of her first short story, Death of \n     a Traveling Salesman. In 2000, University Press of \n     Mississippi published Church Courtyards, a collection of \n     photographs.\n       Welty had three books of black-and-white photographs \n     published. Some of the pictures were exhibited originally in \n     small New York galleries in 1936 and '37. The photos are now \n     high-priced collector's items.\n       Welty's work always focused on people--their simplicities \n     and complexities.\n       ``One of the things that made her great was her ability to \n     get inside people's heads,'' Evans said. ``Her eyes and ears \n     picked up everything about people, and it was her softness \n     and gentleness as a person that allowed her to do so.\n       ``She was so non-threatening that people dropped their \n     guard and let her inside them. And it carried over into every \n     story she ever wrote, every photograph she ever took.''\n       Welty wrote in 1980: ``I have been told, both in approval \n     and in accusation, that I seem to love all my characters. \n     What I do in writing of any character is try to enter into \n     the mind, heart and skin of a human being who is not \n     myself.''\n       She later said: ``To me, the details tell everything. One \n     detail can tell more than any descriptive passage in general, \n     you know. That's the way my eye sees, so I just use it.''\n       Welty always deflected any notion that she was famous, even \n     though she was the recipient of honorary degrees from both \n     Harvard and Yale, and she was knighted by France in 1987.\n       ``I'm not any kind of prophet,'' she said in 1991. ``I \n     think you write about whatever's current . . . They won't be \n     the same kind of stories but they'll be about human beings.''\n       Black was one of the few people who had the opportunity to \n     work closely with Welty.\n       ``In times like these, we always react personally instead \n     of thinking of the world's loss,'' Black said. ``I guess the \n     thing I'll miss about her most is her laughter. She had the \n     greatest wit. We celebrated her birthday together for the \n     past couple of decades. She loved a party.\n       ``But she never wanted to be the center of attention--but \n     she was because she's one of the nation's geniuses.''\n       Larry Brown, an award-winning author from Oxford, said: ``I \n     remember reading some of her short stories in high school and \n     really enjoying them. I met her one time, in 1989 when they \n     gave me the Mississippi Arts and Literature Award, and had my \n     picture taken with her. She really devoted her whole life to \n     writing.''\n       Willie Morris, the late Mississippi author wrote a 4,000-\n     word essay for Vanity Fair magazine on the occasion of \n     Welty's 90th birthday. In an April 1999 interview with The \n     Clarion-Ledger, Morris called the article ``a toast to \n     Eudora.''\n       Morris added: ``I call her Eudora because she's been my \n     friend since I was a little boy. I very strongly support the \n     idea that she is the greatest living American writer. She's \n     full of wackiness and humor and loyalty to her friends. She's \n     just so generous. Always has been.''\n       Shelby Foote, fellow Mississippi writer and longtime \n     friend, said: ``No one who ever spent as much as five minutes \n     in her presence avoided being extremely fond of her. She had \n     a childlike wonder she never lost.''\n       Welty was born in her family home at 741 N. Congress St. on \n     April 13, 1909. In 1923, the Welty family moved to the \n     Belhaven-area home that her father built. She lived and wrote \n     there most of her life. She never married.\n       The Tudor-style home on Pinehurst Street now becomes the \n     property of the Mississippi Department of Archives & History, \n     per Welty's wish.\n       In 10 years, Welty's portrait will permanently enter \n     Washington's National Portrait Gallery, joining the likes of \n     George Washington, Pocahontas, Mark Twain and Albert \n     Einstein.\n       As her health declined in recent years. Welty rarely left \n     her Jackson home. Only close friends and relatives were \n     allowed to visit, but loyal readers continued to knock on her \n     front door.\n       ``She influenced every Southern writer because she taught \n     us to write in our own voice,'' said Ellen Gilchrist, a \n     Mississippi author who once studied under Welty at Millsaps \n     College. ``When I first read her, my mouth was hanging open \n     because she wrote the way I and people I knew talked. It was \n     a revelation to me.\n       ``She was a beautiful lady, like my mother and my aunts. \n     You didn't have to be a drunk living in Paris--you could be a \n     nice lady and be writing books.\n       ``It was an honor to know her.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  `Grand Lady' Admired for Pure Voice\n\n                            (By Gary Petius)\n\n       The death of Eudora Welty, whose mind and heart pondered \n     the separation between human beings, brought many together \n     Monday in mutual grief and regard for the Pulitzer Prize-\n     winning author.\n       ``A giant tree has fallen,'' said David Sansing, historian \n     and professor emeritus of history at Ole Miss in Oxford.\n       ``William Faulkner, Tennessee Williams, Richard Wright, \n     Eudora Welty: Who would think that this little state, with \n     such a high rate of illiteracy, would produce these giants of \n     literature, and all of the same generation?\n       ``Eudora Welty was the last of those, the great four.''\n       Dean Faulkner Wells of Oxford, niece of perhaps the \n     greatest of those four, William Faulkner, said, ``A grand \n     lady of letters is gone. We will always revere her words, as \n     will coming generations.''\n       Wells' husband, author Larry Wells, said Welty ``spoke to \n     all generations. It was that\n\n[[Page S8115]]\n\n     pure voice, that humanity. You can't afford to lose people \n     like Eudora Welty.\n       ``In matters of the heart, she was never wrong.''\n       One of the people who knew her heart best is Suzanne Marrs, \n     a noted Welty scholar and an English professor at Millsaps \n     College in Jackson. In a Monday news conference, she was \n     reminded of the famous Lou Gehrig farewell speech that echoed \n     in Yankee Stadium decades ago. ``Today,'' Marrs said, ``I \n     think I'm the luckiest English teacher on the face of the \n     earth: I had Eudora Welty as a great friend.''\n       Marrs recalled a crowed elevator ride she took long ago \n     with her friend, who was surrounded by a bevy of starry-eyed \n     writers attending a seminar in Chattanooga. When Welty noted \n     that everyone else in the car wore an ID, she said, ``Oh, \n     I've forgotten my nametag.''\n       ``She was that modest to believe she needed a nametag among \n     all those people who knew her greatness,'' Marrs said.\n       Her humility and talent connected with people on both sides \n     of the political and philosophical aisle. Mississippi Gov. \n     Ronnie Musgrove, a Democrat, and U.S. Rep. Roger Wicker, a \n     Republican, honored Welty on Monday.\n       ``Not only will Mississippians miss her,'' Musgrove said, \n     ``but people literally around the world will miss her \n     wisdom.''\n       In remarks made on the floor of the House, Wicker said, \n     ``Eudora Welty understood not only the South, but the complex \n     family relationships and individual struggles that have \n     combined to give America its rich texture. Her works of \n     fantasy and tall tale narration included two of my favorites, \n     The Robber Bridegroom and The Ponder Heart . . ., which are \n     still read aloud frequently at the Wicker household.''\n       A statement from Mississippi native William Ferris, \n     chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, read \n     in part: ``She chronicled the power of place in small towns \n     and in rural areas with an intimacy and eloquence that was \n     unique.''\n       That eloquence charmed and inspired writers of various \n     generations, including Elizabeth Spencer of Chapel Hill, \n     N.C., who wrote the introduction to Welty's Country \n     Churchyards. ``. . . Her work will live on as the presence \n     that we will miss so much,'' Spencer said.\n       In spite of that void, Sansing said, Welty leaves behind a \n     wealth of literary heirs in Mississippi, including Larry \n     Brown, Barry Hannah, Richard Ford and Greg Iles.\n       ``There's no other geographic region in the world, on a per \n     capita basis, that has produced so many really fine \n     writers,'' Sansing said. ``And there's no end in sight.\n       ``(The late author) Willie Morris and I used to talk all \n     the time about why this is so. And he always came back to one \n     thing: It's the caliber of the whiskey we drink.' '' Sansing \n     paused.\n       ``But I don't think Miss Welty drank much whiskey.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/24/senate-section/article/S8115-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS PURSUANT TO S.

The Local law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred July 17, 1990 \nin Salt Lake City, UT.

The three suspects, \nRoy Larsen, 20, Glen Chad Hosey, 20, and Brian Snow, 18, allegedly beat \nthe victim with nunchaku in a city park.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate.

Mr. President, I am pleased to \nannounce that Rebecca Kane, from Lee, New Hampshire, was recently \nawarded the Young Naturalists Award for her essay entitled ``Bog \nTrotting.'' This prestigious honor is only awarded to 12 student across \nthe country and I would like to congratulate her on this outstanding \nachievement.\n  After reading Rebecca's essay, I have learned a great deal about my \nNew Hampshire bogs. Her description of the pitcher plants was \nfascinating, but even more interesting was the introduction of \ndifferent theories related to bog formation.\n  The pictures provided along with the detailed descriptions of the \nlandscape around her were breathtaking and showed a great deal of \nliterary skill beyond 12 years of age. Rebecca's appreciation of the \nbogs and ability to translate that insight into a stylistic prose is \nremarkable and exhibits a veritable talent.\n  As the senior Republican of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I am always concerned about our nation's natural resources \nand none more so than New Hampshire's beautiful landscape. After \nreading this essay, the bogs I live near have come to life. I look \nforward to hearing what new information she may discover about these \nnatural wonders in the years to come.\n  Following Rebecca's trip to New York and multiple meetings with \nresearch scientists from the American Museum of Natural History, I hope \nshe will return home and take advantage of these native surroundings by \ncontinuing to learn and build her skills as a writer and researcher.\n  Rebecca, congratulations again on this distinguished award. It is an \nhonor to represent you in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/24/senate-section/article/S8115-6", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8115-S8116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JACK JEFFREY\n\n Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor John E. Jeffrey \nas he retires from an outstanding career of service to the people of \nNevada.\n  I have known Jack since we were teenagers attending Basic High School \nin Henderson, NV. He is a talented electrician, a compassionate public \nservant, and a dedicated family man. Jack is also a friend.\n  Jack's public service began three decades ago, when he was elected to \nthe Henderson City Council in 1971. Working to expand educational \nopportunity has been a central tenet of Jack's career. Fittingly, his \nfirst major accomplishment was to successfully negotiate with the \nNevada State senate to acquire the first two buildings for the \nHenderson campus of Clark County Community College.\n  In 1975, Jack's influence expanded from City Hall to Carson City, \nwhen he\n\n[[Page S8116]]\n\nwas elected to the Nevada State Assembly by a margin of only six votes.\n  ``We overspent,'' he said when told of the tiny bit of daylight \nbetween himself and his opponent. ``We wasted money campaigning for the \nfive votes I didn't need.''\n  Jack's first of many reelections was won by a more comfortable 28-\nvote margin.\n  His 16 distinguished years in the Assembly include recognition as the \nClark County Teachers Association's ``Friend of Education,'' and the \nInternational Police Association's ``Legislator of the Year.''\n  Jack's Democratic colleagues respected him enough to elect him \nmajority whip--a position close to my heart--in 1977, and then chose \nhim as their majority floor leader in 1981.\n  Jack is proud to have been a tireless advocate for increasing special \neducation funds while he was in the Assembly. He believes special needs \nstudents deserve a quality education too, and he worked to make sure \nthere will be opportunities for them.\n  Since leaving the Assembly in 1991, Jack has continued to fight to \nimprove the quality of life for working people in Nevada. He's been an \nactive member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers \nLocal 357 all his adult life, and understands the trials and \ntribulations of working men and women and their families. Jack has been \nan invaluable asset to Southern Nevada Central Labor Council and to the \nSouthern Nevada Building and Construction Trades Council, and earlier \nthis month he was named ``Consumer Advocate of the Year.''\n  The working men and women in Nevada work in better and safer jobs \nbecause of Jack. In fact, all people in Nevada are better off because \nof Jack Jeffrey. I wish Jack and his wife, Betty, the very best in \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/24/senate-section/article/S8116-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JILL CHARLES\n\n Mr. JEFFORDS. Mr. President, today I rise to pay tribute to a \nwoman of great dedication, compassion, and courage. Jill Charles, \nArtistic Director of the Dorset Theatre Festival and a Dorset, Vermont, \nresident, will long be remembered by those whose lives she touched as \nan accomplished artist, a loving mother, a giving mentor, and a dear \nfriend.\n  It is our good fortune that Jill chose to bring her talent and love \nof theatre to Vermont. In 1968, she arrived in Dorset to work as an \napprentice for Fred and Pat Carmichael's Caravan Theatre at the Dorset \nPlayhouse. Subsequently, she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in \ntheatre from the University of Kentucky and was awarded a Master of \nFine Arts degree in directing from Boston University. After the \nCarmichaels retired in 1976, Jill, with co-founder John Nassivera, \nestablished the Dorset Theatre Festival.\n  Jill was well known and highly respected for her work with young \nartists and for the guidance she provided for hundreds of pre-\nprofessional actors, designers and technicians who apprenticed under \nher direction during her twenty-six years as Dorset Theatre Festival \nArtistic Director. Her interest in the professional growth and \nemotional well-being of each member of the company was repeatedly \nreflected in her attention to matters large and small, and in countless \nacts of personal support and kindness.\n  A woman whose compassion and respect for others extended beyond her \nprofessional endeavors in the theatre, Jill was dedicated to her \ncommunity and to the many humanitarian interests that she held dear. \nShe was a dedicated foster parent for many years, and remained in \ncontact with those children to whom she provided a home. She also was \nactively involved with the Second Chance Animal Shelter in Bennington, \nProject Pave (a support group for abused women), Race for the Cure, and \nthe Dorset Congregational Church choir. She was also a founding member \nof the Cantare a capella singing group in Dorset.\n  The arts and humanities are a powerful force in bringing us together, \nin stretching our horizons, and in improving the quality of our lives. \nJill Charles embodied the gifts of the arts and humanities. She will be \ngreatly missed, but her presence will continue to be felt as her touch \nripples outward like the action of a pebble tossed in a pond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/24/senate-section/article/S8116-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8116]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO VALDON JOHNSON\n\n   Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Valdon Johnson is a retired \nAssistant Professor of English, now Emeritus Professor of English, from \nthe University of Northern Iowa and currently is a regular volunteer in \nmy Waterloo Regional office.\n  Although Valdon's father died when Valdon was about 7, his mother had \nremarried about 5 years later. Valdon began his college career at Iowa \nState Teachers College, now the University of Northern Iowa (UNI) in \n1950. His studies were suspended while he served in the Navy. He \nreceived his B.A. in English in 1958 and an M.A. in English in 1959. \nHis first teaching position was with Webster City Junior College, now \nIowa Central Community College. In 1962, Valdon received a Fulbright \nAward to teach English as a foreign language in Japan before returning \nto UNI in 1968, where for 26 years, he taught Linguistics and \nHumanities.\n  Valdon's first day in my office was September 23, 1994, his next was \nNovember 6, 1995. During the in-between time of about 13.5 months he \nrecovered from a stroke that left him unable to talk. Not withstanding \nthe stroke, he volunteered one to two days per week since. Valdon \ncontinues his other interests, which include the Masons and in \ntraveling to the United Kingdom about every year, music (piano & \norgan), calligraphy, stenotype theory, handwriting analysis and \nreligious history.\n  Although Valdon is unable to answer the phone, he does help with case \nwork letter preparation, news paper clipping, filing and calligraphy. \nFor over 7 years he has been a faithful, always on time volunteer and \nhas been of invaluable assistance.\n  Valdon will celebrate his 69th birthday on August 15. I want to use \nthis occasion to say ``happy birthday'' Valdon.

Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks \nconcerning the recent passing of New Mexico's Patrick McKernan. Patrick \nMcKernan recently passed away at the age of 60 due to complications of \ncancer. He is survived by his seven children and wife. McKernan, who \nhas been deemed by many as ``Mr. Baseball'' was best known in New \nMexico for his management of the Albuquerque Dukes AAA baseball team. \nHowever, McKernan was more than just the manager of one of the most \nsuccessful baseball teams in minor league history, he was also the man \nwho helped pave the way for the success of professional sports in New \nMexico. One of Pat McKernan's key philosophies was the belief that the \nAlbuquerque Dukes were more than a Dodgers AAA affiliate; they were in \nfact Albuquerque's very own team. McKernan worked hard to make sure the \npeople of New Mexico knew this.\n  McKernan's professional success is highlighted by recognition from \nhis peers: three time PCL executive of the year, three time Eastern \nLeague executive of the year, 2000 inductee to the Albuquerque Sports \nHall of Fame, and recipient of the ``King of Baseball'' lifetime \nachievement award. However, one of his most impressive achievements is \nnot illustrated by any award, but by the fact that for more than 20 \nyears, attendance at Dukes baseball games was well above the levels for \nthe rest of minor league baseball.\n  McKernan's management made it easy for Albuquerque and the rest of \nNew Mexico to love the Dukes. McKernan went above and beyond the duties \nof a general manager. McKernan believed that baseball was more than \njust a game, it could also in fact be used as a gateway to reach out to \nthe entire community. He made it an obligation for Dukes management and \nplayers to personally reach out to the community that had so lovingly \nembraced it. Each Christmas, McKernan dressed as Santa Claus and \npersonally handed out presents to needy children. McKernan showed his \nhumanitarianism and genuine love of his fellow New Mexicans by donating \nexcess food to local homeless shelters following every Dukes home game.\n  An editorial in The Albuquerque Tribune made a reference to Patrick \nMcKernan and the city of Albuquerque\n\n[[Page S8117]]\n\nby saying that they seemed almost intertwined in an ineffably charming \nenchantment. This statement is all too true. Not only did the world of \nbaseball lose a brilliant and capable administrator, but the state of \nNew Mexico also lost one its finest citizens and humanitarians. The \ncitizens of Albuquerque and our state mourn the loss of Patrick \nMcKernan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/24/senate-section/article/S8117-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO LT. COL. JOHN D. WOODWARD USAF-RET\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \npay tribute to Lt. Col. John D. Woodward USAF-Ret, of Manchester, NH, \nwho passed away on July 8, 2001.\n  John was born in Pembroke, NH, and served with honor and distinction \nin the United States military. He began his military career with the \nUnited States Army in Panama and later served with the Coast Artillery, \nInfantry and Field Artillery. In 1942, John transferred to the Army Air \nCorps where he was commissioned a second lieutenant serving with the \nArmy Air Force units throughout the South Pacific.\n  John was one of the founding members of Detachment B, 201st Air \nService Group which was accorded Federal recognition at Grenier Field \nin Manchester, NH, as the original New Hampshire Air National Guard. He \nalso served in the Korean Conflict with United States Air Force units \nin Greenland and Newfoundland.\n  Promoted to the rank of Lt. Col. in 1957, John became Deputy \nCommander for Materiel for the 157th Military Airlift Group, MAC, in \n1966, and served in that capacity when the unit became the 157th \nTactical Airlift Group. He was later appointed commander of the 157th \nCombat Support Squadron in 1975 when the Group became a unit of the \nStrategic Air Command.\n  John earned many medals and awards for his dedicated military service \nincluding: the Bronze Star, the American Defense Medal, the Good \nConduct Medal, the American Theater Medal, the Asiatic Pacific Theater \nMedal with two battle stars, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal, the \nNational Defense Service Medal, the World War II Victory Medal and the \nNew Hampshire Air National Guard Medal. As a Vietnam veteran and senior \nmember of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I commend John for his \ncontributions to the people of New Hampshire and the country.\n  John was an active supporter of his local community who contributed \nas a member of organizations including: Sons of the American \nRevolution, the American Legion, Sons of the Union Veterans and as a \nMaster Mason with Washington Lodge #61 of New Hampshire. He was a \nlifelong die-hard supporter of the Boston Red Sox and an enthusiastic \ngolfer.\n  John is survived by his wife of 59 years, Betty; his daughters: Linda \nWoodward and Debra Woodward and his son, John D. Woodward II. He is \nalso survived by a granddaughter, Megan Woods and two sisters: Esther \nPerron and Lillian Lesmerises.\n  John served his country and State with pride and dignity. I applaud \nhim for his exemplary contributions to the United States military and \nNew Hampshire. He will be sadly missed by all those whose lives he \ntouched. It is truly an honor and a privilege to have represented him \nin the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/24/senate-section/article/S8117-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               25TH ANNIVERSARY OF CHERRY VERSUS MATHEWS\n\n   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, July 19th was the 25th \nanniversary of the U.S. District Court decision known as Cherry v. \nMathews, a historic ruling that helped open the door to full and equal \ncitizenship for disabled citizens.\n  Twenty five years ago, many disabled Americans could not use public \ntransportation, go to schools and colleges, or even have access to \nparks, buildings, or voting booths. The Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was \nenacted to prohibit discrimination against an ``otherwise qualified \nhandicapped individual'' in federally funded programs government-wide \n``solely by reason of his handicap.'' The statute included within its \nprotections State and local governments, schools, universities, social \nservice agencies, legal services offices, public housing, parks, and \nmuch more.\n  While the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) argued \nthat Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 was merely a \n``policy statement'' that required no regulatory action, Dr. James L. \nCherry of Georgia sought to assure legal rights and equality for \ndisabled individuals. The lawsuit targeted Health and Human Services' \nSecretary David Mathews. His case was decided on July 19, 1976 when \nU.S. District Court Judge John Lewis Smith ordered HHS to develop the \nSection 504 regulation to prohibit discrimination against ``handicapped \npersons'' in any federally funded program.\n  Dr. Cherry's case led to a regulation under section 504 of the 1973 \nRehabilitation Act that assures disabled citizens reasonable access to \npublic programs and facilities. The case helped paved the way for the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, which expanded the protection from \ndiscrimination to all persons with disabilities.\n  Section 504 was the first ``civil rights act'' for persons with \ndisabilities. It was modeled after Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964 which prohibited discrimination against persons in federally \nfunded programs on the basis of race, religion, national origin, and \ncreed. However, ``handicapped persons'' were not protected from \ndiscrimination by the 1964 law.\n  Cherry v. Mathews was a landmark case that renewed our Nation's \npromise of equal opportunity for all Americans. As we observe the 25th \nanniversary of equal opportunity for disabled Americans, I urge us all \nto rededicate ourselves to this foundation of our Nation's \ngreatness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/24/senate-section/article/S8117-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8117-S8118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     HAPPY 60TH ANNIVERSARY TO MR. AND MRS. S. RICHARD JENNINGS JR.\n\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise today to salute two very \nspecial Tennesseans, and indeed two outstanding Americans, who I am \nproud to call my friends, Virginia and Richard Jennings of Johnson \nCity, TN. On Wednesday, August 29, 2001, Virginia and Richard will be \nsurrounded by family and friends to celebrate the wonderful milestone \nof their 60 years of marriage.\n  In a time where so much in our society seems temporary and fleeting, \nVirginia and Richard have demonstrated each and every day the best of \nAmerican values--devotion to their country, their community, their \nfamily, and to each other.\n  Married on Friday, August 29, 1941 at the First Baptist Church in \nErwin, Tennessee, the Jennings embarked on their journey as newlyweds \nliving in New York City until Richard was called to the service in \nWorld War II. Richard served in both of the war's theaters, and was in \nEurope on VE Day and Japan on VJ Day. While he was overseas, Virginia \ngave back to her community as an educator, teaching and coaching \nbasketball.\n  On returning home, Richard began a distinguished career at Tennessee \nEastman in Kingsport which spanned almost forty years. Virginia made a \nmark for herself in community service in Johnson City, generously \ndonating her time as President of the Junior League, helping to found a \nmental health clinic, and serving on the city's planning commission. \nBoth also made their spiritual lives a priority with their active \nmembership in the Munsey Memorial United Methodist Church. Although \nraised as a Baptist, Virginia followed her mother's sound advice to be \nthe best Methodist she could!\n  With all of their accomplishments, probably their proudest moments \ncame with the arrival of two daughters, Eve Boyd Jennings in 1947 and \nAnne Bradshaw Jennings in 1954. The Jennings' family today boasts six \ngrandchildren and five great-children, all of whom are the apple of \ntheir grandparents' eyes.\n  Through the years, Virginia, a devoted Republican, loved the thrill \nof politics. Former U.S. Senator Howard Baker tapped her into service \nas his Tri-Cities field representative where she served throughout his \nthree terms in the Senate. Virginia became a living legend in that \nrole. When I first ran for the Senate, I turned to her time and time \nagain for advice and counsel, and she not only gave me the great honor \nof becoming a valuable mentor, but she has also bestowed upon my wife, \nKaryn, and me an even greater gift--her friendship and love.\n  Virginia and Richard Jennings epitomize the very best of what it \nmeans to\n\n[[Page S8118]]\n\nbe Americans. They are a national treasure. In anticipation of their \n60th wedding anniversary on Wednesday, August 29, 2001, I want to thank \nVirginia and Richard for their service to our nation, and most \nimportantly, for living their lives in a way that serves as a shining \nexample for all of us to emulate. I am honored to be their U.S. \nSenator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/24/senate-section/article/S8118-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IN MEMORY OF MIMI FARINA\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, in the more than 25 years that I \nhave been privileged to serve in public office, I have come to know \nmany, many remarkable people. But rarely have I ever known anyone more \ntalented, more compassionate, selfless and remarkable than Mimi Farina.\n  Last Wednesday, at age 56, Mimi Farina lost a courageous, two-year \nbattle with neuroendocrine cancer. While people around the country and \naround the world are saddened by her death, Mimi's courageous, \ncrusading spirit will surely live on in the work of Bread & Roses, an \norganization that she founded in 1974.\n  Bread & Roses is a unique, internationally renowned social services \nagency, held together by countless dedicated volunteers and a simple, \ncompassionate mission: to bring free live music to people confined in \ninstitutions--in jails, juvenile facilities, hospitals and rest homes. \nLast year alone, Bread & Roses sponsored more than 500 concerts at some \n82 institutions across the country.\n  Mimi Farina gave up her own promising singing career to found Bread & \nRoses and to nurse it through years of hard times. The inspiration for \nBread & Roses came to her in 1973, when she accompanied her sister Joan \nBaez and blues artist B.B. King to a performance at Sing Sing prison. \nShe was deeply moved by the prisoners' reaction to the music they heard \nthat day. That experience, coupled with a performance of her own a \nshort time later at a Marin County halfway house convinced Mimi of the \nenormous need for an organization like Bread & Roses.\n  Over the past quarter century, the work of Bread & Roses has been \nsupported by a dazzling array of performers, including Bonnie Raitt, \nPete Seeger, Paul Winter, Odetta, Lily Tomlin, Carlos Santana, Judy \nCollins, Robin Williams, Huey Lewis, Boz Scaggs and Taj Mahal.\n  As Bread & Roses grew in size and stature, Mimi became its most \nprominent and persuasive advocate. She received many awards and \naccolades, including ``Woman of the Year'' from the Bay Area Women in \nMusic, ``Most Valuable Person Award'' from the National Academy of \nRecording Arts & Sciences, ``Woman Most Likely to be President'' from \nthe San Francisco League of Women Voters, ``Woman Entrepreneur of the \nYear'' from the National Association of Women Business Owners and the \n10th Annual Life Work Award from the Falkirk Cultural Center in San \nRafael. She was among the first inductees into the Marin County Women's \nHall of Fame.\n  I close today with an offer of my deepest condolences to the family \nof Mimi Farina and to those who loved her, and with these words from \nthe poem ``Bread & Roses,'' originally written for female laborers and \nput to music by Mimi:\n\n     Our days shall not be sweated from birth until life closes.\n     Hearts starve as well as bodies: Give us bread, but give us \n           roses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/24/senate-section/article/S8118-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO WARREN E.

He had fought a courageous battle with cancer and \ninspired many with his spirit and determination.\n  Warren was born in Lewiston, ME, and served with honor and \ndistinction in the United States Army's 25th Infantry Division in \nVietnam. While in the Army, he served as a military ski instructor and \nski area manager in Fort Richardson, Alaska.\n  Warren returned to New Hampshire after his military service and \nassumed the position of head ski school instructor at The BALSAMS Grand \nResort & Hotel in Dixville Notch. He was promoted through the ranks and \nbecame General Manager of the resort in 1971. In 1977 he became a \nmanaging partner and corporate vice president of The BALSAMS \nCorporation.\n  He was an active supporter of his community and served positions \nincluding: Director at The First Colebrook Bank, Chairman at First \nColebrook Bankcorp, Board member of the Upper Connecticut Valley \nHospital and member of the New Hampshire Better Business Bureau. He \nalso served on the Board of Trustees at the Hanover Inn at Dartmouth \nCollege.\n  Warren was awarded professional recognition for his contributions in \nthe hospitality industry including: Innkeeper of the Year Award from \nthe New Hampshire Hospitality Association in 1980-81; New Hampshire \nCommission for the Arts, Business Award for Support of the Arts in 1985 \nand New England Innkeepers Association Outstanding Service Award.\n  Warren is survived by his wife of 34 years, Eleanor; his son, Michael \nand wife, Sharon; his son, Andrew and wife, Lorraine and a daughter, \nTamme and three grandchildren: Duncan Pearson, Lindsay Pearson and \nLilly Anne Pearson Robarts. He is also survived by his mother, Mildred \nBollavance and two sisters: Deborah Cooke and Marcia Whitman.\n  Warren served his country and State with pride and dignity. As a \nVietnam veteran, I commend him for his service in the United States \nArmy and for his exemplary personal and business contributions to The \nBALSAMS Grand Resort and New Hampshire. He will be sadly missed by all \nthose whose lives he touched. It is truly an honor and a privilege to \nhave represented him in the U.S. Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/24/senate-section/article/S8118-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING WYNN SPEECE\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to publicly commend \nWynn Speece of Yankton, South Dakota, who with her sixty years of \nbroadcasting excellence at WNAX, 570 AM, has become the longest running \nradio personality in the nation.\n  Wynn began her career at WNAX in 1939 as a writer in the continuity \ndepartment earning $20 a week. She later was given 15 minutes of air \ntime each Saturday to mention the special premiums offered by WNAX \nadvertisers. Her career advanced rapidly after the station's female \ndirector left, and she was selected to fill the position. In addition \nto her other duties, Wynn was asked to host a 15 minute program \ntargeted primarily at homemakers six days per week, and on July 14, \n1941, this show, known as the ``Neighbor Lady,'' hit the air. Wynn's \nmost avid listeners were provided by farms, ranches and small towns \nacross the upper Midwest.\n  Six decades later, Wynn continues to conduct interviews for the local \nradio station and writes a long-running column for Yankton's Press & \nDakotan where she has literally informed and entertained generations of \nlisteners. Since her first show, Speece has interviewed hundreds of \npeople, hosted 15,000 broadcasts, and received countless letters. With \nher outstanding talent, leadership and commitment to quality radio \nbroadcasting, Wynn has enhanced the lives of countless South Dakotans.\n  Wynn's honors include the Macaroni Award for the top small-market \npersonality in the country, and earlier this year she received a \ndistinguished alumni award from Drake University. She is a member of \nthe South Dakota Hall of Fame, and was named one of Yankton's top \nCitizens of the Millennium by the Press & Dakotan in 1999.\n  Wynn Speece richly deserves this distinguished recognition. \nTherefore, it is an honor for me to share her extraordinary \nprofessional accomplishments with my colleagues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/24/senate-section/article/S8118-4", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8118-S8119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         IN COMMEMORATION OF THE LIFE AND WORK OF HARRY BRIDGES\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to share with the Senate a little of the remarkable life of \nHarry Renton Bridges, one of America's great labor leaders and most \nimpassioned voices for democracy, progress and human dignity. Harry's \nmany friends and admirers will be celebrating the 100th anniversary of \nhis birth on July 28 with a march to the plaza which bears his name in \nSan Francisco.\n\n[[Page S8119]]\n\n  Harry's legend began in 1934, when he helped lead the 83-day West \nCoast longshoremen's strike. This action remains a watershed moment in \nthe history of the worker's movement in the United States. What was \naccomplished not only reverberated in San Francisco and up and down the \nWest Coast, but eventually all across the country. Prior to this time, \nworking conditions along America's waterfronts were deplorable. The men \nworked hard, for very little pay and often in very dangerous \nconditions. Under Harry's leadership, this changed. The strike brought \nemployers to the table. As a result, dock workers and seamen were \nfinally able to work with a measure of pride and security.\n  What began as an insurgent labor movement in 1934 eventually grew \ninto the International Longshore and Warehouse Union or ILWU. Under \nHarry's guidance, the ILWU helped lead the way in the fight for \nworkers' rights and forms of social justice in the United States and \naround the globe. The Union stood steadfast against fascism during the \n1930's and 40's. During the war it protested the detention of Japanese-\nAmericans. It was one of the first unions to be thoroughly racially \nintegrated. It fought McCarthyism and the communist witch hunts and \nblacklists. Harry and the ILWU spoke out early and loudly against \napartheid in South Africa. And the list goes on. Wherever Harry sensed \ninjustice he responded instinctively to correct it.\n  Harry was a native Australian, but he made San Francisco his home. \nHere he is remembered as a hero. Many credit his vision and passion as \na guiding force behind the City's compassion, tolerance and political \nprogressiveness.\n  Two years ago the San Francisco Port Authority officially named the \nnew Ferry Building plaza the Harry Bridges Plaza. It was a fitting \ntribute to a man who did so much to transform the waterfront. Efforts \nare currently underway to further honor Harry and his memory through \nthe construction of a monument on the plaza.\n  Harry was truly one of a kind. Simply put, he cared enough to make a \ndifference. Although he passed away over ten years ago, he and his \nmemory continue to live on in the hearts of those who knew him and who \ncontinue to be inspired by his example.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/24/senate-section/article/S8119-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS ROCHESTER COUNCIL #2048\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, I rise today to \npay tribute to the Knights of Columbus Council #2048 of Rochester, NH, \non the creation of the successful Future Unlimited Banquet Program. \nFuture Unlimited is an annual event which recognizes the Valedictorians \nand Salutatorians from eight high schools in the Seacoast region of New \nHampshire.\n  The eight high schools represented in the program include: St. Thomas \nAquinas High School, Berwick, ME, Dover High School, Somersworth High \nSchool, Farmington High School, Nute High School, Alton High School, \nKingswood Regional High School and Spaulding High School.\n  I commend the Knights of Columbus Rochester Council for their \nrecognition of the scholastic achievements of the high school seniors \nin the Seacoast region. As a former schoolteacher, I applaud the \nefforts of the Knights of Columbus for rewarding students who have \nestablished goals and high standards of excellence in their academic, \nextracurricular and civic endeavors.\n  The Knights of Columbus Rochester Council #2048 have served the \ncitizens of Rochester and our state with pride and honor. The young men \nand women in the Seacoast region are blessed to have the encouragement \nand support of an organization which recognizes the qualities of hard \nwork, perseverance and dedication.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nPatrick Benton. I have had the good fortune of having Patrick as part \nof my staff since 1994, and I would like to thank him for all his hard \nwork in his efforts on behalf of the people of South Dakota. Patrick is \nheading off to Colby College in September, and I have no doubt that our \nloss is their great gain.\n  While in high school, Patrick organized and led a student rally to \nsave the Rapid City School District counselors who were in jeopardy of \nlosing their jobs. Patrick represented South Dakota on a trip to Japan \nas part of the Sony student project abroad. Patrick began work as an \nintern in my Rapid City Office in mid 1998, and eventually joined my \nstaff full time in November of that same year. In September 1999, \nPatrick moved to Washington, DC, and has been a critical part of my \nstaff ever since.\n  Patrick has always been wise beyond his years, and he has built up \nthe trust and confidence of the entire staff. Patrick has worked his \nway up to a Research Assistant position, and has been an invaluable \nresource in handling matters related to banking, telecommunications, \nlabor, campaign finance reform, election reform, federal employees and \nthe Postal Service. He has mastered a vast amount of technical \nknowledge in all of these areas. When people find out Patrick is on his \nway to college, they can't figure out how someone with such knowledge \nand judgment can possibly be only 19 years old.\n  While we will sorely miss Patrick, I join with my entire staff and my \nwife, Barbara, in expressing our pride in Patrick's achievement and \npromise, and our thanks for his years of service to South Dakota. \nHowever Patrick chooses to apply his formidable intellect and talents, \nwe will all be the better for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/24/senate-section/article/S8119-3", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/24/senate-section/article/S8119-4", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting nominations \nwhich were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/24/senate-section/article/S8119-5", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8119]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:25 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 271.

A joint resolution adopted by the \n     Legislature of the State of Maine relative to the Northeast \n     Interstate Dairy Compact; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, Maine has nearly 500 dairy farms annually \n     producing milk valued at over $100,000,000; and\n       Whereas, maintaining a sufficient supply of Maine-produced \n     milk and milk products is in the best interest of Maine \n     consumers and businesses; and\n       Whereas, a University of Connecticut study, done while the \n     Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has been in existence, \n     concluded that from July 1997 to July 2000, the price of milk \n     to the consumer increased 29 cents of which 4\\1/2\\ cents went \n     to the farmer; and\n       Whereas, Maine is a member of the Northeast Interstate \n     Dairy Compact; and\n       Whereas, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact will \n     terminate at the end of September 2001 unless action is taken \n     by the Congress to reauthorize it; and\n       Whereas, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact's mission \n     is to ensure the continued viability of dairy farming in the \n     Northeast and to assure consumers of an adequate, local \n     supply of pure and wholesome milk and also helps support the \n     Women, Infants and Children program, commonly known as \n     ``WIC''; and\n       Whereas, the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact has \n     established a minimum price to be paid to dairy farmers for \n     their milk, which has helped to stabilize their incomes; and\n       Whereas, in certain months the compact's minimum price has \n     resulted in dairy farmers receiving nearly 10% more for their \n     milk than the farmers would have otherwise received; and\n       Whereas, actions taken by the compact have directly \n     benefited Maine dairy farmers by not diminishing the farmer's \n     share; now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That We, your Memorialists, respectfully urge and \n     request that the United States Congress reauthorize the \n     Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this Memorial, duly \n     authenticated by the Secretary of State, be transmitted to \n     the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the United States, \n     the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives of the Congress of the United States, each \n     member of the United States Congress who sits as chair on the \n     United States House of Representatives Committee on \n     Agriculture or the United States Senate Committee on \n     Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, the United States \n     Secretary of Agriculture and each Member of the Maine \n     Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-153. A resolution adopted by the House of the \n     Legislature of the State of Michigan relative to the Detroit \n     River International Wildlife Refuge Establishment Act; to the \n     Committee on Environmental and Public Works.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 116\n\n       Whereas, The Detroit River is a unique resource in many \n     ways. This historic water route has been a major \n     transportation thoroughfare since long before Europeans \n     arrived, and its role in commerce has been a key part of the \n     economic strength of two nations. In addition to these well-\n     documented elements, the Detroit River also hosts great \n     diversity in wildlife and ecological features; and\n       Whereas, The lower portions of the Detroit River include \n     shoals, islands, and channels that support a variety of \n     aquatic plants, fish,\n\n[[Page S8122]]\n\n     and wildlife. Although designated an American Heritage River \n     in 1998, the Detroit River is still threatened by \n     environmental practices; and\n       Whereas, Congress is considering a measure, H.R. 1230, that \n     would establish the Detroit River International Wildlife \n     Refuge. This bill would provide a mechanism to preserve the \n     character of the area through land acquisition and agreements \n     for cooperative management. Under this legislation, the \n     Secretary of the Interior could acquire land along an 18-mile \n     stretch of the Detroit River. A key component of the proposal \n     is that it does not authorize the taking of land but relies \n     upon willing sellers; and\n       Whereas, Establishing the Detroit International Wildlife \n     Refuge along one of the great metropolitan regions in the \n     country is an excellent investment in Michigan's resources; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives, That we \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to enact the \n     Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge Establishment \n     Act; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, and the members of \n     the Michigan congressional delegation.\n       Adopted by the House of Representatives, June 26, 2001\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-154. A resolution adopted by the House of the General \n     Assembly of Pennsylvania relative to issuing a Coal Miners' \n     Postal Stamp; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 121\n\n       Wheras, Our entire Nation owes our coal miners a great deal \n     more than we could ever repay them for the difficult and \n     dangerous job which they performed so that we could have the \n     fuel we needed to operate our industries and to heat our \n     homes; and\n       Whereas, It would be proper and fitting for our Nation to \n     recognize our coal miners, both past and present, for their \n     contributions to this Nation; therefore be it\n       Resolved (the Senate concurring), That the general Assembly \n     memorialize the United States Postal Service to issue a \n     postal stamp to honor our coal miners and to commemorate \n     their contributions to our nation and its citizens; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be delivered to \n     the United States Postal Service, to the presiding officers \n     of each house of Congress and to each member of Congress from \n     Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-155. A resolution adopted by the House of the General \n     Assembly of the State of Pennsylvania relative to legislation \n     protecting employees and retirees whose health care plans \n     have been terminated by companies as a result of financial \n     difficulties caused in whole or in part by unfairly traded \n     foreign imports; to the Committee on Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 212\n\n       Whereas, In the 1980s the American steel industry \n     experienced an economic crisis due to existing trade policies \n     resulting in steel mill shutdowns, steelworker layoffs and a \n     weakening of the entire steel industry; and\n       Whereas, In the early 1990s the American steel industry \n     experienced a period of relative stability; and\n       Whereas, In late 1997 and early 1998 the Asian economic \n     crisis and the collapse of the Russian economy produced a \n     flood of manufactured products, including steel, leading to \n     the most serious crisis for the steel industry since the \n     1980s; and\n       Whereas, That crisis resulted in the layoffs of 10,000 \n     steelworkers, bankruptcy of steel companies, weakening of the \n     entire steel industry and increase in the level of imports \n     deemed ``normal and acceptable'' by the Federal Government; \n     and\n       Whereas, In the week ending December 30, 2000, the steel \n     industry operated at less that 65% of capacity, its lowest \n     operating level in 14 years; and\n       Whereas, Since the beginning of the Asian economic crisis, \n     14 steel companies have been driven into bankruptcy and many \n     others are on the brink of bankruptcy; and\n       Whereas, The bankruptcy and potential bankruptcy of steel \n     companies represents a threat to the health benefits of \n     employees and retirees; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the \n     Commonwealth of Pennsylvania memorialize the President and \n     Congress to support and pass legislation establishing a \n     Health Care Benefit Guarantee Corporation similar to the \n     Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation to ensure benefits to \n     those employees and retirees whose health care plans have \n     been terminated by companies as a result of financial \n     difficulties caused in whole or in part by unfairly traded \n     foreign imports; and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the presiding officers of each house of Congress and to each \n     member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-156.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nextend the availability of Medicare cost contracts for 10 years; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Medicare \nCost Contract Extension Act of 2001.\n  For decades, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (formerly \nthe Health Care Financing Administration), has successfully offered \nhealth insurance providers two contracts to choose from: a Medicare \nrisk contract, (Medicare+Choice), and Medicare cost contract. In an \neffort to expand and refine the Medicare+Choice program, the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997 terminated the Medicare cost contract program \neffective December 31, 2002. To prevent this termination, in 1999 \nCongress passed the Balanced Budget and Refinement Act, which extended \ncost contracts for two years through 2004.\n  I am pleased that Congress passed into law this two-year extension of \nMedicare cost contracting. This extension will help Medicare \nbeneficiaries in rural communities in the United States keep the \nquality health care they currently receive under their cost contract \nplans.\n  Congress should work to extend further Medicare cost contracts. The \nMedicare Cost Contract Extension Act of 2001 would accomplish this by \nextending by ten years the cost contract sunset date of December 31, \n2004 to December 31, 2014.\n  Currently 298,683 Americans, and 18,050 Coloradans receive health \ncare through Medicare cost contracts. Of the 18,050 Coloradans with \ncost contract plans, 16,075 (89 percent) of them live in rural \nColorado, where few Medicare and Medicare+Choice providers operate. If \nMedicare cost contracts are eliminated, essentially two health care \noptions for Medicare beneficiaries would remain: traditional Medicare \nfee-for-service, which can include Medigap, and Medicare+Choice. If \nMedicare cost contracts are eliminated, as scheduled in 2004, then \nthousands of seniors will be forced into these other Medicare programs.\n  Basic Medicare and Medicare+Choice providers, however, are few in \nrural Colorado, where health care demands are great. In addition to the \nfact that 89 percent of Colorado's seniors with cost contract plans \nlive in rural areas, 6,358, 35 percent, of Colorado Medicare managed \ncare beneficiaries live in counties in which Medicare+Choice is not \neven available. Further, cost contract plans are more widely used \nacross the State than are Medicare+Choice plans: Medicare+Choice is the \nMedicare option of beneficiaries in only 20 of Colorado's 64 counties, \nwhile Medicare cost contracts are enjoyed by seniors in 46 counties in \nColorado.\n  In addition to accessibility, basic Medicare has fewer benefits than \ncost contract plans, and Medigap has higher out-of-pocket expenses than \ncost contract plans. Cost contract plans often provide more benefits \nthan Medigap, such as preventive care and prescription drug benefits, \nand Medicare Part B deductible coverage. In addition, some cost \ncontract plans offer one rate for older Medicare beneficiaries, while \nMedigap plans charge higher premiums for beneficiaries who are older.\n  Further, beneficiaries under Medicare cost contracts value the \nservices cost contracting companies offer. According to a 1999 U.S. \nDepartment of Health and Human Services study, the Medicare Managed \nCare Consumer Assessment of Health Plans Study, CAHPS, Medicare \nbeneficiaries gave Medicare cost contract health insurers higher \nratings than non-cost contract providers. Beneficiaries noted cost \ncontracting HMOs solved problems, provided care, and provided customer \nservice better than the majority of non-cost contracting providers. \nThese ratings demonstrate that cost contract insurers provide the \nquality service seniors want and the health benefits they need.\n  While the goal of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 was to provide an \nalternative to basic Medicare through Medicare+Choice, Medicare+Choice \nhas not accomplished this goal in rural America. One of the objectives \nof President Bush and Tommy Thompson, the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, is to increase in the near future Medicare+Choice enrollment. \nI support and have confidence in this effort. Until Medicare+Choice \ncoverage is readily available to rural cost contract recipients \nCongress should extend the current cost contract sunset for an \nadditional ten years.\n  Medicare beneficiaries deserve a choice in how they receive their \nhealth care. Congress should allow one of these choices to remain \nMedicare cost contracts. On behalf of the 298,683 U.S. and 18,050 \nColorado Medicare beneficiaries who obtain their health care from cost \ncontract plans, I urge my colleagues to extend Medicare cost contract \nplans for ten years.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALLEN (for himself and Mr. Warner):\n  S. 1225. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to redesign \nthe $1 bill so as to incorporate the preamble to the Constitution of \nthe United States, the Bill of Rights, and a list of the Articles of \nthe Constitution on the reverse side of such currency; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Liberty Bill \nAct, which directs the United States Treasury to print an abridged \nConstitution with the titles of salient articles and amendments of the \nConstitution of the United States on the back of our one dollar bill. \nIndeed, the redesign of a Ten, Twenty, Fifty or 100 dollar bill could \nincorporate this goal.\n  This important and innovative legislation is designed to educate, \nencourage and promote the understanding of the fundamental principles, \nthe concept of self-government, free will and the protection of \nindividual rights, of the United States for all Americans and people \naround the world who may use U.S. currency.\n  I believe that it is most fitting that the idea for the Liberty Bill \nAct began in a classroom in Liberty Middle School, in Ashland VA, and \ncarried forth by students at Patrick Henry High School in Hanover \nCounty, VA, by students who wanted to do something good for this \ncountry and its democratic principles.\n  A little more than three years ago at Virginia's Poor Farm Park's \namphitheatre, 170 students, representing Liberty Middle School, recited \nthe abridged Constitution as part of a school project. The so-called \nLiberty Bill project left them with a deeper appreciation of the \nConstitution and how important it is that we, as Americans, fully \nunderstand our heritage and the principles of freedom, justice and \nliberty. And, fortunately for the rest of us, the Liberty Bill project \nalso left them with the desire to communicate this appreciation to all \nAmericans and to all people worldwide.\n  I am proud to say that these students did not simply stop their \neducation at this juncture. Instead, they worked with their teacher, \nMr. Randy Wright, to create a proposal that would serve as a reminder \nof our rights and responsibilities as citizens of the United States.\n  After careful thought and consideration, the students decided that \nputting the thoughts of our Constitution on the back of the dollar \nbill, something that passes through the hands of millions of people \naround the world every day, would serve as the powerful reminder of how \nimportant the Constitution is to our representative democracy.\n\n[[Page S8125]]\n\n  In addition, the newly revised dollar bill would teach the progress \nof American history, highlighting amendments that were added to the \nConstitution as our nation evolved into the free and prosperous global \nleader it is today. For example, despite a strong belief in what some \ntermed the ``inherent and unalienable rights of man,'' the fledgling \nAmerican government did not protect the individual rights and liberties \nof all Americans. In fact, it was not until 1865, upon the adoption of \namendment XIII, slavery was abolished and all races were guaranteed \ntheir freedom under the law.\n  In addition, the right to vote and have a say in one's government and \nthe policies that affect everyday life, was not extended to all \nAmericans. In fact, only white men could vote until amendment XV, \nproclaimed in 1870, provided that all men could vote, regardless of \ntheir race or status as a former slave. Later, in 1920, amendment XIX \nrightfully extended suffrage to all of America's people, securing the \nright of women to have a voice in our government as well. For a \nrepresentative democracy is not truly representative until all people \nare heard.\n  Referencing constitutional amendments, such as amendments XIII, XV, \nand XIX on our dollar bill, would help to highlight not only the \nadaptive qualities of our Constitution and its ability to reflect an \nincreasingly enlightened awareness of the rights of all people, but \nteach us to appreciate and value these freedoms and rights as \nAmericans.\n  The Constitution of the United States is one of the most important \ndocuments in all of history. Yet in this day and age many Americans do \nnot even know all the rights and protections enshrined in the first ten \namendments, our Bill of Rights. Many Americans fail to recognize the \nConstitution as framework of the United States government and its \nimpact on our government and prosperity as a nation of free people.\n  The dollar bill is the most used and most recognized currency in the \nworld, every day it pass through the hands of millions of people around \nthe world. And, as the students of Liberty Middle School asked \nthemselves three years ago: ``What better way than to highlight the \nConstitution and promote the ideals and values it represents than \nputting the principles it embodies on the back of the dollar bill?''\n  Every day I come across adults who complain that they are powerless \nto affect our political process or laws. They claim that even their \nvote will not make a difference.\n  Yet, a group of middle school students, through their commitment and \ndetermination, have persevered.\n  In just three years these students have taken up the challenge to \nhelp ensure every American understands the basic precepts of our \ntreasured Constitution. This group of students developed a plan to \nreach this goal. They have gained media coverage and the endorsement of \neditorialists nationwide and their local governments, receiving acclaim \nfrom such notables as the Wall Street Journal and CNN News, although, I \nhave to believe that one of the most notable endorsements of all was \nfrom a middle school student named Jessie, who said of the Liberty Bill \nproject: ``A fantastic learning experience, the Liberty Bill has \ninspired me to pursue politics like never before.''\n  Because of their work and dedication, the impact of the Liberty Bill \nproject on the education of our students can be felt nationwide. A \nremarkable 21 schools, representing seven states, have also joined \ntheir effort, ranging from Bedwell Elementary School in New Jersey and \nFestus High School in Festus, MO, to Dickinson High School in North \nDakota and Newcastle Middle School in Wyoming.\n  The students have taken their effort all the way to Capitol Hill. The \nLiberty Bill Act, H.R. 903, introduced in the 106th Congress eventually \nsecured 107 consponsors and was supported by leadership on both sides \nof the aisle, including Speaker Hastert, Majority Leader Armey, \nMajority Whip DeLay, and Minority Leader Gephardt. In addition, eight \nCommittee Chairmen and 3 Ranking Members endorsed the Liberty Bill \nproposal. I am confident that under the guidance of Congressman Cantor, \nthe Liberty Bill will enjoy even more success during the 107th Congress \nin the House of Representatives and I am looking forward to working \nwith my colleagues to secure the Liberty Bill's success in the Senate.\n  Last February, I had the opportunity to attend a Liberty Bill Project \npresentation performed by students from the Patrick Henry High School \nof Ashland, VA. I cannot tell you how encouraging it is to see a group \nof young people who really get, who realize how important a full \nunderstanding of our Constitution is and the values it represents. Not \nonly was this presentation one of the most wholesome and inspirational \nI have seen, it convinced me that the Liberty Bill Project is an \nexemplary way of capturing our imagination and providing a major \ncontribution toward our understanding of our Constitution, history, and \nform of government.\n  Therefore, it is my privilege to stand here today, joining my \ncolleague in the House of Representatives, Congressman Eric Cantor, and \nintroduce the companion legislation in the Senate. I am proud to act as \na representative for the hard work and dedication of our students and \nsupport their efforts to teach all Americans about the importance of \nthe values and principles embodied by our Constitution.\n  Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to commend the fine \nefforts of the students of Liberty Middle School and their teacher, Mr. \nRandy Wright. Their success is a lesson to all of us, demonstrating \nthat with initiative and hard work we can easily, positively educate \nAmericans.\n  Thomas Jefferson once said, ``If a Nation expects to be ignorant and \nfree, in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never \nwill be.'' This remarkable group of young people has shown all of us \nwhat can be accomplished through dedication, creativity and a desire to \ndo what has not been done before.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1225\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Liberty Dollar Bill Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) many Americans are unaware of the provisions of the \n     Constitution of the United States, one of the most remarkable \n     and important documents in world history;\n       (2) a version of this important document, consisting of the \n     preamble, a list of the Articles, and the Bill of Rights, \n     could easily be placed on the reverse side of the $1 Federal \n     reserve note;\n       (3) the placement of this version of the Constitution on \n     the $1 Federal reserve note, a unit of currency used daily by \n     virtually all Americans, would serve to remind people of the \n     historical importance of the Constitution and its impact on \n     their lives today; and\n       (4) Americans would be reminded by the preamble of the \n     blessings of liberty, by the Articles, of the framework of \n     the Government, and by the Bill of Rights, of some of the \n     historical changes to the document that forms the very core \n     of the American experience.\n\n     SEC. 3. REDESIGN OF REVERSE SIDE OF THE BILL.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 5114 of title 31, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(d) Liberty Dollar Bills.--\n       ``(1) In general.--In addition to the requirements of \n     subsection (b) (relating to the inclusion of the inscription \n     `In God We Trust' on all United States currency) and the \n     eighth undesignated paragraph of section 16 of the Federal \n     Reserve Act, the design of the reverse side of the $1 Federal \n     reserve notes shall incorporate the preamble to the \n     Constitution of the United States, a list of the Articles of \n     the Constitution, and a list of the first 10 amendments to \n     the Constitution.\n       ``(2) Design--Subject to paragraph (3), the preamble of the \n     Constitution of the United States, the list of the Articles \n     of the Constitution, and the first 10 amendments to the \n     Constitution shall appear on the reverse side of the $1 \n     Federal reserve note, in such form as the Secretary deems \n     appropriate.\n       ``(3) Authority of secretary.--The requirements of this \n     subsection shall not be construed as--\n       ``(A) prohibiting the inclusion of any other inscriptions \n     or material on the reverse side of the $1 Federal reserve \n     note that the Secretary may determine to be necessary or \n     appropriate; or\n       ``(B) limiting any other authority of the Secretary with \n     regard to the design of the $1 Federal reserve note, \n     including the adoption of any design features to deter the \n     counterfeiting of United States currency.''.\n\n[[Page S8126]]\n\n       (b) Date of Application.--The amendment made by subsection \n     (a) shall apply to $1 Federal reserve notes that are first \n     placed into circulation after December 31, 2001.\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I am deferring to my junior colleague from \nVirginia and am pleased to be an original cosponsor of legislation \nintroduced by Senator Allen to place actual language from the \nConstitution on the back of the one dollar bill.\n  This legislation is related to a bill I introduced last year based on \nthe idea of students at Liberty Middle School in Ashland, Va. Working \nwith their teacher, Randy Wright, this began as a school project \nseveral years ago. I commend these students and Mr. Wright for their \ncontinued dedication on seeing this idea realized.\n  If you would think for a minute about the circulation of one dollar. \nit is fascinating to imagine how many people this message will reach, \njust how many hands a dollar will pass through even in just one year. \nMoreover, I believe this initiative exemplifies many of the principles \nlaid out in the Constitution and the people's role in our government.\n  The Constitution is our Nation's most noble achievement. It embodies \nthe freedoms and liberties we enjoy as Americans, and gives value and \nmeaning to the laws by which we live. I agree with the students of \nLiberty Middle School that the Constitution belongs to the people. It \nshould be in their hands.\n  I am pleased to support this important initiative.\n                                   ____\n                                 \n      By Mr. CAMPBELL:\n  S. 1226. A bill to require the display of the POW/MIA flag at the \nWorld War II memorial, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, and the \nVietnam Veterans Memorial; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CAMPBELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the POW/MIA Memorial \nFlag Act of 2001. I am pleased to be joined by my friend and colleague \nSenator Allard as an original co-sponsor.\n  I want to begin my statement today describing a powerful and \nemotional sight that moves us to the core of our faith and beliefs \nabout America and about those who served in the Armed Forces of our \nNation.\n  Many of us have visited one or more of the military academies that \ntrain America's future military leaders. These academies have varied \nmissions and yet all of them share in the critical task of developing \nleaders for their particular branch of service. On the grounds of each \nacademy is a chapel, spectacular places that are easily identifiable as \nplaces of worship.\n  In each chapel, a place has been reserved for those prisoners of war \nand the missing in action from each particular service. A pew has been \nset aside and marked by a candle, a powerful symbol that not all have \nreturned from battle. These hallowed places have been set aside so that \nall POW's and MIA's are remembered with dignity and honor. It is a \nmoving and emotional experience to pause at these reserved pews, to be \nencouraged by the burning candle, to recall the valor and sacrifice of \nthose soldiers, sailors, marines, and pilots and to be inspired today \nby what they have done.\n  Yes, I believe we can and should do more to honor the memory of all \nthe POW's and MIA's who have so gallantly served our nation.\n  Therefore, today I am introducing the POW/MIA Memorial Flag Act of \n2001. This act would require the display of the POW/MIA flag at the \nWorld War II Memorial, the Korea War Veterans Memorial, and the Vietnam \nVeterans Memorial, all here in the Nation's Capital, on any day on \nwhich the United States flag is displayed.\n  Congress has officially recognized the POW/MIA flag. Displaying this \nflag would be a powerful symbol to all Americans that we have not \nforgotten, and will not forget.\n  As my colleagues well know, the United States has fought in many \nwars, and thousands of Americans who served in those wars were captured \nby the enemy or listed as missing in action. In 20th century wars \nalone, more than 147,000 Americans were captured and became prisoners \nof war; of that number more than 15,000 died while in captivity. When \nwe add to the number those who are still missing in action, we realize \nthat more can be done to honor their commitment to duty, honor, and \ncountry.\n  The display of the POW/MIA flag would be a forceful reminder that we \ncare not only for them, but also for their families who personally \ncarry with them the burden of sacrifice. We want them to know that they \ndo not stand alone, that we stand with them and beside them, as they \nremember the loyalty and devotion of those who served.\n  As a veteran who served in Korea, I personally know that the \nremembrance of another's sacrifice in battle is one of the highest and \nmost noble acts we can do. Let us now demonstrate our indebtedness and \ngratitude for those who served that we might live in freedom.\n  Just as those special reserved pews in the chapels of the military \nacademies recall the spirit and presence of our POW's and MIA's, so too \nwill the display of their flag over the World War II Memorial, the \nKorean War Veterans Memorial, and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial be a \nspecial reminder that we have not forgotten, and will not forget. This \ncoming September 21, 2001, is National POW/MIA Recognition Day. I \ninvite my Senate colleagues to please join me in passing this bill by \nthen to display the POW/MIA flag on this special day.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1226\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``POW/MIA Memorial Flag Act of \n     2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DISPLAY OF POW/MIA FLAG AT WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL, \n                   KOREAN WAR MEMORIAL, AND VIETNAM VETERANS \n                   MEMORIAL.\n\n       (a) Requirement for Display.--Subsection (d)(3) of section \n     902 of title 36, United States Code, is amended by striking \n     ``The Korean War Veterans Memorial and the Vietnam Veterans \n     Memorial'' and inserting ``The World War II memorial, the \n     Korean War Veterans Memorial, and the Vietnam Veterans \n     Memorial''.\n       (b) Days for Display.--Subsection (c)(2) of that section is \n     amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subparagraphs (A) and (B) as \n     subparagraphs (B) and (C), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting before subparagraph (B), as so \n     redesignated, the following new subparagraph (A):\n       ``(A) in the case of display at the World War II memorial, \n     Korean War Veterans Memorial, and Vietnam Veterans Memorial \n     (required by subsection (d)(3) of this section), any day on \n     which the United States flag is displayed;''.\n       (c) Display on Existing Flagpole.--No element of the United \n     States Government may construe the amendments made by this \n     section as requiring the acquisition of erection of a new or \n     additional flagpole for purposes of the display of the POW/\n     MIA flag.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. THURMOND (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 1228. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to authorize \npilot projects under which private companies in the United States may \nuse Federal inmate labor to produce items that would otherwise be \nproduced by foreign labor, to revise the authorities and operations of \nFederal Prison Industries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would comprehensively reform Federal Prison Industries or UNICOR. \nIt would eliminate the preference that Prison Industries currently has \nto make products for the Federal Government, while for the first time \nallowing private companies to partner with FPI for inmate labor. These \nchanges would benefit all interested parties without endangering this \nessential inmate work program. I am pleased to have Senator Hatch as an \noriginal cosponsor for this important bill.\n  FPI is a self-sufficient government corporation that provides work \nfor over 20,000 inmates in the Federal Bureau of Prisons. This program \nis critical to keeping inmates productively occupied, which helps keep \nprisons safe for staff, inmates, and the public. At the same time, \ninmates learn important job skills that they can use when they return \nto society. FPI has been proven to be the best prison program in \nhelping prevent inmates from returning to a life of crime. It does all \nof this without costing any taxpayer money.\n  Prison Industries is an especially critical program today as the \ninmate\n\n[[Page S8127]]\n\npopulation continues to grow dramatically. The number of Federal \nprisoners has doubled since 1989, and is continuing to grow every year. \nFor the Bureau of Prisons to maintain just 25 percent of the work-\neligible inmates in FPI, it must produce more and more products to keep \nits growing population working and occupied.\n  Since it was created in 1934, Prison Industries has had the authority \nto sell products only to Federal agencies and not to the private \nsector. In return, Federal agencies generally must purchase items that \nFPI makes, if it can provide them on time and at competitive prices. \nThis is known as the mandatory source requirement.\n  The equity of mandatory source has been debated for years. I believe \nthat we should resolve this issue once and for all in this Congress by \neliminating this governmental preference. However, we should do so in a \nway that will maintain, not destroy, this successful work program.\n  The preference that FPI currently has regarding the Federal market is \nessential as long as Prison Industries is only permitted to sell \nproducts to Federal agencies. However, Prison Industries can do much \nmore and actually be a partner with the private sector if it has the \nopportunity. Thus, this bill would eliminate the mandatory source \nrequirement, and it would allow private businesses to contract with FPI \nfor inmates to make the company's products in the commercial market, \nboth domestically and overseas.\n  One of the most promising areas for prison labor today is overseas \nmarkets where American companies simply cannot compete today. \nEconomists, including respected labor expert Professor Richard Freeman, \nhave argued that one of the best uses of prison labor is to produce \ngoods that are not made in the United States, such as toys. This could \nhelp the American economy by bringing jobs back that we have lost. Of \ncourse, if prisoners make products that are not made in the United \nStates, they are not displacing American workers. However, jobs would \nnot only be created in prisons but also in the private sector. Private \ncompanies would provide raw materials, transport goods, and otherwise \nsupplement the prison labor. This is a creative way to bring \nback industries whose entire economic support structure is overseas.\n\n  Also, this could prove to help FPI reduce its need to make the type \nof products that it makes today while keeping inmates just as busy. It \nwould also make the work experience for the inmates even more practical \nif they were making products for the private companies. Thus, the \nlegislation would permit private companies to contract with FPI to \nprovide the labor to make products that are otherwise being made by \nforeign labor outside the United States, and pay the inmates at the \ncurrent prison industry wages.\n  We must keep in mind that FPI has hidden burdens that increase its \nlabor costs. Inmates are significantly less productive than private \nworkers for various reasons including limited skills, less education, \nand the security needs at prisoner work areas. Nevertheless, under this \nlegislation, when FPI contracted with private companies domestically, \nit would pay inmates the same as private employees who do the same type \nof work in the area. These ``comparable locality wages'' are identical \nto the wages that state prison industry work programs provide today. As \nunder state prison work programs, the pay could never be below the \nFederal minimum wage.\n  The additional money that inmates would earn under these new higher \nwages would be used to help pay debts that the inmate owes to society, \nsuch as more restitution to victims and child support obligations. \nAlso, if funds were available, inmates would reimburse the government \nfor a portion of their room and board costs.\n  Further, the bill would increase the size of the Prison Industries \nBoard of Directors to provide greater representation, including members \nrecommended by the Senate and House leadership. Also, decisions about \nwhether a product is otherwise being made by foreign workers outside \nthe United States would be determined by an independent panel, separate \nfrom the Prison Industries Board. This panel would consist of \nrepresentatives of the Departments of Commerce and Labor, as well as \nlabor unions and the business community.\n  The cornerstone of the legislation is that the mandatory source \nrequirement would be eliminated, which is a change that has long been \nsought by certain business and labor interests. The bill would phase it \nout over five years to permit a smooth transition and prevent any major \ndisruptions in inmate labor programs. However, during this period, FPI \nwould be prohibited from expanding beyond its current mandatory source \nlevels in any existing federal market.\n  I believe that this bill represents comprehensive, fundamental reform \nof Prison Industries. It would not be an easy task for Prison \nIndustries to transform its market, as this bill would require. \nHowever, I think this legislation constitutes a fair and equitable \ncompromise for this longstanding issue. It eliminates the mandatory \nsource once and for all. At the same time, it creates new markets for \nprison labor, especially overseas markets where America simply cannot \ncompete today.\n  It is time that we took an entirely new approach toward the issue of \nprison labor. We have the opportunity to move Prison Industries into \nthe new century as a new, dynamic partner with the private sector. I \nencourage my colleagues to join me and Senator Hatch in supporting this \nbold reform initiative.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a section by \nsection analysis be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1228\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

CONFORMING AMENDMENT.\n\n       Section 436 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking ``Whoever,'' and inserting ``Except as otherwise \n     provided in this title, whoever,''.\n                                  ____\n\n\n      Federal Inmate Work Act of 2001 Section-by-Section Analysis\n\n\n                         section 1. short title\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Inmate Work Act of \n     2001.''\n\nsection. 2. authority to carry out pilot projects using federal inmate \n                     labor to replace foreign labor\n\n     (a) Foreign Labor Substitute Pilot Projects\n       This section authorizes Federal Prison Industries, FPI or \n     trade name UNICOR, to carry out pilot projects to produce \n     products for private companies that would otherwise be \n     produced by foreign labor. FPI currently has authority to \n     perform commercial market services, but not for products. The \n     interstate commerce restrictions contained in 18 U.S.C. 1761 \n     concerning products are deemed not to apply to such projects \n     when the provisions below are met.\n     (b) Foreign Labor Substitute Panel\n       This section establishes a Foreign Labor Substitute Panel, \n     selected by the Attorney General. The Panel is to consist of \n     eight members. In order to ensure that there is \n     representation from those with expertise in the affected \n     areas, this section provides that the Panel must be comprised \n     of one representative from the Department of Commerce, the \n     Department of Labor, the International Trade Commission, and \n     the Small Business Administration; two representatives from \n     the business community; and two representatives from \n     organized labor. The Panel is not to receive pay, benefits, \n     or allowances for their services, but may receive travel \n     expenses. Any findings of the Panel must be made available to \n     the public.\n       This section requires the Panel to review proposals for \n     pilot projects. The Panel is authorized to approve a pilot \n     project if, and only if, the Panel determines that: 1. the \n     pilot will be carried out by one or more United States \n     companies and 2. the goods, wares or merchandise proposed \n     under the pilot would otherwise be manufactured, produced or \n     mined by foreign labor.\n\n\n  Section 3. Restatement and Improvement of Federal Prison Industries \n                                Program\n\n     Sec. 4121. Federal Prison Industries: status, mission, and \n       management\n\n     (a) Status\n       This section states FPI's status as a government \n     corporation, whose headquarters is located in the District of \n     Columbia.\n     (b) Mission\n       This section states that FPI's mission is to carry out \n     industrial operations in accordance with the parameters of \n     this section.\n     (c) Board of Directors\n       FPI's current statute provides for six Presidentially \n     appointed Board of Directors who represent industry, labor, \n     agriculture, retailers and consumers, the Secretary of \n     Defense and the Attorney General. This section substitutes \n     the Attorney General for the President and expands FPI's \n     Board of Directors from the current six members to twelve \n     members to increase representation from business, organized \n     labor, victims of crime, and the inmate rehabilitation \n     community. Four members would be required to be selected from \n     the recommendations of the House and Senate majority and \n     minority leadership. The Board also must include two \n     representatives from the business community, two from \n     organized labor, one member representing victims of crime, \n     one representing prisoner rehabilitation community, and two \n     additional members whose background and expertise the \n     Attorney General deems appropriate.\n       This section continues the current provision that the Board \n     of Directors serve without pay, allowances, or benefits. The \n     members of the Board shall serve for a four year term or \n     until the remainder of a four year term if a member is \n     replaced. Seven board members constitute a quorum. The term \n     limits for the first appointments are varied in order to \n     provide for term limits that are staggered. The Chairman of \n     the Board is to be elected by members of the Board.\n\n     Sec. 4122. Federal Prison Industries: operating objectives, \n       standards, and requirements\n\n     (a) Operating Objectives\n       This section requires that FPI's operations be conducted so \n     as to: 1. increase public safety and reduce recidivism by \n     providing meaningful employment and vocational skills, 2. \n     minimize adverse effects on domestic companies or workers, 3. \n     provide meaningful employment and vocational training for not \n     less than 25 percent of eligible inmate workers, 4. provide \n     income so as to help inmates pay their financial obligations, \n     5. generate sufficient revenue to fund the corporation, and \n     6. provide market quality and competitively priced products \n     and services.\n     (b) Performance Standards\n       This section requires FPI to comply with standards, as \n     applicable to correctional industry programs, including: \n     United Nations standards, and International Labor \n     Organization Conventions to which the United States is a \n     signatory party, Federal standards, and American Correctional \n     Association Standards.\n     (c) Voluntariness\n       This section requires that inmates participate in FPI \n     operations voluntarily. This is currently FPI's practice.\n     (d) Wage Rates\n       This section requires that inmate workers be paid the wage \n     rates prescribed by the Board of Directors, unless otherwise \n     provided by law.\n     (e) Protection of Certain Information\n       This section prohibits inmates from having access to \n     personal or national security information, that is otherwise \n     not publicly available.\n     (f) Vocational Training\n       While FPI is authorized to fund vocational training \n     programs, this section specifies that where financially \n     feasible, FPI contribute at least twenty percent of its net \n     profits each year for this purpose.\n     (g) Exemption from Public Contracting and Procurement Laws\n       In order to be as competitive as possible in commercial \n     market ventures, this section exempts FPI from federal \n     procurement and public contracting requirements. This \n     provision is consistent with exemptions granted to other \n     federal agencies with commercial-like missions, such as the \n     U.S. Postal Service and the U.S. Mint.\n     (h) Liability\n       This section provides that personal injuries arising out of \n     FPI work shall be compensated pursuant to the Federal \n     Employees' Compensation Act, for Federal Employees, or the \n     Federal Tort Claims Act, for all other persons. This is \n     consistent with current law.\n     (i) Deductions from Wages\n       This section permits the Board of Directors to make \n     deductions from the amounts paid to FPI inmate workers to pay \n     court ordered fines, restitution, child support, to \n     compensate for reasonable charges for costs of incarceration, \n     to compensate crime victims, and for amounts to be held on \n     account and paid to the inmate upon release from the custody \n     of the BOP. With certain exceptions, the deductions may not \n     exceed 80 percent for FPI inmate workers being paid higher \n     wage rates that comply with 18 U.S.C. 1761(c), for Prison \n     Industry Enhancement pilot projects, or 50 percent for FPI \n     inmate workers being paid prison industry wage rates. Current \n     BOP policy permits these deductions to a maximum of 50 \n     percent. This section requires that inmates agree in advance \n     to any deductions, withholdings, or disbursement of those \n     amounts.\n\n     Sec. 4123. Federal Prison Industries: transactions authorized\n\n     (a) Sales to Agencies and Not-For-Profits\n       This section permits FPI to sell its products, as well as \n     services (which are already authorized in the commercial \n     market), to government agencies and not for profit \n     organizations. Currently, FPI may only sell its products to \n     the federal government.\n\n[[Page S8131]]\n\n     (b) Sales of Certain Commodities\n       This section also permits FPI to carry out programs to \n     manufacture commodities specified in 18 U.S.C. 1761(b) \n     (agricultural commodity sales, as well as commodities sold to \n     federal, D.C. or state entities).\n     (c) Participation in Foreign Labor Substitute Pilot Projects\n       This section authorizes FPI to participate in pilot \n     projects as approved by the Foreign Labor Substitute Panel.\n     (d) Participation in BJA Pilot Projects\n       This section authorizes FPI to make its products (in \n     addition to services which are currently authorized) for \n     private companies if inmates are paid a wage rate that \n     complies with 18 U.S.C. 1761(c). This is similar to the \n     authority that state prisons currently have to sell products \n     to the commercial market, provided the inmates are paid \n     comparable locality wages pursuant to the Prison Industry \n     Enhancement, P.I.E., Program.\n     (e) Requirements for Contracts with Private Companies\n       In FPI contracts with companies pursuant to a pilot \n     program, the contracts must require the inmate work to be \n     carried out in a FPI facility. The contract must prohibit the \n     private company from displacing any of its existing domestic \n     workers as a direct result of the contract with FPI. Any \n     workforce reductions carried out by the company performing \n     comparable work must apply first to the inmate workers \n     performing work under the contract.\n     (f) Goals for Certain Businesses\n       This section requires FPI, in consultation with the Small \n     Business Administration, to establish and strive to meet or \n     exceed realistic goals for entering into contracts with small \n     business concerns and with small business concerns owned and \n     controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged \n     individuals.\n     (g) Job Opportunities for Blind and Severely Disabled \n         Individuals\n       This section requires FPI to establish business \n     partnerships with organizations representing domestic workers \n     who are blind and severely disabled to create job \n     opportunities in furtherance of its efforts to contract with \n     private companies.\n     (h) Donation of Products and Services\n       FPI would be authorized to donate products or services in \n     the Board's discretion, which it currently cannot do.\n     (i) Catalog\n       This section requires FPI to continue to maintain a catalog \n     of its products and services and keep it updated.\n\n\n    SECTION 4. ELIMINATION OF MANDATORY SOURCE PURCHASE REQUIREMENT\n\n       This section requires FPI to phase out its use of the \n     mandatory source preference.\n     (a) In General\n       This section clarifies that the mandatory source preference \n     in section 4124 applies to products only. Neither this \n     section nor section 4124 require any Federal Government \n     agency or department to purchase services from FPI. As is \n     currently required by law, this section requires each Federal \n     department or agency to report purchases from FPI to the \n     Federal Procurement Data System. See 41 U.S.C. 405(d)(4). \n     This section further clarifies that federal entities may \n     continue to buy FPI products or services voluntarily and \n     directly from FPI, even without the mandatory source \n     requirement.\n     (b) Plan for Phased Elimination of Mandatory Source\n       This section requires that the Board of Directors develop \n     and submit a plan to Congress within 180 days after the \n     enactment of this Act, that would phase out mandatory source \n     over a five year period.\n     (c) Public Availability of Plan\n       This section requires that FPI publish the plan in a \n     commercial business publication with national circulation, \n     and make it available to the public.\n     (d) Repeal of Mandatory Source Requirement\n       Effective five years after the date the plan is submitted, \n     this section repeals the mandatory source requirement.\n\n\n               SECTION 5. PERIODIC EVALUATION AND REPORTS\n\n     Sec. 4127. Periodic evaluation and reports\n\n     (a) Evaluation by GAO\n       This section requires the GAO to provide for annual \n     evaluations to assess the continued viability of FPI and its \n     ability to contract with private companies without adversely \n     affecting domestic companies or workers. The GAO is to ensure \n     that the views of the Foreign Labor Substitute Panel, private \n     industry, organized labor, FPI's Board of Directors and the \n     public are sought in the development of appropriate \n     evaluation methodologies by which to assess the program's \n     overall success.\n       This Section also requires the GAO to report annually to \n     Congress its evaluation FPI's operations, to include any \n     concerns raised about any adverse impact on domestic \n     companies or workers; the extent to which FPI was able to \n     maintain at least a 25 percent employment rate for work \n     eligible inmates; the extent to which FPI was able to conduct \n     its operations in a financially self-sustaining manner; and \n     any recommended legislation, if any, for statutory changes to \n     improve the administration or effects of the program, \n     including recommended remedial actions.\n     (b) Annual Report by Board of Directors\n       This section requires FPI to report annually to Congress on \n     its operations and financial condition. Although the current \n     statute requires these annual reports, this section expands \n     the specific information to be included in such reports, such \n     as the total sales of FPI products and services to Federal \n     agencies and to private companies, the total purchase by \n     Federal agency of each product and service, and the FPI share \n     of the total Federal Government purchases. An analysis shall \n     also determine the number of inmates employed, and the number \n     and percentage of employed inmates in the production of \n     products and the performance of services authorized for \n     production and sale to agencies and private companies. The \n     report must also include information concerning any \n     employment obtained by former inmates upon release that is \n     useful in determining whether the employment provided by FPI \n     during incarceration provided those inmates with knowledge \n     and skill in a trade or occupation that enabled those inmates \n     to earn a livelihood upon release.\n\n     Sec. 4130. Construction of Provisions\n\n       This section is intended to preclude Federal inmates from \n     asserting an employee-employer relationship or other \n     entitlements out of their work with FPI.\n\n\n            SECTION 6. RULES OF CONSTRUCTION AND DEFINITIONS\n\n     Sec. 4131. Definitions\n\n       This section defines the terms used in this Act.\n\n\n                    SECTION 7. CONFORMING AMENDMENT.\n\n       This section makes a conforming amendment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WELLSTONE (for himself and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 1229. A bill to amend the Federal Food Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \npermit individuals to import prescription drugs in limited \ncircumstances; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nhelps to correct the injustice that finds American consumers the least \nlikely of any in the industrialized world to be able to afford drugs \nmanufactured by the American pharmaceutical industry. The reason is the \nunconscionable prices the industry charges only here in the United \nStates.\n  I am under no illusion that this legislation provides comprehensive \nor ultimate relief to Americans who are struggling to afford the \nprescription drugs they need. However, this bill does expose and \nhighlight the problem American consumers face and it provides a certain \nmeasure of immediate relief for individuals struggling with the high \ncost of prescription drugs.\n  When I return to Minnesota which I do frequently, I meet with many \nconstituents, but none with more compelling stories than senior \ncitizens struggling to make ends meet because of the high cost of \nprescription drugs, life-saving drugs that are not covered under the \nMedicare program. Ten or twenty years ago these same senior citizens \nwere going to work everyday--in the stores, and factories, and mines in \nMinnesota, earning an honest paycheck, and paying their taxes without \nprotest. Now they wonder, how can this government, their government, \nstand by, when the medicines they need are out of reach.\n  It is not just that Medicare does not cover these drugs. The \nunfairness which Minnesotans feel is exacerbated of course by the high \ncost of prescription drugs here in the United States, the same drugs \nthat can be purchased for frequently half the price in Canada or \nEurope. These are the exact same drugs, manufactured in the exact same \nfacilities with the exact same safety precautions. A year ago, most \nAmericans did not know that the exact same drugs are for sale at half \nthe price in Canada. Today, you can bet the pharmaceutical industry \nwishes no one knew it. But the cat is out of the bag, and it is time \nfor Congress to begin to address these inequities.\n  Legislators, especially from Northern States but also from all around \nthe country, have heard first-hand stories from constituents who are \njustifiably frustrated and discouraged when they can't afford to buy \nprescription drugs that are made in the United States, unless they go \nacross the border to Canada where those same drugs, manufactured in the \nsame facilities are available for about half the price. It is time to \ncodify the right of Americans to go to Canada and certain other \ncountries to buy the prescription drugs they need at a price they can \nafford. And it is time to allow Americans to obtain those necessary \nmedications through the mail as well.\n\n[[Page S8132]]\n\n  Driving to Canada every few months to buy prescription drugs at \naffordable prices isn't the solution; it is a symptom of how broken \nparts of our health care system are. Americans regardless of party have \na fundamental belief in fairness, and know a rip-off when they see one. \nIt is time to allow Americans to end-run that rip-off.\n  While we can be proud of both American scientific research that \nproduces new miracle cures and the high standards of safety and \nefficacy that we expect to be followed at the FDA, it is shameful that \nAmerica's most vulnerable citizens, the chronically ill and the \nelderly, are being asked to pay the highest prices in the world here in \nthe U.S. for the exact same medications manufactured here but sold more \ncheaply overseas.\n  That is why today I am introducing with Senator Stabenow the Personal \nPrescription Drug Import Fairness Act, a bill which will amend the \nFood, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to allow Americans to legally import \nprescription drugs into the United States for their personal use as \nlong as the drugs meet FDA's strict safety standards. With this \nlegislation, Americans will be able to legally purchase these FDA-\napproved drugs in person or by mail at huge savings.\n  What this bill does is to address the absurd situation by which \nAmerican consumers are paying substantially higher prices for their \nprescription drugs than are the citizens of Canada, and the rest of the \nindustrialized world. This bill does not create any new Federal \nprograms. Instead it uses principles frequently cited in both house of \nthe Congress, principles of open trade and competition, on a personal \nlevel, to help make it possible for American consumers to purchase the \nprescription drugs they need.\n  The need is clear. A recent informal survey by the Minnesota Senior \nFederation on the price of six commonly used prescription medications \nshowed that Minnesota consumers pay, on average, nearly double, 196 \npercent, that paid by their Canadian counterparts. These excessive \nprices apply to drugs manufactured by U.S. pharmaceutical firms, the \nsame drugs that are sold for just a fraction of the U.S. price in \nCanada and Europe.\n\n  Now, however, Federal law allows only the manufacturer of a drug to \nimport it into the U.S. It is time to stop protecting the \npharmaceutical industry's outrageous profits, and they are outrageous, \nand give all Americans the legal right to purchase their prescription \ndrugs directly from a pharmacy in a limited number of countries with \nregulatory systems the FDA has found meet certain minimal standards.\n  Last year, the editors of Fortune Magazine, writing about 1999 \npharmaceutical industry profits, noted that ``Whether you gauge \nprofitability by median return on revenues, assets, or equity, \npharmaceuticals had a Viagra kind of year.'' In 2000, drug company \nprofits were just as excessive.\n  Let's take a look at the numbers, so there can be no mistake:\n  Where the average Fortune 500 industry in the United States returned \n4.5 percent profits as a percentage of revenue, the pharmaceutical \nindustry returned 18.6 percent.\n  Where the average Fortune 500 industry returned 3.3 percent profits \nas a percentage of their assets, the pharmaceutical industry returned \n17 percent.\n  Where the average Fortune 500 industry returned 14.6 percent profits \nas a percentage of shareholders equity, the pharmaceutical industry \nreturned 29.4 percent.\n  Those record profits are no surprise to America's senior citizens \nbecause they know where those profits come from, they come from their \nown pocketbooks. It is time to end the price gouging.\n  We need every piece of legislation we can get to help assure our \nSenior Citizens and all Americans that safe and affordable prescription \nmedications can be legally obtained from countries with a track records \nof prescription drug safety. The Personal Prescription Drug Import \nFairness Act is one such step.\n  We all know that the giant step this Congress should be taking is the \nenactment of a comprehensive Medicare prescription drug benefit. Such a \nbenefit should address two issues. First, Medicare beneficiaries are \nentitled to a drug benefit as good as Congress provides for itself. \nThat means a low deductible, 20 percent copay, a cap on out-of-pocket \nexpenses of about $2,000, and affordable premiums. Second, we need \nseriously to address the outrageously high prices that Americans are \nforced to pay for prescription drugs. If we address those high prices, \nwe can provide a comprehensive benefit at a price that is affordable to \nMedicare beneficiaries and to the Federal Government. I have already \nintroduced a bill, S. 925, the Medicare Extension of Drugs to Seniors \nAct of 2001, that provides affordable comprehensive benefits and makes \nit possible to enact them by reigning in the ever increasing cost of \npharmaceuticals using three complimentary approaches.\n  But, while we wait for the Finance Committee and this Congress to act \non a Medicare drug benefit, we should not lose the opportunity to \nprovide some needed relief. That is why I am introducing the Personal \nPrescription Drug Import Fairness Act today.\n  This bill includes specific protections, which were not included in a \nrecent House-passed amendment to the Agriculture Appropriations bill. \nThese protections include: 1. importation for personal use only of no \nmore than a 3 month supply at any one time; 2. limitation on country of \norigin; 3. no importation of controlled substances or biologics; 4. \nrequirement that imported drug be accompanied by a form prescribed by \nthe Secretary of HHS in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury \nthat makes clear what overseas pharmacy is dispensing the drug, who \nwill be receiving it, and who will be responsible for the recipients \nmedical care with the drug in the United States.\n  The only things that are not protected in this bill are the excessive \nprofits of the pharmaceutical industry. My job as a United States \nSenator is not to protect those profits but to protect the people. \nColleagues, please join in and support this thoughtful and necessary \nbill that will help make prescription drugs more affordable to the \nAmerican people.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRIST (for himself and Mrs. Clinton):\n  S. 1230. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to focus \nAmerican efforts on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria in developing \ncountries; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to discuss critically important \nlegislation that I am introducing today along with Senator Clinton to \naddress the internatinal crises of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. \nThe threats of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria are not strictly \nAmerican problems, they ignore national borders, threatening the entire \nworld. Together, these three diseases cause over 300 million illnesses \nand five million death each year.\n  We are all aware of the chilling global impact of HIV/AIDS, 22 \nmillion have already died worldwide and more than three million in the \nlast year alone. Sixty million are currently infected with HIV, a \nnumber that increases by 15,000 each day. In 2000, 2.4 million \nindividuals died in Africa alone.\n  Tuberculosis and malaria are also ravaging the developing world. \nEight million people are infected with tuberculosis each year; over two \nmillion of whom die. There are over 400 million clinical cases of \nmalaria diagnosed each year, resulting in over one million deaths. Over \n700,000 of those who die each year are children. Malaria is endemic to \n101 countries and territories.\n  Not only do these three diseases produce over 50 percent of the \ndeaths due to infectious diseases each year, but they also have complex \ndisease patterns that result in them facilitating each other's spread. \nBy weakening the immune system, infection with HIV increases \nsusceptibility to both tuberculosis and malaria. Furthermore, the \nincreasing number of multi-resistant tuberculosis cases is largely \nattributed to resistance developed in HIV-infected patients. Finally, \nin treating severe anemia that commonly accompanies illness due to \nmalaria, untested blood transfusions create a method of HIV/AIDs \nspread.\n  Historically, the United States has played a critical role in \naddressing international crises. There is perhaps no greater crisis \nthat we face worldwide than the spread of deadly infectious disease. \nTherefore, we must provide the leadership to confront the\n\n[[Page S8133]]\n\nglobal HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis epidemics. History will \nrecord how we respond to the call.\n  We know what is needed to reverse the epidemic. Work by community-\nbased organizations, both religious and secular, has been the linchpin \nof grassroots success. As a surgeon, I have traveled to numerous areas \nof Africa, Sudan, Kenya, the Congo, and Uganda. I have performed \noperations in converted school houses and ill-equipped hospitals where \nI seen first-hand the great need, and the important role, that American \ninvolvement can play in providing hope through health education and \ntreatment.\n  We fight this battle in two ways--by improving primary prevention and \nexpanding access to treatment. Actions to provide drugs to developing \ncountries at dramatically reduced costs represent a promise to those \ncurrently suffering from AIDS. However, access to those treatments \nwithout appropriate health care infrastructure is a moot point. We must \nsupport the development of effective health care delivery systems, \npersonnel training and infrastructure. We must also support programs \ntargeting affected by AIDS, such as the millions of orphans.\n  I have already introduced legislation with Senator Kerry, the \nInternational Infectious Diseases Control Act of 2001. This Act would \ndirect the President to work with foreign governments, the United \nNations, UN, the World bank, and the private sector to establish the \nGlobal AIDS and Health Fund to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria, and \ntuberculosis. This fund would provide grants to governments and non-\ngovernmental organizations for implementation of effective and \naffordable HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis programs, with initial \npriority to programs to combat HIV/AIDS.\n  It is important to contribute to these international efforts not only \nby providing monetary support but also our time, our energy, and our \nexpertise. Therefore, today Senator Clinton and I are introducing \nlegislation to help mobilize our Nation's public health infrastructure \nin the fight against international HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. \nThe Global Leadership in Developing an Expanded Response, GLIDER, \ninitiative will place American health care providers in nations \nconfronting the epidemics of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria and \nprovide them with the tools to carry out prevention programs, care, \ntreatment, and infrastructure development. In addition, it will \nevaluate current methods of treatment and levels of access to treatment \nand enhance disease surveillance. Finally, it will increase funding for \nresearch into treatment and vaccine development.\n  The GLIDER initiative expands programs administered by the \nDepartments of State, Health and Human Services, Defense, and Labor to \nensure that U.S. government agencies are contributing their scientific \nand diplomatic expertise to the problems associated with the spread of \nHIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis throughout the world.\n  This initiative, coordinated through the offices of the Secretary of \nState and Secretary of Health and Human Services, in collaboration with \nthe Secretaries of Defense and Labor, targets four objectives: to \npromote and expand our primary prevention efforts, improve clinic-, \ncommunity- and home-based care and treatment, provide assistance to \nthose individuals who are affected by such diseases such as AIDS \norphans and families, and assist with capacity and infrastructure \ndevelopment.\n  The close partnership between the Departments of State and Health and \nHuman Services will be crucial in ensuring that this program is run in \ncomplete coordination with national, regional and local initiatives, \nmedial and scientific experts, non-governmental organizations, and \ndiplomatic missions. I would like to take a moment to thank Secretary \nThompson and Secretary Powell for their personal commitment to this \nissue. I know that they are working together to bring the full force of \nthe Administration behind the efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, \nand malaria. Their support and input has been invaluable in helping us \nto draft legislation that builds upon and enhances our efforts to \ncombat infectious diseases worldwide.\n  Another essential component to broadening the U.S. mandate for \ninvolvement in international health initiatives is the creation of the \nPaul Coverdell Health Care Corps, a Corps based on the Peace Corps and \nrun through the Department of Health and Human Services. This Corps \nwould provide assistance for the placement of health care professionals \nwho wish to provide their services in developing countries dealing with \nthe crises of HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. This legislation \nprovides flexibility in the design of the program but ensures a wide \nvariety of volunteer opportunities--both short-term and long-term \nprojects, administered by the Ministries of Health, local communities, \nnon-governmental organizations, both faith-based and secular, or the \nUnited States government.\n  Where do we go from here?\n  First, public-private partnerships are extremely important and should \nbe encouraged to attack the pressing problems. This can take place \nthrough widespread support for the Global AIDS and Health Fund and by \nhastily enacting a vaccine development tax credit.\n  Furthermore, we should promote access to high-quality health care by \nengaging the American public health infrastructure in a collaborative \neffort to address an epidemic that has no regard for international \nboundaries.\n  We must enlist each stakeholder in the fight against HIV/AIDS. \nPolitical, ethnic, and religious leaders can coalesce support for \nprevention, care, and treatment programs as well as reduce stigmas \nattached to the disease--a crucial element to any prevention program.\n  Finally, we must not lose sight of the importance of prevention when \nattempting to provide treatment. Likewise, we must not let the \nimportance of treatment for those presently be forgotten in the rush to \nenhance awareness and prevention efforts.\n  As Americans, our challenge has always been to work with other \nnations to create a better, safer world through courage, persistence, \nand patience.\n  That is still our challenge today. And I have no doubt that, as a \nnation, and as a people, we will rise to it.\n  The bipartisan legislation we are introducing today is an important \nstep toward achieving these goals. I thank my cosponsors for their \nsupport. And, I look forward to working with all my colleagues to \nimprove our international efforts to fight deadly infectious diseases \nby passing the GLIDER Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself and Mr. Burns):\n  S. 1231. A bill to amend the Federal Power Act to establish a system \nfor market participants, regulators, and the public to have access to \ncertain information about the operation of electricity power markets \nand transmission systems; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, it is time to lift the veil of secrecy \naround energy markets in this country.\n  Now that electric power is being traded as a commodity, with \nelectricity bought and sold in markets all across the country, basic \ninformation about things like transmission capability and outages must \nbe made available to the public. This information is crucial both for \nthe markets to function efficiently and for the public to have \nconfidence in these markets. But, unlike other commodities, it is often \ndifficult to get basic information about how electric power systems and \nmarkets work. Information about the supply, demand and transmission of \nelectricity around the country is simply unavailable in many areas of \nthe country to State regulators and the general public.\n  The electric power industry has not made this information available, \nand without Congressional action, Americans will continue to be kept in \nthe dark about information they need to make informed choices and which \nwill enable energy markets to work in a fair way.\n  Today, along with Senator Burns, I am introducing the Electricity \nInformation, Disclosure, Efficiency, and Accountability Act to open up \naccess to operating information so that the markets can operate more \nefficiently, which can ultimately provide lower prices for consumers.\n  Our legislation will create a standard system to provide market \nparticipants,\n\n[[Page S8134]]\n\nregulators and the public with access to key operational information \nabout wholesale electric transmission systems and power markets. The \nbill requires operators of wholesale electric transmission and other \nbulk power systems to provide all system users with basic operating \ninformation, including all transmission line and generation facility \ndata used to determine capacity or restraints on a transmission line \nand the supply and demand for electricity. Power system operators \nalready have access to this information as part of their routine \noperation of bulk power systems. So there should be no additional \nburden on power generators to disclose information beyond what they are \nalready providing to their system operators.\n  In general, the bill would require operating information to be \nreleased on a real-time basis, updated hourly. This would ensure that \nmarket participants can keep current with changing conditions \nthroughout the day that impact market decisions. This release of real-\ntime data will also ensure there is a level playing field for all users \nof the transmission grid and prevent some users from gaining a \ncompetitive advantage by access to non-public information.\n  At the same time, the bill also creates a mechanism for keeping \ncommercially sensitive information confidential or delaying disclosure \nof information that could be used to manipulate markets. Our \nlegislation gives the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authority to \ndecide what data is considered commercially sensitive and either should \nnot be publicly disclosed or should only be disclosed when the data is \nno longer commercially sensitive.\n  In developing this legislation, we have worked with a broad range of \nstakeholders including market participants, regulators and consumer \ngroups. The supporters include Enron, the largest electric power \nmarketer in the U.S. today, the National Association of Regulatory \nUtility Commissioners, NARUC, and the Consumer Federation of America.\n  The bill we are introducing today will lift the veil of secrecy now \nshrouding the operations of electric power systems around the country. \nIt will improve access to critical information about how electric power \nsystems and markets work while fully protecting commercially sensitive \ndata. By improving access to information, market participants will be \nbetter informed when they make the thousands of decisions that must be \nmade every day about how electricity is generated to customers across \nthe country. Better access to information will enable regulators to \ntake appropriate steps to ensure our electric power systems are \nreliable and that markets are functioning properly. Ultimately, by \ncreating more efficient systems and markets, electricity customers \nthroughout the country will be better served.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Electricity Information, \nDisclosure, Efficiency, and Accountability Act.\n  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support written by NARUC and \nthe Consumer Federation of America be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n         National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2001.\n     Senator Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Wyden: Thank you for leadership in sponsoring \n     legislation to address the data access difficulties \n     confronting State Public Utility Commissions. Additionally, \n     the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners \n     (NARUC) would like to thank you for working with NARUC \n     members and staff to include in your draft legislation our \n     recommendations on the types of information necessary to \n     adequately monitor wholesale electricity markets and to \n     assure proper access to such information. NARUC supports the \n     draft legislation you are sponsoring regarding electricity \n     information disclosure.\n       Many regional electric markets throughout the country have \n     experienced price spikes of unusual and unexpected \n     proportions. These price spikes have led to curtailment or \n     shutdown of operations of some large industrial customers and \n     to increased prices for smaller commercial and residential \n     customers.\n       The high market price volatility has raised concerns about \n     the integrity of the markets, leading to calls from numerous \n     participants, consumers and policy makers for heightened \n     monitoring of these markets by regulatory bodies. In order to \n     identify corrective policy options to assure the public of \n     the competitiveness and efficiency of the developing \n     wholesale electricity market and its prices, regulatory \n     bodies need access to data such as production for generating \n     plants, transmission path schedules and actual flows.\n       The electric industry restructuring efforts of the federal \n     government and the various states are based upon an \n     assumption that wholesale markets are workably competitive. \n     To that end, policy makers must have the ability to provide \n     confidence to an already skeptical and uneasy public that the \n     market is not being ``gamed.'' This confidence can only be \n     provided if regulators are able to access the data necessary \n     to ensure that the market is functioning in a truly \n     competitive fashion. To the extent data is currently shared \n     among market participants for purposes of reliability, it \n     should also be available to regulators and the public.\n       In conclusion, I would like to thank you again for \n     considering NARUC's concerns and recommendations while you \n     drafted the ``Electricity Information, Disclosure, \n     Efficiency, and Accountability Act.'' NARUC would be pleased \n     to provide any additional assistance necessary to move this \n     legislation forward.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Charles D. Gray\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Consumer Federation of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2001.\n\n     Re Support for Wyden/Burns Electricity Information, \n         Disclosure, Efficiency and Accountability Act.\n\n     Hon. Ron Wyden,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Conrad Burns,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Wyden and Burns: The Consumer Federation of \n     America supports this legislation, which would require that \n     essential information about the functioning and reliability \n     of electricity markets be provided to the public, regulators \n     and market participants on a real-time basis. This would \n     include operating data used by wholesale system operators to \n     determine available electric capacity and bottlenecks and to \n     maintain reliability. Bid data would also have to be made \n     available, such as the price, amount and delivery location of \n     electricity that is purchased.\n       In a series of studies over the last three years, the \n     Consumer Federation of America has documented in detail how \n     the flawed deregulation of electricity in a number of states \n     has led to extensive price spikes and brown outs for \n     consumers and huge windfalls for many energy producers. Among \n     the many steps that should be taken to fix this highly \n     dysfunctional market is the creation of functioning market \n     institutions and greater transparency. Market institutions \n     should be developed before, not after, the trading of \n     electricity begins so that trading is transparent and \n     disciplined by market forces. Undeveloped information and \n     trading mechanisms are prone to manipulation. As we've seen \n     in California over the last year, when abuse occurs under \n     such circumstances, consumers are vulnerable to price gouging \n     and the provision of unreliable electricity.\n       Electricity markets have a multitude of complex \n     transactions. Unfortunately, good information about these \n     transactions is not generally available at crucial times, \n     such as periods of scarcity when wholesale electric prices \n     are being driven up very quickly. There is simply no \n     centralized, reliable source of information, particularly for \n     electric system operators. Moreover, the brokers who are the \n     sources of information--on bid prices, for instance--may well \n     have an interest in skewing it. Overall, a number of \n     information and management weaknesses exist, including \n     inadequate market forecasting tools, a lack of monitoring \n     instruments and little real-time information to respond to \n     market problems.\n       This legislation addresses the lack of timely information \n     that exists about the rates, terms and conditions under which \n     wholesale electricity is being offered. It is an essential \n     step in making this nation's defective electricity markets \n     more competitive and more pro-consumer.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Travis B. Plunkett,\n                                             Legislative Director.\n\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Wyden today \nwith the introduction of the Electricity Information, Disclosure, \nEfficiency, and Accountability Act.\n  Legislation dealing with market data for the wholesale electric power \nmarket is long overdue. The evolving wholesale electric power market is \nbeing hindered by the lack of data that power suppliers need in order \nto provide services to the market. Access to real time operational \ninformation leads to improved efficiencies of systems dispatch in the \nshort term, which\n\n[[Page S8135]]\n\nleads to lower prices for consumers. The absence of reliable, real \ntime, market data hinders the ability of energy suppliers to manage \nprice and volume risk and also prevents efficient utilization of \ntransmission and generation capacity. consequently, the increased costs \nassociated with risks inherent in operating without reliable data are \nultimately borne by consumers.\n  As our Nation moves towards consumer choice it is important that this \nCongress takes action to direct the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission (FERC) to craft rules designed to promote transparency in \nenergy markets. This bill that Senator Wyden and I have introduced will \ndo just that.\n  By incorporating a standard system that would provide market \nparticipants, regulators and the public access to certain operational \ninformation concerning power markets and the transmission systems that \nsupport them, this plan would keep participants abreast of the changing \npower operating conditions throughout the day that impact market \ndecisions required to manage risk. The recent fluctuations in the \nWestern energy markets have shown Montana and every State in the West \nthat we cannot shelter ourselves from the power operating conditions in \nother States. With more access to that information, our local and State \nsuppliers can have the information to better protect their consumers.\n  This bill is backed by consumer groups, power marketers, and the \nnational utility commissioners. It puts forward a framework that many \nof our colleagues can support. As the Senate continues to move closer \nto having movements on energy legislation, I would urge my colleagues \nto also support the Electricity Information, Disclosure, Efficiency, \nand Accountability Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL:\n  S. 1232. A bill to provide for the effective punishment of online \nchild molesters, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1232\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide penalties for certain unauthorized writing \nwith respect to consumer products; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Madam President, I rise today with Senators Hatch, Leahy, \nDeWine, and Durbin to introduce the Product Packaging Protection Act of \n2001. This measure will help prevent and punish a disturbing trend of \nproduct tampering, the placement of hate-filled literature into the \nboxes of cereal or food that millions of Americans bring home from the \ngrocery store every day.\n  Opening a box of macaroni and cheese should not be a harrowing \nexperience. But too many Americans have recently opened product boxes \nand found offensive, racist, anti-Semitic, pornographic and hateful \nleaflets. In the last few years, food manufacturers have received \nnumerous complaints from consumers who report finding such literature \ninserted in their groceries. Hundreds more incidents have likely gone \nunreported. Pizza and cereal boxes appear to be the most frequent \ntargets of this hate speech, but any product large enough for a vandal \nto insert an offensive leaflet is a potential target.\n  As disturbing as this conduct is, it is equally troubling that no \nFederal law exists. And only a couple of State laws are in place. The \nmeasure I introduce today will remedy this situation. It is supported \nby the manufacturers whose products are tampered with. It is necessary \nfor us to help the American consumer.\n  It will empower the government to investigate and punish these \nreprehensible acts. Let me give you one example of how these acts \nimpact unsuspecting Americans. This conduct can harm the youngest and \nmost impressionable among us.\n  Recently, one morning, eight year old Mario Alexander of Chestnut \nRidge, NJ decided to make himself breakfast one morning. In a kitchen \ncabinet, he found an unopened box of his favorite cereal, Oreo O's. So, \nhe grabbed the cereal, a bowl, a spoon, and milk from the refrigerator. \nHe then sat down at the kitchen table and opened the cereal box. In \naddition to the sealed bag of cereal inside, he also found a piece of \npaper. When he opened it, he discovered a graphic description of \nabortion. The leaflet also informed Mario that groups like the National \nOrganization of Women and the American Civil Liberties Union are \n``Natural Born Killers.'' Imagine his surprise and confusion when he \nfound that propaganda, not to mention the shock of his parents. No \nchild should be unknowingly exposed to that kind of material. Yet, it \nhappens regularly in kitchens across the country.\n  These are not isolated occurrences. In fact, Kraft Foods has \ndocumented over 80 incidents in the past four years alone, almost one \nevery two weeks. Of course, there is no way to calculate the number of \nincidents that go unreported. Many manufacturers and distributors share \nKraft's experience with this type of product tampering. Together, they \nrecognize the need for this legislation and have signed a letter \nsupporting the introduction and passage of this bill. The supporters of \nthis bill include: the American Bakers Association, the American Frozen \nFood Institute, Food Distributors International, General Mills, the \nGrocery Manufacturers of America, the Independent Bakers Association, \nKellogg's, Kraft Foods, the National Food Processors Association, and \nthe National Frozen Pizza Institute.\n  No child, indeed no person, should have to face this type of assault \nin the privacy of their homes. But children like Mario Alexander are \nnot the only victims of this kind of behavior. The companies that make \nthese products have their names and reputations slandered by this \nactivity.\n  Manufacturers have responded as best they can to these incidents. \nThey have undertaken internal reviews to ensure that these leaflets are \nnot getting into the products either at the manufacturing plant or \nduring distribution. It is not until the products reach the shelves of \nthe grocery store that these handbills are inserted, too late for the \nmanufacturer or the distributor to do anything about it.\n  Unfortunately, when consumers or companies turn to the authorities \nfor\n\n[[Page S8136]]\n\nhelp, they cannot be assisted. According to the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigations and the Food and Drug Administration's Office of \nCriminal Investigation, these actions are not covered by federal \nproduct tampering statutes. Those laws only cover the actual product \nthemselves, but not the packaging. In response to incidents in their \nrespective states, both New Jersey and California passed laws to \ncriminalize this behavior. These States should be commended, but more \nshould be done. Federal law needs to be amended accordingly.\n  The Product Packaging Protection Act of 2001 would prohibit the \nplacement of any writing or other material inside a consumer product \nwithout the permission of the manufacturer, authorized distributor, or \nretailer. An exception would be made where the manufacturer places \ninserts in the product solely for promotional purposes. The penalty for \nviolation of this measure would be a fine of up to $250,000 per offense \nand/or imprisonment of up to three years. Closing this gap in Federal \nlaw would appropriately punish people whose actions violate the \nintegrity of the food product, compromise consumer's faith in the food \nthey purchase in the grocery store, and damage the good name and \nreputation of the food manufacturer.\n  I look forward to its consideration and passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation \nbe printed in the Record following the completion of my remarks. I also \nask unanimous consent that copies of the remarks of cosponsoring \nSenators be printed immediately following my statement.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1233\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Product Packaging Protection \n     Act of 2001''.\n\n     SEC. 2. TAMPERING WITH CONSUMER PRODUCTS.\n\n       Section 1365 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (f) and (g) as subsections \n     (g) and (h), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after subsection (e) the following new \n     subsection (f):\n       ``(f)(1) Whoever, without the consent of the manufacturer, \n     retailer, or authorized distributor, intentionally tampers \n     with a consumer product that is sold in interstate or foreign \n     commerce by knowingly placing or inserting any writing in the \n     consumer product, or the container for the consumer product, \n     before the sale of the consumer product to any consumer shall \n     be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than three \n     years, or both.\n       ``(2) As used in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the term \n     `writing' means any form of representation or communication, \n     including handbills, notices, or advertising, that contain \n     letters, words, or pictorial representations.''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am proud to sponsor, along with my good \nfriend and esteemed colleague, Senator Kohl, the Product Packaging \nProtection Act of 2001. Other cosponsors include Senator DeWine and the \ndistinguished Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy.\n  This bipartisan legislation addresses a troubling development that \nhas been increasingly reported over the last several years--the \ndiscovery by consumers of unauthorized pamphlets placed inside the \npackaging of everyday consumer products, such as breakfast cereal and \nfrozen foods. In many cases, unsuspecting consumers, including young \nchildren, have found offensive messages inserted into the products they \nhave purchased, including pamphlets explicitly advocating violence \nagainst particular racial, ethnic, and religious groups.\n  While Federal law currently prohibits tampering with consumer \nproducts that taints the product, or renders the labeling materially \nfalse, the law does not currently prohibit someone placing writings in \nor on the product after the product has left the manufacturer's \ncontrol. The legislation being introduced today will close this \nloophole--providing the FBI and other Federal law enforcement agencies \nwith jurisdiction to investigate these incidents and bring the \nperpetrators to justice.\n  With all the recent focus on protecting our children from corrupting \ninfluences on the Internet, we should not ignore old-fashioned ``low \ntech'' avenues by which harmful and often hateful messages may be \ndisseminated. It is intolerable for the distributors of our foodstuffs \nand other consumer products to become the unwitting carriers of \noffensive harmful messages.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Kohl to ensure passage of this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am pleased to join Senator Kohl, and \nothers, on introducing the Product Packaging Protection Act of 2001.\n  Over the last few years, consumer complaints had been made about \noffensive material being inserted in various consumer products. These \noffensive materials range from neo-Nazi and anti-Semitic hate messages \nto pornographic images and disturbing anti-abortion images. \nUnfortunately, these materials have been found in consumer products \noften used by children, such as cereal boxes. Moreover, such activities \npose risks to the safety of consumer products, which consumers \nreasonably expect to obtain from the store in pristine condition and \nwithout those products having been opened by unauthorized individuals.\n  To address this problem, this legislation would add a new prohibition \nto the Federal Anti-Tampering Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec.  1365, to prohibit a \nperson from intentionally tampering with a consumer product, without \nthe consent of the manufacturer, retailer, or authorized distributor by \ninserting a writing in the consumer product or its container prior to \nits sale to a consumer. A person convicted of violating this new \nprovision would be subject to a fine or up to two years' imprisonment. \nThe term ``tamper'' is defined to mean meddling for the purpose of \naltering, damaging or misusing a product. See Webster's Dictionary. The \nbill describes in precise terms the tampering activity that would fall \nwithin the new criminal prohibition, and is intended to extend further \nprotection to consumer products.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/24/senate-section/article/S8136-1", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8136-S8137]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1040.

Madam President, earlier today I indicated that we had \nhoped we could continue to make progress on the Transportation \nappropriations bill, with some expectation of completing our work in \nthe next day or so. That effort has not been as successful as I had \nhoped we could make it. For the last several hours, as our colleagues \nknow, we have been attempting to negotiate language on the Mexican \ntrucking issue. Our Republican colleagues are in many cases opposed to \nthe language that is currently in the bill. It remains a very \ncontentious issue.\n  I also suggested this afternoon that this is a matter that will \ncontinue to be the subject of ongoing negotiations and that I would be \nfiling cloture tonight. The minority leader has indicated that we would \nnot be required to file cloture tonight, even though I want to have the \nvote on cloture on Thursday. So we will ask unanimous consent that when \nwe file cloture tomorrow, if it is required, that the vote still occur \non Thursday. It is my understanding that we are now in a position to \nagree to that unanimous consent request.\n  I will not be filing cloture tonight. My hope is that tonight the \nnegotiations can continue and that tomorrow we will have additional \nopportunities to see if we can find some way to resolve the matter.\n  I ask unanimous consent that should I file cloture on the Murray \nsubstitute and the bill tomorrow, the cloture vote occur on Thursday, \nas provided under rule XXII, with the mandatory quorum being waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Boxer). Is there objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I remind Senators, if cloture is filed, \nall first-degree amendments must be filed by 1 p.m. on Thursday. I \nwould like to announce as well that the negotiations throughout the day \nwill necessitate that Senators who may have amendments that may fall \nunder cloture offer them in the morning.\n  As I understand it, Senator Murray has been working with a number of \nour colleagues. They are planning to offer amendments tomorrow morning. \nThere will be a number of amendments offered with rollcalls to \naccompany the debate. We expect rollcall votes tomorrow morning.\n  It is also my expectation, if those negotiations are ongoing, that we \nwould take advantage of the time available to us.\n  I have been discussing with Senator Lott the possibility of taking up \nthe Iran Sanctions Act under a time limit that would be offered \ntomorrow sometime during the day. We anticipate spending a relatively \nshort period of time thereon. I don't want to spend the entire day \ndebating the issue, but it is a matter that has to be resolved prior to \nthe time we leave recess as well. I would hope that we could take it \nup.\n  I understand there may be one amendment that we may want to consider. \nBut that also is an issue that will be addressed tomorrow, if we cannot \nresolve the Mexican trucking matter in an expeditious manner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/07/24/senate-section/article/S8141-2", "month": "07", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, the other matter I would like to \nconsider as well is the matter involving further consideration of \nnominations. There are a couple of nominations that we can turn to \ntomorrow that will involve some time.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, as in executive session, \nthat the majority leader, after consultation with the Republican \nleader, may turn to the consideration of Wade Horn to be Assistant \nSecretary for Family Support at the Department of Health and Human \nServices and that he be considered under the following time limitation: \n2 hours under the control of Senator Wellstone; 60 minutes under the \ncontrol of Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley; that when all time is \nused or yielded back, the Senate vote on the confirmation of the \nnomination, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's actions.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that upon the disposition of the Horn \nnomination, the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. \n252, the nomination of Hector Barreto to be Administrator of the Small \nBusiness Administration and that there be 30 minutes for debate on the \nnomination equally divided between Senators Kerry and Bond, or their \ndesignees, and that upon the use or yielding back of that time, the \nSenate vote on confirmation of the nomination; the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table; the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action; that any statements on either of these two nominations \nbe printed in the Record at the appropriate place, and the Senate \nreturn to legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will be votes \non those amendments.\n  We will anticipate that ongoing negotiations will bring us to some \nconclusion about the need to file cloture tomorrow. If cloture is \nfiled, the cloture vote will then occur on Thursday. If there is time \nto be allotted to other issues, the other issues will include the Iran \nSanctions Act as well as the two nominations, Horn and Barreto.\n  We will have a number of rollcall votes tomorrow.
