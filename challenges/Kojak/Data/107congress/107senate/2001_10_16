Madam President, today is the fifth anniversary--that is, \nweekly anniversary--of the attacks our Nation sustained on September \n11. These attacks fundamentally changed the legislative priorities of \nthe 107th Congress. The sense of urgency which fell upon the Congress \nhas required all of us--every Senator, all the leadership, committee \nchairmen--to reorder their priorities to deal with the new war-related \ndemands. The necessary sacrifices have been for a greater cause.\n  In addition to the war-related measures we had to undertake, the \nadministration, of course, is expecting us to pass all the annual \nspending bills necessary to keep the Government operating. Regrettably, \nin the past several weeks there has been a concerted effort\n\n[[Page S10746]]\n\nby some to prevent us from considering these measures. In fact, there \nare no basic policy differences or disagreements in these measures. \nThey are driven by a desire to increase the number of judicial \nnominations.\n  Let me say in response, the statement made yesterday by a number of \npeople on the other side that the majority leader and I, when we were \nin the minority, held up legislation because of judges is simply not \ntrue. We made statements. The only time there was ever an effort, as I \nrecall--and they talked about it yesterday--was an authorization bill, \nnot an appropriations bill. In fact, we worked very hard to move \nappropriations bills. We were in the minority, but we worked very hard \nto have our Members take off holds on bills so we could move the \nappropriations bills through the process.\n  We did a good job. We worked with them to pass virtually every \nappropriations bill. Senator Daschle did nothing to hold up \nappropriations bills. In fact, he worked very hard to pass them. One of \nthe assignments I had from Senator Daschle was to get rid of amendments \non appropriations bills. I worked hard to do that.\n\n  Now, in an effort to get judicial confirmations, appropriations bills \nare being held up. I had someone tell me yesterday: We could whip right \nthrough these. When the time comes to complete these bills, we will do \nthem quickly.\n  We can't do appropriations bills quickly. It is the nature of these \nbills that they are hard. Foreign operations is always a contentious \nbill. Labor-HHS is a contentious bill. Defense appropriations is a \ncontentious bill. D.C. appropriations is difficult legislation. We are \nnot going to be able to whip through these bills. The time we have \ntaken in these last several days waiting on motions to proceed, using \nup 30 hours, is time we could have spent on appropriations.\n  Senator Murkowski said he will come in every day and talk about ANWR \nand the need for an energy policy. More power to him. There is a lot of \ntime to come and talk because we are not doing anything that is \nconstructive in nature. If he wants us to move to an energy bill, then \nhe should talk to the people on his side of the aisle so that we can \ncomplete these appropriations bills.\n  I think the President should be concerned about what is taking place. \nWe have bent over backwards to be fair to the President. We are going \nto continue to be fair to the President. We are going to continue to \nmove judicial nominations as quickly as we can. There is a hearing set \nthis week where we are going to move five. Senator Leahy is going to \nhave hearings next week, even though when the majority was on the other \nside of the aisle, they never held confirmation hearings 2 weeks in a \nrow. We are going to do that because we are not going to treat them the \nway they treated us. We are going to move these nominations as quickly \nas we can.\n  They believe it is a greater priority to move some judges than it is \nto do other matters now before the Senate; namely, appropriations \nbills.\n  These tactics are not simply dilatory; they are obstructionist. They \ndemonstrated last week that they were even willing to hold up an \naviation security bill. We worked our way through that timewise, but it \ntook a lot of extra time.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak \nfor an additional 5 minutes and the Republicans have 5 additional \nminutes after the morning hour has terminated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I am wondering if we are going to be prevented from \nconsidering the Defense appropriations bill. I assume so. Are we going \nto be prevented from considering a Labor-HHS bill to provide funding to \ndeal with, for example, bioterrorism threats? I assume so. The question \nconfronting the minority is whether these tactics are worth \nconfirmation of a few additional judges. I assume that is a decision \nthey have made.\n  People of Nevada are concerned about what we are doing to fight the \nwar. They are not concerned about judges. We are going to do everything \nwe can to take care of these judges. Senator Leahy has worked extremely \nhard. He will continue to do so. We are going to do all the judges we \ncan.\n  I am concerned. When you recognize there are no major disagreements \non the spending bills, we have worked with the President to get the \nnumbers up where we can move them out of conference. On my bill, energy \nand water, we will have a meeting at 3 o'clock today. That will \nbasically be wrapped up. I am wondering if they are going to allow us \nto do the conference reports on the appropriations bills we have \ncompleted. I have been told no.\n  These bills are important. The appropriators, the administration, and \nthe budgeteers are all in agreement on the remaining bills. Holding \nthem up hurts the country. It is not hurting the Democratic Senators; \nit is hurting the country.\n  I am sure if we asked the Attorney General whether he wanted the bill \nfunding his ability to maintain and enlarge his efforts to combat \nterrorism, he would choose that over some more judges. We could ask \nSecretary Powell whether he would want funding to improve our embassy \nsecurity and the many other things the foreign operations bill \naddresses. Secretary Powell is now in Pakistan. I will bet there hasn't \nbeen a single word spoken between Secretary Powell and President \nMusharraf about how many judges we are confirming. I bet there are a \nlot of questions on what we are going to do to aid India and Pakistan \nwith the problems they have.\n  Would Secretary Thompson prefer a commitment for faster consideration \nof nominees over funding to allow him to better respond to the growing \nnumber of anthrax cases? That answer is obvious. The administration \nrightfully expects us to pass annual appropriations bills. The efforts \nby the minority to block consideration of these and other important \nmeasures are not only self-serving, they are self-defeating.\n  We hear daily demands for consideration of an energy bill. We should \nhave an energy bill. I don't know how in the world we are going to have \nthe time. We have lost 2 weeks of doing anything by their holding \nthings up because of judges. We cannot consider energy until the other \nmeasures are disposed of, and we can't dispose of those because the \nminority won't allow us.\n  So it seems to me that we should be for this legislation. The fact \nthat we are not moving forward with it is an answer to a question that \nhas already been asked. We have a limited amount of time. We have a \nnumber of pieces of legislation that we must complete, and we are not \ngoing to be able to do them. We can only do so much. The committee can \nonly do so much. We can get into all the numbers that we want. We \nbelieve we are treating them much better than we were treated.\n  As I said yesterday, at the time we took control of the Senate, half \nof the first year was gone. Not a single confirmation hearing was held \nand not a single confirmation was considered by the majority at that \ntime. We have done much better. We are going to continue to do \neverything we can to move these judges.\n  I am a lawyer. I believe judges are important. I am going to do \neverything I can to move the nominations along. We can't do it with \nthis hammer to our head. We are doing the best we can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, what is our status?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business, and 9\\1/2\\ \nminutes are remaining under the Senator's control.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/16/senate-section/article/S10746-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10746-S10747]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WORK THE SENATE CAN ACCOMPLISH\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, on the issue we have before us, \nobviously, we have many things to do. We have met this morning and we \nhave been working on an economic stimulus package, which is very \nnecessary and important. We also need to do the ordinary work that is \nalways before the Congress--the appropriations.\n  I continue to hear all the time from the other side of the aisle that \nwe just can't do all these things; we have too much and we can't do \nthese things at the same time. It doesn't mean you have to give up \nworking on the floor on issues such as appropriations. You can go ahead \nin a committee and do some things with the judiciary and get some of \nthose things out here.\n  In my State, we happen to have four appointees, all of whom were \nnominated prior to the August recess. None\n\n[[Page S10747]]\n\nof them has even had hearings. That is a problem with the committee, \nnot a problem on the floor. It is a problem with moving forward. As we \nmove into this matter of internal terrorism, and so on, the U.S. \nattorneys are going to be very important, as are U.S. marshals. Do we \nhave them? No. There is no reason we don't have to do one or the other. \nWe can do both of them.\n  Frankly, the constant talk that we hear that we didn't do as many \nwhen you were in the majority is immaterial, whether that is right or \nwrong. The fact is, here is where we are, and we have 50-some judges \nwaiting to be approved, with very few in. In the Tenth Circuit, we have \n4 vacancies out of 12. There is no movement to do anything about that.\n\n  So I guess what I am saying is I feel badly about it as well. I would \nlike to be moving forward, but they are not happening. We don't get any \nassurance from the chairman of the committee that he is going to do \nanything any differently. All they do is talk about what they did in \nthe past. That is immaterial. What we ought to talk about is what we \nare faced with now and the fact that we need to do something about \nthat.\n  Energy is something that is very important, of course. We have asked \nfor a commitment to do something on energy. We have been working at it. \nI am on the Energy Committee. We have worked at it for a couple of \nyears, getting things together, trying to get something on the floor. \nIt is very important in terms of the United States and its economy. It \nhas been very important in terms of us getting an energy policy out \nthere. I know the Senator from Nevada agrees with that.\n  Now it is even more important when we get to where we have nearly 60 \npercent of our oil imported, much of it from the Middle East. We find \nourselves with real difficulties in the Middle East, and it is even \nmore important that we get it in there and have an energy policy. All \nwe have asked for is a commitment to do that, to move forward. That is \nthe reason things are not moving. We get no commitment as to changing \nthe things that are not being done. I think that is where we are. It is \ntoo bad we are in a kind of controversy about it. I think getting a \ncommitment from the leadership that we are going to be able to \naccomplish some of these pending things is very important.\n  Saying the priority is doing something for Pakistan instead of a \njudge, that is really not a choice. We can do both of those things. We \ncan do both of those things, and we can move forward. I wonder how many \nhearings there have been this week on judges. More important, what has \nbeen brought to the floor?\n  I believe we can find a remedy, and I know there are meetings going \non to secure that remedy. I certainly hope we can continue to find that \nremedy and get ourselves into a position to move forward not only with \nthe pending legislation, but also do these things that are very \nimportant to the operation of Government.\n  Of course, now we find ourselves with more and more difficulties in \nterms of internal terrorism and the anthrax issue that is coming up. \nBut I can tell you it is the belief among the Members of Congress that \nwe are going to take every method of making sure we are safe and that \nour staffs are safe. On the other hand, we can do those things that are \nnecessary and we can go forward with the job we have to do. I suspect \nwe are here to complete our task.\n  I have suggested in the past that maybe we can set some priorities \nand have our priorities established, move forward with them and deal \nwith those things that are not being done and say, yes, we are going to \ndo it at a certain time. That is really the request. It is not going to \ntake long to do some of these things. We need commitments and \npriorities and to be prepared to move forward. But as long as the \nissues that some of the Members are very anxious about are not dealt \nwith, obviously there are going to be some efforts to make sure they \nare. That is not a unique situation, by the way. That has happened \nthroughout the years, and it is part of the process here, \nunfortunately. But it is part of the process.\n  I mentioned yesterday the very process we are going through now was \ngone through last year, and all the evidence is in the Congressional \nRecord. The very issues we objected to now were done then.\n  So I think we can find a solution. I look forward to seeing that \nsolution so that we can commit ourselves to do the things that need to \nbe done, to move forward with the other bills. We can do more than one \nthing at a time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will now \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 2506, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A motion to proceed to the bill (H.R. 2506) making \n     appropriations for foreign operations, export financing, and \n     related programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2002, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I am not going to speak at great length \nabout why we are in the position we are. I have already spoken. As I \nhave said, Senator Leahy has a hearing scheduled this week. He is going \nto have some hearings next week. The report I received recently is that \nwe have not done any U.S. marshals because we do not have them. They \nhave not been sent to the committee. We cannot do it.\n  We approved 14 U.S. attorneys last Thursday. We are moving these \nnominations along just as quickly as we can.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is absolutely right we need to do; an energy \nbill, but we cannot do an energy bill. We have had 2 weeks where we \nhave done nothing. We still have five appropriations bills to handle, \nplus all the conferences, and they are not letting us move to them.\n  Sure, we can do two things on the floor at once; we agree. But they \nare not letting us do one thing on the floor. The leader has said that \nwe will get to energy as soon as we can, and that means we have to get \nrid of all these other items first.\n  We are approaching Thanksgiving. We have already had two continuing \nresolutions. This is not the time to dillydally. We have very important \nthings we need to do for this country, and we are in quicksand on \njudges. We are going to go forward the best we can and jump through all \nthe procedural hoops they are making us jump through. I would think \nsometime in the near future the administration might get involved. The \nadministration has more to lose than anyone else. This is the \nminority's side.\n  No one can criticize the Democratic majority in working with the \nPresident. We have worked hand in hand with him. He and the majority \nleader speak three times a day on issues relating to this country and \nthe world. The minority is making a real mistake holding up this \nlegislation. That is a decision they have made, and they are going to \nhave to live with it. We are going to do the best we can, I repeat, \njumping through all these hurdles.\n  In the process, we are going to use up 3 or 4 weeks of time that we \ncould be doing other bills. We have a bioterrorism bill on which \nSenators Kennedy and Frist have worked. I do not know if they will let \nus go to it when the committee reports it out. We hope the committee \ncan report it out as early as Thursday. In the meantime, all the other \nlegislation is being held up.\n  People think we can waltz through the rest of these appropriations \nbills in a matter of a day or two. It has never happened, and it never \nwill happen. These bills take a lot of time even though we agree on the \nnumbers.\n  We need to do a bioterrorism bill. We have a bipartisan bill we \nshould bring\n\n[[Page S10748]]\n\nup. We had airline safety. They would not let us bring that up.\n  I repeat, when it comes down to the end of this year and people are \nsaying where is the energy bill and other bills, remember last week and \nthis week: We have done nothing. Most of it has been procedural in \nnature.\n  We were fortunate last week to finally, getting through all the \nprocedural hoops, get airline security passed, and with a lot of \ncooperation we were able to do the counterterrorism legislation, but it \nhas been a struggle. We should be further through the appropriations \nprocess more than we are.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Economic Stimulus\n\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, one of the items, of course, that is \nbeing considered and has, in fact, been considered and passed in the \nHouse is the economic stimulus--doing some things now that will \nencourage and get more activity in our economy.\n  We, of course, through the last couple of years have seen some \ndecline in the economy, and now with the September 11 attacks, we have \nseen substantial change. We are faced with the challenge to do that \nwhich will have an impact--hopefully an immediate impact--on the \neconomy.\n  It has been very difficult to define exactly what is best to do. We \nhave met several times with Chairman Greenspan and Bob Rubin, the \nformer Secretary of the Treasury, to talk about what would have the \nmost impact on the economy in the short term. There are very many ideas \nout there.\n  Quite frankly, among professional economists there is not unanimity \nas to what would have the most impact. Certainly, most people agree \nthat it needs to be a large movement. Some think it ought to be $100 \nbillion, which is a huge amount--however, a relatively small amount of \nthe gross national product. It is difficult to know.\n  This Congress has already passed $50 billion or more that has to do \nwith defense and with repair in New York City. I question, of course, \nwhether those expenditures will be made soon enough to have an impact \non the economy and whether they, indeed, fit in as part of the economic \npackage. I, frankly, am inclined to think they do.\n  Then we are faced with what should be the additional effort. It is my \nunderstanding the House-passed bill was nearly $100 billion in addition \nto what we spent, which is more than the President has suggested, I \nbelieve, which is $50 billion to $75 billion. We have that decision to \nmake and, of course, what will most quickly and efficiently affect the \neconomy. I believe we should have some parameters to decide in general \nwhat we want to do and then see how these individual items fit into it. \nOne ought to be those things that we know will have an impact on the \neconomy and do it in the short run.\n  Another is, since we are talking about shortrun remedies, we ought to \nbe picking solutions that are not long term so we will have another \nopportunity after this economy has gathered some strength to take a \nlook at them and see if they should be in place long term.\n  Obviously, when Members have tax issues and have been looking for a \nvehicle to put them on, they will be interested in putting them on a \nstimulus bill. We have to be careful this does not become a Christmas \ntree.\n  What do we do? There is the question of how much of this stimulus \nought to be done in terms of the consumers' ability to purchase. What \ncan we do about moving more money into the hands of consumers so they \ncan do a redistribution of income?\n\n  On the other hand, how much of this package should be in the form of \nincentives for business, such as deferred taxes, or reducing the time \nfor appreciation?\n  These are the issues we will have to decide. Many are interested in \ndoing something with the corporate alternative minimum tax put in about \n1985 as a reaction to some of the tax reductions that were made prior \nto that time, which have the effect, of course, of causing certain \nlevels of income tax to have to be paid, regardless of whether there \nare tax breaks that can be taken advantage of otherwise.\n  So very many people in the business sector believe that could be \nchanged. It would encourage the purchase of new equipment.\n  Some suggest a 5-year carryback of net operating expenses as another \nway to put money in the hands of business to create jobs and move \nforward. Accelerated appreciation is another area discussed. The House \nprovision has a 30-percent reduction in the first year--again, to \nencourage businesses to invest in their equipment and in their \ninventory.\n  There are issues on foreign trade to make it more competitive for \nbusinesses. For individuals, there is talk about making tax reductions \nwe put into place earlier this year more permanent, to not expire at a \ncertain length of time. That has to be discussed. Capital gains \nreductions are quite often talked about. Some wonder if capital gains \nreductions will, again, have that short-term impact. Others have \nsuggested the capital gains ought to be limited only to those purchases \nafter September 11 to encourage purchases rather than sales. Any \npayroll tax deduction will provide an opportunity to put money into the \nhands of citizens, including those who are not paying income tax.\n  There are recommended vacation tax credits to get people on the move: \nTo fly, to stay in hotels. The industry is suffering a good deal.\n  There are lots of opportunities. I am hopeful as we draw it up in the \nFinance Committee we have parameters to make sure they comply with our \ngoals and our purpose and our motives. I think we can do that. It ought \nto be confined to short-term activities so we can review them again in \nthe future. These are some of the things being discussed. They are very \nimportant.\n  Now we find ourselves faced with three different challenges: One is \nthe war on terrorism; another is the economy, which has been impacted; \nand doing the things we do in everyday life and continue to deal with \ngovernment operations. These are the challenges. I believe we will meet \nthe challenges. We need to move forward.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Would the Chair explain the parliamentary matter now before \nthe Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is now considering the motion to \nproceed to H.R. 2506.\n  Mr. REID. Potentially, if I am not mistaken, there is as much as 30 \nhours available under that motion to proceed; is that right, \npostcloture?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not on a postcloture situation. There \nis no time limit.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Chair, cloture was not invoked yesterday, so \nwe are not bound by the 30 hours; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Unless something happens, we are on this bill forever; is \nthat right? There is no time limit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are on the motion to proceed.\n  Mr. REID. There is no time limit?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Is it possible to move to some other matter?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Not while the motion is pending.\n  Mr. REID. Only by unanimous consent, is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is right.\n  Mr. REID. Unless the minority agrees to move to an appropriations \nbill or move to this appropriations bill or move to bioterrorism, it \ncannot be\n\n[[Page S10749]]\n\ndone without their consent; is that right?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I say to my colleague from Nevada, as he \nknows, we had a cloture vote on this appropriations bill, and we did \nnot invoke cloture. We have what is known as a filibuster--not on an \nappropriations bill but even on the motion to proceed to the \nappropriations bill.\n  There is a time and a place for everything. I certainly would never \nabridge the right of any Member of the Senate to use the rules in any \nmanner they prescribe for themselves or their constituents. It is in my \njudgment rather unseemly at this moment, given what is happening in \nthis country, for this Senate effectively to be at parade rest--\nstanding, sitting, waiting, doing nothing. We have appropriations bills \nthat need to come to the floor of the Senate. They have been through \nthe Appropriations Committee, but we cannot get them to the floor of \nthe Senate because we have people objecting.\n  The other side says they don't want the Senate to do its business at \nthis point, so they object. This appropriations bill is foreign \noperations. It is a critically important piece of legislation dealing \nwith issues such as the security of our Embassies. Does anyone wonder \nat this moment and at this time, given the security threats we face at \nvirtually every Embassy around the world, staffed by American citizens, \nwhether we ought to wait to pass legislation dealing with Embassy \nsecurity? I don't think there is not great cause for me to wonder. Of \ncourse we should. We ought to move this appropriations bill to the \nfloor of the Senate, debate it, and pass it.\n  Let me go back for a moment to describe why I believe this should not \nbe business as usual and why I believe it is unseemly for some simply \nto plant themselves at this moment and say: We are not going to allow \nthe Senate to do anything. September 11 changed a lot of things in our \nlives. The heinous act of mass murder by perverted people changed a lot \nin the lives of all of us. This attack against our country, but \nbasically an attack against freedom, makes everyone feel less secure. \nWe have resolved from that moment to do things differently.\n  One of the things that happened almost immediately following the \nPresident's speech to a joint session of Congress was a new attitude \nand a new spirit in the Congress. All of a sudden, those who previously \nhad been Democrats and Republicans, conservatives and liberals, were \nstanding during debate, proclaiming themselves so described, all of a \nsudden those labels were gone. There did not seem to be any longer an \n``our'' side and a ``your'' side or a ``your'' side and ``my'' side. \nThere was only in this Chamber, and only in the House of \nRepresentatives, and only between us and the President, one side. It \nwas our side. Just our side. We were all in on the same side, \ndetermined to try to deal with these cowardly acts of terrorism.\n  That, regrettably, has changed some. There is now a different \nattitude in recent days. Folks decided we shouldn't work together, that \nwe shouldn't do the Senate's business, that we shouldn't pass \nappropriations bills, that we should essentially stall and stop. It \ndoesn't make any sense to me. It doesn't serve anybody's interests. It \ndoesn't serve the interests of the United States, and it certainly \ndoesn't serve the interests of the American people.\n  I mentioned this appropriations bill has money for the security of \nour embassies all around the world. Is what we really want to do at \nthis moment to slow down this process, to say embassy security somehow \nis not very important, that there is no urgency here? I don't think so.\n  I think our job ought to be to say these are important issues for the \nSenate to address--not tomorrow, not next week, but now. It is not just \nthis bill. It is especially this bill today because that is what we are \ntalking about, the motion to proceed to this bill, but it is so many \nother appropriations bills and so much additional work that we and the \nHouse must do together.\n  Aviation security, we did that bill. Antiterrorism, we did that bill. \nNeither has been done in a satisfactory way by the other body. So we \nneed to resolve those differences, and that is critically important.\n  But most especially the business of the Senate is to take up \nimportant issues, including this bill from the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Foreign Operations, debate it, and pass it. If someone \nhere has heartaches about what is in it, offer amendments and have \nvotes. God bless you; you have every opportunity in the Senate to do \nthat. The rules allow you to do that. But it is not appropriate, in my \njudgment, to shut this place down because someone got cranky about \nsomething else. If you are in a bad mood, find another room, but at \nleast here on the floor of the Senate let's try to do the Senate's \nbusiness.\n  If there was ever an opportunity and requirement to demonstrate to \nthe American people this is a new time and new day and we are facing \nthreats in a new way together, this is the time to do it. Let's adopt \nthese motions to proceed, pass these bills, and provide for the \nsecurity of American embassies included in this bill.\n  Madam President, Senator Daschle, the majority leader, is present. I \nwill yield the floor and allow him to proceed.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I compliment the Senator from North \nDakota for his excellent statement. I don't think I could have said it \nas well. But I really appreciate the passion with which he has \nexpressed himself.\n  These are important bills. We are going through international crises \nthat demand leadership, demand responsiveness, demand that these bills \nget done. He said it so well. I hope our colleagues have the \nopportunity to hear him as I just did.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I would like to share a few thoughts \nwith regard to the process of nominating and confirming Federal judges. \nWe have had a problem, as I have seen it, in recent months, leaving us \nwith an ever-growing backlog, one of the largest backlogs of judicial \nvacancies we have ever had. I would like to share a few thoughts about \nthat.\n  One of the bases for rationalizing this apparent slowdown is the view \nthat President Clinton's judges were not treated fairly. Many of you \nhave heard that. I think we ought to talk about that straight up.\n  President Clinton nominated and got confirmed 377 Federal judges, \nalmost exactly the number President Reagan had in his 8 years in \noffice. They both had 8 years in office. He had one of his nominees, \nonly one, who was voted down by this Senate. The rest we either \nconfirmed or were pending when he left office.\n  When President Clinton left office, he had 41 nominees pending before \nthis Senate, nominees who had not been acted upon. Historically, that \nis a low number. Under the leadership of Chairman Orrin Hatch, the \nSenator from Utah, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee at that \ntime, a Republican, he moved President Clinton's nominees effectively \nand gave them fair hearings, and for the most part they were promptly \nconfirmed if they were deserving. That 41 nominees were unconfirmed is \na rather low number, in my view. Really, 67 vacancies were in existence \nat that time in the Federal judiciary. We have over 800 Federal judges, \nand 60-some judges has generally been considered a normal vacancy rate. \nIt just about takes that much time for the names to go up to the \nPresident, for him to consider them, an FBI background check to be \ndone, to submit the nominee's name, they answer all the questionnaires \nwe demand of them, ABA does a background check--and it just takes some \ntime. So you seldom will be below 50 vacancies in the Federal \njudiciary.\n  However, we begin to see the numbers increase dramatically. Just a \nfew days ago we had 110 vacancies in the Federal judiciary. Now I think \nit is 108 after the confirmation of the 2.\n  To me, this is too large a vacancy. Let me tell you why I am \nconcerned about it. I will be frank with you about it. The reason I am \nconcerned is that there is a sense in which this slowdown in \nconfirmations is a part of a plan to block President Bush's nominees in \nan unusual and special way. Unlike anything we have seen before.\n  There was a report in the New York Times on April 30 of this year \nreporting\n\n[[Page S10750]]\n\nabout the private retreat the Democratic Members of this body had. The \nRepublicans have those retreats, too. At that retreat, Professor \nLaurence Tribe, who is well known, Cass Sunstein, and Marcia \nGreenberger discussed with the Democratic Senators their idea to \ndevelop a ``unified party strategy to combat the White House on \njudicial nominees.'' That was the New York Times reporting on that \nconference.\n  Professor Tribe and the others apparently advocated scrutinizing \nnominees more closely than ever in order to slow down the nomination \nprocess, stating that it was:\n\n       . . . important for the Senate to change the ground rules \n     and there was no obligation to confirm someone just because \n     they are scholarly and erudite.\n\n  This is the same Laurence Tribe who was very active in the Bork \nnomination and Thomas nomination fight and actually wrote a book in \n1985 titled ``God Save This Honorable Court'' in which he talked about \nthe strategy of blocking judicial nominations.\n  Before we had gotten started in this process, those of us on this \nside had cause for concern because there was a stated policy of \nchanging the ground rules or to block President Bush's constitutional \nability to have his nominees treated fairly and confirmed, if fit and \nqualified.\n  Subsequent to that, we began to have a number of hearings in the \ncourts subcommittee, of which I am the ranking Republican member. The \nfirst hearing dealt with a suggested change in how we ought to do \nnominations. The change and question was whether or not ideology should \nbe considered in the judicial process. That has been generally rejected \nconsistently.\n  Invited to testify on that panel were Cass Sunstein, Laurence Tribe, \nand Marcia Greenberger--surprise, surprise. Also invited to testify was \nLloyd Cutler, former White House counsel to a Democratic President, and \na man of great respect in the community.\n  In his remarks, he differed with those other professors, however, and \nmade clear that he opposed--and quoted a commission of which he was a \nmember--making politics and ideology a factor in the confirmation \nprocess.\n  If someone has an obsessive political or personal or ideological view \nthat would keep them from being objective in analyzing facts and law, \nthey ought not to be confirmed. But just to say that you are a liberal \nDemocrat--as overwhelmingly the 377 judges confirmed by President \nClinton were--that you are, therefore, not qualified, or if you are a \nconservative Republican you are not qualified to serve on the bench \nwould be a historic change in the ground rules all right--not a change \nthey suggested ought to be done before President Bush took office but a \nchange they suggest only after their President left office. We have a \nnew President. So we are concerned about this.\n  The first hearing was suggesting that we ought to have a higher role \nof politics in the judiciary. Lloyd Cutler, to his credit, and other \nprofessors who were members of that panel, also to their credit, were \nfirmly opposed to politicizing the judiciary. It is a dangerous thing.\n  I was a U.S. attorney for 12 years and assistant U.S. attorney for 2. \nAlmost 15 years of my life was spent practicing law and trying cases \nfull time before Federal judges. I didn't always agree with them, but I \nwill say with great conviction that they were wonderful judges--men and \nwomen of integrity and ability who did things right. If you had the law \non your side, you could be expected to prevail. If you went to court \nand said: I have cases that say this evidence is admissible, Your \nHonor; I have evidence that says their document is not required to be \nproduced in this hearing, Your Honor, and if you could show the judge \nthat, you could almost always count on them to rule correctly according \nto the law, whether they were Republicans or Democrats.\n  This idea that somehow, if you are a liberal or a conservative, you \nare therefore going to allow that to affect your ability to control a \ncourtroom and do justice to people is wrong and dangerous. And I am \nnervous that we would suggest to the American people that this is so. I \ndo not believe it is.\n  At one of our hearings recently, when I asked Senator Fred Thompson \nfrom Tennessee, a skilled lawyer, if he believed in his experience as a \nlitigator that he could expect unfairness or a difference of views on \nissues simply because of who appointed the judge to the bench, he said \nhe did not. His experience as a judge was normally expected to rule \ncorrectly on the law and the facts. Certainly that has been my \nexperience over the years.\n  Actually, I would add parenthetically that is one of the great \nreasons for our strength and health and economic prosperity as a \nnation. We have a rule of law. Whether you are a British corporation or \na corporation from any nation in the world or a domestic corporation or \nan individual or a poor person or a rich person, we believe in the \nideal and in the reality that person would receive equal justice under \nlaw. Indeed, those are the words chiseled and engraved into the front \nof the Supreme Court building across the street--``Equal Justice Under \nLaw.'' That is the American-British--Anglo-American--legal ideal that \nwe have adhered to effectively. Nations where that rule of law has been \ncommonplace and followed have prospered. I have come to believe in \nrecent years as I have gotten older that if you examine nations that \nare not doing well economically, that do not have freedom and the \nthings we have, it is fundamentally because they lack a rule of law. \nYou can't invest, you can't plan, and you can't develop a long-term \ngoal for the future and save money today in order to expand your \nbusiness tomorrow if everything is unstable, and if you have to pay off \npoliticians and never know what the law is going to be.\n  We are blessed with a rich heritage of law that is so valuable that \nwe should never see it undermined. We must protect it. The last line of \nthe great hymn is our liberty and respect of the law. The American \npeople respect law. We must do that. We must further that, and not \ncreate this image by a bunch of politicians in a committee room \nsuggesting that what goes on in courtrooms throughout America is \npolitical and not based on law and fact. That would undermine public \nrespect for law. I believe that very deeply.\n  I was sorry that we went off on that tack. It was a good hearing. The \nchairman was very fair and everybody got their say. It was probably a \ngood thing to talk about it and get it out in the open. I don't dispute \nthat. But I think it is important that we in this body do not suggest \nto the American people that politics affects the law out in the field \nin the courtrooms all over America because it, in my view, does not.\n  The second hearing we had was on the burden of proof. It was \nsuggested in these hearings that the burden of proof is on the nominees \nto prove somehow that they ought to be confirmed. That would be a big \nchange in policy. I do not know what you are supposed to do. Are you \nsupposed to come to a judiciary hearing with 100 of your best friends? \nWhat are you supposed to do?\n\n  What we do know is that the process has served us pretty well over \nthe years. The President of the United States gets to nominate Federal \njudges under the Constitution. He solicits information back from the \ndistrict involved or the circuit that is involved. Names come up to the \nPresident. He evaluates them and decides whom he is going to nominate.\n  They do a pretty good job, frankly, of asking around, finding out if \nthere is any trouble in the person's background, would they make a good \nnominee. In my view, as the years have gone by, the President has been \neven more intent on getting people who will be good judges than people \nwho might be political friends or things of that nature. So that goes \nup.\n  The President tentatively selects a nominee. This is the person they \nwould like to submit. They do their own checking around. Then they give \nit to the FBI, and they do an intensive, full field investigation. The \nagents interview anybody with whom that person has worked. They \ninterview people who have litigated against them. They interview judges \nbefore whom they have practiced. Then they come back with an FBI \nreport. They find out whether or not they have been arrested, whether \nor not they have had drug abuse problems, or any other problem they \nmight have in their background. They will interview an ex-wife, people \nwho may have a basis to complain, and they put that in the report.\n\n[[Page S10751]]\n\n  So the President has that report. Then he decides whether or not to \nsubmit the name. And that report is available to all of us in the \nSenate--only the Senators--in confidential form. We can go and examine \nthat report. If we see something we do not like, even though the \nPresident has approved that person, we can oppose a nominee on that \nbasis. So that is the way the system works.\n  After the nominee hits the Senate, the Senate sends a big \nquestionnaire to the nominee. First the President submits a big \nquestionnaire to the nominee, and depending on the investments and the \ncareer of the nominee, the questionnaire can have hundreds of pages of \nresponses to all these questions. Then we have another one from the \nSenate. That one is done. Then the ABA, the American Bar Association, \ngoes out and does their background check. They talk to judges. They \ntalk to lawyers. They talk to the president of the local bar \nassociation, the president of the ABA, the members of the ABA from that \ncommunity. They talk to people who have litigated in intense situations \nwith the nominee. That is an important factor. In the pit, in the \ndepth, in the intensity of a big-time lawsuit, if the person has \ncharacter flaws, they will usually show up. Most lawyers are pretty \nobjective. They will fairly evaluate a person they have litigated \nagainst, and they will tell the ABA and the FBI what they think about \nthem.\n  So then the ABA makes their recommendations as to whether or not this \nnominee is ``qualified'' or ``exceptionally well qualified.''\n  I think that is a pretty good process. So I suggest it is not wise at \nthat point to say: Mr. Nominee, after you have done all these things, \nit is your burden, as we sit up here as Senators, to convince us, after \nthe tremendous career you may have had in the practice of law--maybe \nyou have a well-qualified rating--you have to convince us to vote for \nyou. I do not know how you do that.\n  I think the record speaks for itself. Historically we have not had \nthat as a standard. In fact, in the first 125 years of this country's \nexistence we never even had hearings on the nominees. If something came \nup on a nominee that the Senate did not like, they could object, but \nthey did not even have hearings on the nominee. I do not mind an \nobjection to hearings; it is probably a healthy thing. The Senate \nshould not be a rubber stamp. But also we should not put that burden on \nthe nominee, after they have done all that, before they are confirmed.\n  So, Madam President, we will also have another series of hearings \nthat are designed to intensify a basis for opposition to President \nBush's nominees, all of which I think is a dangerous direction. So I \nsay all that as a matter of background. That is not myth. That is not \nan unfair characterization of where we are.\n  There is a move, apparently, by some, to change the ground rules of \nconfirmation. It has, apparently, already begun to infect our process.\n  I have some charts in the Chamber I would like to show that depict \nwhere we are in terms of vacancies in the Federal courts today.\n  In the 103rd Congress, there were 63 vacancies at this same time \nperiod. This was during a time when Senator Biden, a Democrat, chaired \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  In the 104th Congress, there were 65 vacancies during this same time \nperiod. Senator Hatch was chairman of the Judiciary Committee. There \nwere 65 vacancies. This was during President Clinton's administration.\n  Then, with a Republican chairman, a Republican majority in the \nSenate, and a Democratic President, Chairman Hatch got the number down \nto 50 vacancies.\n  Then in the 106th Congress, the last year of President Clinton's \nadministration, there were 67 vacancies--just about the traditional \naverage. In fact, historically they tend to be a little higher in the \nlast year of an administration.\n  But now, just a few months later, the vacancy rate has surged from 67 \nto 110. Perhaps it is 108 today after those confirmations, but that is \nan unhealthy trend. I believe President Bush and those who want to see \nhim have a fair day for his judges have a right to be concerned in \nlight of particularly the statements that they want to change our \nground rules.\n  One of the things we have found, as we have looked at the process, is \nthat the Senate, regardless of who is in the majority party, has done a \ngood job of confirming judges who were nominated prior to August in \nthat first year. In other words, from January through July, the \nPresident submits his nominees, as he can. It is a little difficult for \nhim at first because he has a lot of people to appoint--he has a \nCabinet to select, and new things are happening for the President in \nthose first months--but, fundamentally, we have seen that the President \nhas done very well with the nominees he has submitted.\n  President Reagan, in his first year in office, was able to get every \njudge he nominated, prior to August, confirmed before the Senate \nrecessed for the year in November or December. He had 100 percent \nconfirmed.\n  Former President Bush got 100 percent of his nominees confirmed \nduring that time.\n  President Clinton got 93 percent confirmed. I think there was one \njudge who did not get confirmed who was nominated before August. This \nwas under President Clinton and a Republican Senate--well, maybe it was \na Democrat Senate at that time. They did not confirm one, but all the \nrest were confirmed.\n  But under this President, President Bush--and we are coming along to \nthe end of this session; there are people saying we ought to be out of \nhere in a month or less--has only gotten 18 percent of those judges \nconfirmed.\n  I know there have been some things that have happened that make it a \nlittle difficult, but, frankly, I think we ought to work a little \nharder. We have had a change of party, and we have had an attack on \nAmerica that has disrupted us in many ways. But many of these nominees, \nyou have to understand, are highly rated by the ABA. They are highly \nrespected by their local men and women in the bar association, and no \none objects to them. They have no objections against them. Republicans \nand Democrats back home support them.\n  There is one from my district. She worked for me. She was hired as an \nassistant U.S. attorney under President Carter. She worked 12 years for \nme. Absolutely wonderful. She recently received a unanimous ``well \nqualified'' rating. She has no political agenda. A lot of these \nnominees are like that, just good lawyers, men and women of integrity \nand ability. They need to be moved forward. We could be a lot further \nalong than we are today.\n  One of the reasons we are behind is that we are not bringing enough \nof these noncontroversial judges, or any of the judges, forward at \nhearings on nominations.\n  Under the heading ``judicial nominees per hearing,'' in 1998, they \nhad 4.2 judges as the average number per hearing to be confirmed.\n  We have a hearing in which the judge appears and answers any \nquestions Senators might have. Later there is a vote within the \ncommittee whether or not to confirm.\n  You can't have a vote in the committee until there has been a hearing \nto take information and question the nominee about anything anybody \nwould like to ask. So the hearing is a critical step in getting \nconfirmations. In 1999, it was 4.2. In 2000, it was 4.2.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/16/senate-section/article/S10751-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10751]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

A motion to proceed to H.R. 2506.\n  The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n\n[[Page S10752]]\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the Foreign \nOperations Appropriations Subcommittee and coauthor of the bill with \nthe Senator from Vermont, obviously, I would like to see the bill pass, \nand pass sometime soon. But the point this side of the aisle made \nyesterday afternoon is that we do need to have some cooperation in \nmoving forward on the President's nominees for the circuit district \ncourts across America.\n  An essential part of our job in the Senate is confirming these \njudges. The President has nominated judges to fill these vacancies at a \nrecord pace.\n  In fact, his first 11 nominations were sent to the Senate on May 9 of \nthis year, more than 2 months earlier than any of the previous 3 \nPresidents in their first years. Of these 11, all received either the \nhighest or second highest rating available from the American Bar \nAssociation, and all have had their paperwork complete for many months. \nIn eight situations, there were formal judicial emergencies. Yet only \nthree have received a hearing.\n  This is the situation in which we find ourselves. Looking back at \nrecent history, looking at the first year of each of the three previous \nadministrations, with one exception, every judge nominated before the \nAugust recess was confirmed before the end of the year.\n  Let me repeat that. Looking back at the last three administrations, \nin the first year of each of the last administrations, every judge, \nwith one exception, nominated prior to the August recess was confirmed \nin the first year of those administrations.\n  There is simply no good reason to move so slowly. It is easy to have \nhearings, and when you have hearings, it is easy to have a number of \ndifferent judges at that hearing. I am sure the chairman has made the \npoint that he has had a number of hearings. The problem is we have not \ndone any judges at the hearings. So we need to give these outstanding \nnominees an opportunity to have their hearings, to have their votes in \nthe Judiciary Committee, and to have their votes on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Part of fighting the war on terrorism is to have a judiciary that is \nadequately staffed. There is a very significant, a very high vacancy \nrate currently in the Federal judiciary across America.\n  This pace we have been following is just painstakingly slow and is \nreally not necessary at all. As time passes and we do not have serious \naction on judicial nominees, the situation gets worse. Just today, \nanother judge, Charles Wolle of the Southern District of Iowa, \nannounced he has taken another status.\n  Another day has gone by, and we have lost another judge. The vacancy \nsituation has now risen to 109, which is almost 13 percent of the \nFederal bench. That means that more than 1 out of every 10 seats is \nunfilled. Justice delayed, as we all know, is justice denied. And if \nthere is not a judge on the bench, obviously you cannot get justice.\n  The situation is much worse than it was just a couple of years ago \nwhen our colleagues on the other side of the aisle were urging action \non judges. I want my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nunderstand that I am not engaging in hyperbole. My conclusions are \nbased on the specific standards articulated by our Democratic \ncolleagues.\n  For example, just last year when there were only 76 vacancies--at the \nmoment we have 109 vacancies--just last year when there were only 76 \nvacancies, Senator Daschle stated:\n\n       Looking at those figures, one might assume we have no \n     pressing need for Federal judges. In fact, just the opposite \n     is true. Today, there are 76 vacancies on the Federal bench. \n     Of those 76 vacancies, 29 have been empty so long they are \n     officially classified as ``judicial emergencies.'' The \n     failure to fill these vacancies is straining our Federal \n     court system and delaying justice for people all across this \n     country.\n\n  That was March 8, 2000, at the time there were 76 vacancies, just 18 \nmonths ago. Now there are 109 vacancies and very little to no action \nhas been taken.\n  Some of our colleagues have tried to shift the blame to the President \nfor our lack of progress, but this is clearly not the case. As I \nindicated at the beginning of my remarks, President Bush has submitted \nmore nominees to the Senate and at a faster pace than any President in \nrecent memory.\n  Specifically, he submitted his first batch of nominees in May, a full \n2 months before President Clinton submitted his first nominees. The \nadministration has done an extraordinary job. President George Bush has \ngotten his nominees up here 2 months before President Clinton got his \nfirst nominee up. By the August recess, President Bush had submitted 44 \njudicial nominees, another record. So the President and his \nadministration, on the issue of getting nominees vetted and up to the \nSenate, has clearly surpassed recent administrations.\n  You cannot blame our lack of progress on the change of control of the \nSenate and the time to get an organizing resolution because after the \nchange in Senate control, 9 different Senate committees held 16 \ndifferent nomination hearings for 44 different nominees before \nreorganization was completed.\n  Let's go over that again. It has been suggested that somehow the \nshift in control of the Senate slowed down the consideration of judges. \nYet since the shift in the Senate, since the reorganizing resolution \nwas passed, 9 different Senate committees held 16 different nomination \nhearings for 44 different nominees before reorganization was completed, \nand one of those committees even held a markup during the \nreorganization period. I am talking about the period during the \ndiscussion of reorganization.\n  By contrast, during the same period, the Judiciary Committee did not \nhold a single confirmation hearing for any of the 39 judicial and \nexecutive branch nominees who were pending before us.\n  Let's take a look at that one more time. I am talking about the 3-\nweek period when we were discussing how to reorganize the Senate. The \nSenate had shifted hands to the Democrats, and we had a 3-week period \nwhere we were discussing how to reorganize. During that 3-week period, \n9 different Senate committees held 16 different nomination hearings for \n44 different nominees prior to the reorganization discussion being \ncompleted. One of those committees even held a markup during the \nreorganization period.\n  During that 3-week period we were discussing reorganization, after \nthe Senate shifted hands to the Democrats, what was happening at the \nJudiciary Committee? Absolutely nothing. It did not hold a single \nconfirmation hearing for any of the 39 judicial and executive branch \nnominees who were then pending before us.\n  The notion that nothing could be done during the period we were \ndiscussing how to reorganize the Senate certainly did not affect these \nother nine committees that were holding hearings and in one case even \nheld a markup on nominees for jobs other than the judicial jobs.\n  It seems to me the reason for our slow progress has been a lack of \nefficiency. While we have had some hearings, we have not come close to \ngetting the most out of the hearings. In fact, it seems as if we have \ngotten the least out of the most. Specifically, during the period from \n1998 to 2000, the Judiciary Committee averaged 4.2 judicial nominees \nper hearing. This year we have averaged only 1.4 judicial nominees per \nhearing. That is a pace that is three times as slow.\n  The issue of having hearings is not as significant as the question of \nwhat did you do in the hearing.\n  As I indicated, if you average up the number of judicial nominations \ndealt with per hearing, in 1998 it was 4.2 judicial nominees per \nhearing in the Judiciary Committee; in 1999, 4.2 judicial nominees per \nhearing; in the year 2000, 4.2 judicial nominees per hearing.\n  This year, strangely, we have only dealt with 1.4 judicial nominees \nper hearing. The number of hearings is interesting but not relevant to \nthe subject of processing judges because we have had only 1.4 judges \ndealt with per hearing even though each of the last 3 years there were \n4.2 judges per hearing. Obviously, we can do a lot better than that. It \nis not too late. The session is\n\n[[Page S10753]]\n\nnot over. It is not too late for the Senate to act, at least on the \nremaining 38 judicial nominees who were submitted to the Senate before \nthe August recess.\n  In the last three administrations, of the 30 judges submitted before \nthe August recess, 23, or 77 percent, were confirmed in the fall after \nthe August recess.\n  I have to quote a colleague, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \non our ability, if we set our minds to it, to do this. Last year, when \nthere were only 60 vacancies, Senator Leahy said: Having begun so \nslowly in the first half of the year, we have much more to do before \nthe Senate takes final action on judicial nominees this year. We \nmisused all the time for adjournment to remedy the vacancies that have \nbeen perpetrated on the courts to the detriment of the American people \nand the administration of justice. That should be a top priority for \nthe Senate the rest of the year.\n  This was Chairman Leahy, last year, dealing with the very same kind \nof situation, which is to get our work done on judges, a year in which \nwe were doing way more judges than we have done so far this year.\n  I must correct my colleague from North Dakota who earlier today said \nour failure to act on the foreign operations bill, which I care deeply \nabout, is jeopardizing much needed funds for embassy security. As the \nranking member on this bill, I assure my colleagues that is not the \ncase. The money for embassy security is not in the foreign operations \nbill, not in this bill at all. It is in the Commerce-Justice-State \nbill. So nothing is being jeopardized by the failure to pass the \nforeign operations bill on one day versus a few later, after we reach \nan understanding on how to deal with the President's nominees sent up \nbefore the August recess.\n  In sum, all we are asking for is a specific concrete commitment to \nhave President Bush's nominees treated in the same manner as nominees \nof his predecessors. Until we get such a commitment, I think it is \nclear from yesterday's vote it will be difficult to make progress on \nthe appropriations bills. Let me again say, as an appropriator, as a \nformer chairman of the foreign operations subcommittee, and now ranking \nmember, I certainly would not argue that the bill is unimportant. It is \nan important bill. A long time ago, we learned how to walk and chew gum \nat the same time. We can do more than one thing. We can have hearings \nbefore the Judiciary Committee. We can deal with more than 1.2 judges \nper hearing. We can get our work done. We can get judges out of \ncommittee. We can get them voted on and pass appropriations bills at \nthe same time.\n  I hope sometime in the next day or two we will be able to reach an \nunderstanding as to how to go forward on both of these important \nissues, the foreign operations bill and the confirmation of the \nPresident's nominees, or at least a vote on them--Senators can \ncertainly oppose them if they choose but vote on the nominees who came \nup before the August recess as we have done in previous years for other \nPresidents.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have worked with Senator Daschle for 20 \nyears. I have served with him almost 20 years, or very close to 20 \nyears. When I came to Washington, he already was a veteran legislator. \nSince the first time I met him until just a few minutes ago when I \ntalked with him, he has been one of the nicest, fairest people I have \never met. As a legislator, he qualifies as being outstanding. As \nminority and majority leader--and I have served under a significant \nnumber of them--he is unparalleled. He has the ability to understand \nissues, to work with people of all different persuasions and never, \never lose his patience and always has enough time to talk to someone. I \nam amazed at the ability he has, as harassed as he appears, to me, to \nbe with people wanting this and wanting that, to take time in a lengthy \ntelephone conversation with someone who has an issue.\n  The only reason I am saying this, the minority doesn't understand the \nproblem they have; that is, we have said we are going to move judicial \nnominations as quickly as we can. And we are. And we have. All of the \ncajoling and threatening they do on the other side will not get them \nany more judges. We are doing the very best we can.\n  For the whole time that Senator Hatch was chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee--and Senator Hatch is someone about whom I care a great deal; \nhe comes from the neighboring State of Utah. I like him; I have no \ncriticism of Senator Hatch. He never, during the time he was chairman \nof the committee, to my knowledge, held confirmation hearings 2 weeks \nin a row. We are going to do that. Maybe it will set some dangerous \nprecedent where we will have judicial confirmation hearings 2 weeks in \na row, but we are going do that because it is the right thing to do.\n  My friend, about whom I care a great deal, the Senator from Kentucky, \nand I have worked together on a number of issues. As stated, it will be \ndifficult to make progress unless something happens on the judges. I \ndon't know what they want us to do to make progress on the judges. We \ncannot guarantee this many or that many.\n  I spoke to Senator Leahy four times today on the judicial \nnominations. I have spoken to his staff. He is trying to come up with \npeople for the hearing next week, but the paperwork is not in on the \nvast majority of the people. He cannot do the hearings unless the \npaperwork is completed.\n  It is interesting, but you cannot do the hearings without the FBI \nreport. You cannot do the hearings without the Justice Department \nreporting. You cannot do it unless all the paperwork, which is very \ntraditional, is in. And it is not in. The fact they have sent people \ndown here doesn't mean the paperwork is done. This isn't paperwork we \ninvented. It is paperwork that has been traditional in trying to find \nout if this person should be a member of the Federal judiciary.\n  As my friend from Kentucky said, it is difficult to make progress. He \nalso said: You can do two things at once. That is what we have heard \ntoday.\n  The Senator from Wyoming said we can do two things at once. Of \ncourse, we can do two things at once. But we are not even doing one \nthing. These appropriations bills are extremely important.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. On the issue of paperwork, according to my staff, 29 \nof the judges have all the paperwork--29.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Kentucky, I don't know where you \nare getting this information.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. As a member of the committee, it is not a secret. We \nare entitled to know that.\n  I am saying to my friend I believe the paperwork is completed, \nentirely completed, on 29 judges who are before the committee. A couple \nhave had hearings.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Leahy, to whom I spoke several times today, has \nindicated to me that the paperwork on the vast majority of the \nconfirmations the President is seeking has not been completed. I also \nwould say, in response to my friend from Kentucky, regarding the chart, \n``Judicial Nominations Per Hearing,'' the fact is, of course, the \nnumber of judges per hearing has some merit. But also it is \nacknowledged that Senator Leahy has held more hearings. So even though \nyou do not do as many judges per hearing, if you do more hearings, it \nall adds up to the same thing anyway.\n  As I have said here on several different occasions, you can prove \nanything with statistics or disprove anything with statistics. The fact \nis, we are ready to move forward on appropriations bills--``bills'' in \nthe plural. Senator Murkowski comes to the Chamber every day saying, \nlet's do something on an energy package. We can't. We can't until we \nfinish the business at hand.\n  The continuing resolution is going to run out in a few days. Then we \nwill need a third continuing resolution. It is 3 weeks until \nThanksgiving. I hope the Senator from Alaska understands that there \nwill be no energy bill, nor can there be, until we finish the work that \nwe have. And the work now before us is the Foreign Operations Export \nFinancing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act for 2002. My friend \nfrom Kentucky says it is a good bill and he supports it.\n  Some are saying this is not all about judges; it is about having one \nbig appropriations bill. This is a way to stall\n\n[[Page S10754]]\n\nour individual appropriations bills and then we can have one big bill \nand go home. I think that would be too bad. There are specific things \nthis administration has requested in this bill that will not happen \nunless it is done in this bill. It will not be done with a continuing \nresolution.\n  We have people, especially from the heartland of this country, but \nthere are others, of course, who also care a great deal about a farm \nbill. We can't take up a farm bill until we finish these measures that \nare now before the Senate, foreign operations and the other \nappropriations bills.\n  I don't know what magic is expected. Of course, it is difficult to \nmake progress, as my friend from Kentucky has said, when we are not \nallowed to go forward on any legislative matters. As I have said on a \nnumber of occasions, we have not held up judges saying we are going to \nhold these until we are able to move forward on appropriations bills. \nWhen there were judges last week, we reported them out. We have done \nthat on all nominations. We have reported them out.\n  There was talk this morning, why haven't you done all the Federal \nmarshals? We haven't gotten any. The Judiciary Committee doesn't have \nany U.S. marshals. We can't report them out if we don't have them. Why \ndon't we do U.S. Attorneys? There may be some who know better than I, \nbut we have never seen a slower process in sending down U.S. Attorneys. \nLast week we reported 14 of those we have. We reported out 14 \nattorneys. I am sure they have all taken their oaths of office by now.\n  We are going to move forward as rapidly as we can on judicial \nnominations. If the minority doesn't want us to do the appropriations \nbills, then that is something they can do procedurally. They can stop \nus. They can bar us from doing that. But in the process, the important \nwork of the Senate will not get done.\n  No matter what happens with the minority, we are going to move \nforward in good faith and get as many judges, U.S. Attorneys, and U.S. \nmarshals as we can. Whatever they decide to do on the other side is not \ngoing to change the number of judges we are going to do. We are going \nto do the very best we can because we also believe it is important to \nthe country to have a full staff of U.S. marshals, full staff of U.S. \nAttorneys, and a full Federal judiciary as quickly as we can.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Nevada, the dispute is not \nabout U.S. Attorneys or U.S. marshals. That is not why all the \nRepublicans voted against cloture on the motion to proceed to the \nforeign operations bill yesterday. It is about the judicial \nnominations.\n  Mr. REID. Let me ask one question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield for a question.\n  Mr. REID. I didn't bring up the number of U.S. marshals and U.S. \nAttorneys; various members of the minority brought this up as a form of \ncriticism. And I am glad that is not a criticism because on those there \nreally is no dispute; we are doing the very best we can.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Even on U.S. Attorneys, there are a number before the \ncommittee--I don't have the number before me--that have not been acted \nupon.\n  The concern of the Republican conference, I assure my friend from \nNevada and Members of the Senate, is not about U.S. Attorneys and about \nU.S. marshals. As we all know, those offices have a number of \nprofessional civil servants. In the U.S. Marshal Service and the \nAssistant U.S. Attorneys, typically when there is a U.S. Attorney \nvacancy, there is an acting U.S. Attorney. They are able to function. \nBut a judge who isn't there can't rule. When you have a judicial \nvacancy, you have a vacancy. There isn't such a thing as an assistant \njudge, a civil servant who can sit in cases and make rulings. The U.S. \nAttorneys offices are functioning. The U.S. Marshal Service is \nfunctioning. Absent judicial seats do not function.\n  With regard to whether or not all the paperwork is in, I say to my \nfriend from Nevada, I do now recall that the chairman has prepared a \nnew questionnaire that he has sent out, I am told, over the last couple \nof weeks. Since there is a brandnew questionnaire that just went out in \nthe last couple of weeks, it could be some of those are not in. But \nuntil the last 2 weeks, the understanding of the committee was that the \ncompletion of the ABA report completed a file. That has happened with \n29 of district and circuit judges who are ready to be acted upon. It is \ntime to move.\n\n  I see my friend and colleague from Arizona is here. I am happy to \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wanted to make a couple of comments and \nthen I know the Senator from Iowa wants to speak to a subject which is \nvery, very important: U.S. relations with Pakistan. I am anxious he \nhave that opportunity so I will be very brief.\n  One of the things the Senator will say is that Pakistan has really \nstuck its neck out in support of the United States position in this war \nagainst terrorism. Pakistan is in a very dangerous neighborhood, and \nthe United States has to do everything we can to support Pakistan in \nits time of need.\n  Almost all of us in this body, and certainly the administration, \nagree with that proposition. So we are going to have to do everything \nwe can to assist them. By the way, there are some things in the \nappropriations bill that will be before us, hopefully relatively soon, \nthat will assist in this regard as well. In the meantime, there are a \nlot of other things we can be doing to assist Pakistan.\n  In response to what has been said here with respect to the motion to \nproceed on the Foreign Operations bill, Senator McConnell is absolutely \nright about the delay that has been occurring in the consideration of \njudges. As he has said, he is the ranking member of this appropriations \nsubcommittee and has chaired the subcommittee for the last several \nyears. While it is important to get the foreign ops appropriations bill \nbefore us, the fact is we are going to have a foreign ops \nappropriations bill. We have a supplemental that covers the situation \nuntil then, so there is not a single day that goes by that we are not \nproviding the money that is called for under this legislation. So this \nis not about holding up the Senate's business or holding up the Foreign \nOperations Appropriations Bill. All of that is going to be done. That \nis not the issue before us.\n  The issue before us is occasioned by the fact that there were some \nwho said we are so busy we just can't get to these nominations. My \nresponse is: Fine, we will just call a time out until we can catch up \nwith some of the nominations. In each of the three preceding \nadministrations--the Reagan administration, 8 years' worth; the Bush \nadministration, 4 years; and 8 years of President Clinton--in their \nfirst year every single one of the nominees that had been sent to the \nSenate by the August recess were confirmed by the end of the year with \nonly one exception. Yet it is going to be virtually impossible for that \nto occur now. There were 44 nominees sent up by President Bush before \nthe August recess. We have confirmed eight. That leaves 36. At the pace \nthe Judiciary Committee, of which I am a member, is holding hearings, \nwe are not going to be able to complete work on even half of those \nnominees.\n  Part of the reason we have tried to focus attention on this matter is \nto say we have to get to work in the Judiciary Committee. We have to \nhave the Judiciary Committee hold hearings, approve the nominees for \nconsideration by the floor so all of us can then consider the nominees. \nThey are going to be approved on the floor. I doubt very many, if any, \nare going to be disapproved. But certainly, in any event, whether you \nlike the nominee or not, the argument has been made for years that they \nat least deserve a vote, and I think all of us would agree with that. \nSo we have to do something to take up consideration on these nominees. \nTime is short. We have only another 4 or 5 or 6 weeks to go in this \nsession.\n  If we don't get to work here pretty soon, we are not going to be able \nto confirm the same percentage of judges that have been confirmed in \nprior administrations.\n  There have been two parliamentary or rhetorical tacks taken by those \non the other side of the aisle. One is the red herring, the President \nhasn't sent\n\n[[Page S10755]]\n\nup very many nominees for U.S. marshals. That has nothing to do with \nthe fact that a whole lot of nominees are pending for judge. I daresay, \nas important as the marshals are, the judges are more important. We \nhave got to get them confirmed.\n  Then there was the comment that the President could send up a lot \nmore U.S. attorney nominations than he has. Again, it is a red herring. \nHe could. We will confirm them, too. They are also important.\n  But let's get back to the judges. In other words, let's stop trying \nto change the subject. President Bush has nominated more candidates for \njudgeship at this point in his Presidency than any of the past three \nPresidents.\n  With respect to nominees to the court, the President has done his \njob. Granted, he got a bit of a late start because his term as \nPresident got a bit of a late start because of all of the business \nfollowing the election results. But, once he got started, he named \nnominees at a faster pace than his three predecessors.\n  That is what is pending before us--60 nominations with only 8 \nconfirmed. We are saying that all of those ought to be considered by \nthe Senate and by the Judiciary Committee. But, at a minimum, those \nnominated prior to the August recess should be considered by the full \nSenate.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, the Senator \nis right on the mark. It is not too late to do the right thing, which \nis one of the points we are trying to make to the Senate and to the \ncountry. In those first years of those three administrations to which \nthe Senator made reference--and I have talked about others--77 percent \nof those confirmed were confirmed after the August recess, which means \nit is not too late.\n  The idea some on the other side of the aisle may be thinking--that we \ncan't possibly replicate the standard here--is not true. It can be \ndone. We simply need to have hearings and have more than 1.4 judges \nheard per hearing. Hearings don't mean a whole lot if you are not \nhaving judges before the committee.\n  I commend the Senator and echo his thoughts. It is not too late to do \nthe right thing. That is what we are saying.\n  Mr. KYL. Exactly. At the rate of 1.4 judges per hearing, there is no \nway we will be able to have enough judge nominations that can come to \nthe Senate floor for confirmation before we adjourn for the year. That \nis why we have to not only have more hearings but we have to have more \njudges at each hearing.\n  Basically, there are a couple of dozen, or more, of these pending 36 \nthat haven't had hearings. That means that even if you have one hearing \nper week rather than one per month, and you have maybe five candidates \nper hearing, you are just barely going to be able to have enough \nhearings to get the candidates voted on and get them to the Senate \nfloor in order for us to be able to confirm them before year's end.\n  While it is true that it is not too late, it will be too late if we \ndon't get a commitment right away to have the Judiciary Committee hold \nhearings for the candidates and have business meetings at which the \ncommittee can then vote on them, and then have the ability for the full \nSenate to take up the nomination.\n  To further validate what the Senator from Kentucky just said, the \nfact is that in almost every case in the past several years the \nnominees are voted on as a bloc by voice at the end of the day, or by a \nunanimous consent. In other words, the majority leader will usually \nstand up and say: I ask unanimous consent that we now go to Executive \nCalendar number such-and-such and consider the following 14 candidates \nfor judge. The clerk reads the names. Is there any objection? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered. It is done. That is all the time it takes.\n  It is true that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee since June \nhas insisted on rollcall votes on the Senate floor. That is fine, too. \nThat takes 20 minutes per judge. We can do that. We can have debate \nbefore that. No problem. We are saying that we now have an opportunity \ndo to that; let's do it.\n  I want to make the point that you can try to change the subject if \nyou want, but you can't deny that we are not moving as rapidly as \npossible. For anybody to stand here and say we are moving as rapidly as \npossible runs counter to the facts. We could be holding hearings. We \nare not. We could be voting to approve those who have had hearings. We \nare not. We could bring those people to the floor for a vote. We are \nnot doing that. It is simply incorrect to say we are moving as fast as \nwe can or that we are doing as much as we can.\n  Unless somebody brings all of this to the attention of the American \npeople and also the other people in the body, this matter simply slides \nuntil it becomes too late to consider those candidates.\n  We should not be using the horrific events of September 11 and the \nbusiness we have had since as an excuse not to take action on a matter. \nIn fact, one can make the argument that it is more important than ever \nthat we fill these important positions. That is simply the point I \nwanted to make.\n  But I want to defer now to the Senator from Iowa who I know has an \nimportant point to make about this war on terrorism and the position of \nthe United States in supporting one of our allies, in particular the \ncountry of Pakistan, something that is very important for us to do. In \nadvance, I applaud his remarks.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                          The National Agenda\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we are in times when it seems \nwe ought to be doing what is on the top of the national agenda. Meeting \nthis terrorist threat, providing the resources to our military, and \nproviding the humanitarian assistance in our efforts in Afghanistan \nclearly should be at the top of the agenda.\n  In meeting the national economic condition we have seen as a result \nof the airlines having the difficulty of getting their passengers back, \nit took us 3\\1/2\\ weeks to get the aviation and airline security bill \npassed in this body. When it finally passed last Thursday, it was on a \nunanimous vote. But it was filibustered. We had to go through all the \nmotions of breaking the filibuster to finally get it to where we would \nget a unanimous vote because different people had different agendas.\n  So, too, we find ourselves now with the foreign operations \nappropriations bill being held off and last night having the motion for \ncloture defeated. We couldn't get 60 votes so that we could proceed on \nthis very important appropriations bill that directly affects what we \nare doing on the other side of planet Earth at this moment. We simply \nmust move swiftly to conduct the business of the American people.\n  There is no more urgent pending business than this foreign operations \nbill that we are simply trying to get to, but we keep being held up in \nthe Senate. This foreign operations bill gives the administration and \nSecretary of State Powell the resources and tools needed to build the \ninternational coalitions that are so necessary in fighting this war on \nterrorism. It is clearly necessary for us to be able to successfully \nconduct the operations of Enduring Freedom.\n  Specifically, this bill provides funding for the important \ninternational initiatives vital to conduct U.S. foreign policy.\n  If this foreign operations bill does all of that, why are we having \nthe difficulty of getting to it? Why can't we have our debates where \nthere might be disagreement on something other than a bill that is so \nimportant to the national agenda and supporting our men and women in \nuniform over in the central Asian region of the world?\n  Let me talk about something else that this bill does. It provides $5 \nmillion for Afghan refugees.\n  Why is that important? It is important because we have a major two-\npronged effort in Central Asia. We have the military effort, and we \nhave the humanitarian effort. We are dropping food. We want to be able \nto win the hearts and minds of those people. We want to take the \nexample of what has happened in North Korea, a communist dictatorship, \nwhere we have sent bags of food that the people of North Korea know \nhave come from the United States because the bags say, in the native \nlanguage, ``This is a gift from the people of the United States of \nAmerica,'' and those people know it. Because of their starvation, those \nNorth Koreans are very appreciative.\n\n[[Page S10756]]\n\n  Do you know what they do with those bags, those sacks after, in fact, \nthey have eaten the food? They use that material from the sacks for \nclothes, for suitcases, for anything that human ingenuity can think of \nto use those sacks. They recognize that the food has come from the \nUnited States because it says, in their language, ``This is a gift from \nthe United States of America.'' So we have been very successful in \ndoing that.\n  So we ought to take the model of what we have done so successfully in \nour humanitarian aid in North Korea and apply it in Afghanistan. \nSecretary Powell came over to discuss a lot of these matters with the \nForeign Relations Committee and this matter was brought up to him. He \nthought that was an excellent idea. But part of it depends on us \npassing this bill, this appropriations bill, which has $255 million for \nAfghan refugees. And we cannot even get this bill up because yesterday \nwe only got some 50 votes to break this filibuster so we could get this \nbill to the floor.\n  So here we are, still debating the motion to proceed. It is \ninconceivable to me, with what is at stake for this country and the \ninterests of this country over in that part of the world near \nAfghanistan, that we have people who are delaying this legislation \ncoming to a swift passage.\n  Let me give you some additional items in this bill. There is $326 \nmillion in this appropriations bill for nonproliferation, \nantiterrorism, demining, and related programs. One of the big problems \nis, even from the old days of the Afghan war with the former Soviet \nUnion, there are so many mines that for our troops, once they are in \nthere, or for nongovernmental companies going in to distribute food, \nthere is the risk of detonation. We need to be in there demining.\n  This foreign operations appropriations bill provides money for that. \nWhy can't we get on with passing this legislation instead of it being \nderailed by a filibuster?\n  This bill also includes $4 million for a terrorist interdiction \nprogram designed to enhance border security overseas to reduce \nterrorism. It also includes $38 million for the antiterrorism \nassistance program to support training and emergency and first \nresponder training.\n  Additionally, the bill provides important bilateral assistance to \nnations that are so important to both the Middle East peace process as \nwell as fighting terrorism. It provides foreign assistance of $2.7 \nbillion to Israel, almost $2 billion to Egypt, and $228 million to \nJordan. Need I remind you how important the King of Jordan and his \ngovernment are to us as we knit together a coalition of Arab and Muslim \nnations to assist us in this war on terrorism. Yet we have people who \nare delaying this legislation for their own agenda. Their own agenda \nmay be important to them, but is it as important to us in America as \nthe war against terrorism?\n  Let me suggest some other things this legislation says. It provides \nassistance for the independent states of the former Soviet Union--now \nget this--the Ukraine, Armenia, Georgia; former states of the former \nSoviet Union, now independent states that are absolutely critical as we \nknit together the coalition in this war against terrorism. U.S. support \nand assistance in these nations are needed now, and it is in our \nnational security interests. Yet the legislation is being delayed. It \nis being filibustered in this Chamber.\n\n  There are also other items in this legislation. We must keep the \nfocus on the Andean region. This bill provides $718 million for the \nAndean regional initiative, which includes $147 million for \nhumanitarian and development programs. This Andean initiative is a part \nof a balanced effort aimed at eradicating coca crops, supporting \ninterdiction efforts, and strengthening the rule of law in those \nconflict-plagued regions of the world. This is critical to the U.S. \nfocus on Latin America where democracy itself is being threatened. That \nis a very high priority in the agenda of protecting the interests of \nthe United States. But we have people filibustering this bill, not \nallowing it to go forward.\n  I daresay when it passes, it will probably pass almost unanimously, \nif we can ever get it to a vote. Yet we have people dragging their feet \nfor their own specific agenda purposes.\n  I will give you more examples. This legislation that is being held up \nright now provides funding recommendations for conflict resolution in \nthe Middle East and the Balkans. It provides funding for conflict \nresolution in the War Crimes Tribunals in Yugoslavia, Rwanda, and \nSierra Leone, and it provides funding for regional democracy programs \nin Asia. Yet the legislation is being held up.\n  So I urge our colleagues to put aside their differences and stand up \nfor what is in the interests of the United States at this particularly \ncritical time in our country. I ask all our colleagues to join in the \nspirit of bipartisanship we have had over the course of the last \nseveral weeks in sending a strong statement to the American people and \nto those around the world who would wish ill upon the United States. \nLet's send that strong message that we will move forward with a policy \nthat is important to freedom, democracy, and American values, despite \nthe efforts of those in the world who would try to undercut all things \nwe hold so dear in this country.\n  I plead with our colleagues, it is not in their interest to delay and \nto obfuscate, to use tactics of filibustering an appropriations bill \nthat is so important to the national security interests of this \ncountry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The distinguished Senator from \nIowa.\n\n\n                                PAKISTAN\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I take the floor to talk about our \nrelationship with one of the longest, strongest allies we have ever had \nin this world and why I think it is so important for us at this point \nin time to recognize that and to move more aggressively towards \nreestablishing the kind of connections and ties and mutual support we \nhave had with the nation of Pakistan in the past.\n  Following the attacks of September 11, all eyes turned to South Asia \nand particularly to Afghanistan. Just as quickly, we began to look for \nallies in that region of the world. As has always been the case, the \nUnited States found a steadfast ally in Pakistan. Through thick and \nthin, we have never had a better ally in that region of the world and, \nin fact, in almost the entire world, but we have often failed to \nrecognize this fact.\n  Let's look at the record. Our close relationship with Pakistan began \nwhen that State was born in 1947 with the partition from India. At that \ntime, we watched as the world began to divide into two camps--one led \nby the United States and the free world and democracies, and the other \nby the Soviet Union and the Communists. The temptation for the \nPakistanis to stay neutral at best or to be opportunistic and go with \nthe Soviet Union, since it was so close to the borders of the Soviet \nstates at that time, was enormous. But when Pakistan's first prime \nminister, Liaquat Ali Kahn, chose to undertake his first foreign travel \nout of Pakistan--this is the first prime minister of a newly formed \ncountry, very close to the Soviet Union, right on the border of \nCommunist China--he took his first trip to the United States. In a \nspeech to Members of the U.S. Congress at that time, Prime Minister \nLiaquat Ali Kahn proclaimed:\n\n       No threat or persuasion, no material peril or ideological \n     allurement could deflect Pakistan from its chosen path of \n     free democracy.\n\n  Imagine that. This was in 1947. Since those days, Pakistan has stood \nwith the United States time and time again. In 1950, Pakistan declared \nits unqualified support for our position in the Korean conflict. Keep \nin mind, Pakistan shares a border with Communist China. They sent \ntroops to fight alongside us in Korea, barely 3 years after Pakistan \nbecame a nation.\n  Soon after that, Pakistan joined CENTO and SEATO, the Southeast \nTreaty Organization, supporting the U.S. in the long struggle to \ncontain communism. In 1959, the U.S. and Pakistan signed the mutual \ndefense treaty, which, by the way, is still in effect today. One year \nafter that, Pakistan allowed the United States to set up bases in their \ncountry to conduct U-2 flights over the Soviet Union.\n  As those who are at least my age may recall, the U-2 flight of \nFrancis Gary Powers, which we remember was the U-2 shot down by a \nmissile in the Soviet Union, originated in the Pakistani city of \nPeshawar, which we read\n\n[[Page S10757]]\n\nso much about today since it is right on the border of Pakistan. After \nthat U-2 flight was downed in the Soviet Union, Nikita Khruschev, in \none of his more infamous, belligerent speeches, threatened to ``wipe \nPeshawar off the face of the earth'' because they had allowed our U-2 \nflights to originate there.\n  Despite its relative proximity to the Soviet Union and the immediate \nthreat it posed, Pakistan continued to stand with America. The threat \ncrept even closer as the Soviets invaded Afghanistan. From the onset of \nthat invasion in 1979 until the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, Pakistan \ncooperated fully with the United States to roll back the Soviet threat. \nIt became the staging area for our work with the rebel forces in \nAfghanistan to throw back the Soviets.\n  Probably a little known fact: In every conflict the United States has \nfought since Korea, Pakistan has sent troops to fight alongside us \nevery single time. They even sent troops to help us in Haiti, of all \nplaces. They sent troops to fight alongside us in the Gulf War.\n  In the United Nations--check the record on this--Pakistan was one of \nour strongest allies in voting with us. Their neighbor to the east was \nvoting more often with the Soviet Union, but Pakistan was one of the \nbest votes we had to support the United States in all these years in \nthe United Nations.\n  Pakistan has also repeatedly taken courageous actions against \nterrorism in recent years. We may remember when the two CIA employees \nwere shot and killed right in our own backyard. Pakistani authorities \narrested and turned over several suspected terrorists, including Mr. \nMir Aimal Kasi who was convicted of killing the two CIA employees. \nPakistan picked him up, gave him over to our authorities so we could \nbring him here, try him, and convict him of those killings.\n  They turned over Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, convicted for his role in the \n1993 World Trade Center bombing. Pakistan turned him over to us.\n  In 1998, they detained Mohammed Sadiq Howaida, involved with the \nbombing of the U.S. Embassy in Kenya. Time and time and time again, \nwhen we wanted the terrorists turned over, Pakistan not only helped us \nhunt them down, but arrested them and then turned them over to us.\n  Since the dark day of September 11, when we turned to Pakistan once \nagain in our time of great need, most Pakistanis and their government \nare bravely standing with us at substantial risk to themselves. I \nbelieve history will record this as one of Pakistan's finest hours. I \nhope the courageous support in the war against terrorism will now open \na new era of unparalleled bilateral collaborations between our two \ngreat nations.\n  Yes, we must continue to encourage Pakistan, as well as India, to \npursue sound nuclear policies and to sign the comprehensive test ban \ntreaty. I believe that will come with continued, positive engagement. \nIt will come as Pakistanis see their role as a critical U.S. ally in \nthe region and as they are more fully recognized as a great leader, \nespecially among the Muslim nations of the world.\n  Madam President, Pakistan now faces its gravest crisis since the 1971 \nwar with India, especially given its ethnic and religious makeup. \nNevertheless, the Government of Pakistan has been remarkably \nforthcoming in its willingness to help the U.S. prosecute the war \nagainst the terrorists who perpetrated the recent horrific attacks in \nour country and their sponsors.\n  President Musharraf has pledged to give the Americans just about \neverything they want.\n  Now, that is just about as strong as what we heard from Prime \nMinister Blair in England. Yet this is from the President of a country \nin which there are elements--large elements--who support the Taliban \nand, quite frankly, do not support what the United States is doing. So \nPresident Musharraf has courageously stepped forward to help our \ncountry once again. We asked for an expanded information exchange \nbetween the United States and Pakistani intelligence services. They \nhave given that to us. We asked for permission to use their air space \nfor military purposes. They have given it to us. We asked for \nlogistical support for any U.S. military operations to be launched from \nPakistani territory. They have given us that commitment also.\n  In short, in standing up to terrorism, no government--no government--\nhas been more responsive to U.S. requests since September 11, and no \ngovernment is assuming greater risk to itself than the Government of \nPakistan.\n  The Bush administration is already moving on several fronts to \nsolidify our short-term and long-term cooperation with the Government \nof Pakistan and to show our deep appreciation for the Pakistanis' \nstrong support for the U.S.-led coalition that is now embarked on \nridding the world of the scourge of terrorism. The remaining sanctions \non Pakistan are in the process of being lifted. I compliment President \nBush and his administration for beginning that process. Debt relief is \nbeing hammered out. U.S.-Pakistani military cooperation is quickly \nbeing restored--at least I hope so.\n  The Senator from Arizona and I were just discussing this issue on the \nfloor. The Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, was recently in Pakistan, I \nbelieve, toward the end of August and had several meetings with the \nmilitary and with the President. We were discussing this issue.\n  My friend, the Senator from Arizona, heard there are a lot of people \nin the Pakistani military--many of whom are retiring or getting ready \nto retire--who trained with or worked with our military who feel a \nclose kinship with our military. Yet because we have cut off this \nmilitary-to-military engagement over the last 20-some years, if I am \nnot mistaken--pretty darn close to 20 years--we have a whole new \ngeneration of young military officers who have come in who have no \nconnection with the United States.\n  In many cases, they have come from areas of Pakistan where the forces \nmaybe are not too supportive of the United States, and may be closer to \nthe Taliban, have more sway.\n  So I am hopeful that the President and the Congress will give him \nwhatever authority he needs to allow our military, once again, to \nengage in military-to-military cooperation with the Pakistani military \nto make sure that we can bring Pakistani military officers over here \nfor training and for the kind of intermilitary kind of cooperation that \nI believe will help build a more lasting and strong friendship between \nour two peoples.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, I am happy to.\n  Mr. KYL. I commend the Senator for the points he is making. I will \nadd one other point, which he hasn't mentioned yet, but I am sure he \nwas probably getting ready. Pakistan has not been the same kind of \ndemocracy as the United States. The military of that country has pretty \nwell controlled its nuclear armaments and forces, rather than being \nunder civilian control. That is the way it is in Pakistan, and I know \nit to be important for the United States to know where the Pakistani \nmilitary is coming from.\n\n  As long as they have great relations with the United States, which \nthe Senator from Iowa was referring to, I don't think we have too much \nconcern that Pakistan's nuclear weaponry would fall into the wrong \nhands. If this younger officer corps, which is not as closely aligned \nwith the West and the United States, were to become dominant in their \nmilitary, and if the influence of the Taliban should continue to \nincrease in Pakistan, I would think the United States would have great \nconcern about who is controlling the nuclear weapons in Pakistan. That \nis another very important reason to support what the Senator is talking \nabout right now.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend and colleague from Arizona for \nelaborating. That is a concern, and should be a concern, to all of us. \nPakistan is a nuclear power. We want to make sure the control of those \nnuclear arms is in responsible hands and in the hands of a military \nthat is closer to us.\n  Again, we have tried over the years to reestablish our military \ntraining programs with Pakistan. I hope we can get that back on course. \nI remember when Pakistan, in good faith, purchased a number of F-16s \nfrom the United States. They paid for them, and then the United States \nreneged. I am not going to get into all those issues. Let me put it \nthis way. There was a contractual relationship and the United States \nreneged on it. The F-16s\n\n[[Page S10758]]\n\nnever went. We kept their money and their planes for several years.\n  Finally, the Clinton administration made good on the money in a sort \nof roundabout way. I often think today, with what we are doing in going \nafter the terrorists and their sponsors in Afghanistan, would it not be \nnice to know that the Pakistani Air Force had those F-16s--the kind of \nplanes that we fly--and maybe they would have had that close \nrelationship to us. Yet after they purchased and paid for them, we \nwould not let them have them and we kept their money for several years. \nIt was one of the darkest times in our relationship with Pakistan. I \nremember it well.\n  Several of us here, including myself, Senator Brownback from Kansas, \nand others, had worked long and hard to get that straightened out. \nAnyway, all of these steps--the debt relief, the sanctions being \nlifted, the restoration of the military cooperation, all of which I \nsupport--we need to do sooner rather than later. But still more needs \nto be done. We should use our voice and our vote in the IMF, the World \nBank, and other international financial institutions, to help Pakistan \nsecure new loans on more favorable terms for its beleaguered economy. \nWe should also provide much more than the $100 million in assistance \nthat President Bush has recently pledged to assist Pakistan with the \nrising flood of Afghan refugees.\n  That is another thing I found when I visited Pakistan. There were \nover 1.5 million Afghan refugees in Pakistan. They are left over from \nthe Afghan war against the Soviets. These Afghans, for the most part, \nare living in refugee camps, poorly educated, poorly fed, and poorly \nhoused. Pakistan did everything we asked them to do in prosecuting this \nproxy war against the Soviet Union in Afghanistan. Yet they have all \nthese Afghan refugees there. Now more are coming across the border.\n  Madam President, it was said to me a long time ago, before anybody \never heard of Osama bin Laden that these Afghan refugee camps are a \nbreeding ground for the terrorists, a breeding ground now I know for \nOsama bin Laden and others. Pakistan needs help with these Afghan \nrefugees. It is something we should have done a long time ago.\n\n  Most important, now is the time for the United States to forge a new \nstrategic partnership with Pakistan, while at the same time not giving \nup our ties with India. I do not believe it is one or the other. I am \nnot saying we have to become friendly just with Pakistan and cut off \nIndia. I am not saying that at all. I know India and Pakistan have \nfought several wars in the past. I understand that. I believe we can \nmaintain our ties with India and, at the same time, build a new \nstrategic partnership with Pakistan.\n  This new United States-Pakistani strategic partnership should be \nbuilt upon three principal shared interests.\n  First, the United States must commit to supporting a stable \ndemocratic Pakistan with a growing economy and at peace. With our \nsupport, Pakistan could serve as a model to many of the newly \nindependent, mostly Muslim, countries of west and central Asia. Muslims \ncould begin to see the United States as a willing economic partner in \nthe Islamic world. That has not been the case for far too long.\n  I am encouraged by the recent visit of Secretary Powell. As I read in \nthe newspaper this morning, Secretary Powell and President Musharraf \nhad discussed several items, one of which I noted with interest was \neducational assistance to Pakistan.\n  During a visit to Pakistan, the then-President and Prime Minister and \nthe head of education in Pakistan all met with me to tell me how bad \nthe educational system was in Pakistan. They had all these phantom \nschools where people were being paid but no one was teaching anything. \nThe structure of education had totally broken down in Pakistan.\n  They knew I was on the Education Committee and the appropriations \nsubcommittee for education, that it is a big interest of mine. They \nquite forthrightly asked if we could help them with educational \nassistance in Pakistan. So I came back and had a personal conversation \nwith President Clinton, sort of debriefed him on my trip to Pakistan. I \ntalked to him about this very point.\n  I then called up my good friend Secretary of Education Dick Riley, \nand I talked to him about this. I said: The President is getting ready \nto take a trip to Pakistan and India in a couple of months. I would \nlike to arrange for you, Mr. Secretary, to go with him to meet with \npeople in Pakistan to begin to set up a structure whereby the United \nStates could be involved with Pakistan in helping rearrange, \nrestructure, and help build up their educational system in Pakistan.\n  Everything was a green light. Secretary Riley was going to go with \nthe President. The meetings were going to be set up in Pakistan. I \nthought this was going to signal a whole new era in our relationship \nwith Pakistan. Then we know what happened. India, I thought in a very \nunwise and provocative maneuver, started exploding underground nuclear \nweapons again. In response to that, Pakistan exploded underground \nnuclear weapons. The President's trip was called off. A few months \nlater, there was a military coup in Pakistan, a military government \ntook over. That trip occurred later, but only in its barest form.\n  That was a missed opportunity to establish, again, a new relationship \nwith Pakistan. I am very encouraged that the present Government of \nPakistan under President Musharraf has at least spoken with Secretary \nPowell about educational assistance. I will do whatever I can to help \nthe Secretary of State and President Bush in whatever way to help \nprovide that assistance.\n  For too long, Pakistan has seen us as an ally who was there when it \nwas in our interest and, when it was not in our immediate interest, we \nwere gone. It was sort of, the United States uses us, they abuse us, \nand then they lose us. It is time to change that, and we must change \nthat.\n  It is true that Pakistan over its lifetime has had about half \ndemocratic governments and half military governments. In large part, \nthat is because we have not paid attention, that we have not been as \ninvolved in helping establish and maintain the democratic structures in \nPakistan that are truly responsive to the wishes of the people of \nPakistan. Now is the time to reestablish that.\n  I said there are three principal shared interests: First, supporting \na stable democratic Pakistan with a growing economy and at peace. \nSecond, we share an interest in containing and reversing the nuclear \narms race and missile technology proliferation in South Asia. An arms \nrace may be good business for the arms dealers, but it is bad for the \neconomic and social development of that entire region.\n  Unless and until the issue of Kashmir is settled, or at least until \nwe have such time that Kashmir becomes a negotiating issue between \nPakistan and India, we are going to have trouble in South Asia. It is \ntime for our ally India to recognize that it can no longer ignore this, \nit can no longer take the posture that there is nothing to negotiate, \nand it is time for the United States, I believe, to be involved as an \nhonest broker, as a third party broker in bringing India and Pakistan \ntogether to begin the diplomatic resolution of the conflict in Kashmir. \nI believe now is the time to start that also, and I believe it is in \nall of our best interests to do so.\n  I call upon Pakistan in that vein to use its powers to control any \nand all terrorist type activities that may be happening in Kashmir, to \nuse its armed forces and its police power to keep and prevent any \naltercations that may then provoke India to fire back, as we saw happen \njust the other day. I call upon India to refrain from any military \nactions in Kashmir. There needs to be a hiatus, but there can only be \nthat hiatus if the United States is willing to use its good offices as \nan honest third party broker to step in and help arrange the \nnegotiations between India and Pakistan.\n  Third, we must work together more closely and for as long as it takes \nto reduce the threat of not only the international terrorism of \nPakistan but of international narcotics trafficking, the trafficking in \nwomen, and the use and abuse of child labor.\n  Pakistan has been one of the more forthright of the nations in all of \nSouth Asia in cutting down on the use of child labor. At least the \nPakistan Government in the past admitted there was child labor and that \nthey were willing to do something about it. We\n\n[[Page S10759]]\n\nengaged with them in efforts to cut back on child labor.\n  Pakistan has been forthright in helping to cut down on narcotics \ntrafficking.\n  Pakistan has also been very helpful in trying to cut down on the \ntrafficking in women all over South Asia.\n  These are three things about which Pakistan and the United States \nshare mutual concerns, and we need to work more closely with them on \nthese threats.\n  Madam President, the multifaceted war against terrorism and its \nsponsors is not a war against Islam. We know that. Pakistan was among \nthe very first nations of the world to recognize this critical \ndistinction and to act upon it. This is all the more courageous and \nnoteworthy because obviously the vast majority of Pakistanis are \nMuslims.\n  It is not enough to simply embrace our Muslim friends in Pakistan and \nelsewhere in times of armed conflict, uncertainty, and threats to the \nUnited States. We owe it to them, to ourselves, to a more peaceful \nworld, to commit now to building a much closer, lasting relationship \nwith an ever-expanding circle of Islamic nations based upon mutual \nunderstanding, democratization, more broad-based economic development, \nand shared prosperity.\n  As I have often said since September 11, yes, we have to get these \nterrorists. We have to rip the wires out of their network. We have to \nbring Osama bin Laden and al-Qaida and the other networks to justice. \nWe need to break down the states that sponsor these terrorists. But if \nwe do all of that and we walk away, our children and my grandchildren, \n30, 40 years from now, will be facing the same thing.\n  From Indonesia in the South Pacific, to Morocco, in the east \nAtlantic, stretching across a broad belt of South Asia, southeast Asia, \nsouthwest Asia, and northern Africa, lies the Islamic world--1.5 \nbillion-plus people. It has become clear to me that the United States \nis not fully engaged with the people of the Islamic world. We have only \ndealt with the thin veneer of whatever dictator might be in charge, \nwhatever prince or king, whatever shah at that point in time, and only \nif it serves some short-term best interests of the United States.\n  We have failed to recognize the vast amount of poverty and \nilliteracy, the lack of decent things that make up the basics of life \nsuch as clean water and decent housing, a decent diet. So many of these \npeople who live in the Islamic world from Indonesia to Morocco, so many \nlive without education, without decent nutrition, without decent \nhousing, with no hope.\n  Perhaps out of this dark cloud that has now covered us will come a \nsilver lining, that we will rid the world of organized terrorists, but \nthat we will also recognize we must engage and embrace and be involved \nwith that part of the world that encompasses over 20 percent of the \nworld's population and that we must do it in a way that embraces their \nhopes and desires, their need to have a better share of the world's \nprosperity, their need for economic development, their need to have \nsome hope for their kids and their grandkids for a better life.\n  One image will always stick in my mind. I was in a small town in \nPakistan, right on the border with India. It was a very poor community. \nI remember I met with one of the individuals, a man in charge of some \nof the city planning, who went to Harvard. He was there with almost an \nunimaginable task. We were driving down the street, a little dirt \nstreet, with sewage on both sides of the street. On the side of the \nsidewalks, up on the walk, was something that looked to me like maybe a \nbarber shop. I am not certain what it was. Inside, while sitting in the \ncar, literally 20 feet away, we saw a bunch of men sitting watching a \ncolor television. Obviously, it was the only television for quite a way \naround. They were watching the television, and on the screen was a \nsoccer match being broadcast from England.\n  I marveled at this. I saw these people in a poor community, with \nsewage in the streets, with not much in the way of clean water, a \nterrible educational system, bad housing, and they were watching a \ncolor television of this soccer match in England, with all these people \nwho were dressed up and they were looking at all of the finery coming \nthrough that television. I thought, what are they thinking? They live \nlike this, but they know there is another world that lives a lot \ndifferently.\n  The world has shrunk in my lifetime, and, Madam President, in yours. \nWe live in a world where we have instant communications and CNN. People \nknow what is going on--not like it was when I was a kid. People know, \nthose 1.5 billion Muslims in that part of the world, that, for whatever \nreason, they are not sharing in the world's prosperity. They know their \nkids don't have as much hope and they don't have as much hope for a \nbetter life.\n\n  So maybe out of this dark cloud will come some silver lining that we \nwill engage with this world in a sense of shared prosperity for the \nfuture of our entire globe. I believe much of this will hinge on our \nrelationship with Pakistan. If we are now willing to reengage, to \nsupport a moderate Islamic state that does not shield and harbor \nterrorists but has arrested them and turned them over to us time after \ntime, that has courageously stood up against those terrorists, that is \nsupporting us in every way we could hope right now, that by \nestablishing that relationship with Pakistan and not abandoning \nPakistan once we put an end to the terrorists, I believe we will go a \nlong way toward bringing that silver lining out of this dark cloud, for \nthe entire Islamic world and for all of us.\n  In this spirit, I plan to work with interested colleagues in the \nSenate and the House on both sides of the aisle to establish a \ncongressional caucus on Pakistan and United States-Pakistani relations. \nAfter the terrible attacks of September 11, we must think anew and act \nanew toward the Islamic world. Let's start now by more fully embracing \nour long-time friends and partners in Pakistan. Together, we can build \na foundation of a just and lasting peace, as well as prosecute the war \nagainst the misguided fanatical terrorists who are our common enemy.\n  I hope Senators and House Members will join together in establishing \nthis congressional caucus on Pakistan and United States-Pakistani \nrelations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I enjoyed listening to my friend from \nIowa. I wish him every good wish for this caucus he will be starting. I \nhope to help him with that.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, as I stand here, I have no office in \nthis complex. As we probably all know, about 30 offices had to be \ncleared out to do some precautionary air quality testing in the offices \nthat were connected to the ventilation system in Leader Daschle's \noffice. We know Leader Daschle's office received a letter that \ncontained anthrax. They are taking every precaution.\n  I want my colleagues to know we are all still working, even those who \nmay not have an office at the moment. I thank the Senate staff and my \ncolleagues in the Senate for being so wonderful and offering us their \noffices to use, their phones to use, their faxes, their computers, and \nthe rest. We are fully functional.\n  We have recorded a message for people calling this office. They are \ngiven the number of my Los Angeles office, so we will not leave people \nout there without a voice on the other end of our telephone.\n  I thank my colleagues for their generosity of spirit and for being so \nkind to my staff. I also thank the Capitol Police, the Sergeant at \nArms, and the Capitol physician for acting so swiftly to protect my \nstaff. I am very certain that their steps will prove to be the right \nsteps and that in fact we will have a high level of confidence that we \nare all OK.\n  One of the reasons I think we will be OK is because, as Senator \nDaschle explained, the particular employee in his office handled this \nletter in such a fashion that it was quickly dropped to the floor, and \nwe think, because of that, the effect will be minimal. Of course, we \npray that is the case. I am confident and hopeful that will be the \ncase.\n  The reason I came down to the floor is not only to thank my \ncolleagues for all their help, but also to plead with my Republican \nfriends to let us move on with the business of the day. We are working \nout of makeshift offices, Republican and Democrat Senators alike\n\n[[Page S10760]]\n\nwho were caught in this situation. But we could do a lot more if we \nwere working on the Senate floor with the important foreign operations \nbill that is pending before us.\n  I have listened to colleagues who say, you are holding up judges. I \nhave looked at the record. The fact is, we are moving forward with \njudges. The fact is, when Republicans were in charge, I waited once 4 \nyears--4 years--to get a vote on one wonderful judge who eventually \npassed through the Senate.\n  We are not doing that. Senator Leahy is working to get the paperwork \ndone. He is holding hearings. We have definitely moved much quicker \nthan the Republicans did when Bill Clinton was President, if you \ncompare the time periods.\n  I am perplexed as to why we are having this slowdown. After all, our \nPresident says we are in a war. Certainly, it is a campaign against \nterrorism. This bill is essential.\n  I will spend the next few minutes spelling out what is in this bill \nand why it is so important to move it forward.\n  First of all, the bill invests $42 million to help countries \nstrengthen their borders and secure their weapons facilities. This is \nvery important. What we are talking about is a sum of money that will \nbe given to our coalition partners to make sure that if they have \nweapons, particularly weapons of mass destruction or weapons we do not \nwant to have in the hands of the terrorists, they have the ability to \nsecure these weapons and secure their borders. I would say it is \nelementary that we must take this step. They are helping us. We should \nhelp them make sure that these weapons cannot be stolen by terrorists.\n  I say to my Republican friends, you are holding us up. Why in God's \nname would you hold us up at a time such as this? We should be moving \nquickly to secure those weapons.\n  We have in this bill $175 million in infectious disease surveillance \nprograms that can provide an early warning system against some of the \nworld's deadliest and most contagious diseases. We are making speeches \non the floor about the whole issue of bioterrorism, and here we have a \nbill that provides $175 million in infectious disease surveillance so \nwe can stop these diseases from coming into this country which my \nRepublican friends are holding up.\n  Then in this bill we strengthen the coalition against terrorism by \nproviding $5 billion in military and economic assistance to Egypt, \nIsrael, and Jordan, countries that are critical to long-term peace and \nstability in the Middle East. Why would our Republican friends hold up \nthis money? Why? It doesn't make any sense.\n  It also provides $3.9 billion in military assistance to key NATO \nallies that are putting it on the line for our country right now, and \nto front-line states in the area of the conflict. These states are \nUzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tadzhikistan. These are the countries \nthat are being so cooperative with us. They were formerly in the Soviet \nUnion. They are helping us. They are helping our troops. Why would our \nRepublican friends hold up this money? It does not make any sense.\n\n  Then we hear our President, rightly so, beg the children of this \ncountry--and I want to support him 100 percent--to put $1 in an \nenvelope and send it to the White House. I hope everyone will do it who \nis now listening. Send it to the children of Afghanistan. As he has \nstated eloquently, we are not in a war against the Afghan people. We \nare in a war against terrorism. In this bill we have funds, $255 \nmillion, for refugee assistance to shelter Afghani refugees. That is \n$55 million more than the President requested.\n  In this bill it says:\n\n       The situation in Afghanistan is perhaps the most urgent, \n     the most massive humanitarian crisis anywhere.\n\n  Let me repeat that, the bill--and it is bipartisan, I must say--says:\n\n       The situation in Afghanistan is perhaps the most urgent, \n     the most massive humanitarian crisis anywhere.\n\n  I don't understand. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nholding up this bill which will help the children and the women and the \nfamilies, the innocents in Afghanistan, get on their feet again.\n  Then in this bill we look ahead--and this is again a program where I \nso agree with the Bush administration and with Colin Powell: $337 \nmillion for U.N. voluntary programs, the programs our President \nenvisions will play an essential role in reconstructing Afghanistan \nafter this campaign ends.\n  That is just a part of what is in this bill: Tracking terrorists; \nwarning against infectious diseases; strengthening our coalition \nagainst terrorism; feeding and sheltering the Afghan refugees, helping \nto make Afghanistan whole. That is just a part of the good things in \nthis bill.\n  Let me conclude. We have work to do and we are not doing it. We have \ndone a lot on this floor in a bipartisan way. I thought the airline \nsafety bill was stupendous, where we provided a marshal on every \nflight, where we said strengthen those cockpit doors, where we said \nmake those screeners Federal employees working under law enforcement. \nWe did that in a bipartisan way right here on this floor. I am proud \nthat we did that.\n  Why are we stopping now? I could show you the charts that depict that \nSenator Leahy, since he took over the Judiciary Committee just this \nsummer, has done far more than the Republicans did in that same \ntimeframe when Bill Clinton was President.\n  I am all for getting judges. I am working hard with the \nadministration, in my State, to get good, moderate judges. I will fight \nagainst anyone, right or left, who is a radical. But I will support \nmainstream judges. We are working to do that, and we are bringing those \njudges to the floor of this Senate.\n  To come here and say we are going to waste another day on an issue \nwhere we are doing better on our side than the Republicans did when the \nshoe was on the other foot seems to me to be bizarre. It is bizarre. We \nare in a crisis, an international crisis, and we are not doing our \nwork.\n  Look at this floor. There is no one here but my good friend from \nVirginia. I love to see him. We work together on so many things. We are \nworking together on a bill that I think will pass which deals with \ntravel and tourism, to set up a promotion agency within the Department \nof Commerce so we can go on the air and tell people to rediscover \nAmerica. If they do not feel comfortable traveling to far away places, \ntravel in America.\n  We have work to do. My colleague in the chair has an incredible \nprogram she is working on to honor the victims of 9-11. What are we \ndoing today? Nothing. People are sitting around here doing nothing but \nmaking speeches. The point of this speech is to get us off the dime, to \nget working.\n  I want to work on this bill. I want to protect the people I represent \nand all Americans from ever having to face another crisis such as we \ndid on 9-11 and another crisis such as what we are facing almost on a \ndaily basis now from the anthrax situation.\n  In closing, I want to tell people to put this in perspective. We have \nways to treat this. If you are exposed to it and you go on antibiotics, \nyou are going to be fine. We are going to deal with this. We are going \nto wrap our arms around it. But for goodness sake, let's work on the \nforeign operations bill.\n  You wouldn't think we even had a problem, the way my Republican \nfriends are acting--as if we can dillydally around until tomorrow and \nthe day after to get money to fight terrorism. I am very upset about \nit. I don't mean to sound frightened. If I have, I apologize. But I \nbelieve it is very important that we do our work. After all, that is \nwhy our people sent us here.\n  Thank you, very much. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Madam President, I will speak briefly because we have a \nmeeting shortly. Our time on the Republican side is to be protected \nbetween 4 and 5 for a meeting on the economic stimulus package.\n  I listened to my friend from California, Senator Boxer, speak on the \nforeign operations bill. That bill will be passed. I think it is an \nimportant bill. I have enjoyed working with Senator Boxer on her \ntourism promotion, which I think is very important for our economy. I \nhave enjoyed working with the Presiding Officer in allowing people all \nacross this country to show their\n\n[[Page S10761]]\n\ncare in their communities for the 6,000-plus people who lost their \nlives. There are going to be a lot of park projects, mentoring, \nrecreational facilities, maybe computer laboratories, maybe homes for \nadults, and senior citizen programs across the country named for each \nand every one of the fallen victims of these violent acts of terrorism \non our office buildings in our airplanes on September 11.\n  I look forward to working with you. All of that is going to be done \nin less than a year. That will be a fitting memorial so we will \nremember those who lost their lives.\n  The people taken from us by those terrorist attacks were good people. \nThey were our sons and daughters, mothers and fathers, grandparents, \ngrandchildren, our friends, our neighbors, and our loved ones. They \nshould be remembered.\n  The foreign operations bill, while it is an important bill--and it \nwill be passed--also is important in the administration of justice. We \nhave a crisis in the administration of justice.\n  Obviously, we have a crisis mentality so far as terrorism is \nconcerned, as well as prosecuting the war on terrorism on the home \nfront where we need to have our first responders better equipped. Our \nsurveillance needs to be improved. In situations where there may be an \nanthrax scare, it needs to be properly identified and remedied. If it \nisn't anthrax, we need to make sure people are not panicked.\n  I believe very strongly that those front-line people, the fire, \nrescue, and police officers who are working in the terrorist attack \nzone, ought to be accorded the same sort of tax policy treatment \naccorded to our military personnel.\n  Under current Federal law--it is very good law--if our military men \nand women in uniform have to serve in a combat zone, their income taxes \nfor that month are not paid because they are in a combat zone.\n  This war on terrorism has changed the face of war. Now the terrorism \nwar is not taken to military facilities but is taken to office \nbuildings, to airplanes, to civilians, and to commercial airlines. We \nhave seen that--whether it was an attack on the World Trade Center \nbuildings or whether at the Pentagon or obviously the innocent people \nwho were on the airplanes that were hijacked and turned into weapons. \nWith that, we see that innocent, unprotected men, women, and children \nare now the targets and the victims of terrorist attacks.\n  My view is that the firefighters, the rescue squad people, the heroic \npolice officers, whether in New York City or at the Pentagon, are \nworking in a combat zone. But it is called a terrorist attack zone. The \nPresident has so designated these areas. It would seem to me that these \nwarriors and these patriots here at home in their heroic acts of \nworking in these buildings and in these facilities--some of them with \ntheir last breath of life to get people out, to save lives, and also in \nthe aftermath of pulling rubble out with their hands, breathing toxic \nair in the crumbling buildings--those individuals are also in a combat \nzone. It is a terrorist attack zone.\n\n  It seems to me very logical and appropriate to adapt our tax laws so \nthey do not have to pay income taxes for the month in which they are \nworking in these combat zone areas, or terrorist attack zones.\n  I have legislation in that regard. Hopefully, we will pass that, as \nwell as legislation to say to the family members of those who have lost \ntheir lives that they will not have to worry about paying taxes.\n  Again, using the analogy for those who serve in our military, if a \nman or woman in our Armed Forces is killed in combat, they are not \nsubject to income taxes, and half of their estate taxes are forgiven. \nAgain, the targets of these terrorist attacks were men, women, \nchildren, and families. It seems to me we should accord them the same \nsort of tax treatment.\n  I have put in a bill, for which I have support from a good number of \nSenators, to say to those victims' survivors that they will not have to \npay income taxes for the loss of their husband, wife, or other family \nmember, and they will not have to be worrying about death or \ninheritance taxes. I think that is an appropriate and logical \nadaptation of law in that regard.\n  So far as justice and the judicial system are concerned, there are \ncurrently 106 vacancies in the Federal courts, 31 at the circuit court \nand 75 at the district court level, which is higher--it is almost 50 \npercent higher than the vacancy rate 2 years ago when many Democratic \nSenators, including the current chairman, Senator Leahy, complained \nabout a vacancy crisis. That is when there was a 50-percent vacancy \nrate. Forty-one of those vacancies have been formally classified as \njudicial emergencies by the nonpartisan Judicial Conference of the \nUnited States. This is the highest vacancy rate since 1994.\n  Despite the high level of vacancies and the record pace of \nnominations, the judiciary has actually shrunk during the months since \nPresident Bush took office. In other words, the number of vacancies has \nincreased, and the Federal Government has moved backwards in its effort \nto bring the judiciary up to full strength.\n  During the first year of the Clinton administration, just to give you \na sense of the pace of court nominees, there were nominees for the \ncourt of appeals. Of those nominees, 60 percent of President Clinton's \ncourt of appeals nominees were reported in the first year. In contrast, \nPresident Bush has nominated 25 circuit court nominees and the \ncommittee has reported 4. That is just 16 percent. One of those was \nRoger Gregory of Virginia--a very good move. I am glad the committee \nreported Roger Gregory. But 16 percent is just not good enough.\n  There are those who will say, gosh, this is the same as it has always \nbeen. Let's look at first-year comparisons of former Presidents.\n  President Clinton nominated 32 judges by October 31 of his first year \nin office. Of those, 28--or 88 percent--were confirmed by the time \nCongress went out of session in 1993.\n  Further, President George Herbert Walker Bush nominated 18 judges by \nOctober 31, 1989, of which 16--or 89 percent--were confirmed by the \ntime Congress recessed by the end of the year.\n  President Reagan's confirmation rate for pre-October 31 nominees \nconfirmed during his first year was 100 percent.\n  Now President George W. Bush has nominated 60 judges, and the Senate \nhas confirmed only 8, a mere 13 percent. So that is the actual \ncomparison.\n\n  Currently, there are 108 empty seats in the Federal judiciary, which \nis about 12.6 percent of the total number of judgeships. This is the \nhighest in modern history, except for the extraordinary event in \nDecember of 1990 when Congress created 85 new positions and, therefore, \nthere were 85 vacancies all at once.\n  I believe we can do better. I think these nominations ought to be \nacted on before we recess for the year, which will be the end of the \nPresident's first year in office. I think all of the President's \nnominations that were made prior to August certainly should be acted \nupon.\n  Again, if you look at the history of the Senate, by the end of the \nPresident's first year in office, the Senate has acted on all judicial \nnominations made prior to the August recess; the only exception being \none Clinton nominee the Senate acted on in the following year.\n  If we are going to work with the President to reach his goal to \naddress the current judicial vacancy crisis, then the Senate should \nconfirm at least 40 more judges by the end of this session.\n  I do not think this is too hard to do. It can be done if we work our \nwill. I ask the chairman of the Judiciary Committee to hold these \nhearings. These individuals ought to be vetted, ought to be cross-\nexamined. Look at their record, their judicial philosophy, their \ndemeanor, especially if they are district court judges.\n  I think if they look at the competence, the qualities, and the \ncharacteristics of these judges, they will certainly find them to be \nindividuals who ought to be on the bench administering justice.\n  Clearly, we have a judicial crisis. These vacancies should not \ncontinue. We need to act in the Senate, not just do one thing at a \ntime. Let's keep moving forward to make sure that, yes, we support our \nmilitary, support our intelligence efforts, our diplomatic efforts in \nforeign operations, making sure we are properly reacting and \nstimulating\n\n[[Page S10762]]\n\nour economy to get people back to work, making sure consumers have \ngreater confidence and have the capability to then buy things so those \nwho manufacture or produce various goods or services can start hiring \nagain and get our economy moving again--but also we need to make sure \nthe third branch of Government, the judicial branch, is at full \nstrength, which it certainly is not with the 12.6-percent vacancy rate, \nwhich is an unprecedented high rate, again, as observed by those who \nsee this as a crisis.\n  We need to get to work in the Senate. I hope once we get a commitment \nto move forward, that we then, obviously, can move forward on the \nforeign operations bill, which is also a very important measure. But \nlet's get our judicial branch of Government up to full strength. That \nis our duty and responsibility as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield back my time and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I know there has been debate \nintermittently as we have discussed other issues about the appointment \nof judges, and the pace and the speed. Frankly, I sort of regret the \ndebate in a certain sense because we have been working together very \nwell as a body since September 11. The times call for bipartisanship. \nAnd this is an issue that is naturally a partisan issue.\n  Some of the talk I have heard that the nomination of judges will be \ntied to bringing appropriations bills forward is not what we need at \nthis time. But, nonetheless, it is proceeding.\n  As a member of the Judiciary Committee who has sort of been quite \nsurprised that some of my good friends on the other side of the aisle--\nthey are indeed friends--would make this an issue right now, I thought \nI ought to try to answer it in as objective way as I could because as \nsomeone who serves on the Judiciary Committee, I have seen the speed \nwith which we approved judges during the first 6 months, and the speed \nwith which we have approved judges since Senator Leahy became chairman \nof the committee.\n  By any measure and by any objective standard, we have done a lot more \nsince Pat Leahy became chairman than we did before that time.\n  To say we are slowing down the selection of judges is nonsensical to \nanyone. I would bet my bottom dollar that if we had 100 observers of \nthe Judiciary Committee from a foreign planet, and they looked at the \nspeed, both pre-Leahy and post-Leahy, all 100 of them would say the \nspeed picked up when Pat Leahy became chairman.\n  One wonders what the other side is trying to do. Are they trying to \nintimidate us into rushing judges we might want to dispute? Maybe. I \nhope not. They will not. I am not going to allow somebody I believe is \nnot qualified for the bench to get on the bench because it is tied to \nsomething else or because the times ask for bipartisanship. We are not \nthe ones who are making this matter an issue. But let me go into some \nof the details.\n  The bottom line is very simple. We now have real work to do in this \nChamber. This Judiciary Committee has worked long and hard on an \nantiterrorism bill. We are trying to appropriate money for foreign \noperations. More is needed now than ever before. We have not finished \nthe business of improving airline security. We are just beginning the \nbusiness of improving rail security. We are trying to finalize and \nexamine how we ought to change our immigration laws. We have anthrax in \nour office buildings. We are facing threats we have never had to deal \nwith before.\n  Should we be filling the bench? Yes. Is that the No. 1 priority since \nSeptember 11? Absolutely not. It is certainly not called for to tie \nappropriations bills or a foreign operations bill to the movement of \njudges. That is not marching to our higher instincts. That is not \nsomething the American public, looking on the Chamber, would say is the \nright thing to do at this time. It is not what they want.\n  It is with regret that some of us have to come to the floor and \ndefend Chairman Leahy. We shouldn't even have to do it. But when the \nSenator from Kentucky comes down and brings a chart that says let's \nlook at the number of nominees considered for hearing, I guess we have \nto answer.\n  Again, some of the arguments are on the verge of the ridiculous. They \nsay: Let's look at the number of judges per hearing. That is not the \nstandard. That is not the standard you folks want. If we had one \nhearing with six judges as opposed to five hearings for four judges, \nyou wouldn't be happy.\n\n  I was going to say to my colleague from Kentucky, but I couldn't get \nthe floor, that it is sort of like saying how many chairs there are in \nthe hearing room. We have more chairs in the hearing room than you do. \nSo? The standard is the number of judges approved.\n  Let's set the record straight.\n  First, Ranking Member Leahy became chairman on July 10. That is when \nthe full committee was reconstituted. So he has been here over 3 \nmonths, including, of course, the August recess. In effect, he has been \nhere through two working months. Yet he is ahead of the pace set by \nCongress in the first year of the first Bush administration and the \nfirst year of the first Clinton administration.\n  If there is anything at variance, you would have thought that the \nDemocrat President and the Democrat Congress, which existed in 1993, \nwould have wanted to rush through judges. Yet more judges passed this \nyear.\n  If you extrapolate Chairman Leahy's numbers over a full year--in \nother words, if the pace continues at the pace we have been proceeding \nthus far--then he is ahead of the pace set by the Republican-controlled \nCongress for the past 6 years.\n  If anyone doubts his devotion, he was here in August when most of us \nwere traveling around our districts and going on vacation, and whatever \nelse people do during August recess. I do some of each. But he was here \nholding hearings.\n  Since September 11, of course, we have been focused on the tragedies \nof that day and the new challenges that face our great country. \nNonetheless, despite that, two more confirmation hearings have been \nheld by Chairman Leahy. The third is coming on Thursday. I am supposed \nto chair it. I have lots of other things to do, given the state of my \nState and the state of the city, both of which I love. But we are \nsitting and holding hearings. It is unfair at best and not nice to say \nwe are not working hard on it when we have so many other challenges.\n  My good friend, Orrin Hatch, with whom I work on so many issues, has \nargued that his numbers were what they were because there were not \nenough nominees to confirm. There are some folks out there who disagree \nwith that.\n  Here are the names of nominees who were never confirmed:\n  Judith McConnell from California; John Snodgrass from Alabama; Bruce \nGreer from Florida; James Beaty from North Carolina; Jimmy Klein from \nWashington, DC--I went to college with him--Legrome Davis from \nPennsylvania; and Helene White from Ohio.\n  Those are just a few of the 57 nominees from all over the country who \nnever--underline ``never''--got a hearing from the Republican Judiciary \nCommittee. Those 57 would be shocked to hear Republican Senators taking \nto the floor and claiming they had no one to confirm. They are not a \n``nobody,'' as somebody once said. That doesn't even begin to address \nthe people who got hearings but had to wait and wait and wait.\n  The average time of a circuit court nominee from the 105th and 106th \nCongresses awaiting confirmation under the Judiciary Committee chaired \nby my friend, Orrin Hatch, was 343 days. President Bush had not even \nbeen in office that long. Some took much longer. We know the reasons. \nRichard Paez took 1,520 days. Willie Fletcher waited 1,321 days. Hilda \nTagle took 943 days. Susan Mollway took 914 days. Ann Aiken waited 791 \ndays. Timothy Dyk took 785 days.\n  The list goes on and on. It sounds almost like the Bible. So and so \nlived 800 years, and begat so and so. The list goes on and on. We are a \nlong way from seeing that under Chairman Leahy. I don't think we ever \nwill.\n  I believe there are three criteria for confirming judges. As I played \na role,\n\n[[Page S10763]]\n\nas we all do, in selection of judges in my State, I have had three \nwords that sort of guide me. They are excellence, moderation, and \ndiversity.\n  By excellence, I mean legal excellence, among the best the bar has to \noffer. Being an article 3 judge, a lifetime judge, is such an important \nposition. I believe that is important.\n  Moderate: I do not like ideologues on the bench. I do not like judges \ntoo far to the right; I do not like judges too far to the left. I want \njudges who will have moderate approaches to the law.\n  The third criteria is diversity. To me, that means we should not have \nall white males on the bench; we ought to make an effort for diversity \nin terms of race and gender but also ideology. I think a bench that had \nnine liberal Democrats would be just as bad as a bench that had nine \nconservative Republicans. You need some diversity of opinion. \nObviously, depending on who is the President or who is in the Congress, \nthere will be a tilt toward one direction or the other, but there ought \nto be some balance. Balance, to me, is the key word, as it is on so \nmany issues these days.\n  While we move on judges, we are not going to be pressured to move too \nrapidly. We need time--and a reasonable amount of time--to examine \nthese judges' backgrounds and their opinions before we give them \nlifetime seats on the Federal bench.\n  We are going to keep holding hearings for those nominees on whom we \nhave done background research. We are going to keep confirming judges \nwho merit confirmation. And we are going to do it at a pace that will \nexceed that done by my Republican friends across the aisle. Those are \nfair and reasonable commitments to this body. It is a fair commitment \nto the White House. It is a fair commitment to the American people.\n  With those commitments we should return to the real and pressing \nbusiness that awaits us. We should not be having just cloture votes at \nthis crucial time. That is so wrong, so, so wrong.\n  If you ask the American people, what are the top 5 issues, what are \nthe top 10 issues, what are the top 50 issues, I do not think they \nwould say the confirmation of judges is in that top 50. Yet we are \nslowing down important and vital legislation. Some people can make that \nlink; it is wrong.\n  So I say to my colleagues--I almost plead to them--America is at war, \nand you are bickering about judges. We need to get our eye back on the \nball.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the leadership of Senator \nSchumer on the Court Subcommittee. I know he is a good lawyer, and he \ncares about the court system. We have had some very interesting \nhearings under his leadership. They do, however, reflect an idea that \nwas openly stated at a Democratic retreat early this year, that the \nground rules for confirming judges to the courts should be changed. \nApparently, at that retreat, a brilliant but liberal law professor, \nLaurence Tribe, and Cass Sunstein, and Marcia Greenberger advised the \nDemocratic Senators that they should ``change the ground rules''--that \nis a quote from the New York Times--used in the confirmation process \nand make it more difficult to confirm judges.\n  That is after the Senate gave President Clinton a fair hearing on his \njudges. This is important to note: In the 8 years that President \nClinton was in office, he had confirmed 377 Federal judges. He only had \none of his nominees voted down.\n  According to my numbers, there were 41 nominees pending that did not \nget confirmed before he left office. That is a traditional number. \nThere were 67 vacancies, but there were 41 nominees; he did not have \nnominees for the difference.\n  So under Senator Hatch's leadership, when the Republicans had the \nmajority in the committee, the Clinton nominees were scrutinized, they \nwere examined, and, for the most part, they got through.\n  Last fall, at the time we left--and in the last months of the Clinton \nadministration--we constantly heard a drumbeat of complaints that the \n60-or-so vacancy level that was pending out there in the courts was \njeopardizing justice in America. The truth is, you are going to have \naround 60 vacancies at all times.\n  It takes a while for the President to decide who to nominate. There \nhas to be an FBI background check. They have to get the nominees to \nfill out all kinds of questionnaires to make sure there is not \nsomething bad in their record. As I say, the FBI does a background \ncheck. The ABA does a background check. The nominees are sent over here \nto the Judiciary Committee and are given a big questionnaire, which \nthey have to fill out.\n  Historically, we have seldom been below having 60 vacancies for \njudges. Now we are at about 110. And the very people who were on this \nfloor last year, screaming mightily that 60, 67 was an outrage, are now \nsuggesting they have no problem with 110.\n  In my district, the southern district of Alabama, we have a three-\ncourt district where I was a U.S. Attorney for 12 years. I practiced \nthere before Federal judges. Really, it was for 15 years as an \nAssistant U.S. Attorney and a U.S. Attorney before Federal judges. They \nhave a three-judge court. They only have one judge. There are two \nvacancies there.\n  So we have some problems around the country that need to be dealt \nwith. Here we are, and we are asked: What can you do about it? On the \nJudiciary Committee, President Bush's party, the Republican party, does \nnot have a majority, so it cannot call hearings. It cannot force \nhearings. It cannot force votes. We are at the pleasure of the chairman \nand the majority.\n  What we have seen is a systematic slowdown, consistent with the \npublic statements that have been made previously of what they were \ngoing to do. That is beginning to put a crunch on the judiciary and \nreally hurt justice in America. It is legitimate and proper that this \nmatter be raised here in this Senate Chamber.\n  Some say: Well, don't play politics with the foreign operations bill. \nYou are playing politics with that.\n  Let me just say it this way: Let's have a fair movement of President \nBush's qualified judges. Let's see them move forward at a fair rate.\n  They say: Well, you cannot complain about that. You cannot do \nanything about it. You cannot utilize any of the rules that are \navailable to you Republicans because if you do, you are partisan. But \nwe can sit on judges. We can delay hearings in the judiciary. And we \ncan delay confirmations, but that is not partisan.\n  We are getting close to the end of this session, and we are way \nbehind where we need to be. Nobody, in my view, can dispute that. \nNobody can dispute we have a growing vacancy problem in the courts. It \nis time for us to confront it.\n  We have written letters to the chairman. We have talked to the \nmajority leader. We have asked and asked for their help, and we are not \ngetting it. So I do not think it is fair to say, those who have asked \nrespectfully and urged movement of the judges in a fair and legitimate \nway, that we ought to be accused of being partisan.\n  By the way, the foreign operations funding is operating under a \ncontinuing resolution. We are not shutting off funding for that. But \nwhat we are saying is that this is serious business. Moving judges is \nserious business. We want your attention, majority in the Senate, slim \nthough it may be. We want your attention. We want your focus on judges. \nIt is important to America. And we have a legitimate concern in that \nregard; and we are asking for that.\n  Just a year ago, the then-minority leader, Tom Daschle, in July made \na statement about moving the intelligence authorization bill. In recent \nweeks we have learned about how important the intelligence community \nis. The intelligence bill was on the floor, and in a nice way that the \nthen-minority leader had to express himself; this is what he said:\n\n       I also hope we can address the additional appropriations \n     bills. There is no reason we can't. We can find a compromise \n     if there is a will, and I am sure there is. But we also want \n     to see the list of what we expect will probably be the final \n     list of judicial nominees to be considered for hearings in \n     the Judiciary Committee this year. I am anxious to talk with \n     him [Trent Lott, the then-majority leader] and work with him \n     on that issue. All of this is interrelated, as he said, and \n     because of that, we take it slowly.\n\n  In other words, that was a nice way of saying, from Mr. Daschle, that \nthey were not going to move the intelligence authorization. He was not\n\n[[Page S10764]]\n\ngoing to move that legislation until he got a commitment from the \nmajority leader on judges. He wanted to know how many were going to be \nconfirmed before the session ended.\n  Sometimes those things occur. The minority in the Senate has the \npower to block consideration of bills. That is what he was doing at \nthat time. That is basically what we are saying today. We are going to \nstop this legislation until we get some sort of good-faith commitment \nto move judges forward at this point in time.\n  They say we didn't have any nominees in the first 6 months. The \nPresident of the United States has a lot to do in the first 6 months. \nHe has to fill his Cabinet, his subcabinet, organize his government, \nworking night and day, and submit judges. By May, President Bush had \nsubmitted a stellar list of judges, including at least three Democrats. \nWhat has happened on that?\n  Three Democrats have had hearings and been confirmed. They found time \nfor those. Seven out of the 18 have had hearings. They were nominated \nin May. Their backgrounds are sterling. It was a bipartisan blue ribbon \ngroup of nominees.\n  The President reached out. He nominated one nominee that had been \nblocked by the Senate and had been held up. He renominated one of \nPresident Clinton's nominees as an act of good faith, to reach out. So \nwhat has happened? We have had confirmation of the three Democrats. We \nhave had hearings on 7, and 11 of those nominated back in May have not \neven had a hearing. That is beyond the pale. That is unjustified.\n  Since then, additional nominees have come forward for which there is \nno objection. Many of those nominees have been blessed already by the \nhome State Democratic Senator. Many of them, the Republican Senators \nhave all signed off on. They are ready to go, many of them, with no \nobjection whatsoever. Their background checks are clean, and they are \nready to go forward.\n  We just need to have a hearing. We can't move a judge under our rules \nuntil the judge has been given a hearing. Any Senator has the right to \nask them questions. I don't think this Senate should be a rubber stamp. \nThey ought to be able to ask questions and examine their backgrounds \nand records. If they are not comfortable with it, vote no. But \nPresident Bush has given us a group of nominees that are mainstream \nsuperior judges and will do a great job on the bench. He is entitled to \nthe same support and movement of his judges as President Clinton \nreceived.\n  They say we have a lot to do. We should not worry about judges and \njust pass the appropriations bill for foreign operations. We are just \ntoo busy to do this.\n  We have a chart that shows how many judges have been put up per \nhearing before the Judiciary Committee. This chart is revealing. In \n1998, judicial nominees per hearing averaged 4.2; in 1999, 4.2; in \n2000, 4.2. That is 4.2 judges up each time we had a hearing. In 2001, \nthat number has dropped. There has been some dispute about it, but \nthere is no dispute that it is half what it was before.\n  One of the things happening is, when we have a hearing, we are not \nputting as many judges on the panel. We can do three, four, five, six \nat one time, if we want to. We can all be able to ask them questions if \nwe want to. But if you hold the number of judges per hearing down, you \nare not moving many judges forward. That is a critical event that has \ngotten us as far behind in the scale as we are today.\n  Again, I know a lot has happened this year. Perhaps there is some \nbasis for the complaint, the excuse, or the reason we have not moved \nforward is that a lot of things have happened. But if we were just to \nget our hearings moving, we would not be in this crisis. We have been \nwarning on our side that this was happening. We have been asking in a \nrespectful way and received little or no attention to the matter.\n  I believe our complaint is legitimate. I believe it is our duty to \nask the majority leader and the chairman of the judiciary to reevaluate \nwhat they are doing, to sit down and plan some hearings for these \njudges and give us a commitment that they are going to move forward. If \nwe don't, we will end up when we recess--and maybe we will recess \nearlier than normal this year; many hope so--without moving anything \nlike the number of judges that we should.\n  It has been stated that a substantial portion of the judicial \nnominees pending in committee do not have all their paperwork \ncompleted. However, almost 30 have everything in, including their ABA \nrating, and there is no reason for us not to move on those.\n  We have at least 30 that have every bit of their paperwork done. We \nhaven't been moving those. The President made 18 nominations in May; 11 \nof them that have not even had a hearing and their paperwork is in. Why \nis it that we are not able to move effectively?\n  Unfortunately, it appears to be consistent with what we learned in \nthe New York Times article. At the Democratic retreat they had a \nmeeting to plan to change the ground rules for confirmation of judges; \nin effect, to slow the process down, let the vacancies grow, even \nthough last year they were saying just the opposite.\n  I will share with you some of the comments we had last year. When \nthere were 76 vacancies--now we have 108, 109--when there were 76 \nvacancies, the now majority leader stated:\n\n       The failure to fill these vacancies is straining our \n     Federal court system and delaying justice for all people \n     across this country.\n\n  That was last year when we had 76 vacancies. Just 2 years ago, when \nthe vacancies numbered in the sixties, Senator Leahy, then ranking \nmember, now chairman of Judiciary said:\n\n       We must redouble our effort to work with the President to \n     end the longstanding vacancies that plague the Federal courts \n     and disadvantage all Americans. That is our constitutional \n     responsibility.\n\n  Well, the Senate's pace in moving nominations this year is far behind \nthe pace during the first years of both Reagan and Bush 1 and the \nClinton administrations. For example, in the first year of President \nReagan's administration, there were 40 confirmations to the Federal \nbench. Under former President Bush's administration, there were 15 \nconfirmations. Under President Clinton's administration, the first \nyear, 28 confirmations. At this point, we have confirmed eight, and we \nhave maybe a month left in this session. At the rate we are going, we \nare not going to get close to what was a national average of the last \nthree administrations of 28 judges in the first year.\n  In fact, with regard to the nomination process, in the first year of \neach of those Presidents' administrations, every person who was \nnominated before the August recess was confirmed that first year, \nexcept one.\n  This is a chart that demonstrates that quite clearly. During the \nReagan administration, all of his nominees who were sent to the Senate \nbefore the August recess--they gave us a whole month to work on the \npaperwork and review it--every one was confirmed. Under former \nPresident Bush, the same occurred. Every nominee he sent forward to \nthis Senate before the August recess was confirmed. Under President \nClinton, 93 percent of his were confirmed who were submitted before the \nAugust recess. Only one of his was not confirmed. Under the now-\nPresident Bush, only 18 percent of his have been confirmed to date.\n  So we are just heading on a collision course to a situation that is \ngoing to leave the courts shorthanded. If we don't recognize it, we are \nacquiescing in what could be a deliberate plan to slow down the \nconfirmation of judges, even though last year--less than a year ago--\nthe people who are involved in that now were decrying that as \nunacceptable; it was unacceptable to keep the confirmations low.\n  One more time, let's review these numbers because I don't think \nanyone should think that the reason we are here is light or \ninsignificant. The reason we are here talking about these issues is \nthat they are important.\n  In the 103rd Congress, under President Clinton--and he had a \nDemocratic majority in the Judiciary Committee--there were 63 vacancies \nthere. In the 104th Congress, 2 years later, at the end of President \nClinton's first term there were 65 vacancies. In the 105th Congress, \nwith Chairman Orrin Hatch's leadership there were 50 vacancies. Senator \nHatch had reduced vacancies to 50. In the 106th Congress, the last \nyears of President Clinton's term, the\n\n[[Page S10765]]\n\nvacancies were 67, which is, as you can see, pretty mainstream. But now \nwe have 110 vacancies without an extraordinary game plan in the \nJudiciary Committee to have hearings and move judges forward. At the \nrate we are going, the resignations are going to exceed the nominations \nand confirmations. That is not a healthy thing for our judiciary.\n  Mr. President, I feel strongly about the issue. I know there are \npressures on all of us. We have groups out there that used to try to \npressure Chairman Hatch and tell him how to run the Judiciary \nCommittee. He took the view that: If you want to get elected to the \nSenate, you can run the committee; otherwise, I am going to give \nhearings a fair shot and do what I think is right and move nominees.\n  I know pressure is out there. I think it is time for us to get \nserious on this matter, to move nominees forward, give President Bush's \nnominees a fair chance to be confirmed, to reduce this extraordinary \nbacklog of vacancies that are out there --to have hearings on those 11 \njudges who were nominated in May because they have not even had a \nhearing yet--and get busy with filling our responsibility to advise and \nconsent or reject President Bush's nominees.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, one year ago today, America awoke to the \nterrible news that we had lost three extraordinary public servants: \nGovernor Mel Carnahan, his son Roger, and their friend and aide Chris \nSifford.\n  Mel Carnahan was a remarkable man--the kind whose work proved that \npolitics and public service can indeed be a noble profession.\n  Like another man from Missouri, Harry Truman, Mel Carnahan was a man \nof plain speech and enormous political courage.\n  Throughout his career, he worked to help people, to make government \nefficient, and to use the tools at his disposal to make a difference in \npeople's lives.\n  Whether it was improving public schools, expanding health insurance \nfor children, protecting seniors through stricter safety standards for \nnursing homes, or making communities safer--Mel Carnahan never stopped \nworking to make a difference.\n  I have no doubt that he would have been a great Senator, just as he \nwas a great Governor. Sadly, he never got the change to show us that--\nat least, not directly.\n  But his spirit does live on in this Senate. As Jean Carnahan has said \nso many times:\n\n       Hopes and dreams don't die with people, they live on in all \n     the people we touch.\n\n  Today, Mel Carnahan's hopes and dreams live on through all those he \ntouched. But they have their most powerful voice in his wife of 45 \nyears, Jean Carnahan.\n  It was one year ago that she pledged to keep the fire burning. And \nevery day since--that is exactly what Senator Carnahan has done.\n  In her tireless work to see that the economic victims of September 11 \nget health care, unemployment benefits, and job training--we feel Mel's \nsense of justice and compassion. In her work to improve our nation's \nschools--we see Mel's commitment to the children of Missouri, and \nAmerica. And when Senator Carnahan comes to the Senate floor, and \ncommands here colleagues' attention with her clear and thoughtful \narguments--we hear the echoes of Mel's plainspoken sensibility.\n  One year after that cruel October morning, Jean Carnahan has become \nthe great Senator that Mel Carnahan would have been had he been given \nthe chance. That is one blessing that makes his loss more bearable.\n  The poet Longfellow wrote:\n\n     When a great man dies,\n     for years beyond our ken,\n     the light he leaves behind him lies\n     upon the paths of men.\n\n  During his life, Mel Carnahan cast a bright and shining light on his \nstate and our nation. His death did not extinguish that light.\n  That light continues to shine in the remarkable work and the \nindomitable spirit of his partner and our colleague, Senator Jean \nCarnahan.\n  Today, especially today we thank her for her courage and for our \ninspiration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/16/senate-section/article/S10765-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10765-S10766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JUDICIAL CONFIRMATIONS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my concern over \nthe slow pace of judicial confirmations in the Senate.\n  The Bush administration deserves to be treated as fairly by the \nDemocrat majority as the Republican majority treated the Clinton \nadministration. Thus far, the facts show that the pace of confirmations \nis extremely slow and the number of vacancies is extremely high.\n  The Senate has confirmed only 8 judges so far this year, compared to \n60 who have been nominated. During the Clinton administration, the \nSenate confirmed an average of 47 judges per year. In the first year of \nthe Clinton administration, the Senate confirmed 28 judges, which is \nabout average when compared to the first year for Reagan and Bush I. In \nthe final year of the Clinton administration, we confirmed 39.\n  Given these numbers, it should not be surprising that the number of \nvacancies is much higher today than at the end of the Clinton \nadministration. As of today, there are 109 vacancies for a vacancy rate \nof 12.7 percent, while at the end of the Clinton administration last \nyear, there were only 67 vacancies for a 7.9 percent vacancy rate.\n  The Senate confirmed almost the same number of judges for President \nClinton as for President Reagan, 377 compared to 384. This is true even \nthough Republicans controlled the Senate for six years of Clinton and \nsix years of Reagan. In fact, while I was Chairman for the first six \nyears of the Reagan administration, I made confirmations arguably my \ntop priority. Yet, the numbers are comparable.\n  The Democrat majority often notes that it has confirmed more circuit \njudges this year than the Senate did for the first year of the Clinton \nadministration. While this is true, President Clinton nominated only \nfive circuit judges in his first year in office, compared to 21 for \nPresident Bush so far this year. Also, in the first year of Clinton, \nthe Democrats were in charge at the time. Last year, while Republicans \nwere in control and it was an election year, the Senate still confirmed \n8 circuit judges, double the number we have confirmed so far this year.\n  Under any reasonable evaluation, the numbers show that we are far \nbehind this year. However, there is still time to act this session, and \nmake the numbers fair with former Presidents.\n  In the first year of each of the past three administrations, all \njudges nominated before the end of the August recess were confirmed \nthat year. The only exception is one judge during the first year of the \nClinton administration who received a negative American Bar Association \nrating, and even he was confirmed the next year. President Bush \nnominated 44 judges before the end of August, and to be consistent we \nshould confirm these judges before we adjourn this year.\n  One pending circuit court nominee is Judge Dennis Shedd, who was \namong President Bush's first set of nominees sent to the Senate on May \n9. He has been a very able district court judge for the past decade and \nwas formerly the chief counsel and staff director of the Judiciary \nCommittee. He has bipartisan support. Also, the position for which he \nhas been nominated has been declared a judicial emergency by the \nAdministrative Office of the Courts. In addition, the committee held a \nhearing in August on the nomination of Terry Wooten for the District \nCourt in South Carolina. I sincerely hope both of these fine judicial \ncandidates can be confirmed this year.\n  In summary, I hope the Senate can act this year on many pending \njudicial nominees, and greatly reduce the extremely high vacancy rate \nthat currently faces our Federal courts.\n\n[[Page S10766]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/16/senate-section/article/S10765-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10765-S10766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JUDICIAL CONFIRMATIONS\n\n  Mr. THURMOND.

In addition, the committee held a \nhearing in August on the nomination of Terry Wooten for the District \nCourt in South Carolina. I sincerely hope both of these fine judicial \ncandidates can be confirmed this year.\n  In summary, I hope the Senate can act this year on many pending \njudicial nominees, and greatly reduce the extremely high vacancy rate \nthat currently faces our Federal courts.\n\n[[Page S10766]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/16/senate-section/article/S10766-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n       COMMENDING MR.ISAAC HOOPII FOR HIS ACTIONS AT THE PENTAGON\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on September 11, 2001, out of the rubble \nof destruction, countless Americans rose and demonstrated great courage \nand selflessness. One such American was Mr. Isaac Hoopii, a Native \nHawaiian who resides in McLean, VA, and is a Pentagon police officer \nand member of a bomb-sniffing canine police unit.\n  Minutes after a hijacked plane crashed into the Pengaton, Mr. Hoopii \nraced into the burning building and carried out eight people.\n  His calm resolve in the face of danger equaled his physical prowess. \nUnable to see the terrified victims, but knowing that they were amid \nthe debris, smoke, and darkness, Mr. Hoopii repeatedly called out: \n``Head toward my voice.''\n  Several people followed his voice and crawled to safety. At least one \nman who was led by Mr. Hoopii's voice called it the ``voice of an \nangel,'' and credits it for saving his life.\n  I have had the opportunity to hear Mr. Hoopii's voice. He is a \nmusician with the ``Aloha Boys,'' a Hawaiian musical group that has \nperformed on Capitol Hill. His singing is melodious and resonant, but I \nbelieve Mr. Hoopii's voice had never before sounded more beautiful than \nit did on that September morning. Mr. Hoopii carries with him the true \naloha spirit, and I thank and commend him for sharing with the world \nthe aloha of the Hawaiian people, whom I have been privileged to serve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/16/senate-section/article/S10766-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TECH TALENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for the \nTechnology Talent Act of 2001. As an original co-sponsor, I am pleased \nto have joined my Senate colleagues, Senators Joe Lieberman, Barbara \nMikulski, Bill Frist, and Pete Domenici in introducing an important \npiece of legislation that will help strengthen the long-term economic \ncompetitiveness and health of our Nation. We are here to sound the \nalarm to the public that our Nation's innovation capabilities are at \nrisk of falling behind other industrial nations if we do not \naggressively increase the number and quality of our technologically-\ntrained workforce.\n  The number of American students receiving degrees in the natural \nsciences and engineering fields has fallen significantly. This decline \nhas occurred despite the growth in population and increase in \nundergraduate enrollment. But in other countries, the proportion of \ndegrees in the sciences has grown compared to the United States. As a \nresult, the demand for scientists and engineers in this country is \nbeing filled by foreign workers. And with the demand for engineers and \ncomputer scientists expected to grow by more than 50 percent by 2008, \nthe high-tech industry is deeply troubled that it will become \nincreasingly difficult to fill this demand and remain competitive in \nthe global economy.\n  To respond to the shortage of technically-trained workers in this \ncountry, the Congress has had to raise the cap on H1-B visas for \nimmigrant workers. Why was this necessary? In the past decade, growth \nin the number of Asian and European students earning degrees in the \nnatural sciences and engineering has gone up on average by 4 percent \nper year. During the same time, the rate for U.S. students declined on \naverage by nearly one percent each year. It was startling to learn that \nthe Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, ranked \nthe United States 25 out of 26 industrialized nations surveyed in terms \nof the number of college and university degrees in science. The OECD \nfound that South Korea led those nations surveyed and that we are \nbehind countries like Finland, Japan, the Czech Republic, and Ireland!\n  In my home State of Missouri, I have seen the same sort of disturbing \ntrends. The University of Missouri has seen an overall decline in \nscience, engineering, and math degrees as a proportion of total \nundergraduate degrees. For example, undergraduate degrees in \nengineering have declined by 16 percent over the past 5 years whereas \nnon-science degrees have increased by 14 percent.\n  Because of these troubling numbers, I am excited to work with my \nSenate colleagues to come up with a potential solution. I thank Senator \nLieberman and his staff for taking the initiative in crafting this bill \nand working with me. I also thank Professor Romer of Stanford \nUniversity for his vision and thoughts in developing this bill.\n  Through the administration of the National Science Foundation, this \nlegislation provides financial incentives to our colleges and \nuniversities to expand existing successful programs and create new, \ninnovative ways that encourage our youth to enter and stay in the \nscience and engineering fields. Our bill also encourages schools to \ndevelop programs that will attract more minorities and women. This is \ncritical since there are few minorities and women employed in the high-\ntech sector.\n  To jumpstart this program, I am pleased to note that we have included \n$20 million in NSF's budget as part of the Senate's fiscal year 2002 \nVA, HUD bill. I hope we can maintain this level in conference and later \nincrease funding for this program to a level of $200 million if this \nprogram is successful and our subcommittee receives the necessary \nfunding.\n  Along with many of my Senate and House colleagues, I have been trying \nto increase support for NSF because we recognize the role NSF plays in \nstimulating our economy and supporting the biomedical work of the \nNational Institutes of Health. That is why we believe in doubling NSF's \nbudget and as part of this effort, increasing the Nation's \ntechnologically-trained workforce is a key element. Clearly, we need to \ninvest in our students because they will be the booster rocket for the \nfuture success of our economy and allow this Nation to lead the world \nin this century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/16/senate-section/article/S10766-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10766]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of this \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred June 21, 2001 \nin Cortez, CO. The body of an openly gay, half-Navajo teen, Fred \nMartinez Jr., 16, was found south of Cortez 5 days after he left home \nto go to a carnival. Police have arrested another teen, Shaun Murphy, \nin the murder and are investigating whether the homicide was a hate \ncrime based on sexual orientation or race. The perpetrator allegedly \nbragged that he ``beat up a fag.'' Martinez often curled his hair, \nplucked his eyebrows, wore make-up and toted a purse to school. His \nmother told the press that she firmly believes her son's slaying was a \nhate crime based on his gender identity or because he was transgender.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe that by passing this legislation, we can change \nhearts and minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/16/senate-section/article/S10766-4", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10766-S10767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING TODD BEAMER\n\n  Mr. CORZINE.

Mr. President, I rise today in honor of Dr. Lee \nHartwell who received this year's Nobel Prize in Physiology and \nMedicine.\n  Dr. Hartwell began his work over 30 years ago with little more \nequipment or sophisticated research methods than a few dishes of yeast \ncells and a microscope and now works at one of the most prestigious \ncancer research centers in the country. Dr. Hartwell is President of \nthe Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, and also a \nProfessor of Genetics and Medicine at the University of Washington.\n  I believe that no one deserves this honor more than Dr. Hartwell, who \nis gracious and humble in his knowledge even as it has fundamentally \nchanged the way we understand biology.\n  Dr. Hartwell was selected to receive the Nobel Prize because of his \ncontributions to understanding how cells divide. Using yeast as a model \norganism, he was among the first scientists in the world to translate \nbasic genetic research into the study of how cells function, and to \ndetermine which genes are involved in cell division.\n  Cells are the basis for all animal and plant life, and our \nunderstanding of how they multiply and develop is key to our \nunderstanding of larger organisms, like people. Errors or mutations in \ngenes involved in the process of cell division can lead to cancer. Dr. \nHartwell's work on these genes is fundamental in developing approaches \nthat predict, prevent, or treat many kinds of cancers.\n  In his research, Dr. Hartwell has discovered more than 100 genes \ninvolved in cell-cycle control, including the gene that controls the \nfirst step in the cell division process. He also documented the \nexistence of cell-cycle ``checkpoints,'' which ensure steps in the \nprocess of cell growth and division have been completed properly before \nthe process continues.\n  Dr. Hartwell's work was the first to show that cell division is \ngenetically controlled, and he generated a collection of cell-division \ncycle mutants from which many of the key genes in this process have \nbeen isolated. Dr. Hartwell's latest work focuses on the possible role \nfor checkpoint defects and genetic instability in cancer progression \nand he is looking into how to exploit these defects to develop new \ncancer treatments.\n  Dr. Hartwell graduated from Glendale High School in California before \ndeciding to attend a junior college. He later transferred from junior \ncollege to the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, CA. In \n1961, he earned a Bachelor of Science at Caltech, and in 1964 earned a \nPh.D. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He did \npostdoctoral work at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. He \njoined the University of Washington faculty in 1968 and has been a \nprofessor of genetics there since 1973. In 1996 he joined the faculty \nof Seattle's Fred Hutchinson, Cancer Research Center and in 1997 became \nits president and director.\n  Dr. Hartwell is the recipient of many national and international \nscientific awards for his work in cell-cycle biology, including the \nLeopold Griffuel Prize, the Massry Prize, the American Cancer Society's \nMedal of Honor Basic Research Award, the Albert Lasker Basic Medical \nResearch Prize, the General Motors Sloan Award and the Gairdner \nFoundation International Award for Achievements in Science. Dr. \nHartwell is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences.\n  Dr. Hartwell typifies the ingenuity and creativity found throughout \nWashington State. I speak for us all when I commend him on winning the \nNobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine. Dr. Hartwell's work is truly \nrevolutionary, and although it is done without pomp and circumstance, \nhis work will have a lasting impact on us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/16/senate-section/article/S10767-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 IN RECOGNITION OF DR. VICTOR WESTPHALL\n\n Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. Victor \nWestphall. Dr. Westphall has dedicated his life to recognizing and \ncelebrating the service and sacrifice of our Nation's veterans. This \npast Saturday, Dr. Westphall celebrated his 88th birthday, and I still \nmarvel at how much he has accomplished during his lifetime.\n  Dr. Westphall's dedication to veterans is not surprising because he \nis a veteran himself. He entered the United States Navy in 1943 as an \nensign and served for two years in the South Pacific during World War \nII. During this time, he was responsible for setting up message centers \nto allow front-line communication. After serving three years in the \nNavy and earning two full stripes, Dr. Westphall moved with his wife \nand his two sons to Albuquerque. However, his family had a difficult \ntime finding housing because of the large number of returning G.I.s. \nDr. Westphall realized that many veterans were faced with the same \nsituation, so he began a home construction business and built over \n3,000 homes in New Mexico. At the same time, he earned his doctorate in \nhistory at the University of New Mexico and eventually became a leading \nauthor and expert on Southwestern American history.\n  In 1968, Dr. Westphall received news that his son, David, had been \nkilled in Vietnam. David was a platoon leader and was killed with \ntwelve of his men in an ambush near Con Thien. However, Dr. Westphall \nwas determined to draw some good out of this tragic event. He decided \nto use the life insurance payment from his son's death to build the \nVietnam Veterans Peace and Brotherhood Chapel in Angel Fire, NM. \nAlthough Dr. Westphall struggled to find financial support to help \nbuild this memorial, he remained dedicated to the project, and in 1971, \nthe first monument to Vietnam veterans in the United States was \nformally dedicated.\n  The Vietnam Veterans Peace and Brotherhood Chapel stands as a \nhandsome tribute to our veterans who served in Vietnam. Dr. Westphall \nhired a Santa Fe architect to design a beautiful white chapel with \ngentle curves sweeping 50 feet upward towards the sky. This serene \nmemorial overlooks the sacred Moreno Valley in northeastern New Mexico. \nIt offers visitors the opportunity to remember those who served their \nNation proudly in the Vietnam War in a peaceful and spiritual setting. \nThe Chapel's eternal flame illuminates this ideal place for quiet \nmeditation.\n  Even today, Dr. Westphall remains deeply involved in this monument, \nwhich attracts over 120,000 visitors every year. He still greets \nvisitors to the Chapel in his wheelchair, while sharing stories of \nloved ones lost during the War. There is a very moving story that Dr. \nWestphall recounts about the Chapel. When the memorial was first \nopened, the Chapel would close every night. However, one morning Dr. \nWestphall found a message left by a young veteran on the door: ``I \nneeded to come in and you locked me out.'' Since then, the Chapel \nremained open 24 hours a day.\n  Just like the Chapel, Dr. Westphall has always been there for our \nNation's veterans. From his own service in World War II to his \nconstruction of houses for returning veterans to the opening of the \nVietnam Veterans Peace and Brotherhood Chapel, Dr. Westphall has \nremained dedicated to America's veterans. I salute Dr. Westphall's \nlifetime of service to our veterans, and I am proud and honored to have \nhim as a friend.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/16/senate-section/article/S10767-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10767-S10768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               THE OUTSTANDING SERVICE OF RICHARD MONAHAN\n\n Mr. KENNEDY.

A bill to provide for grants through the Small Business \nAdministration for losses suffered by general aviation small business \nconcerns as a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001; to \nthe Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of Senator Inhofe, \nSenator Baucus, Senator Burns, Senator Johnson, Senator Hollings and \nmyself, to introduce the General Aviation Assistance Act. This \nlegislation would provide assistance in the form of Small Business \nAdministration grants, helping to support an essential part of our \naviation industry at a very critical time.\n  When many of the large passenger airlines were in trouble, we knew we \nhad to act quickly to support this vital industry. When the planes were \ngrounded following the September 11 attacks, many airlines were in a \nprecarious position.\n  The situation in the general aviation industry is equally, if not \nmore, precarious. And the services general aviation businesses provide \nare no less critical to our economy.\n  In Iowa and in many rural States, commercial service is very limited. \nWithout general aviation, traveling by air means driving for hours to \nreach a small commercial airport that offers few flights, often at \ninconvenient times. That is not a workable situation for most \nbusinesses. Many could not locate to rural America without general \naviation services.\n  The general aviation industry is made up of a number of small \nbusiness. It operates at more than 5,300 public use airports \nnationwide, compared to the 650 airports in the nation that have \nairline service. Ninety-two percent of the aircraft registered in the \nUnited States are general aviation aircraft. That includes charter \nbusinesses, crop dusters, the people who maintain small noncommercial \nairports and those that train future pilots. These businesses provide \njobs for thousands of hard-working Americans and many cannot survive \nmuch longer without our help.\n  Our failure to support general aviation now would deal a severe blow \nto the rural economy. Unlike the commercial airlines, general aviation \nis made up largely of small businesses. Their ability to remain in \nbusiness rests on their ability to fly. A very significant number of \nthese businesses are in danger of not making it through the year \nwithout relief.\n  Over the past month, while visiting many of Iowa's airports to \ndiscuss airlines safety, I also met with a number of general aviation \noperators. For many small plane operators, flight restrictions lasted \nfar longer than they did for the big airlines. Indeed, there are still \nsome general aviation companies near large cities that are still closed \ntoday.\n  Last week, I spoke with Bill Kyle from Charles City, IA who is a \nsmall independent operator. From September 11 to September 22, he lost \ntwo thousand dollars a day. He is still losing $800 dollars every day \nbecause his business is reduced at a similar rate to the reductions \nseen in commercial aviation. These are not the type of losses that a \nsmall business like Bill Kyle's can survive, not without some \nassistance.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will provide small general \naviation businesses with grants to make up for their actual losses from \nSeptember 11 through the end of the year. The program would be \nadministered by the Small Business Administration which would make sure \nthat the amount of assistance provided was fairly determined. Grants \ncould be as much as $6 million, although, of course, the vast majority \nwould be far less.\n  We must act. This assistance could be the difference between a \ngeneral aviation business taking off or being grounded permanently.\n  A number of my colleagues are working to assist small business to \nrecover from this tragedy. I am sure that many have been hearing from \ntheir constituents about this issue. So, I am sure they know that few \nsmall businesses have been impacted as dramatically as the hard-working \npeople in general aviation.\n  I am committed to getting general aviation back on track. It is \nimportant to these small businesses. It is important to the people they \nemploy. And it is important to the rural economy as a whole. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in support of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH:\n  S. 1553. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \nbonus deduction for depreciable business assets; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \ndesigned to help stimulate the economy by creating a strong incentive \nfor businesses to invest immediately in new productive assets.\n  Unfortunately, the evil acts of terrorists on September 11 did more \nthan shatter lives, hopes and dreams and destroy or damage great \nbuildings in New York and Washington. They also caused serious harm to \nour national, and even the world's economies.\n  While we do not yet know the full extent of the havoc brought to the \nU.S. economy by the calamities of September 11, practically all the \nexperts agree that the damage will be significant. Few of them doubt \nthat we are now in a recession. Moreover, many of the Nation's leading \neconomists agree that the Congress and the President should move \nquickly to enact a package of tax cuts and other measures to stimulate \nthe economy and try to prevent the downturn from becoming a long and \ndeep one.\n  For this reason, the bipartisan leadership of Congress in both \nhouses, along with the White House, have been meeting for weeks in an \nattempt to develop a consensus on what such an economic stimulus \npackage should include. Last Friday, the Committee on Ways and Means of \nthe House of Representatives approved an initial stimulus bill.\n  While it appears evident to me that it will be difficult for everyone \nin both parties and in both houses to agree on the proper content of \nthe economic stimulus package, there are some guiding principles for \nthe package on which most seem to agree. First, and almost by \ndefinition, the stimulus package should provide a strong incentive for \nplayers in the economy to take action they would not ordinarily take. \nSecond, such an incentive should cause the desired action to occur \nquickly, when it will be of the most good to the economy. Finally, the \nstimulus should be temporary, and not cause a large long-term effect on \nthe Federal budget, which could lead to an increase in interest rates.\n  It may be that there are many specific tax law changes that meet \nthese guiding principles. Some have suggested another round of tax \nrebate checks, but designated only for those who were not able to \nparticipate in the advance tax cut Congress passed in May of this year. \nOthers are proposing the acceleration of the income tax rate cuts that \nwere included in that same tax bill that are presently scheduled to \ntake effect in future years. Still others insist that the stimulus \npackage include new spending on our infrastructure or relief to ailing \nindustries and to displaced employees.\n  In the end, the economic stimulus package signed into law will \nprobably contain a combination of several of these ideas. Our political \nprocess will\n\n[[Page S10771]]\n\nrequire us to reach some kind of consensus, which means some of this \nidea and some of that idea will have to be included.\n  Knowing that the stimulus package will be a collage of ideas, I \nbelieve it is important that it include a core provision that almost \neveryone seems to agree meets the criteria of true economic stimulus, a \nstrong inducement for businesses to invest in productive assets. The \npurpose of the bill I introduce today is to put before the Senate a \nbold plan that I believe would accomplish this goal.\n  The Economic Stimulus Through Bonus Depreciation Act of 2001 would \nprovide businesses throughout America a very strong, but short-term, \nincentive to purchase business assets and put them to work over the \nnext few months. A strong and concentrated surge in capital spending by \nU.S. businesses would provide a tremendous shot in the arm to our \neconomy, as present inventories become depleted and manufacturers \nscramble to keep up with the new demand.\n  Specifically, my bill would provide a 50-percent bonus depreciation \ndeduction for business assets purchased after September 10, 2001, and \nbefore July 1, 2002, and placed in service before January 1, 2003. This \nmeans that businesses that want to take advantage of this strong \nincentive, which generally provides more than twice the first year \ndeduction than is allowed under current law, would have to act quickly \nand order the new business assets by next June 30, and take delivery by \nnext December 31.\n  For example, suppose a business needed a new delivery truck that cost \n$50,000. Under current law, most trucks are considered 5-year property, \nand are generally depreciated over a 5-year period. If the business \npurchased the truck in 2002, the current-law depreciation deduction for \nthe first year would be $10,000. In other words, the business would be \nable to write off one-fifth of the cost of the truck in the year of \npurchase.\n  Under my bill, that same business would be allowed a 50-percent \nfirst-year depreciation deduction, rather than the 20 percent. So, \ninstead of a deduction of $10,000 in 2002, the business would be \nallowed to deduct $25,000 of the cost of the truck in the first year. \nThis is a significant difference, and it should be enough of a \ndifference to change behavior when coupled with a short window of \nopportunity.\n  The short time frame is a key to the success of a stimulus promotion \nbill like this one. My bill would require that a business make a \ndecision and enter into a contract to purchase a new asset by next June \n30, and then take delivery on the property by December 31, 2002.\n  I will note that the economic stimulus bill approved by the House \nWays and Means Committee last week includes a somewhat similar \nprovision, one that provides for 30 percent extra depreciation for \ncertain business assets. However, that bill allows the purchaser to \ntake almost 3 years to decide to buy a new asset, then allows another \nseveral months to place the property into service. With all respect to \nmy colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee, I believe the window of \nopportunity for the enhanced deduction created by that bill is too \nlong. It does not instill the sense of urgency that I believe is needed \nto truly create a significant stimulus.\n\n  It is important to note that my bill also applies to more types of \nbusiness property than does the Ways and Means bill. The bill passed by \nthe Ways and Means Committee would generally provide for an enhanced \ndepreciation deduction for depreciable property with a recovery period \nof 20 years or less, except for leasehold improvements. The bill I am \nintroducing today would apply to all types of depreciable property, \nincluding leasehold improvements and depreciable real estate.\n  As a practical matter, I realize that many real estate projects, as \nwell as many larger build-to-order equipment projects, take longer than \na year to build and place in service. However, it is also true that \nmany larger and costly projects can be built within the time \nconstraints of this bill, especially if there is a concerted attempt to \ndo so. I believe that the short time frame of my bill would induce many \ncompanies to act much more quickly than they otherwise would, in order \nto get business assets ordered and built in time to qualify for the \nbonus depreciation. This is where the economic stimulus power of this \nbill comes into play. The more effort that is made to get real estate \nprojects finished, or to get equipment ordered, delivered, and placed \nin service in time to meet the deadlines of this bill, the more \neconomic stimulus is created.\n  Moreover, I believe this bill meets the three guiding principles I \nmentioned earlier. First, it provides a strong incentive for businesses \nto take stimulative action they would not otherwise take, in this case \nto purchase assets by June 30, 2002, in order to reap a significant tax \nsavings. Second, because of the short deadline, this action will take \nplace right away, when economic stimulus is really needed. Finally, the \nbill raises few risks of raising interest rates. Depreciation is a form \nof cost recovery over a period of time. Because our tax code allows the \ncost of assets to be recovered over time, a speed-up of the time of \nrecovery has few long-term costs to the Federal budget. So, allowing \nbusinesses to write off a larger portion of the cost of assets for a \nshort time period has a negative effect on the Treasury in the first \ntwo or three years, but begins to reverse itself afterward. Thus, much \nof the early year costs of my bill will be fully reversed within the \n10-year budget window.\n  President Bush has indicated his support for the inclusion in the \neconomic stimulus package of an enhanced depreciation provision. A \nnumber of Democrats and Republicans have also spoken out in support of \nthis idea. And, as I mentioned, the Ways and Means Committee included a \nversion of bonus depreciation in the bill it passed last week. Bonus \ndepreciation is a solid economic stimulus idea. In crafting a consensus \npackage, I urge my colleagues to include a depreciation provision that \npacks a punch by offering the promise of a large deduction for actions \ntaken in a relatively short time frame. I believe the legislation I \nintroduce today fits the bill nicely, and I urge its consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1553\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Akaka):\n  S. 1555. A bill to express the policy of the United States with \nrespect to the adherence by the United States to global standards in \nthe transfer of small arms and light weapons and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Security \nand Fair Enforcement in Arms Trafficking Act of 2001, cosponsored by \nSenators Leahy and Akaka.\n  Small arms and light weapons, such as assault rifles, machine guns, \ngrenades, and portable launchers of antiaircraft missile systems, are \nthe weapons of choice for terrorists and their friends, and I fully \nbelieve that U.S. leadership is needed to stem the global torrent of \nillicit arms. All too often these arms fall into the hands of \nterrorists, drug cartels, and violent rebellions. Curbing the \nproliferation of these weapons must be a vital component of our efforts \nto combat international terrorism.\n  The rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan, in fact, is due in no small \npart to the ready availability of these weapons in that war torn \ncountry, and Afghanistan clearly demonstrates how a country can become \na threat to regional and global security if it is flooded with small \narms and light weapons. The Taliban and the al Qaeda network were able \nto gather more than 10 million small arms and light weapons from a \nvariety of sources over the past decade, including AK-47s, hand \ngrenades, and Stinger missiles. Today the United States and its allies \nare faced with these very weapons as we move forward with Operation \nEnduring Freedom.\n  The global networks of terrorism are clearly linked to the networks \nof the illicit arms trade and to the states that harbor terrorists, and \nterrorists around the globe also utilize the intertwined global \nnetworks of the illegal arms trade and the drug trade to generate \nfinancial resources for their destructive and threatening activities.\n  As I have previously discussed on the floor, the global proliferation \nof small arms and light weapons is a staggering problem.\n  An estimated 500 million illicit small arms and light weapons are in \ncirculation around the globe.\n  In the past decade, an estimated 4 million people have been killed in \ncivil war and bloody fighting. Nine out of ten of these deaths are \nattributed to small arms and light weapons.\n  The sheer volume of available weaponry has been a major factor in the \ndevastation witnessed in recent conflicts in Angola, Cambodia, Liberia, \nMozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Somalia, Sri Lanka, and Kosovo, among \nothers, as well as the violence endemic to narco-trafficking.\n  The increased access by terrorists, guerrilla groups, criminals, and \nothers to small arms and light weapons poses a real threat to U.S. \nforces overseas. For the United States, as we now engage in the war on \nterrorism, this issue is a very real force protection issue.\n  The conflicts fueled by small arms and light weapons undermine \nregional stability and endanger the spread of democracy and free \nmarkets around the world.\n  Clearly this is a huge problem, with profound implications for U.S. \nsecurity interests.\n  I strongly believe that the U.S. Government must take the lead in the \ninternational community in addressing this issue. It is in the United \nStates national interest to promote responsibility and restraint in the \ntransfer of small arms and light weapons; to combat irresponsible \npractices in such transfers, to ensure that nations engaged in \nsubstandard practices are held accountable; to encourage other members \nof the international community to meet, as minimum standards U.S. law \nand practices; take strong action to negotiate and support making the \ntrafficking of small arms traceable; bolster rules governing arms \nbrokers; and eliminate the secrecy that permits millions of these \nweapons to circulate illicitly around the globe, fueling crime and war.\n  As a matter of fact, as a major supplier country in the legal arms \ntrade, the United States has a special obligation to promote \nresponsible practices in the transfer of these weapons.\n  That is what the Security and Fair Enforcement in Arms Trafficking \nAct of 2001 aims to do. It: Affirms U.S. policy to maintain the highest \nstandards for the management and transfer of small arms and light \nweapons exports, and that it is U.S. policy to refrain from exports \nthat could be used in internal repression, human rights abuses and \ninternational aggression; enforces the ban in international commercial \ntransfers of military-style assault weapons and, improves end-use \nmonitoring of U.S. arms transfers; urges the administration to enter \ninto negotiations with the European Union and NATO member states, as \nwell as other members of the international community to bring our \nallies into compliance with U.S. law and standards for the export and \ntransfer of military-style assault weapons as well as on such critical \nissues as marking and tracing of small arms and light weapons, rules \ngoverning the conduct of arms brokers, and the enforcement of arms \nembargoes; calls on the administration to establish a U.S.-EU \nCoordinating Group on Small Arms, and to work to and implement and \nadvance the Program of Action of the United Nations Conference on the \nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects; \nimproves the transparency of U.S. transfers in small arms and light \nweapons, and requires the establishment of a registry of all U.S. \nfirearm exports; and, encourages all states that have not done so to \nratify the OAS convention on small arms and light weapons.\n  And let me be clear: This legislation does not interfere with \nlegitimate and responsible transfers of small arms or the lawful \nownership and use of guns in the United States.\n\n[[Page S10773]]\n\n  The United States needs to push hard to improve the international \nstandards and the application of legally binding agreements to stem the \nillicit trade in these weapons. Fighting the proliferation of small \narms is critical to our efforts to combat terrorism, narco-trafficking, \ninternational organized crime, regional and local war.\n  I believe that combating the proliferation of small arms and light \nweapons is a critical element of the fight against terrorism, and I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate and with the \nadministration to pass the Security and Fair Enforcement in Arms \nTrafficking Act of 2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. STABENOW (for herself, Mr. Kyl, Mrs. Clinton, Mr.  \n        Schumer, Mr. Allen, Mr. Warner, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Dayton, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Breaux, Mrs. \n        Carnahan, Mr. Nickles, Mr. Levin, Mr. Corzine, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \n        Johnson, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 1556. A bill to establish a program to name national and community \nservice projects in honor of victims killed as a result of the \nterrorist attacks on September 11, 2001; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, we all witnessed a great national \ntragedy on September 11. While the deaths and damage occurred in New \nYork, Washington, and the fields of Pennsylvania, a piece of all of us \ndied that day.\n  Many people came up to me in the weeks after the attack and asked: \n``What can I do? I've given blood. I've donated to relief efforts. But \nI want to do more.''\n  We all shared in the horror. Now everyone wants to share in the \nhealing.\n  But how?\n  Then a constituent of mine, Bob Van Oosterhout, wrote me with an \nidea. Why not have the Federal Government devise a program that would \nencourage communities throughout the Nation to create something that \nwould honor the memory of one of the victims lost in the attack? \nTogether these local memorials to honor individuals would dot our \nNation and collectively honor all those lost in the attack.\n  What could be simpler? Or more moving?\n  From that idea came the Unity in the Spirit of America Act, which I \nam introducing today along with my distinguished colleague Senator Kyl.\n  Here's how it would work: Communities, it could be as small as a \nneighborhood block, or nonprofit organizations, houses of worship, \nbusinesses, or local governments would choose some kind of project that \nwould unite them and their community.\n  Applications and the assigning of names for each project will be \nhandled by the Thousand Points of Light Foundation in conjunction with \nthe Corporation for National Service. Once the bill has passed, \napplications and procedures will be posted on the foundation's web \npage.\n  In the meantime, I urge people to meet with their neighbors, or \ncoworkers, or fellow church members to start identifying projects that \nwould make fitting memorials to the victims of the attack of September \n11.\n  It could be cleaning or creating a park, adopting a school and \nmentoring students, creating a meals program for the homeless, or just \nabout anything that would do honor to the memories of those who died on \nSeptember 11.\n  The Thousand Points of Light Foundation will track each project's \nprogress on their web page.\n  The only rule would be that qualified projects should be started by \nSeptember 11, 2002.\n  Then on that day--as all over America we gather to grieve over the \nfirst anniversary of the attack that enraged the world--we'll also be \nable to look over thousands and thousands of selfless acts that made \nour world better.\n  In our sadness, we can create 6,000 points of life across our Nation. \nAnd we will show the world that our resolve was not fleeting, or our \nmemories not short.\n  They will see Unity in the Spirit of America.\n  And what could bring more fitting honor to all those innocents we \nlost.\n  I am also pleased that this bipartisan legislation enjoys the support \nof the Senators from New York, Mr. Schumer and Mrs. Clinton, and the \nSenators from Virginia, Senators Warner and Allen.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1556\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the issuance of certificates to social \nsecurity beneficiaries guaranteeing their right to receive social \nsecurity benefits under title II of the Social Security Act in full \nwith an accurate annual cost-of-living adjustment; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join with my \ncolleague, Senator George Voinovich of Ohio, in introducing the Social \nSecurity Benefits Guarantee Act, legislation aimed at conferring upon \ncurrent Social Security beneficiaries an explicit property right to \ntheir benefits.\n  As the President's Commission to Strengthen Social Security and \nCongress continue to consider options about how best to put our most \nvital social program on sound financial footing, it is increasingly \nimportant to assure today's beneficiaries that they are not going to be \nadversely affected by any reform proposal that Congress may ultimately \nenact into law.\n  Although reasonable people can disagree about how best to restore \nSocial Security to a path of long-term solvency, philosophical or \npolitical leanings should not obstruct us from meeting our moral \nobligation to preserve and protect the benefits of current \nbeneficiaries.\n  Both basic fairness and practicality dictate that individuals and \nfamilies who are currently receiving Social Security benefits should \nnot be expected to adapt to any of the steps necessary to shore up \nSocial Security's long-range financial health. Indeed, President Bush \noutlined as his very first\n\n[[Page S10774]]\n\nprinciple in the creation of the present Commission that \n``Modernization must not change Social Security benefits for retirees \nor near-retirees.''\n  No matter what reform plan Congress may consider, one of the more \nproductive interim steps we can undertake is to create an environment \nwhere constructive, bipartisan policy options can be pursued. Toward \nthis end, I believe that it is important to remove the ``demagoguery \nfactor'' from the Social Security reform discussion by ensuring seniors \nthat they receive every cent that the government has promised them, \nincluding an accurate annual cost-of-living increase. That is why we \nare introducing the Social Security Benefits Guarantee Act today.\n  Unfortunately, current law affords no such protection for our \nnation's elderly. In the Supreme Court's 1960 decision Flemming v. \nNestor, 363 U.S. 603, the Court held that Americans have no property \nright to their Social Security benefits, and that Congress has the \npower to change Social Security benefits at any time. One unfortunate \nbyproduct of this case law is that current beneficiaries have fallen \nvictim to scare tactics from politicians, interest groups and others \nstating or implying that sustainable long-term Social Security reform \nwill lead to a reduction or endangerment of their benefits.\n  Social Security reform is too important to working Americans to allow \nshort-term political demagoguery to drown out serious bipartisan \nefforts to put our most vital social program on sound fiscal and \nactuarial footing. By passing an explicit property right to Social \nSecurity benefits for those eligible for and receiving benefits, \nCongress can assure seniors that their benefits will be protected and \nfocus the reform discussion on the future, where it belongs, and how we \ncan best preserve Social Security's financial dependence at a cost that \nfuture generations can bear.\n  In closing, it is my sincere hope that our colleagues will join \nSenator Voinovich and me in supporting this commonsense legislation to \nprovide America's seniors peace of mind during the inevitable policy \nchallenges that lie ahead for Social Security's financing.\n  I again thank Senator Voinovich for working with me in this effort, \nand ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1558\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Secretary shall also issue \n     such a certificate to any individual on the date such \n     individual is determined thereafter to be entitled to \n     benefits under such title.\n       (b) Benefit Guarantee Certificate.--The benefit guarantee \n     certificate issued pursuant to subsection (a) shall represent \n     a legally enforceable guarantee--\n       (1) of the timely payment of the full amount of future \n     benefit payments to which the individual is entitled under \n     title II of the Social Security Act (as determined under such \n     title as in effect on the date of the issuance of the \n     certificate); and\n       (2) that the benefits will be adjusted thereafter not less \n     frequently than annually to the extent prescribed in \n     provisions of such title (as in effect on the date of the \n     issuance of the certificate) providing for accurate \n     adjustments based on indices reflecting changes in consumer \n     prices as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics or \n     changes in wages as determined by the Commissioner of Social \n     Security.\n       (c) Obligation To Provide Payments as Guaranteed.--Any \n     certificate issued under the authority of this section \n     constitutes budget authority in advance of appropriations \n     Acts and represents the obligation of the Federal Government \n     to provide for the payment to the individual to whom the \n     certificate is issued benefits under title II of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.) in amounts in accordance \n     with the guarantee set forth in the certificate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/16/senate-section/article/S10774-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10774-S10775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 79--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n   PUBLIC SCHOOLS MAY DISPLAY THE WORDS ``GOD BLESS AMERICA'' AS AN \n                  EXPRESSION OF SUPPORT FOR THE NATION\n\n  Mr. THURMOND submitted the following concurrent resolution, which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 79\n\n       Resolved, by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that it is \n     consistent with the Constitution for public schools to \n     display the words ``God Bless America'' as an expression of \n     support for the Nation.\n\n  Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution \nthat would demonstrate the support of Congress for the renewed public \npatriotism in our country. It would express the sense of the Congress \nthat public schools should be free to post the phrase ``God Bless \nAmerica'' without the misguided fear that it is illegal and violates \nthe Constitution.\n  In response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, the patriotism \nof the American people can be seen everywhere. The American flag is \nbeing flown all across our country, from homes and cars to schools and \nplaying fields. Patriotic songs are being sung with a renewed \nenthusiasm at all public places.\n  One such patriotic song is ``God Bless America,'' which was written \nduring World War I and became part of American life. Members of \nCongress spontaneously sang it on the steps of the Capitol the night of \nthe attacks, and it has been played countless times across the country \nin recent weeks.\n  The outpouring of unity and love that our Nation has expressed is \ninspiring. It is truly a fitting response to the terrorists. After all, \ntheir goal was to tear us apart, but what they have actually done is \nbring us together.\n  One small expression of unity came from Breen Elementary School in \nRocklin, California, which posted the phrase ``God Bless America'' on a \nmarquee in front of the school.\n  Given the patriotism all across our country, this small expression of \nresolve would not seem to be newsworthy. After all, these words are \npart of the history and fabric of our country. These words demonstrate \nthe spirit of America.\n  Unfortunately, there are a few who do not agree, and do not support \nBreen Elementary's display of patriotism. The American Civil Liberties \nUnion has demanded that the school remove the slogan, saying that the \nschool is clearly violating the Constitution. It even referred to the \ndisplay of ``God Bless America'' as ``hurtful'' and ``divisive.''\n  To say that ``God Bless America'' is ``hurtful'' and ``divisive'' is \nabsolutely ridiculous. The phrase is also in no way unconstitutional. I \nhave disagreed with the ACLU many times over the years, but their \nresponse here is even hard for me to believe. It simply wrong for the \nACLU to try to bully this school into supporting its extreme \ninterpretation of the Constitution.\n  Fortunately, the school is not intimidated. Rocklin Unified School \nDistrict Superintendent Kevin Brown has made it plain that the school \nis standing firm in its decision to keep ``God Bless America'' posted. \nIt is a decision that is principled, appropriate, and entirely in \nkeeping with the Constitution. We all should be proud of the school for \ntaking this courageous stand.\n\n  Simply put, the ACLU has no support in the law for its position. \nWhile there does not appear to be any Federal cases ruling on the \nphrase ``God Bless America,'' various challenges have been made to a \nsimilar slogan, ``In God We Trust.'' The Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals, arguably the most liberal federal appeals court, held in \nAronow v. United States that the use of this phrase on currency and as \nthe national motto does not violate the establishment clause of the \nConstitution. The court said, ``Its use is of a patriotic or ceremonial \ncharacter and bears no true resemblance to a governmental sponsorship \nof a religious exercise.'' It also said that ``it is quite obvious'' \nthat the phrase ``has nothing whatsoever to do with the establishment \nof religion.''\n  While the ninth circuit is the most relevant here because the school \nis located in California, other circuit courts\n\n[[Page S10775]]\n\nhave reached the same conclusion. The tenth circuit explained in Gaylor \nv. United States that the national motto ``through historical usage and \nubiquity cannot be reasonably understood to convey government approval \nof religious belief.'' In cases such as Lynch v. Donnelly, the Supreme \nCourt has indicated its approval of these rulings. Even Justice William \nBrennan, one of the most liberal Supreme Court Justices of the modern \nera and one of the most strident advocates for the separation of church \nand state, even indicated his support for this view, saying that \nAmericans have ``simply interwoven the motto so deeply into the fabric \nof our civil polity'' as to eliminate constitutional problems.\n  The same reasoning applies to Breen Elementary's use of ``God Bless \nAmerica.'' Both of these phrases show the important role that religion \nplays in America, but they are not an establishment of religion or \nendorsement of religious belief.\n  It is also significant that even when the Supreme Court ruled that \norganized prayer in public schools was unconstitutional in Engel v. \nVitale, it made it clear that the case did not apply to patriotic or \nceremonial anthems that refer to God. While I have always viewed this \ncase as misguided, and have for years introduced a constitutional \namendment to reverse it, even this case supports Breen Elementary \nSchool.\n  The fact is that religion is central to our culture and our patriotic \nidentity as a nation. As the Supreme Court said in Lynch v. Donnelly, \nthere is an ``an unbroken history of official acknowledgement by all \nthree branches of government of the role of religion in American \nlife.''\n  This is not something we should ignore or hide. I have never \nunderstood why some have desperately tried to remove any acknowledgment \nof religion from American life.\n  Just the opposite should be the case. It is only fitting that we \nwould turn to these expressions in times of great difficulty.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting the patriotism \ndisplayed in Rocklin, California. Throughout the history of this great \nNation, we have invoked the blessings of God without establishing \nreligion. From prayers before legislative assembly meetings and \ninvocations before college football games to the national motto \nembedded on our currency, our Constitution has allowed references to \nGod. During this time of national tragedy and recovery, we should not \nallow extreme interpretations of the Constitution to dampen our \npatriotism and resolve.\n  This is an important matter that deserves our attention during these \ndifficult times. A resolution very similar to this one has been \nintroduced in the House by my friend, Representative Henry Brown. We \nshould support Breen Elementary School and others like it as they \npersonify the spirit of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/16/senate-section/article/S10775-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NOTICES OF HEARINGS/MEETINGS\n\n\n           committee on agriculture, nutrition, and forestry\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.
