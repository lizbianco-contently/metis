Under the previous order, the time until \n10:30 a.m. shall be equally divided and controlled for debate on the \nSmith amendment No. 2705.\n  The Senator from Oregon is recognized on his amendment.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. I thank the President pro tempore.\n  Mr. President, it is a privilege this morning to speak about a \ncomponent of the stimulus package which I think does garner wide \nbipartisan support. There are many good ideas. And I, as a Republican, \nstand in this Chamber to say I look forward to voting to extend \nunemployment benefits and health care benefits. I think these ideas add \nto the demand side of the equation by giving dollars to consumers--to \ntaxpayers--who very much need to make ends meet and to meet life's \nnecessities.\n  There is a supply side to this debate that actually is central to an \neconomic recovery, and that is the supply side of doing things which \ntruly stimulate the economy, because if we want to get back to \nsurpluses, the best way we can do that is by pursuing policies that \nwill lend themselves to growth.\n\n  The bonus depreciation amendment, which I have before the Senate this \nmorning, does that very thing. It has won verbal support from the likes \nof Chairman Greenspan and former Clinton Treasury Secretary Robert \nRubin, who uniformly endorse a stimulus package, and specifically the \nimmediate stimulative effect on the economy of the temporary enactment \nof bonus depreciation.\n  I commend the majority leader for much improving his proposal as to \nthe budget, as to the bonus depreciation from its initial offering. But \nfor reasons I will point out, I think it still falls short of what it \nneeds to be if we are truly serious about stimulating the economy.\n  Senator Daschle's proposal will allow 30-percent bonus depreciation \nfrom only September 11 of last year to September 11 of this current \nyear. This\n\n[[Page S112]]\n\nmeans it will only stimulate business purchases for the next 8 months, \nassuming we can get the stimulus package passed by February 1. It is 12 \nmonths, but it is simply an inadequate period when you figure that 8 \nmonths to make business decisions is all that is allowed. So we are \nleft with a proposal to stimulate business that just simply lacks the \nweight that it needs to do the job.\n  If you look at the facts on business investment, it has fallen \nprecipitously since August of 2000. Consumer spending in this recession \nhas been surprisingly resilient, but business investment has fallen off \nthe table.\n  Today's recession is caused primarily by a decline in business \ninvestment. Chairman Greenspan made that clear in his remarks to the \nBudget Committee yesterday. It is the central reason for this \nrecession.\n  So what kind of investment can we stimulate in the 8 months that \nremain under the underlying proposal? It probably gives businesspeople \ntime to buy a chair and perhaps some new wastebaskets, a rug for the \nfront office, but 8 months is not enough time to start major projects \nthat would, in fact, employ thousands upon thousands of people. It does \nnot allow time to build heavy equipment, modernize a lumber mill, \nrestart a coal mine, revamp a corporate computer system, rebuild a rail \nbed, or even to construct an airplane. It doesn't allow enough time to \nobtain building permits, perform environmental reviews, complete \narchitectural or engineering studies.\n\n  My amendment allows bonus depreciation for farm equipment and \nimprovements and special purpose agricultural and horticultural \nbuildings. Farmers, unfortunately, may not see the turnaround they need \nin the next 8 months. I wish it were so. It may take longer than that. \nBut when the farm economy does recover, they will need to update their \nequipment, and they ought to have the advantage of the bonus \ndepreciation that we are offering long enough so they can have that \nadvantage, too.\n  Consider the airplane. If you want to build an airplane, the average \nis it takes about 18 months. So, clearly, that important industry, that \nvery American industry, is left out of the calculation before the \nSenate, if my amendment is defeated. Eight months is simply not enough \ntime to build an airplane.\n  Moreover, an 8-month bonus depreciation period does not provide \ninsurance against future down ticks in our recovery cycle. These \ncommonly occur when an economy struggles to throw off the shackles of a \nrecession. We need to create a booming economy, not only for today but \nfor the next several years. So I emphasize that the majority's 8-month \ndepreciation proposal lacks the economic weight that our economy now \nneeds. I plead with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, let's \nrecognize the realities of the business world and provide the kind of \nstimulus which is meaningful, weighty, and effective.\n  Mr. President, I have been requested to add the names of Senators \nCollins and Allard as cosponsors. I ask unanimous consent that they be \nadded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing letters from the Association for Competitive Technology and \nthe American Electronics Association in support of the Smith amendment \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   Association for\n\n\n                                       Competitive Technology,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 2002.\n       To All Senators: On behalf of thousands of information \n     technology (IT) companies and professionals, I am writing to \n     express my support for the Smith (OR) amendment that would \n     provide a 3-year, 30% bonus depreciation provision. Like \n     other companies in our industry, our members feel strongly \n     about depreciation and are paying close attention to this \n     vote.\n       Small business drives the IT industry. No sector has \n     created more jobs or advances in technology. These businesses \n     have spent nearly $160 billion during the past two years on \n     acquiring new products used to develop cutting edge \n     applications and services. The end result has been a richer \n     computing experience for businesses and consumers.\n       Enhanced depreciation schedules will improve small business \n     productivity, strengthen the U.S. economy and boost the IT \n     sector. Enhanced depreciation means small businesses will \n     have the IT tools they need to stay competitive--obsolete IT \n     tools will be one less obstacle in a small company's growth \n     and success. Favorable expensing rules will free-up small \n     business capital to grow business and increase jobs.\n       Modernizing expense for high technology equipment can help \n     boost the economy at a time when we need it most. My member \n     companies feel that the time is now to address these changes \n     and the economic stimulus package it the right vehicle.\n       The one-year, 30% provision in the Democratic stimulus bill \n     is unacceptable. The reality is that their ``year'' ends in \n     September 2002, which only provides seven months at the most \n     for companies to plan for and make technology purchases. We \n     hope we can count on you to do what's best for the technology \n     industry and vote ``Yes'' on the Smith amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Jonathan Zuck,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                          AeA,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 25, 2002.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the high-tech industry, I write \n     to express AeA's strong support for the Smith amendment \n     calling for a 30 percent bonus depreciation provision for \n     capital assets purchased over the next 36 months. We believe \n     that this is a meaningful accelerated cost-recovery provision \n     for American business and is essential to stimulate the \n     economy. Our industry is unified in its support of such a \n     measure.\n       Please vote in support of the Smith amendment.\n       A 30% bonus depreciation will stimulate greater investment \n     and provide the kind of stimulus that will strengthen our \n     companies and create more jobs across the country. The \n     current economic slowdown requires this kind of dramatic, \n     effective action by the Congress.\n       AeA (American Electronics Association) is the nation's \n     largest high-tech trade association and is comprised of more \n     than 3,500 small, medium and large high-tech companies. \n     Passage of an economic stimulus package is very important to \n     the high-tech industry right now, and we hope the U.S. Senate \n     will act quickly to approve a stimulus package that includes \n     at least a 30 percent bonus depreciation provision.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                William T. Archey,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I also will note that President \nBush also spoke in support of a bonus depreciation only a few days ago. \nI quote from him:\n\n       But any good stimulus package plan must ask the question \n     ``how do we create more jobs?'' and one way to do that is to \n     accelerate tax relief for workers, and the other way to do \n     that is to make sure that the Tax Code doesn't punish \n     companies like Walker.\n\n  That is the one he was visiting.\n\n       We ought to allow them to accelerate the depreciation \n     schedule so it is more likely they will buy more equipment.\n\n  That is simply what we are doing, Mr. President. We are trying to \nallow this bonus with enough time that they can take enough advantage \nof it for the greater advantage of our entire country.\n  Mr. President, I think we all recognize that the No. 1 issue in the \nhearts and the homes of the American people is economic security, as \nwell as national security. I, for one, was deeply disappointed that we \nwent home for Christmas not as Santa Claus but as Scrooge. We should \nhave done this before we left. I am glad, however, that the majority \nleader has brought it up and is allowing this to go forward now. I hope \nwe are successful because I think we ought to show the American people \nthat we are doing all we can to make this happen and are taking out the \ninsurance policy that is necessary to support our economy and our \npeople.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Brownback as a cosponsor of \nthe amendment as well.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to vote for \nthis amendment. I think it will win a lot of additional Republican \nsupport for the overall effort of the majority leader, and I think for \nthe American people's sake that is important.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, how much time is reserved on our side on \nthe Smith amendment?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The opposition has 11 minutes 44 seconds. \nThe sponsor has 3 minutes 26 seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We reserve the time on our side.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Very well. Who seeks recognition?\n\n[[Page S113]]\n\n  The Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Conrad, is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in order to understand and evaluate this \namendment, the first thing we have to do is understand our current \neconomic condition. The day before yesterday, the Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office, Mr. Crippen, informed us that the \nprojection of $5.6 trillion of surpluses over the next 10 years that \nwas made only 1 year ago has now been eroded dramatically, and that \nwhat is available to us over the next 10-year period is not $5.6 \ntrillion but $1.6 trillion. That is a loss of $4 trillion of projected \nsurpluses in only 1 year.\n  If we look to the causes for that dramatic change in our fiscal \ncondition, what we see, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \nis that tax cuts accounted for 42 percent of the reduction in projected \nsurplus; 23 percent is the result of economic changes from the economic \nslowdown; 18 percent is from other legislation, mostly as a result of \nthe attack on this country of September 11 of last year; 17 percent is \nthe result of certain technical changes. Examples of that are increased \ncosts of Medicare and Medicaid.\n  I think it is critically important, as we evaluate these amendments, \nto understand our current fiscal condition. The implications of this \ndramatic drop in the projected surpluses are that we have gone from a \ncircumstance in which we were told last year that we would be virtually \ndebt free as a Nation in the year 2008 to now Director Crippen telling \nus that instead of being debt free in 2008, we will have $2.8 trillion \nof publicly held debt. As Chairman Greenspan reported to the Budget \nCommittee yesterday, that is the tip of the iceberg because we have \nother liabilities--so-called contingent liabilities--of another $10 \ntrillion.\n  Mr. President, I think that should sober us in our deliberations \ntoday. The implications of all this are serious and far-ranging. It \nmeans the total Federal interest costs that we can anticipate are going \nup by over a trillion dollars. We were told last year we would expect \ninterest costs to the Federal Government of $622 billion over this \nforecast period. That has now been increased to $1.6 trillion, an \nincrease of over a trillion dollars.\n  Mr. President, perhaps most alarming is that the truth is there are \nno surpluses left--no surpluses. The only place there is surplus money \nis in the Social Security trust fund account. If we remove the Social \nSecurity trust fund and the Medicare trust fund, what we find--last \nyear, we were told we would have $2.7 trillion in non-trust-fund \nsurpluses. Now what we see is a $1.1 trillion deficit. What this means \nis any proposal before us will take the payroll taxes of our firemen, \nour policemen, our farmers, our carpenters, our teachers, those who \nwork in our factories, even our own employees, and we will be taking \nevery penny to pay for any of these provisions--however meritorious--\nright out of the payroll taxes of the taxpayers of America--taxes they \nwere told were being levied to pay for Social Security and Medicare and \nare now being taken not to pay for Social Security and Medicare--oh, \nno--but now to pay for any tax relief provision that is being \nconsidered in this Chamber.\n  Mr. President, I believe that sets the very high bar with respect to \nany of these proposals.\n  Now comes this well-intended amendment. I have high regard for the \nSenator offering this amendment. He is a respected member of the Budget \nCommittee. I support bonus depreciation as part of a stimulus package, \nbut bonus depreciation over 3 years defeats the purpose of a stimulus \npackage.\n  Stimulus packages, as Secretary Rubin described it to us, as Chairman \nGreenspan described it to us, are designed to change economic behavior \nnow--not 3 years from now but now. And if instead of doing 1-year \ndepreciation, we do 3 years' depreciation, what we have actually done \nis to encourage people to wait to make the investment. That is \nprecisely what we should not do. What we need to do is encourage people \nto invest now.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Isn't it, in fact, correct that this proposal, the 3-\nyear bonus depreciation, is contradictory within its own terms? What \nyou want to do with a stimulus--and I am for a 1-year bonus \ndepreciation because I think that may serve as an incentive for \nadditional investment in order to realize the benefit of the bonus \ndepreciation in the first year--if you make it a 3-year bonus \ndepreciation, the latter part of the bonus depreciation is countering \nthe front part of the bonus depreciation, which is exactly what we do \nnot want. We want to do the 1 year.\n  We will see what the 1 year gives us, where the economy is at the end \nof the 1 year and whether an additional effort is needed. But to do 3 \nyears so someone can say, I will not do it this year, I will not do it \nnext year, I will do it in the third year of the bonus depreciation, is \nexactly contrary to what we are trying to accomplish. Isn't that, in \nfact, the case?\n  Mr. CONRAD. It is precisely the case. Again I say, I am a supporter \nas well of bonus depreciation. I agree with everything the Senator from \nOregon said with respect to the merits of bonus depreciation, but I \nhave to say to my colleague, I think it would be a profound mistake to \ndo 2 or 3 years because that simply encourages people to wait rather \nthan creating an incentive to act now, to invest now, to give lift to \nthe economy now. The message that is being sent is wait. That is not \nthe message we ought to send.\n  That is not just the conclusion of this Senator or the conclusion of \nthe Senator from Maryland but the Congressional Budget Office, which at \nmy request did an analysis of the various stimulus proposals and \nconcluded on this whole question that, ``A longer period would give a \nbigger average yearly boost, but more of it would come at the end of \nthe period than at the beginning, delaying the stimulative effect.'' \nDelaying the stimulative effect.\n  Is that what we want to do, delay the stimulative effect? I do not \nthink so. That goes directly counter to what a stimulus package is \nsupposed to do.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. SARBANES. In fact, as I understand it, the Congressional Budget \nOffice said in a report evaluating the various stimulus options:\n\n       Extending the period during which such expensing could be \n     used would reduce the bang for the buck because it \n     would decrease businesses' incentive to invest in the \n     first year and increase the total revenue cost.\n\n  We would lose on the stimulus front, and we would add to the deficit \nproblem, which the Senator has so ably outlined, that we confront as we \nlook out into the future.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Actually, the result of passing the Smith amendment would \nhave the perverse result of decreasing the impact of the stimulus and \nincreasing the debt, increasing the deficits, which is the worst stew \nyou could cook.\n  Mr. President, I point out that as we started this whole question of \nstimulus, the budgeteers on the House side and the Senate side on a \nbipartisan basis agreed to a set of principles to apply. One of them \nwas a stimulus sunset. That principle says:\n\n       All economic stimulus proposals should sunset within 1 \n     year, to the extent practicable.\n\n  This amendment, as well intended as it is, violates that basic \nprinciple.\n  Yesterday we heard from Chairman Greenspan. The headline in the \nWashington Post today is: ``Greenspan Doubts Need for Tax Cuts.'' While \nwe may agree or disagree on that question, I frankly think additional \nstimulus would be a good insurance policy, but I think it should be, \nwith respect to this provision, 1 year. I think that gives us the \ngreatest stimulus and does the least damage to our long-term deficit \nsituation.\n  Chairman Greenspan yesterday said he is very conflicted about a \nstimulus package. He said:\n\n       Since the nature of the coming recovery remains uncertain \n     and may be relatively weak, having some additional stimulus \n     could be helpful.\n\n  I agree with him on that.\n  He said:\n\n       On the other hand, such a package would deepen the budget \n     deficit this year which would not be a good idea.\n\n  Mr. Greenspan went on:\n\n       There is a possibility, depending on the provisions of a \n     stimulus plan, that it could have a modest negative effect on \n     the long-term economic outlook.\n\n\n[[Page S114]]\n\n\n  Mr. President, it is very clear that the best advice we have gotten \nis that we should have stimulus, that we should have it limited to 1 \nyear so we do not dig the hole deeper in the outyears in light of the \ndramatic change in our fiscal condition.\n  I will conclude by showing what the amendment of the Senator will do. \nThe revenue lost this year is $39 billion, but that pales in comparison \nto the loss from 2002 to 2006 of $82 billion.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Will the Senator yield on that point?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I will be happy to yield.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time of the opposition has now \nexpired.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SARBANES. And 30 seconds for the other side.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will not object if we have 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SARBANES. I thank the Chair. I thank my good friend from Iowa.\n  Mr. President, I want to add one dimension of this--the loss of cost \nin Federal revenue. There is also an impact of this on State revenue. \nOne of the problems we are confronting by this economic downturn is \nwhat it has done to State budgets. Bonus depreciation over a 3-year \nperiod will cost significantly more to the State governments, whose \nrevenue structures are tied to the Federal revenue structure, than the \n1-year plan. It is estimated, in fact, that it will probably cost the \nStates in the billions just in the second year of a bonus depreciation. \nThis is a further complication that arises out of this proposal.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask for an additional 30 seconds on both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I raise a point of order that the pending \namendment violates section 311(a)(2)(B) of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974 and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The point of order is immaterial while \ntime remains.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of our time this \nway: 1 minute to the Senator from Oklahoma, the remaining time to the \nSenator from Kansas, and the Senator from Kansas will go first.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, if I may in response----\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Time is running.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I have to yield time: 1 minute, half a minute, and the \nremaining time to the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the Smith amendment but \nmore to speak on behalf of the Boeing workers around my State and \naround the country. I have great respect for the Senator from North \nDakota and the Senator from Maryland for the efforts they are putting \nforward.\n  In the proposal they are putting forward, which basically has an 8-\nmonth window, we are not going to build any additional planes based \nupon that.\n  We need the longer depreciation period because a plane is a major \ninvestment project. It takes decisionmaking time to put that forward, \nand we need this greater depreciation.\n  I have been in close touch with the Boeing workers in Wichita. We \nhave other aircraft manufacturers that are located in Wichita, whether \nit is Cessna or Raytheon or Lear Jet, and they are saying we have to \nhave this if we are actually going to stimulate people to buy \nairplanes.\n  This is a major decision they have to make, and they need the longer \ntimeframe for it to be able to occur. We are talking about thousands of \njobs in this industry that were directly hit because of September 11. \nThat is why I speak on their behalf, and I ask my colleagues to \nconsider what impact this has had to aircraft manufacturing workers who \nwere directly hit by the September 11 events. They need this longer \ndepreciation schedule for major companies to make the decision to buy \nthe planes.\n  In an 8-month time period--that is the basic framework of this 1-year \nproposal--we will only have 8 months to act on it. Those decisions \ncannot and will not be made in that period of time that would be \ninvolved for a company to decide to put millions of dollars out for \naircraft.\n  They have been contacting me and are strongly supportive of the \nlonger depreciation time period saying that is what we need, and I ask \nwe consider what happens to the aircraft workers. That is what we ought \nto be thinking about on this particular amendment. If we want to \nstimulate this work, if we want to stimulate manufacturing, we need the \nSmith amendment for the longer timeframe.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time, and I yield to the Senator from \nOklahoma for his 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, first I wish to compliment my colleague \nfrom Oregon, Senator Smith, for his amendment because he is trying to \nput some stimulus in the stimulus package. Right now, under the so-\ncalled Daschle package, there is no beef. There is nothing that is \ngoing to create jobs. The only thing that could even remotely be called \na stimulus would be the depreciation section, and when one reads the \ndepreciation section there is nothing there.\n  I have heard colleagues say Senator Daschle's amendment has a \ndepreciation section for 12 months. Well, 4 months of those 12 months \nhave already expired. How many jobs are we going to create for the past \n4 months? That has already happened. There are only 8 months remaining. \nI doubt this is going to be enacted into law today, and so it is going \nto be less than 8 months. So the stimulative portion of this might last \nfor 7 months.\n  Senator Smith happens to have a business background. I used to be in \nthe private sector. We cannot pass a bill and say to the business \ncommunity, go out and make investments, and by the way you have to make \nthe investment in the next 6 months and it has to be put into action, \naccording to the Daschle amendment, by December. One just does not do \nit.\n  One might buy a few little things but they are not going to make a \nsignificant investment. It will not happen. Jobs are not going to be \ncreated.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma has used 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Thirty-five seconds.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I will use the remainder of the time unless others want \nit.\n  I, again, thank my colleague from Oregon because he is trying to put \nstimulus in this so-called stimulus package. If we want to strictly \nhave a spending bill, let's have a spending bill. That is really what \nmost of the Daschle package is.\n  The Smith amendment says, let us have some stimulus. This has passed \nthe House. It was part of the bipartisan bill that we had Democrats and \nRepublicans say we can pass. It is one of the things for which the \nPresident has asked. Let us do something that would help create jobs. \nIf we do not pass this amendment, I do not think the underlying \namendment is worth passing. That is my observation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Gordon Smith amendment.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time has expired.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, in my role as Budget Committee chairman, I \nraise a point of order that the pending amendment violates section \n311(a)(2)(B) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I move to waive the respective \nsection of the Budget Act with regard to my amendment and ask for the \nyeas and nays on this motion.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n\n[[Page S115]]\n\n  Mr. REID.

KRIEGER, OF COLORADO, TO BE UNITED STATES \n  DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO AND JAMES C. MAHAN, OF \n NEVADA, TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEVADA\n\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, upon the \ndisposition of the Smith amendment No. 2705, the Senate will now go \ninto executive session and proceed with the consideration of Executive \nCalendar Nos. 644 and 645.\n  The nominations will be stated.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Marcia S. \nKrieger, of Colorado, to be United States District Judge for the \nDistrict of Colorado, and James C. Mahan, of Nevada, to be United \nStates District Judge for the District of Nevada.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there will now \nbe 10 minutes for debate to be equally divided between the chairman and \nranking members of the Judiciary Committee, and 10 minutes for debate \nunder the control of the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Harkin.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized after these two votes for such time as I may need to speak \nabout the nominations. I know a number of Senators have schedules they \nwant to keep.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I will not \nobject--I would like to be given time immediately following the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues here in the Chamber \ntoday that I announced last year before we adjourned for the holiday \nrecess that because of the failure of the Senate to provide for cloture \non the farm bill so that we could have a reasonable amount of time for \ndebate and come to closure on it, the Senator from Iowa, this Senator, \nwas not going to agree to any unanimous consent on any judges or \nanything else that came before the Senate until we completed the farm \nbill.\n  I was approached the other day and was asked if we would let a couple \nof these judges go. It was my intention at that time to say no. I am \nnot interested in anything passing here until we got a farm bill \nfinished and sent to conference. But it has come to my attention that \nthere seems to be some movement towards reaching some agreement to have \neither a defined list of amendments and/or a time limit so that we \ncould bring this farm bill to some closure.\n  So in the spirit of trying to work on a bipartisan basis and trying \nto reach some agreement, I withdrew my objection so we could go ahead \nand permit these two judges to go through. I asked for this 10 minutes \nof time only to hope that in the ensuing few days--I know that next \nweek we are not going to be here much more than 1 day, and I think we \nare out Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday for the party conferences. That \nmeans we will have a short day Monday, a day Tuesday, and that is it. \nThen we are in the week after that. I am hopeful that sometime before \nwe adjourn next week for our party conferences the leadership on the \nRepublican side and on the Democratic side can reach an agreement on a \ndefined list of amendments on the farm bill and/or some time limit so \nwe can reach closure on it. Hopefully we will do that the week after \nnext.\n  This is becoming even more important because the Department of \nAgriculture just came out last week with their economic forecast for \nagriculture this year. I will read from the AP report on their \nforecast.\n\n  With crop prices mired near record lows, the government says farm \nincome will drop nearly 20 percent this year unless Congress enacts a \nnew farm program quickly, or approve more emergency payments.\n\n  There you have it.\n  There are three things we can do: Sit back, do nothing, and let farm \nincome drop 20 percent, we can come up with more emergency payments, or \nwe can enact a new farm bill, go to conference with the House, and have \na more reasonable approach.\n  I hope we can do the latter; that is, pass the farm bill, go to \nconference, come back, and let the House and the Senate work its will.\n\n  We have had a lengthy debate on the farm bill already. We have been \nhere 12 days; 1 more day on the farm bill means we will have broken all \nrecords for length of time for the farm bill to be considered in this \nChamber. Just 1 more day and we will have that. It looks as if we are \ngoing to break the record.\n  We had three substitutes for this farm bill. It was well debated. We \nhad the Lugar substitute, we had the Roberts-Cochran substitute, and we \nhad the Hutchison substitute, which is basically the House bill. None \nof them got over 40 votes. One got 30, one got 38, one got 40. So it \nlooks as if the bipartisan bill that we came out of committee with is \nthe bill that has the most votes.\n  I know there are things in the bill not everyone likes. There are \nsome things in the bill I personally as chairman of the committee do \nnot like. But\n\n[[Page S116]]\n\nI recognize there are other reasons for things and for different parts \nof the country. There is agriculture all over America. Maybe what is \ngood in one place is not good in other places. That is why there are \nvarying interests. I believe the bill we have on the floor does a good \njob of balancing those interests.\n  We have a good bipartisan bill. That doesn't mean we can't have more \namendments considered. Of course we can. There are payment limitation \namendments. There are other amendments that will come up. That is just \nfine. I have never taken the position we should not have amendments. \nLet us have a reasonable time limit, get the amendments up, have a \nreasonable debate, and then move on.\n  Again, I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will permit \nus to move ahead week after next on this farm bill, either with a \ndefined list of amendments or at least a time agreement or vote cloture \non the bill so we can move ahead on it expeditiously.\n  Again, I do not intend to hold up these judges in the spirit of \ncomity and working together. But I say to my friends on the other side \nof the aisle, if we cannot get some reasonable agreement to have this \nbill up and passed the week after next, then this Senator from Iowa \nwill again say nothing else is going to pass here until we get that \nfarm bill passed.\n  So I have removed my objection to these judges because of what I have \nheard. And I have talked with some people and have heard that there may \nbe some movement to get this farm bill debated and passed. If that is \nthe case, that is fine. I hope we can do that. But we cannot afford to \ntarry any longer. We have to get this bill passed, get to conference \nwith the House, and, hopefully, get it to the President.\n  We have farmers getting ready to go into the fields in the South \nalready. I think the wheat harvest in Texas is probably going to start \nnext month. We have farmers up in the northern parts of the country--\nwhere I am from--who do not know whether they can go out and buy a new \ncombine or a new tractor or something similar because they do not know \nwhat they are going to get this year. The bankers are uncertain.\n  The President was just out at John Deere a couple weeks ago. I was \nwith him at a John Deere plant in Illinois. The CEO of John Deere said \nthat we have to get a farm bill passed because no one is buying the \nimplements because they do not know what the bill is going to be. There \nis that uncertainty out there.\n  So I know we are talking about a stimulus package, my friends, but \nstimulus in rural America is the farm bill. If we get that farm bill \npassed, it will stimulate economic activity in rural America. It will \nlet bankers know how much they can lend. Farmers would then be able to \nsay: OK, now I can buy that tractor or that combine or that new piece \nof equipment. But until we do that, all that uncertainty and that cloud \nis hanging over them.\n  So, again, I took this time only to say that I will not object to \nthese judges in that spirit of comity, but I hope by next Wednesday we \nwill have an agreement worked out so when we come back the week after \nnext, after the party conferences and the party issues conferences, we \ncan bring up the farm bill, have a reasonable time for debate, and then \nhave final passage on the bill.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, is there any time to respond to the \nstatement made by the Senator from Iowa?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the unanimous consent order, there \nis none.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for 5 minutes. And I daresay I would not use that much time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. How much time?\n  Mr. BURNS. Five minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I say to my \nfriend from Montana, the chairman and ranking member of the Judiciary \nCommittee agreed to speak after the votes. We have people here who have \nschedules to meet. If my friend really wants to speak now, I will not \nobject.\n  Mr. BURNS. No.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent the Senator \nfrom Montana be allowed to speak after the chairman and ranking member \nare allowed to speak.\n  Mr. BURNS. I will agree to that. I thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana withdraws his \nrequest?\n  Mr. BURNS. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Pursuant to an earlier unanimous consent request, I am \nsending to the desk an amendment being offered by me on behalf of the \nmajority leader.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Illinois [Mr. Durbin], for himself, Mr. \n     Wellstone, Mr. Dayton, Ms. Landrieu, and Mrs. Lincoln, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2714.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under \n``Amendments Submitted.'')\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this is part of the economic stimulus \npackage. It is an amendment agreed to by both sides, Democrats and \nRepublicans, to extend the unemployment insurance benefits to those \nStates which will provide protection, expanded coverage for part-time \nworkers who otherwise would not be eligible for unemployment \ncompensation, and expand coverage to low-wage and recent hires who are \nalso out of work and cannot be covered by unemployment. It also \nincreases benefit levels under unemployment compensation by 15 percent \nor $25 per week, whichever is greater. These proposals are temporary. \nAll of the funding comes from Federal funding sources from the \nunemployment insurance fund. The amendment costs about $15 billion in \none year, but it will provide direct, immediate relief to unemployed \npeople across America. When we return next Tuesday, I will speak to \nthis amendment at length.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting it on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee for allowing me a minute to simply notify the \nSenate that I will redo my amendment and try to get 60 votes. It will \ncome back and be filed later today. It will have a 2-year time period \nbeginning January 1 of this year and going for 2 years, with a 30-\npercent depreciation bonus, and it will also specifically include the \nmotion picture industry so that they can have the advantage of this \nstimulus as well.\n  I think it is critical we do what the the Senator from Illinois is \ntalking about, and it is also critical we do something that is actually \nstimulatory of the economy. Two years is the absolute minimum, if we \nare serious about this part of the stimulus bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that the majority leader and the \nassistant majority leader moved to consider additional judicial \nnominations today. Both Senator Daschle and Senator Reid have been \nworking very diligently to clear these nominations which were put on \nthe Executive Calendar as we went out of session prior to the new year. \nThey have worked very hard to return the Senate's consideration of \njudicial nominations to a more orderly and open process. I compliment \nthe Senator from South Dakota and the Senator from Nevada for their \nefforts and thank them for their leadership. Along with our Senate \nleaders, many Senators have been working to move away from the \nanonymous holds and inaction on judicial nominations that characterized \nso much of the period from 1996 through the year 2000. Since the change \nin majority last summer, we have already made a difference in terms of \nboth the process and its results. The number of vacancies and the \nnumber of confirmations have finally begun to move in the right \ndirections.\n\n  As we begin this new session, I will take a moment to report where we \nare\n\n[[Page S118]]\n\nin the handling of judicial nominations and to outline the road ahead. \nThe distinguished Presiding Officer knows more of the history of this \nbody than any of the nearly 260 or 270 Senators with whom I have \nserved--I suspect more than a lot of others with whom he has served. I \nhope he will not feel it presumptuous if I take a few minutes to touch \non the history and legacy of the last 6 years as it relates to judicial \nnominations.\n  Those last 6 years have left a residue of problems that I think are \ngoing to take a continuing effort to purge. We are not going to do it \nin 1 day or 1 weekend, but it is going to have to be a continuing \neffort of both parties, Republicans and Democrats, and the White House.\n  After going through that history, I am going to offer the steps that \nwe in the majority will take in good faith to undo the damage of the \nlast 6 years. Then I am going to call on the White House to help us \ntake similar steps to help move the process forward. I do this both in \nmy capacity as the Senator from Vermont--a position I honor, and I am \nalways thankful to the people of my great and beautiful State for \nletting me be here--but also carrying the responsibility my caucus has \ngiven me by allowing me to be chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  One of the lessons I learned early on in this body from the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer is that if you are the chairman of a \ncommittee, you have a responsibility to that committee, to your caucus, \nbut also to the Senate, the whole Senate. I respect that.\n  So let me talk about the Judiciary Committee. In a span of less than \n6 months, and in a year that was tumultuous for the Nation and the \nSenate, the Judiciary Committee, between July and the end of the \nsession in December, held hearings on 34 judicial nominees. We reported \n32 and the Senate confirmed 28. As of today, we add 2 more and the \nSenate has now approved 30 of those judicial nominations.\n  They are conservative Republicans, but nearly all were unanimously \napproved by Democrats, Republicans and Independent alike on the \nJudiciary Committee and by the Senate, in a democratically-controlled \nSenate.\n  We reported more judicial nominees after the August recess than in \nany of the preceding 6 years, and more than in any similar period over \nthe preceding 6\\1/2\\ years. The Senate Judiciary Committee during the \ntime I have been chairman did not have and has not yet had a year in \nwhich to work. Last session we had less than 6 months. Still, in the \nlast 5 months of last year, the Senate confirmed almost twice as many \njudges as were confirmed in the first year of the earlier Bush \nadministration. We also confirmed more judges, including twice as many \njudges to the courts of appeals, as in the first year of the Clinton \nadministration. The Senate confirmed the first new member of the Fifth \nCircuit in 7 years, the first new judge for the Fourth Circuit in 3 \nyears, and the first new judge for the Tenth Circuit in 6 years.\n\n  Of course, more than two-thirds of the Federal court vacancies \ncontinue to be on the district courts, and the administration has been \nslow to make nominations to the vacancies in these trial courts. In the \nlast 5 months of last year, the Senate confirmed a higher percentage of \nthe President's district court nominees than a Republican majority had \nallowed the Senate to confirm in the first session of either of the \nlast two Congresses with a Democratic President.\n  Last year, the White House did not make nominations to almost 80 \npercent of the current trial court vacancies. When we came back to \nsession, we began with 55 out of the 69 vacancies without nominees.\n  Since the change in majority last summer, we have acted in the Senate \nto build better practices into the confirmation process for Federal \njudges and to make it more orderly. We made some progress at the end of \nlast year when, after many months, the White House and our Republican \ncolleagues finally agreed to limited steps to update and to simplify \nthe committee questionnaire, which seemed to have grown like Topsy over \nthe years.\n  And we have opened up the process as never before. For the first \ntime, the Judiciary Committee is making public the blue slips sent to \nhome State Senators. Until last summer these matters were treated as \nconfidential materials. They were restricted from public view.\n  We have moved nominees with less time from hearings to the \ncommittee's business meeting agenda, and then onto the floor, where \nnominees have received timely rollcall votes and confirmations. Over \nthe preceding 6\\1/2\\ years, at least eight judicial nominees who \ncompleted a confirmation hearing were never considered by the committee \nand were simply abandoned without any action. Before my chairmanship, \nthere were at least eight judicial nominees who got a hearing but never \neven got a vote--not a vote on the floor, Mr. President, they never got \na vote in committee.\n  Also, the past practices of extended unexplained anonymous holds on \nnominees after a hearing were not evident in the second half of last \nyear, as they had been in the recent past.\n  By the time the Judiciary Committee was reorganized and began its \nwork last summer, the vacancies on the Federal courts were peaking at \n111. That is what I faced as the Committee began its work--111 \nvacancies. Since then, 25 additional vacancies have arisen. Through \nhard work in the limited time available to us, we were able to outpace \nthis high level of attrition. By contrast, when my friends on the other \nside of the aisle took charge of the Senate in January 1995, until the \nmajority shifted last summer, judicial vacancies rose from 65 to more \nthan 100, an increase of almost 60 percent.\n  The Judiciary Committee simultaneously, during those last 5 months of \nlast year, held 16 confirmation hearings for executive branch nominees. \nWe sent to the Senate nominees who were confirmed for 77 senior \nexecutive branch posts, including the Director of the FBI, the head of \nthe Drug Enforcement Administration, the Commissioner of the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, the Director of the U.S. \nMarshals Service, the Associate Attorney General, the Director of \nONDCP, the Director of the Patent and Trademark Office, 7 assistant \nattorneys general, and 59 U.S. attorneys.\n  Senators may recall that soon after the Senate confirmed Judge Roger \nGregory as the first new Federal judge nominated by this President last \nJuly, the White House counsel said in an interview that he did not \nexpect the Senate to confirm more than five judges before the end of \n2001. Just think about that: The White House said last July that they \ndid not expect the Senate to confirm more than five judges before the \nend of 2001.\n\n  Of course, that estimate of 5 was actually an upward revision. \nInitially some on the other side of the aisle, after the midyear change \nof majority, had proclaimed that the Democratic majority would not \nconfirm a single judge. The White House, I think, trying to appear more \nbipartisan, upped the estimate from zero to 5. Of course, we achieved \nmuch more than that and confirmed more than 5 times the number of \njudges that the White House counsel had predicted.\n  One might have thought from the constant barrage of partisan \ncriticism that 2001 resembled 1996, a year in which a Senate Republican \nmajority confirmed only 17 judges, none of them appellate-level \nnominees.\n  The worst fear of some, it has been clear, is that Democrats would \ntreat Republican nominees as poorly as Democratic judicial nominees \nwere treated by a Republican Senate. That is not what has happened. In \njust 5 months we went on to confirm 28 additional judges, as I have \nsaid, more than five times the number the White House predicted we \nwould confirm. Think of that, Mr. President--five times what the White \nHouse was telling the American people we would confirm.\n  The Senate can be proud of its record in the first session of the \n107th Congress of beginning to restore steadiness in its handling of \njudicial nominees. I want to build on that record in the second session \nof the 107th.\n  Yesterday the Judiciary Committee held another hearing for judicial \nnominees. That was the 12th since July. This morning the Senate is \nconfirming the first two judges of this session and the 29th and 30th \nsince the change in majority last summer.\n  The legacy of strife over the filling of judicial vacancies that we \nall must work to overcome began in 1996, when months went by without \nthe Republican Senate acting on judicial nominations from a Democratic \nPresident.\n\n[[Page S119]]\n\n Later that same year, outside groups began forming to raise money on \ntheir pledge to block action on judicial nominees and to ``kill'' \nClinton nominees.\n  As the new session opened in 1997, efforts were launched on the \nRepublican side of the aisle to slow the pace of Judiciary Committee \nand Senate proceedings on judicial nominations and to erect new \nobstacles for nominees.\n  The results were soon apparent delaying the process, and they \npersisted throughout the remainder of President Clinton's \nadministration.\n  Those times stand in sharp contrast to the last 5 months of last \nyear, in which I noticed a hearing within 10 minutes of becoming \nchairman of the full committee, chaired unprecedented hearings during \nthe August recess, and held hearings and votes throughout the period \nafter September 11 and during the closure of our offices and hearing \nrooms after Senator Daschle and I received anthrax filled letters.\n  I want to emphasize that. During that time, 50 men and women who were \nnominated and who went through all the vetting, FBI backgrounds, and \neverything else, never received a hearing and a committee vote, many \nafter waiting for years.\n  They included Judge James A. Beaty, Jr., Judge James Wynn, and J. \nRich Leonard, nominees to longstanding vacancies on the Fourth Circuit; \nJudge Helene White, Kathleen McCree-Lewis and Professor Kent Markus, \nnominees to the Sixth Circuit; Allen Snyder and Professor Elana Kagan, \nnominees to vacancies on the D.C. Circuit; and James Duffy and Barry \nGoode, nominees to the Ninth Circuit; Bonnie Campbell, the former \nAttorney General of Iowa and former head of the Violence Against Women \nOffice at the Department of Justice, nominated to the Eighth Circuit; \nJorge Rangel, H. Alston Johnson, and Enrique Moreno, each nominated to \nthe Fifth Circuit; Robert Raymar and Robert Cindrich, among the \nnominees to the Third Circuit; and District Court nominees like \nAnabelle Rodriguez, John Bingler, Michael Schattman, Lynette Norton, \nLegrome Davis, Fred Woocher, Patricia Coan, Dolly Gee, David Fineman, \nRicardo Morado, David Cercone, and Clarence Sundram.\n  None of these qualified nominees was given a vote.\n  Over the course of those years, Senate consideration of nominations \nwas often delayed for not months but years.\n  It took more than four years of work to get the Senate to vote on the \nnominations of Judge Richard Paez and Judge William Fletcher; almost \nthree years to confirm Judge Hilda Tagle; more than two years to \nconfirm Judge Susan Mollway, Judge Ann Aiken, Judge Timothy Dyk, Judge \nMarsha Berzon, and Judge Ronald Gould; almost two years to confirm \nJudge Margaret McKeown and Judge Margaret Morrow and more than a year \nto confirm several others during the preceding 6\\1/2\\ years of \nRepublican control.\n  During those years, the Republican majority in the Senate went an \nentire session without confirming even a single judge for the Courts of \nAppeals.\n  As few as three appellate nominees were granted hearings and \ncommittee votes in an entire session. During that time, the Republican \nmajority averaged eight hearings a year for judicial nominees and had \nas few as six during one entire session. One session of Congress, the \nRepublican majority allowed only 17 judges to be confirmed all year, \nand that included not a single judge to any Court of Appeals. All the \nwhile, the judicial vacancy rate continued to worsen.\n  The problems did not end when President Clinton left office. New \nproblems have arisen through unilateral actions taken by the Bush \nadministration in its handling of judicial nominations.\n  Fifty years ago, President Dwight Eisenhower started a policy of \nhaving the American Bar Association do a review of judicial nominees. \nThat practice by President Eisenhower was followed by President \nKennedy. It was then followed by President Johnson. It was then \nfollowed by President Nixon. It was then followed by President Ford. It \nwas then followed by President Carter. It was then followed by \nPresident Reagan. It was then followed by the first President Bush. It \nwas then followed by President Clinton. But when this new White House \ncame in, they decided summarily to end that 50-year practice.\n  Senators are still going to ask at least to have that ABA background \ndone. It does not mean that peer review is controlling, by any means. \nWhat is happening now is that instead of having that ABA peer review \ndone simultaneously with the FBI background check and having the ABA \nreport come to the Senate around the same time as the FBI report, the \nAdministration sends up the nominee, and the Senate has to wait 6 or 8 \nweeks more to get the ABA vetting. The vetting processes could have \ndone both at the same time and potentially save 2 months in the \nprocess.\n  This unilateral approach in vetting nominees and disregarding the \nSenate's longstanding practice is similar to another disregarding of \nthe longstanding practice that encouraged consultation with home-State \nSenators, both Republicans and Democrats. That has needlessly \ncomplicated the Senate's handling of several of the nominations.\n  I realize we are looking back over the first year of a new \nadministration. But I am laying out this history to them because it is \na history of the handling of nominees that has worked fairly well for \nRepublicans and Democrats alike since President Eisenhower's time. \nMaybe we ought to go back to the things that have worked.\n  In addition, the White House has not responded to our repeated \nrequests to help the Senate work through residual issues caused by the \nRepublican Senate's earlier actions and inactions related to several \ncircuit courts.\n  We hear about all the vacancies on the circuit courts without mention \nof the fact that there have been previous qualified nominees for the \nvacancies on whom the Republican-controlled Senate refused to proceed. \nThat has created problems that have grown and festered over time. They \nare not going to be remedied immediately, especially in the absence of \nWhite House cooperation.\n  One of the best friends I have in the Senate is Senator Orrin Hatch \nof Utah. Senator Hatch and I can sit down and work out many of these \nthings. But we cannot do it by ourselves if the White House is \nuninterested in working with us. They ought to understand that we are \nable to work out most of our problems. They ought to take advantage of \nthat and work with us.\n  Let us turn to look at where we go from here. I think we made a good \nbeginning in the first 6 months of Democratic leadership in the Senate. \nBut the way forward is not easy. If we want to have continued progress, \nit is going to require leadership and cooperation and good will not \nonly within the Senate but by the White House.\n  These are the steps that the Judiciary Committee will take in good \nfaith. I want to lay this out for my colleagues.\n  First, we are going to restore steadiness in the hearing process. The \ncommittee will hold regular hearings at a pace that will exceed the \npace of the last 6 years. Following longstanding committee practice, \neach hearing typically will involve several nominees--a circuit court \nnominee and a number of district court nominees.\n  Since the Senate's reorganization last July, we have convened \njudicial nominations hearings each and every month. I mention that \nbecause, by contrast, in the 72 months that the Republican majority \nmost recently controlled scheduling such hearings, in 30 of those \nmonths no hearings were held at all, and in another 34 months only one \nhearing was held.\n  Yesterday we held our 12th hearing since July. If we are able to keep \npace, we will hold more hearings this session than were held in any of \nthe 6\\1/2\\ years of Republican control and more than twice as many as \nwere held in some of those years.\n  Secondly, we will include hearings for a number of controversial \nnominees who do not have a blue slip problem. We will convene a hearing \nthe week after next on the nomination of Charles W. Pickering for the \nFifth Circuit Court of Appeals. I fully expect we will also have \nhearings on other nominations for which consensus will be difficult, \nincluding such nominees as Judge Priscilla Owen, Professor Michael \nMcConnell, and Miguel Estrada.\n  Third, we will continue to seek a cooperative and constructive \nworking relationship not only with our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle but also with the White House. I ask the White\n\n[[Page S120]]\n\nHouse to help make the confirmation process more orderly and less \nantagonistic, and thus make it more productive.\n  Finding our way forward out of the legacy of the last 6 years is \ngoing to require some White House cooperation. The President represents \none of our three branches of Government. We in the Senate represent \none. We are talking about working together in matters that affect our \nthird branch. I take very seriously the advise and consent clause of \nthe Constitution. It does not say: Advise and rubberstamp. It says \nadvise and consent. The distinguished Presiding Officer, the President \npro tempore, knows better than anybody else in this body the kind of \ndebate that went on at the founding of this country on the \nconstitutional requirement of advice and consent. Our Founders made \nvery sure we, the people, had a voice in these appointments. This is a \ndemocracy, not a regency.\n\n  I will strive--whether we have a Democratic President or a Republican \nPresident--to uphold the right, and not just the right, the duty of the \nSenate, to fulfill its advise and consent role. It is one of the most \nimportant roles this body has ever had because it is exclusively in \nthis great Chamber, in this great body. Senators really do not follow \ntheir oath of office if they do not uphold that right and that \nprivilege and that duty of advice and consent.\n  I have heard the distinguished Presiding Officer speak of the number \nof Presidents with whom he has served. He very correctly has pointed \nout, we do not serve under a President, we serve with a President.\n  I have enormous respect for all Presidents I have served with, \nRepublicans and Democrats. They are a major part of our Democratic \nframework. Whoever is President carries an awesome burden and should be \nhelped in carrying out that burden. But we carry an awesome burden on \nadvice and concept, as well. Let us try to bring the duties and rights \nand obligations at one end of Pennsylvania Avenue closer to the duties \nand rights and obligations at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue and \nsee how we might work together.\n  So today I ask the President, for his part, to consider several \nsteps, each of which makes a tangible improvement in the consideration \nof judicial nominations.\n  First, the most progress can be made quickly if the White House would \nbegin working with home State Senators to identify fair-minded, \nnonideological, consensus nominees to fill these court vacancies.\n  One of the reasons that the committee and the Senate were able to \nwork as rapidly as we did in confirming now 30 judges in the last few \nmonths was because those nominations were strongly supported as \nconsensus nominees by people from across the political and legal \nspectrums.\n  I have heard of too many situations, in too many States, involving \ntoo many reasonable and constructive home State Senators, in which the \nWhite House has shown no willingness to work cooperatively to find \ncandidates to fill vacancies. The White House's unilateralism is not \nthe way the process is intended to work. It is not the way the process \nhas worked under past administrations. I urge the White House to show \ngreater inclusiveness and flexibility and to help make this a truly \nbipartisan enterprise.\n  Logjams persist in several settings, the legacy of the last 6 years. \nTo make real progress, the White House and the Senate should work \ntogether to repair the damage and move forward.\n  As I said before, the Constitution directs the President to seek the \nSenate's advice and consent in his appointments to the Federal courts. \nThe lack of effort on the advice side of that obligation gives rise to \na general impression, heightened by the White House's refusal to work \ncooperatively with some home State Democratic Senators, and by its \nunwillingness to listen to suggestions to continue the bipartisan \ncommissions that have been a tradition, for years, in many States, that \nthe White House and some in the Senate are intent on an ideological \ntakeover of our courts.\n  With the circuits so evenly split in so many places, nominees to the \nCourts of Appeals may have a significant impact on the development of \nthe law for decades to come. Some of us are concerned that there not be \na rollback in the protections of individual rights, civil rights, \nworkers' rights, consumers' rights, business rights, privacy rights, \nand environmental protection.\n\n  Secondly, I ask the President to reconsider his early decision on \npeer review vetting. It has needlessly added months to the time \nrequired to begin the hearing process for each nominee. For more than \n50 years, the American Bar Association was able to conduct its peer \nreviews simultaneously with the FBI background check procedures. As I \nsaid earlier, that meant that when nominations were sent to the Senate, \nthe FBI report and the ABA report were sent at approximately the same \ntime, and we could start moving forward to review nominations and \nschedule hearings from that day.\n  We had occasions last year when we proceeded with hearings with fewer \nDistrict Court nominees than I would have liked because recent \nnominees' files were not yet complete. I worry that same problem will \nbe repeated this year.\n  For example, in relation to the FBI and the ABA background materials \non the 24 District Court nominations that we received in the last day \nor so, we are not going to have all that material until March or April. \nThat is regrettable. It was avoidable. We could have had it all here \ntoday so we could start reviewing those nominations and considering \nthem for hearing agendas right away.\n  Now, no Senator is bound by the recommendations of the ABA. And I \nwould never suggest that a Senator be bound by that. Each Senator is \nbound by their own conscience and their own sense of what is right. But \nthe White House can make it clear that it is not bound either but that \nit is restoring a traditional practice--not because it intends to be \nbound by the results of that peer review but solely to remove an \nelement of delay that it had inadvertently introduced into the \nconfirmation process.\n  The White House can expressly ask the ABA, if they want, not to send \nthe results of its peer reviews to the executive but only to transmit \nthem to the committee. Few actions available to either the Senate or \nthe White House could make as constructive a contribution as would the \nPresident's resolution of this problem. I ask him to seriously and \nthoughtfully consider taking it. It would take 1 minute of decision; it \nwould save months of time.\n  In conclusion, whether we succeed in improving the confirmation \nprocess is going to depend in large measure on whether our goals are \nshared by Republican Senators and the White House. We will not have \nrepaired the damage that has been done if we make progress this year \nand the improvements we are able to make are not institutionalized and \ncontinued the next time a Democratic President or, for that matter, a \ndifferent Republican President is the one making judicial nominations.\n  In the statements I have heard and read from the Republican side, I \nhave not heard them concede any shortcomings in the practices they \nemployed over the previous 6\\1/2\\ years, even though since the change \nin majority last summer, we have exceeded their pace and productivity \nover the prior 6\\1/2\\ years. If their efforts were acceptable or \npraiseworthy as some would argue, I would expect them to commend our \nbetter efforts since last July.\n  If they did things they now regret, their admissions would go far in \nhelping establish a common basis of understanding and comparison. \nTaking that step would be a significant gesture. It is something that \nhas not yet occurred. I wish it would.\n  Whether it occurs or not, I want to move forward. The nominees voted \non this morning and those included at our most recent hearings \nyesterday are clear evidence, again, that consensus nominees with \nwidespread bipartisan support are more easily and quickly considered by \nthe committee and confirmed by the Senate. I believe there was not a \nsingle vote against either of the judges confirmed today.\n  There are still far too many judicial vacancies. We have to work \ntogether to fill them. We have finally begun moving the confirmation \nand vacancy numbers in the right directions. The way forward is \ndifficult. Democrats alone cannot achieve what should be our common \ngoal of regaining the ground lost over the last 6 years. But all of us \ntogether can achieve that. I invite each with a role in this process to \njoin that effort.\n\n[[Page S121]]\n\n  If I could close on a personal note, as I said before, the ranking \nmember of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the senior Senator from Utah, \nis a close personal friend. I have been in the position of ranking \nmember of that committee while he was chairman. I know many times he \nhad to urge actions to move forward, actions with which many in his \ncaucus did not agree. But he did, and I commend him for it. For my \npart, I pledge, during this year or whatever time I am chairman, to \nmeet on a regular basis with my friend from Utah to try to iron out as \nmany problems as we can. I believe there is a mutual respect between \nthe two of us. But I would also urge the White House to realize that \nthey do not act in a vacuum, to understand it is a democracy, to take a \nmoment to reread the advice and consent clause. Let us work together. \nThings will go a lot faster and a lot better that way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. LEAHY). The distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I don't want to take this time to engage in \nstatistical judo on judicial nominees. I personally have appreciated \nour chairman and the work he did last year. We are friends, and I \nintend to work very closely with him. Hopefully we can put through a \nlot of judges this year, as we did for President Clinton in his second \nyear.\n  Mr. President, the record is clear. Here are the true facts, the \nnumbers for the first years and for the current session. I gave an \nextensive speech at the end of last year, and it shows where we stand \ntoday and what we did to establish a near record with 377 Clinton \njudges. That is five fewer than for President Reagan, the all-time \nchampion of confirmed judges. I can say, categorically, there would \nhave been at least three more than what President Reagan had, had it \nnot been for holds on the Democrat side of the Chamber. So the all-time \nchampion would have been William Jefferson Clinton as President. The \nDemocrats, not the Republicans, stopped the approximately eight or nine \nadditional Clinton nominees who otherwise would have been confirmed.\n  Sometimes it was for petty reasons that holds were put on. But the \nfact is that holds came from the other side. One thing we did not do is \napply any litmus test. Today, some special interest groups are urging \nthe Democrats to apply one. Had we Republicans applied an abortion \nlitmus test to President Clinton's nominees, perhaps fewer than a dozen \njudges would have gone through. If the Senate were to get into the \nlitmus test game, we would certainly hurt this body and this country a \ngreat deal. Everyone knows that when we elect a President, we are \nchoosing the person who has the power to pick the judges in this \ncountry. As long as the President's nominees are qualified, the Senate \nought to approve the President's judges.\n  There were a variety of reasons that prevented several of President \nClinton's nominees from getting confirmed, including some who lacked \nthe support of their home State Senators. But the overall record makes \nclear that we were fair. As my colleague, Senator Leahy, said, our job \nwas not to simply rubberstamp President Clinton's judges. The current \nPresident does not expect a rubber stamp either. So, mere numbers and \nstatistics--as my distinguished chairman, the Senator from Vermont, \nlisted--do not give the full picture because they do not explain the \nreasons in particular cases. And our current President has been more \ndeliberative, more cooperative in his selection, evaluation, and \nnomination of judges than any other President while I have been serving \nin the Senate.\n  I have to be honest, I am concerned about the tone I have heard \ntoday. But I still remain cautiously optimistic that the Senate will do \nthe right thing with regard to judges, and I keep hope alive that this \nbitter tone on judicial nominees will subsist. I think we are above \nthat.\n  At the outset of the second session of the 107th Congress, we have an \nopportunity in the Senate to make a real difference in the \nadministration of justice in this country. This opportunity is the \nchance to halt the vacancy crisis that presently plagues the Federal \ncourts. A new congressional session provides many opportunities to make \nchanges and allocate our time to those matters most pressing. Our \nNation is facing many great challenges, ranging from threats of \nterrorism at home and abroad to the struggling economy. We have a lot \nof work to do.\n  One of the most pressing matters we must address this session is the \nvacancy crisis in the Federal court system. I was interested in some of \nthe statistics my colleague from Vermont gave. In 1992, the Democrats \ncontrolled the Senate and therefore the Senate Judiciary Committee. On \nelection day 1992, when William Jefferson Clinton was elected President \nof the United States, there were 97 vacancies and 54 of President \nBush's nominees left hanging without a vote. (Some of those 54 \nneglected nominees have now been renominated by the current President \nBush.) Of the 54, there were about 6 who were nominated so late in the \nsession that there wasn't really an opportunity on the part of Senator \nBiden or the committee to confirm them. So, really, 48 were left \nhanging without a vote. By contrast, when George W. Bush was elected \nPresident, there were 67 vacancies--30 fewer than eight years earlier \nwhen the Democrats controlled the Senate Judiciary Committee. And for \nthose 67 vacancies, there were 41 nominees left hanging. In other \nwords, the Republicans left 13 fewer nominees than the Democrats did. \nBut, of the 41, 9 were nominated so late in that session that there was \nno chance any Judiciary Committee chairman could have gotten them \nthrough. So, in essence, there were 32 nominees that did not get voted \non at the end of the Clinton Administration.\n  The fact is that 32, contrasted with the 48 that the Democrats left \nhanging when they controlled the Senate, is a pretty good record. It \nwas the best we could do given the individual circumstances presented. \nA couple were held up because of home State Senators. I could not solve \nthat problem. Neither could Senator Leahy. There were some who were \nheld up because of further investigation that had to be made and \nquestions that had arisen. Some were held up because of other matters \nin the FBI reports or problems that existed that we could not solve \nbefore election day.\n  On January 1 of this year, Supreme Court Chief Justice William \nRehnquist released his 2001 year-end report on the Federal judiciary. I \nask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             2001 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary\n\n\n                              i. overview\n\n       The 2001 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary is my \n     16th. 2001 will surely be remembered by the entire country, \n     including the federal Judiciary, for the terrorist attacks of \n     September 11 and the anthrax contamination that followed.\n       I received word of the first strike on the World Trade \n     Center as the 26 federal judges who are members of the \n     Judicial Conference of the United States were preparing to \n     convene at the Supreme Court the morning of September 11. It \n     soon became clear that we would have to cancel the Conference \n     session and evacuate the building, the first cancellation of \n     a Conference meeting since its creation in 1922.\n       Just six and a half weeks later, our Court was forced to \n     evacuate the building again after traces of anthrax were \n     found in our off-site mail facility. For the first time since \n     our building opened in 1935, the Court heard arguments in \n     another location--the ceremonial courtroom in the District of \n     Columbia E. Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse. The Court \n     was also forced out of its quarters in the Capitol when the \n     British burned part of the Capitol building in August 1814.\n       Despite the effects of events since September 11, the \n     federal courts, along with the rest of our government, have \n     gotten back to business, even if not business as usual. Our \n     Court has kept its argument schedule, federal (and state) \n     courts have met, albeit with heightened security, and within \n     three weeks, the Judicial Conference completed by mail all of \n     the business that had been on the schedule for September 11 \n     and that could not be postponed.\n\n\n    ii. ensuring a well-qualified and fully staffed judicial branch\n\n       The federal courts were created by the Judiciary Act of \n     1789, which established a Supreme Court and divided the \n     country into three circuits and 13 districts. This structure \n     has obviously changed greatly since 1789, but one thing has \n     not changed: the federal courts have functioned through wars, \n     natural disasters, and terrorist attacks. During times such \n     as these, the role of the courts becomes even more important \n     in order to enforce the rule of law. To continue functioning \n     effectively and efficiently, however, the courts must be \n     appropriately staffed. This means\n\n[[Page S122]]\n\n     that necessary judgeships must be created and judicial \n     vacancies must be timely filled with well-qualified \n     candidates.\n\n                   Promptly filling vacant judgeships\n\n       It is becoming increasingly difficult to find qualified \n     candidates for federal judicial vacancies. This is \n     particularly true in the case of lawyers in private practice. \n     There are two reasons for these difficulties: the relatively \n     low pay that federal judges receive, compared to the amount \n     that a successful, experienced practicing lawyer can make, \n     and the often lengthy and unpleasant nature of the \n     confirmation process.\n       Of the inadequacy of judicial pay I have spoken again and \n     again, without much result. Judges along with Congress have \n     received a cost-of-living adjustment this year, and for this \n     they are grateful. But a COLA only keeps judges from falling \n     further behind the median income of the profession. I can \n     only refer back to what I have previously said on this \n     subject.\n       I spoke to delays in the confirmation process in my annual \n     report in 1997. Then as now I recognize that part of the \n     problem is endemic to the size of the federal Judiciary. With \n     more judges, there are more retirements and more vacancies to \n     fill. But as I said in 1997, ``[w]hatever the size of the \n     federal judiciary, the President should nominate candidates \n     with reasonable promptness, and the Senate should act within \n     a reasonable time to confirm or reject them. Some current \n     nominees have been waiting a considerable time for a Senate \n     Judiciary Committee vote or a final floor vote. The Senate \n     confirmed only 17 judges in 1996 and 36 in 1997, well under \n     the 101 judges it confirmed during 1994.''\n       At that time, President Clinton, a Democrat, made the \n     nominations, and the Senate, controlled by the Republicans, \n     was responsible for the confirmation process. Now the \n     political situation is exactly the reverse, but the same \n     situation obtains: the Senate confirmed only 28 judges during \n     2001. When the Senate adjourned on December 20th, 23 court of \n     appeals nominees and 14 district court nominees were left \n     awaiting action by the Judiciary Committee or the full \n     Senate. When I spoke to this issue in 1997, there were 82 \n     judicial vacancies; when the Senate adjourned on December \n     20th there were 94 vacancies. The Senate ought to act with \n     reasonable promptness and to vote each nominee up or down. \n     The Senate is not, of course, obliged to confirm any \n     particular nominee. But it ought to act on each nominee and \n     to do so within a reasonable time. I recognize that the \n     Senate has been faced with many challenges this year, but I \n     urge prompt attention to the challenge of bringing the \n     federal judicial branch closer to full staffing.\n       The combination of inadequate pay and a drawn-out and \n     uncertain confirmation process is a handicap to judicial \n     recruitment across the board, but it most significantly \n     restricts the universe of lawyers in private practice who are \n     willing to be nominated for a federal judgeship. United \n     States attorneys, public defenders, federal magistrate and \n     bankruptcy judges, and state court judges are often nominated \n     to be district judges. For them the pay is a modest \n     improvement and the confirmation process at least does not \n     damage their current income. Most academic lawyers are in a \n     similar situation. But for lawyers coming directly from \n     private practice, there is both a strong financial \n     disincentive and the possibility of losing clients in the \n     course of the wait for a confirmation vote.\n       Former magistrate, bankruptcy, and state court judges, as \n     well as prosecutors and public defenders, have served ably as \n     federal district and circuit judges, bringing their insights \n     into the process gained from experience. But we have never \n     had, and should not want, a Judiciary composed only of those \n     persons who are already in the public service. It would too \n     much resemble the judiciary in civil law countries, where a \n     law graduate may choose upon graduation to enter the \n     judiciary, and will thereafter gradually work his way up over \n     time. The result is a judiciary quite different from our \n     common law system, with our practice of drawing on successful \n     members of the private bar to become judges. Reasonable \n     people, not merely here but in Europe, think that many civil \n     law judicial systems simply do not command the respect and \n     enjoy the independence of ours. We must not drastically \n     shrink the number of judicial nominees who have had \n     substantial experience in private practice.\n       The federal Judiciary has traditionally drawn from a wide \n     diversity of professional backgrounds, with many of our most \n     well-respected judges coming from private practice. As to the \n     Supreme Court, Justice Louis D. Brandeis, who was known as \n     ``the people's attorney'' for his pro bono work, spent his \n     entire career in private practice before he was named to the \n     Supreme Court in 1916 by President Wilson. Justice John \n     Harlan served in several government posts early in his \n     career, but the lion's share of his experience prior to his \n     nomination by President Eisenhower in 1954 was in private \n     practice. When appointed to the Court of Appeals for the \n     Second Circuit, a year before his appointment to the Supreme \n     Court, Justice Harlan succeeded Judge Augustus Hand. Judge \n     Hand and his cousin, Learned Hand, are well known as great \n     court of appeals judges; both spent virtually all the time \n     between their graduation from law school and their \n     appointment as federal judges in private practice. Retired \n     Justice Byron White, who played professional football for \n     the Detroit Lions on the weekends while attending Yale Law \n     School, was in private practice in Colorado for nearly 14 \n     years before joining the Justice Department as deputy \n     attorney general to Robert Kennedy. Less than a year \n     later, President Kennedy named Justice White to the Court. \n     Justice White was the circuit Justice for the Tenth \n     Circuit, where Judge Alfred P. Murrah served as a district \n     judge in Oklahoma and as a judge on the court of appeals. \n     Judge Murrah, who spent his entire career in private \n     practice before becoming a judge, is remembered for much \n     more than having the Oklahoma City federal building named \n     after him. Before being named a judge on the Court of \n     Appeals for the Second Circuit, Justice Thurgood Marshall \n     spent his career in the private sector. He first opened \n     his own law practice in Baltimore and then for many years \n     worked as the top lawyer for the NAACP, becoming known as \n     ``Mr. Civil Rights.'' Justice Marshall left his seat on \n     the court of appeals to become Solicitor General of the \n     United States before President Johnson named him to the \n     Supreme Court in 1967. John Brown, Richard Rives, Elbert \n     Tuttle and John Minor Wisdom, well-known for their courage \n     in enforcing this Court's civil rights decisions as judges \n     on the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, all served \n     almost exclusively in private practice before their \n     appointments to the bench.\n       On behalf of the Judiciary, I ask Congress to raise the \n     salaries of federal judges, and I ask the Senate to schedule \n     up or down votes on judicial nominees within a reasonable \n     time after receiving the nomination.\n\n                   Creating necessary new judgeships\n\n       Last year I expressed hope that the 107th Congress would \n     take action on the Judicial Conference's request to establish \n     10 additional court of appeals judgeships, 44 additional \n     district court judgeships and 24 new bankruptcy judgeships. \n     No additional court of appeals judgeships have been created \n     since 1990. No new bankruptcy judgeships have been created \n     since 1992, although the number of cases filed has increased \n     by nearly 500,000 since then. The 107th Congress has not \n     created a single new judgeship.\n       Despite a significant increase in workload, the Courts of \n     Appeals for the First, Second, and Ninth Circuits have not \n     increased in size for 17 years--since 1984. During that time \n     period, appellate filings in the First Circuit have risen \n     65%, in the Second Circuit they have risen almost 58%, and in \n     the Ninth Circuit appellate filings have almost doubled--\n     rising 94.6%. The Judicial Conference has asked that the \n     Congress create one new appellate judgeship for the First \n     Circuit, two judgeships for the Second Circuit, five for the \n     Ninth Circuit and two for the Sixth Circuit, which has had \n     only one additional judgeship since 1984.\n       Congress has recognized the crisis faced by the \n     overwhelming caseloads in the Southwestern border states. \n     Although we are thankful that Congress has provided \n     additional judges during the 106th Congress for four of the \n     five affected districts, it has not alleviated the very \n     serious problem faced by the Southern District of California, \n     based in San Diego, a district with no judicial vacancies. \n     The judges there have the highest number of filings per judge \n     of any federal district court in the nation and the Judicial \n     Conference has requested that eight additional district \n     judgeships be created for this district.\n       I urge the Congress to act on all of the pending requests \n     for new judgeships during its next session.\n\n\n                 III. International Judicial Exchanges\n\n       The federal Judiciary continues to play a vital role in the \n     development of independent judicial systems in countries \n     around the world. This year over 800 representatives from \n     more than 40 foreign judicial systems formally visited the \n     Supreme Court of the United States seeking information about \n     our system of justice.\n       On September 25, 2001, I led a small delegation \n     representing the federal Judiciary on a judicial exchange in \n     Guanajuato, Mexico. The visit was at the invitation of Genaro \n     David Gongora Pimentel, President of the Mexican Supreme \n     Court, and followed a similar visit to Washington by a \n     Mexican delegation in November 1999. Our traveling to Mexico \n     within two weeks of the September 11 attacks underscored the \n     importance of this exchange. I am grateful to President \n     Gongora Pimentel and his colleagues for their invitation to \n     meet with them in Mexico and for their commitment to \n     strengthening cross-border judicial relations in North \n     America.\n       The visit brought home not only the close connections of \n     our two countries, but the importance of working with other \n     judiciaries to improve the functioning of all judicial \n     systems. The Federal Judicial Center, the Administrative \n     Office of the United States Courts, and the International \n     Judicial Relations Committee of the Judicial Conference have \n     also provided many international visitors with information, \n     education, and technical assistance to improve the \n     administration and independence of foreign courts and enhance \n     the rule of law. Through these judicial exchanges, we also \n     gain valuable insights into our own judicial system by \n     exchanging information with foreign visitors and by visiting \n     foreign courts. Improving the administration of justice--here \n     and in other courts around the world--have become even more \n     important in the age of the global economy.\n\n[[Page S123]]\n\n                         IV. The Year in Review\n\n                 The Supreme Court of the United States\n\n       The work of the Supreme Court continues to grow modestly, \n     putting an increasing strain on the Supreme Court's building, \n     the infrastructure of which has not been changed in any basic \n     way since the building was opened in 1935. I wish to thank \n     Chairman Byrd, Ranking Minority Member Stevens, Chairman \n     Young, Ranking Minority Member Obey, Chairman Hollings, \n     Ranking Minority Member Gregg, Chairman Wolf, and Ranking \n     Minority Member Serrano for their efforts to secure funds to \n     modernize our Supreme Court building. I am hopeful that the \n     remaining funds necessary to implement our building \n     modernization program, which has been in the planning stage \n     for several years, will be included in our Fiscal Year 2003 \n     appropriation. Significant safety and security upgrades to \n     the Supreme Court building are included in the project and \n     should not be delayed.\n       The total number of case filings in the Supreme Court \n     increased from 7,377 in the 1999 Term to 7,852 in the 2000 \n     Term--an increase of 6.4%. Filings in the Court's in forma \n     pauperis docket increased from 5,282 to 5,897--an 11.6% rise. \n     The Court's paid docket decreased by 138 cases, from 2,092 to \n     1,954--a 6.6% decline. During the 2000 Term, 86 cases were \n     argued and 83 were disposed of in 77 signed opinions, \n     compared to 83 cases argued and 79 disposed of in 74 signed \n     opinions in the 1999 Term. No cases from the 2000 Term were \n     scheduled for reargument in the 2001 Term. Although the \n     closing of our building did not delay any scheduled \n     arguments, the interruption in mail delivery in the \n     Washington area may have an impact on the number of cases \n     heard by the Court this Term.\n\n                      The Federal Courts' caseload\n\n       In Fiscal Year 2001, filings in the 12 regional courts of \n     appeals rose 5% to 57,464--a new all-time high.\\1\\ Civil \n     filings in the U.S. district courts fell 3% to 258,517,\\2\\ \n     and, after six consecutive years of growth, the number of \n     criminal cases and defendants declined slightly.\\3\\ The \n     essentially static level of criminal filings was reflected in \n     a 1% gain in the number of defendants activated in the \n     pretrial services system.\\4\\ The number of persons on \n     probation and supervised release went up by 4% to an all-time \n     high of 104,715.\\5\\ Filings in the U.S. bankruptcy courts \n     climbed 14% from 1,262,102 to 1,437,354, following two years \n     of decline.\\6\\\n\n\n        v. the administrative office of the united states courts\n\n       The Administrative Office of the United States Courts \n     serves as the central support agency for the administration \n     of the federal court system. In light of the terrorist \n     attacks of September 11 and the ensuing anthrax \n     contamination, the Administrative Office played a pivotal \n     role in ensuring that the federal courts around the country \n     had effective security precautions and mail-screening \n     procedures in place. An emergency response team was convened \n     to work with the staff of the affected courts in New York to \n     get communications and computer systems working and to return \n     the courts to normal operations as soon as possible. In \n     November 2001, Administrative Office Director Leonidas Ralph \n     Mecham created a Judiciary Emergency Preparedness Office to \n     focus on the planning aspects of crisis response.\n       Even before September 11, court security was a high \n     priority. A study of the court security program by \n     independent security experts was completed in November. The \n     consultants concluded that although there have been \n     substantial improvements in court security over the last two \n     decades, security needs continue to grow. They recommended \n     options or enhancing the physical security of courthouses, \n     addressing security needs during court proceedings, improving \n     the protection of judges in and outside the courthouse, and \n     conducting background checks on employees. The Judicial \n     Conference's Committee on Security and Facilities and the \n     Administrative Office are currently reviewing the report's \n     recommendations.\n       One of the Administrative Office's key priorities is to \n     secure adequate funding from Congress so that the federal \n     courts can carry out their critical work and maintain the \n     quality of justice. Director Mecham, Judge John Heyburn II, \n     chair of the Judicial Conference's Budget Committee, and \n     Judge Jane Roth, chair of the Security and Facilities \n     Committee, deserve credit for their efforts in this area. The \n     funding provided to the courts for fiscal year 2002 \n     represents a 7.1% increase and will provide the courts \n     adequate staff (including probation and pretrial services \n     offices) to meet growing workloads. I want to express thanks \n     to the Congress for funding an increase in the rates of pay \n     for private ``panel'' attorneys accepting appointments under \n     the Criminal Justice Act of $90 per hour. This has been a \n     high priority for the Judiciary for several years. I am \n     also pleased to report that Congress has continued to \n     provide significant funds for the courthouse construction \n     program, funding 15 needed courthouse construction \n     projects costing $280 million.\n       Last year, an independent consultant concluded that the \n     Judiciary is making effective use of technology and that it \n     is doing so with fewer resources invested in technology when \n     compared with other organizations. The Administrative Office \n     continues to develop and implement automated systems that \n     will enhance the management and processing of information and \n     the performance of court business functions. Deployment of a \n     new bankruptcy court case management/electronic case files \n     system began this year, and it is now operating in 14 \n     bankruptcy courts. The system's electronic case files \n     capabilities include the ability to receive and file \n     documents over the Internet. The creation of electronic files \n     will reduce the volume of paper records and make these \n     records more readily accessible. Testing of the district \n     court case management/electronic case files system began in \n     2001, and development work on the appellate court system is \n     underway.\n       Under the guidance of the Judicial Conference's Committee \n     on Court Administration and Case Management, the \n     Administrative Office completed a two-year study on how to \n     balance privacy concerns with the rights of the public to \n     access court electronic records. After extensive public \n     comment, the Committee recommended that civil case documents \n     be made available electronically to the same extent they are \n     available at the courthouse (except that certain personal \n     identifiers will be partially redacted). A similar policy \n     will be followed for bankruptcy case documents assuming \n     necessary statutory changes are enacted. The Committee \n     recommended that there be no electronic access to documents \n     in criminal cases at this time. These policies were endorsed \n     by the Judicial Conference in September, and several \n     Conference Committees, supported by Administrative Office \n     staff, are currently working to implement them.\n       A review of the Judiciary's use of libraries, lawbooks, and \n     legal research materials--both hard copy and electronic--was \n     completed in 2001. While the use of on-line legal resource \n     materials is expanding and continues to show promise for \n     increased use, the study concluded that a clear and \n     compelling need continues to exist for lawbooks and other \n     legal research materials in hard-copy format. The Judicial \n     Conference adopted recommendations to control costs further \n     and to improve the management of court libraries.\n\n\n                    vi. the federal judicial center\n\n       The Federal Judicial Center, the federal courts' statutory \n     agency for education and research, last year provided \n     education to some 50,000 participants in traditional and \n     distance education programs and continued its research and \n     analysis to improve the litigation process. A few highlights \n     of the Center's work in 2001 follow.\n       Science and technology. Litigation is increasingly \n     dominated by scientific and technical evidence. The Center's \n     efforts to help judges included its acclaimed Reference \n     Manual on Scientific Evidence, now in its second edition, and \n     a six-part Federal Judicial Television Network series, \n     Science in the Courtroom, on principles of microbiology, \n     epidemiology, and toxicology, and how to manage cases \n     involving these types of evidence. Other judicial education \n     programs dealt with genetics, the human aging process, \n     astrophysics, and the impact of computer technology on the \n     law of intellectual property.\n       To assist federal judges in dealing with the sophisticated \n     technology many attorneys use to present evidence, the Center \n     provided federal judges its Effective Use of Courtroom \n     Technology: A Judge's Guide to Pretrial and Trial, developed \n     in cooperation with the National Institute for Trial \n     Advocacy. It also provided judges a Guide to the Management \n     of Cases in ADR, which it prepared in light of the growing \n     use of alternatives to traditional litigation.\n       Management skills for federal courts in uncertain times. \n     Center programs responded to another challenge facing the \n     courts: the need for leadership skills and management \n     practices befitting the complex organizations that federal \n     courts have become. Courts must integrate technology with \n     increasingly sophisticated business practices, and deal with \n     growing caseloads and diverse workforces and litigants, while \n     pursuing their overarching purpose to deliver justice for \n     all.\n       Demystifying the legal process. The Center assisted the \n     Judicial Conference's Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules \n     of Civil Procedure with a different type of challenge. The \n     Committee has proposed a requirement that attorneys use \n     ``plain language'' in the notices they send to potential \n     class members in class action suits and asked the Center to \n     develop illustrative language as examples. The Center tested \n     alternative workings with focus groups of ordinary citizens \n     typical of class members. This testing explored recipients' \n     willingness to open and read a notice as well as their \n     ability to comprehend and apply the information it contained. \n     From this research, the Center produced illustrative notices, \n     which remain on the Center's Web site (www.fic.gov) for \n     public comment and use.\n       International judicial cooperation. Given its international \n     reputation, the Center gets frequent visitors from other \n     countries seeking to create or enhance their judicial branch \n     research and education centers. Although it does not use its \n     own funds in responding to these requests, the Center has \n     been of assistance this year in important ways. It hosted \n     seminars or briefings of 422 foreign judges and officials \n     representing 34 countries. The Center also responded to more \n     specific requests for assistance. For example, a delegation \n     from the Russian Academy of Justice spent a week at the \n     Center attending a program on teaching methodology. Three \n     Center representatives traveled to Moscow for a follow-up \n     workshop focusing on distance learning and judicial this. \n     Center personnel also played an important role in the\n\n[[Page S124]]\n\n     U.S. delegation's visit to Mexico, which I described earlier, \n     and will continue that relationship by organizing a seminar \n     next May in Washington for interchange with Mexican judicial \n     educators.\n\n\n              VII. The United States Sentencing Commission\n\n       On May 1, 2001, the newly reconstituted United States \n     Sentencing Commission completed its first full sentencing \n     guidelines amendment cycle and submitted to Congress a \n     package of guidelines amendments covering 26 areas. This \n     package of amendment resolved 19 circuit conflicts and \n     included responses to nine new congressional directives (five \n     with emergency amendment authority). For the first time in \n     years, there are no congressional directives awaiting \n     implementation by the Commission.\n       The amendment include a multi-part, comprehensive economic \n     crimes package with a new loss table that significantly \n     increases penalties for crimes involving high-dollar loss \n     amounts, but gives judges greater discretion in sentencing \n     defendants convicted of crimes with relatively low loss \n     amounts. The amendments also increase the penalties for \n     ecstasy and amphetamine trafficking; counterfeiting; high-\n     dollar fraud offenses; child sex offenses; and the use of \n     nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. The Commission \n     also expanded eligibility for first-time, non-violent \n     offenders to obtain relief under the guidelines' ``safety \n     valve'' provision and it clarified that participants who play \n     a limited role in a crime are eligible for an adjustment \n     to their sentences under the guidelines ``mitigating \n     role'' provision. The guidelines went into effect November \n     1, 2001.\n       On June 19, 2001, the Sentencing Commission held a public \n     hearing in Rapid City, South Dakota, in response to the March \n     2000 Report of the South Dakota Advisory Committee to the \n     U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, which recommended that an \n     assessment of the impact of the federal sentencing guidelines \n     on Native Americans in South Dakota be undertaken. As a \n     result of suggestions made at the hearing and subsequent \n     written submissions, the Commission is forming an ad hoc \n     advisory group on issues related to the impact of the Federal \n     Sentencing Guidelines on Native Americans in Indian Country.\n       The Tenth Annual National Seminar on the Federal Sentencing \n     Guidelines, co-sponsored by the Commission and the Federal \n     Bar Association, was held May 16-18, 2001, in Palm Springs, \n     California. More than 400 federal judges, U.S. probation \n     officers, and attorneys attended. During fiscal year 2001, \n     Commission staff also participated in training for thousands \n     of individuals at training sessions across the country \n     (including ongoing programs sponsored by the Federal Judicial \n     Center and other agencies). Commission staff continue to work \n     with the Federal Judicial Center and the Administrative \n     Office to plan and develop educational and informational \n     programming for the Federal Judicial Television Network. \n     During the year, the Commission's ``Helpline'' provided \n     assistance to approximately 200 callers per month.\n       Finally, congratulations are due to Sentencing Commission \n     Chair Diana E. Murphy who, together with Judge Frank M. \n     Coffin of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, \n     received the 19th Annual Edward J. Devitt Distinguished \n     Service to Justice Award on September 10, 2001. This award \n     recognizes Article III judges who have achieved exemplary \n     careers and have made significant contributions to the \n     administration of justice, the advancement of the rule of \n     law, and the improvement of society as a whole.\n\n\n                            VIII. Conclusion\n\n       Once again the Judiciary can look back upon the year ended \n     as one of accomplishments in the face of adversity. In spite \n     of the terrorist attacks that have affected the entire \n     country, our courts continue to conduct business, day in and \n     day out. We continue to find ways to perform our work more \n     efficiently.\n       Despite an alarming number of judicial vacancies, our \n     courts continue to serve as a standard of excellence around \n     the world. At bottom, federal judges are able to administer \n     justice day in and day out because of their commitment and \n     the commitment and hard work of court staff around the \n     country. My thanks go out to all of them.\n       I extend to all my wish for a happy New Year.\n\n\n                               end notes\n\n     \\1\\ Original proceedings surged 48%, largely as a result of a \n     rise in habeas corpus petitions filed by prisoners. Criminal \n     appeals grew 5%, administrative agency appeals increased 2%, \n     and civil appeals rose 1%. Bankruptcy appeals fell 5%. \n     Appeals filings have increased 22% since 1992.\n     \\2\\ Filings with the United States as plaintiff seeking the \n     recovery of student loans dropped 47%. New administrative \n     procedures implemented by the Department of Education led to \n     fewer such filings in the federal courts. Excluding student \n     loan filings, total civil filings increased 1%. Total private \n     case filings fell less than 1%. Filings related to federal \n     question litigation were consistent with the total decline in \n     private cases, falling less than 1% to 138,441. Diversity of \n     citizenship and civil rights filings each rose less than 1%. \n     Filings related to federal question litigation and diversity \n     of citizenship were greatly affected by the stabilization of \n     personal injury/product liability case filings related to \n     breast implants, oil refinery explosions, and asbestos. \n     Despite an 11% decrease in total filings with the United \n     States as plaintiff or defendant, filings with the United \n     States as defendant increased 10% to 40,644. This was mostly \n     due to a 23% surge in federal prisoner petitions and an 8% \n     rise in social security filings. Motions to vacate sentences \n     filed by federal prisoners grew by 36%. Social security \n     filings related to disability insurance and supplemental \n     security income rose 9% and 6%, respectively. Civil filings \n     have increased 9% since 1992.\n     \\3\\ Filings of criminal cases dropped by 37 cases to 62,708, \n     and the number of defendants decreased 1% to 83,252. As a \n     result of the creation of 10 additional Article III \n     judgeships, criminal cases per authorized district judgeship \n     declined from 96 to 94. This was the first decrease in cases \n     per judgeship since 1994, when the effects of a hiring freeze \n     on assistant U.S. attorneys was being felt. In succeeding \n     years, federal courts saw increases in criminal filings, \n     primarily due to immigration and drug law-related cases in \n     districts along the Southwestern border of the United States. \n     This year, drug cases rose 5% to 18,425, firearms cases rose \n     9% to set yet another record at 5,845, traffic cases rose 6% \n     to 4,958, robbery cases rose 8% to 1,355, and sex offense \n     cases rose 8% to 1,017. Immigration filings fell by 873 \n     cases, a 7% decline over last year due to fewer immigration \n     cases reported by the Western District of Texas, the Southern \n     District of California, and the District of New Mexico. \n     However, in the Western District of Texas and in the Southern \n     District of California, the decline in immigration filings \n     was offset by a rise in drug filings. As a result, overall \n     criminal filings increased 2% in the Western District of \n     Texas and declined 3% in the Southern District of California. \n     Criminal filings since 1992 have increased 30%.\n     \\4\\ In 2001, the number of defendants activated in the \n     pretrial services system increased 1% to 86,140, and the \n     number of pretrial reports prepared rose 1%. During the past \n     five years, pretrial services case activations and pretrial \n     reports prepared each rose 24%, persons interviewed grew 16%, \n     and defendants released on supervision increased 25%. \n     Pretrial case activations have risen each year since 1994, \n     and this year's total is 54% higher than that for 1994.\n     \\5\\ There is an average lag of several years before \n     defendants found guilty and sentenced to prison appear in the \n     probation numbers. Supervised release following a period of \n     incarceration continues to account for a growing percentage \n     of those under supervision and now stands at 65% of this \n     total. In contrast, the number of individuals on parole is \n     small and declining, composing only 4% of those under \n     supervision. Of the 104,715 persons under probation \n     supervision, 42% had been charged with a drug-related \n     offense. The number of persons on probation has increase 22% \n     since 1992.\n     \\6\\ Nonbusiness petitions rose 14% and business petitions \n     increased 7%. Filings increased under all chapters except \n     Chapter 12, jumping 17% under Chapter 7, rising 7% under \n     Chapter 11, and increasing 8% under Chapter 13. Bankruptcy \n     filings under Chapter 12, which constituted 0.03% of all \n     petitions filed, fell 31%. This decrease resulted from the \n     expiration of the provisions for Chapter 12 on July 1, 2000. \n     Subsequently, Public Law 107-8 extended the deadline for \n     filing Chapter 12 petitions to June 1, 2001, and Public Law \n     107-17 extended the deadline further to October 1, 2001. \n     Bankruptcy filings have increased 47% since 1992.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. In his report, the Chief Justice stressed the urgent need \nto fill vacancies promptly, particularly in light of the threats facing \nour Nation at present. He noted that although the structure and scope \nof the judiciary have changed dramatically since its creation in 1789,\n\n       [O]ne thing has not changed: The Federal courts have \n     functioned through wars, natural disasters, and terrorist \n     attacks. During times such as these, the role of the courts \n     becomes even more important in order to enforce the rule of \n     law. To continue functioning effectively and efficiently, \n     however, the courts must be appropriately staffed. This means \n     that necessary judgeships must be created and judicial \n     vacancies must be timely filled with well-qualified \n     candidates.\n\n  In light of the September 11 attacks, I share the Chief Justice's \nconcern about the potential impact of the vacancies on the Federal \njudiciary and our Nation's ability to fight the war on terrorism. \nFederal judges are instrumental in combating terrorism by presiding \nover hearings and trials and by imposing just sentences. What is more, \nthey play a crucial role in protecting civil liberties by ensuring that \nour law enforcement officials abide by the letter and the spirit of the \nlaw. In addition to their integral function in the criminal justice \nsystem, Federal judges preside over and decide civil cases that impact \neveryday business relationships.\n  Federal judges are tasked with preserving the rights of employers and \nworkers alike. They also provide the certainty of dispute resolution \nnecessary for future business and employment decisions. But when there \nis a shortage of Federal judges, criminal matters must understandably \ntake precedence due to speedy trial concerns and other concerns. The \nunintended consequence is that the American workers and their employers \nare left hanging in limbo when their cases are not being heard in a \ntimely manner.\n  Today, we have 99 judicial vacancies. This is a far cry from the \nappropriately staffed judiciary of which Chief Justice Rehnquist spoke. \nWhen the Chief Justice addressed the vacancy crisis in the 1997 year-\nend report, there were 82 empty seats on the Federal bench, nearly 20 \nfewer than the present situation. Commenting on the 1997 statistic, the \nWashington Post, in January 1998, in an editorial remarked:\n\n       The problem of judicial vacancies is getting out of hand. \n     Nearly 10 percent of the 846 seats on the Federal bench are \n     now empty.\n\n  One key Democratic Senator called these figures ``pretty \nfrightening,'' and said, ``If this continues, it becomes a \nconstitutional crisis.''\n  There are now 99 vacancies, or 17 more than when the editorial and \nthe\n\n[[Page S125]]\n\nstatements by the Democratic Senator were made. If 82 vacancies was a \nserious crisis in 1997, what do we have now with 99 vacancies?\n  We in the Senate have an opportunity to address this situation. We \ncan make a real difference in the administration of justice in this \ncountry simply by fulfilling our constitutional responsibilities of \nadvise and consent. In fact, Chief Justice Rehnquist specifically urged \nthe Senate ``to act with reasonable promptness and to vote each nominee \nup or down.''\n  He continued:\n\n       The Senate is not, of course, obliged to confirm any \n     particular nominee, but it ought to act on each nominee and \n     to do so within a reasonable time.\n\n  I could not agree more with the Chief Justice. This is precisely what \nI tried to accomplish as Judiciary Committee chairman while abiding by \nour customs and rules of the Senate. But now some of President Bush's \njudicial nominees have been waiting more than 8 months for a hearing. \nAll but a handful of them have had their blue slips returned. Their FBI \nbackground investigations are completed, and their ABA ratings are \nsubmitted.\n  At a time when our national security is at stake, we have a duty to \nfollow the Chief Justice's admonition and act promptly on these \nnominees. As we embark on the second session of this Congress, we in \nthe Senate have the perfect opportunity to do just this. I sincerely \nhope we accomplish this goal. I will continue to cooperate with our \nDemocratic chairman, and I hope the rhetoric on both sides of the aisle \nis cooled so we can confirm as many as possible of the highly qualified \nnominees pending before us.\n  A realistic yardstick of our success will be how President Bush's \nsecond year in office will compare to President Clinton's second year \nin office. In 1994, the second year of President Clinton's first term, \nthe Senate confirmed 100 judicial nominees. I was an integral part of \nthat. I worked very hard to get them confirmed. I had to override \npeople on my side of the aisle and convince some of them that the \nnominees should be confirmed. As a result of this work, there were only \n63 vacancies in the Federal judiciary when the Senate adjourned on \nDecember 1, 1994.\n  I am confident the Republicans and Democrats can work together to \nachieve or even hopefully exceed the goal of confirming 100 judges in \n2002, particularly the many circuit court nominees who are pending to \nfill emergency vacancies in the appellate courts around this country.\n  I have been gratified this morning to hear the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from Vermont that he wants to do that; that he \nwants to do the best he can, and that he believes we can. I think we \nare off to a good start.\n  There are two district court nominees awaiting a vote by the Senate \nafter today. Our first confirmation hearing was held yesterday. We have \nto keep up the pace of hearings and confirmation votes so we do not \nfall further behind in filling the vacancies that plague our Federal \njudiciary.\n  I look forward to working with our Democratic colleagues to \naccomplish this goal. Having said that, let me make this clear. We have \nhad a total confirmed since the distinguished chairman took over in the \nmiddle of last year of 30 judges. That means 6 circuit court nominees \nand 24 U.S. district court nominees. I commend my colleague. I think it \nis certainly a decent start.\n\n  On the other hand, we have currently pending 23 circuit court \nnominations--23. Most of them have well qualified ratings by the ABA. I \ndo not think anybody can make a case that they are not qualified to \nserve. Just to mention four: John Roberts was one of those nominees \nsubmitted by the first President Bush who was left hanging without \nSenate action back in 1992. Roberts is considered one of the top five \nappellate lawyers in the country. He is not an ideologue. He is \nprobably more conservative than most of the Clinton nominees were, but \nthe fact is he is a tremendously effective advocate and an excellent \nnominee for the court. He should not be held up any longer. He went \nthrough that back in 1992. Why does he have to go through it again, \nespecially for 8 months?\n  Miguel Estrada--I am pleased to hear the distinguished Senator from \nVermont indicate that he will have a hearing. Miguel Estrada is one of \nthe brightest people in law. He came from Honduras and attended \nColumbia University as an undergraduate. He graduated with honors and \nthen went on to Harvard Law School and graduated with honors there. He \nis considered one of the brightest people in law today, and, of course, \nhe is a very successful attorney. He is a Hispanic nominee that I think \nour colleagues should be pleased that the President has sent to the \nSenate.\n  Jeffrey Sutton is one of the best appellate lawyers in the country. \nHe has argued a number of cases in the Supreme Court, including in the \nlast few weeks. He is also a decent human being. He has very good \nratings from the ABA. He is a person we ought to put on the Circuit \nCourt of Appeals.\n  I am pleased the distinguished Senator from Vermont mentioned one of \nmy State's nominees, Michael McConnell. Michael McConnell is considered \none of the greatest constitutional experts in the country. I do not \nthink you can categorize him in any particular political pigeonhole. \nThis is a fair and circumspect man who is going to do a tremendous job \non the bench.\n  I asked one of the leading deans of a law school in the country, a \nvery liberal Democrat, what he thought of Michael McConnell. By the \nway, McConnell was tenured at the University of Chicago before moving \nto Utah to raise his family. He moved to the University of Utah where \nhe has been a pillar of good teaching ever since. When I asked the \nliberal dean, ``What do you think of Michael McConnell?'' he said these \nwords:\n\n       Senator, I've met two legal geniuses in my lifetime, and \n     Michael McConnell is one of them.\n\n  And he is. He is a great nominee.\n  There are other excellent nominees I would like to mention, but I do \nnot have enough time today.\n  We have 23 circuit court nominees pending. Many of them have been \nnominated to seats declared to be judicial emergencies by the \nAdministrative Office of the Courts.\n  Again, there are 23 U.S. circuit court judges pending, and 36 U.S. \ndistrict court judges, for a total of 60 who are awaiting action. I am \ngratified by my colleague from Vermont's expression that he wants to \nmove these nominees through the Senate process. It means a lot to me, \nand I compliment him for his comments today.\n  With regard to some of the statistics, we certainly disagree, and we \ncan both make our cases with regard to that. I did want to make some of \nthese points because, to me, it is very important that we make the \nrecord clear.\n  Mr. President, I am also pleased today we have confirmed two \nexcellent judicial nominations. These two nominees are Marcia Krieger \nand James Mahan. They were unanimously approved by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  I was gratified to see that done on December 13, and I expect the \nunanimous vote they received today tells everybody the Bush \nadministration is doing a good job on these judgeship nominees.\n  Our vote today on these two nominees, along with the nominations \nhearing Chairman Leahy held yesterday, in my opinion, is a step in the \nright direction. It is a good beginning to this session.\n  I think it is important to start our work early because we have a lot \nof work to do. As I said before, there are presently 99 vacancies in \nthe Federal judiciary, which represents a vacancy rate of almost 12 \npercent, one of the highest in history.\n  As Alberto Gonzalez, counsel to President Bush, says in today's Wall \nStreet Journal: The Federal courts desperately need reinforcements.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of Judge \nGonzalez' article be printed in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Jan. 25, 2002]\n\n                        The Crisis in Our Courts\n\n                         (By Alberto Gonzales)\n\n       Federal courts protect constitutional rights, resolve \n     critical civil cases, and ensure that criminals are punished. \n     But as Chief Justice William Rehnquist cautions, the ability \n     of our courts to perform these functions is in jeopardy due \n     to the ``alarming number'' of judicial vacancies, 101 as of \n     today.\n\n[[Page S126]]\n\n       President Bush has responded to the vacancy crisis by \n     nominating a record number of federal judges: 90 since taking \n     office, almost double the nominations that any of the past \n     six presidents submitted in the first year. Despite his \n     decisive action, the Senate has not done enough to meet its \n     constitutional responsibility. It has voted on less than half \n     of the nominees. Indeed, it has voted on only six of the 29 \n     nominees to the courts of appeals. And the Senate has failed \n     even to grant hearings to many nominees, who have languished \n     before the Judiciary Committee for months.\n       For example, on May 9, 2001, the president announced his \n     first 11 nominees. All were deemed ``well qualified'' or \n     ``qualified'' by the American Bar Association, whose rating \n     system Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy has called \n     the ``gold standard'' for evaluating nominees. Yet his \n     committee has held hearings for only three of the 11. \n     Although the Senate did confirm 28 judges last year, its \n     overall record was unsatisfactory, given the number of \n     vacancies and pending nominees.\n       As Congress returns to work, the administration \n     respectfully calls on the Senate to make the vacancy crisis a \n     priority and to ensure prompt hearings and votes for all \n     nominees. The Senate should make this practice permanent, \n     adhering to it well after President Bush leaves office, so as \n     to ensure that every judicial nominee by a president of \n     either party receives a prompt hearing and vote.\n       The federal courts desperately need reinforcements. There \n     are 101 vacancies out of 853 circuit and district court \n     judgeships. The 12 regional circuit courts of appeals have an \n     extraordinary 31 vacancies out of 167 judgeships (19%). The \n     chief justice recently warned of the dangerous impact the \n     vacancies have on the courts and the American people, and the \n     Judicial Conference has classified 39 vacancies as ``judicial \n     emergencies.''\n       In 1998, when there were many fewer judicial vacancies, \n     Sen. Thomas Daschle, now majority leader, and Mr. Leahy \n     expressed their concern about the ``vacancy crisis''--with \n     the latter explaining that the Senate's failure to vote on \n     nominees was ``delaying or preventing the administration of \n     justice.''\n       Today's crisis is worse, and is acute in several places. \n     The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, which, other than the \n     Supreme Court, is often considered the most important federal \n     court because of the constitutional cases that comes before \n     it, has four vacancies on a 12-judge court. The Sixth Circuit \n     Court of Appeals has eight vacancies on a court of 16. In \n     March 2000, when that court had only four vacancies, its \n     chief judge stated that it was ``hurting badly and will not \n     be able to keep up with its work load.''\n       In the past, senators of both parties have accused each \n     other of illegitimate delays in voting on nominees. The past \n     mistreatment of nominees does not justify today's behavior. \n     Finger-pointing does nothing to put judges on the bench and \n     ease the courts' burdens; it only distracts the Senate from \n     its constitutional obligation to act on the president's \n     judicial nominees.\n       President Bush has encouraged the Senate to act in a \n     bipartisan fashion, both now and in the future. He put it \n     best at the White House last May while announcing his first \n     11 nominees: ``I urge senators of both parties to rise above \n     the bitterness of the past, to provide a fair hearing and a \n     prompt vote to every nominee. That should be the case for no \n     matter who lives in this house, and no matter who controls \n     the Senate. I ask for the return of civility and dignity to \n     the confirmation process.''\n       It is time for the Senate to heed his call.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. This week, the White House submitted 24 new judicial \nnominations to the Senate. They are really doing a good job in this \nWhite House, and I know it has been difficult for them.\n  Since we already had 38 nominees still pending from last session, and \nwe confirmed 2 today, we now have a total of 60 nominees awaiting \naction from the Judiciary Committee. Yesterday's hearing and today's \nvotes make me optimistic we will vote on all of our nominees as \nexpeditiously as possible this year, and I am counting on our chairman \nto help get that done.\n  It certainly is possible to confirm all 60 this year, in addition to \nthe other nominations we will receive later. In 1994, the second year \nof President Clinton's first term, as I mentioned earlier, the Senate \nconfirmed 100 judicial nominees. I am confident Republicans and \nDemocrats can work together to achieve or even hopefully exceed this \nnumber in 2002, particularly with regard to the many circuit court \nnominees pending to fill emergency vacancies in appellate courts around \nthis country. To do this, we have to keep up the pace of hearings and \nconfirmation votes so we do not fall further behind in filling the \nvacancies that plague our Federal judiciary.\n  As Chief Justice Rehnquist noted, and as I have stated, in his 2001 \nyear-end report:\n\n       To continue functioning effectively and efficiently . . . \n     the courts must be appropriately staffed.\n       This means that necessary judgeships must be created and \n     judicial vacancies must be timely filled with well-qualified \n     candidates.\n\n  So I sincerely hope we will accomplish this goal. I look forward to \ncooperating with my chairman, the distinguished Senator from Vermont, \nand all of our other Democrat colleagues, and I hope the rhetoric on \nboth sides of the aisle is cooled so we can confirm as many as possible \nof the highly qualified nominees pending before us.\n  Today's nominees are good examples of the kind of highly qualified \nnominees President Bush has submitted to the Senate. Chief Bankruptcy \nJudge Marcia Krieger, who has been nominated to the District Court in \nthe District of Columbia, attended Lewis & Clark College, from which \nshe graduated after 3 years summa cum laude, and earned her law degree \nfrom the University of Colorado School of Law. She has experience as a \nlawyer and as a specialist in bankruptcy. She has served as a \nbankruptcy court judge since 1994.\n  Judge James Mahan, who has been nominated to the District Court for \nthe District of Nevada, achieved a great reputation as a lawyer in Las \nVegas for 17 years, primarily focusing on business and commercial \nlitigation. In the process, he earned an AV rating from the Martindale-\nHubbell legal directory, high praise from his peers. I have held that \nrating from the earliest day it could be given to me, and I understand \nwhat goes into getting an AV rating. It is very important because it is \na secret ballot by your peers, some of whom may not like you but \nnevertheless acknowledge you are of the highest legal ability and legal \nethics. And he has that rating.\n  In February 1999, he was named a judge on the Clark County District \nCourt. Since taking the bench, Judge Mahan has heard civil and criminal \nmatters and trials involving a 3,000 case docket.\n  Both Judge Krieger and Judge Mahan have already established \nthemselves as capable jurists. After today, they will be able to share \ntheir expertise in the Federal system, and I am confident they will \nbring honor and dignity to the Federal district court bench. I am very \npleased our colleagues have unanimously confirmed both of them.\n  Again, I thank my good friend and distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee for the work he has done up to now, and hopefully \nwe can do better in the future. I appreciate being able to work with \nhim.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Levin). The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of my friend from \nUtah. Obviously, we cannot determine the course the White House might \ntake. They can make that decision on their own, and I expect will. We \ncan only determine what the Senate does. As I said before, it is advise \nand consent, not advise and rubberstamp.\n  I only urge the White House to seek, as Presidents have throughout my \nlifetime, advice from the home State Senators of both parties on \njudgeships. Senator Hatch and I can move far more quickly on judges \nwhen that kind of consensus has been reached, just as we have \ndemonstrated by moving through numerous conservative Republican \nnominees but for whom there was consensus.\n  Frankly, it would be a much easier job if only the Senator from Utah \nand I had to make these decisions. Again, I hope the White House will \nlisten to what the two of us have been saying. We have demonstrated we \nwill work together. They also have to help. They have to help in the \nconsultation. They have to help in getting the information on to the \nFBI, and the ABA reports. They have to also make sure when they speak \nabout these issues they speak accurately.\n  I thank my good friend from Utah for his comments. I will continue to \nwork with him.\n  I also see the distinguished assistant Republican leader. He and the \nassistant Democratic leader, Senator Reid, have worked very closely \ntogether with each other to try to schedule votes on judges. Both have \nworked with me and with Senator Hatch. I think that is helpful. It \nreflects the way the Senate is supposed to work. Our distinguished \nleaders, Senator Daschle and Senator Lott, have worked closely on this \nand will continue to do that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n[[Page S127]]\n\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleagues from \nVermont and Utah for their comments. On the issue of judges, I think \nthe Senate, and particularly with the leadership of both Senator Leahy \nand Senator Hatch, did very well on district court judges. We moved a \ntotal of 28 judges last year, and 2 now, so that is 30 judges we have \nconfirmed this Congress, 6 of whom were circuit court judges and the \nrest were district court judges. So I compliment them.\n  The percentage of district court judges has been a good percentage \nfor the number who were nominated through the summer. So that was good. \nOn circuit court judges, the record is not quite so good. We have \nconfirmed six. President Bush has nominated 29.\n  I comment to the chairman of the committee and the ranking member of \nthe committee, there are 23 circuit court judges, only 1 of whom has \nhad a hearing. In the 23 who are pending, there are some outstanding \nnominees. For example, Miguel Estrada is a native Honduran who came to \nthe United States. He graduated top of his class from Columbia and \nHarvard Law School. He has argued 16 cases before the Supreme Court. I \nhope we have a hearing for him. He was nominated in May, so I again ask \nthe chairman of the committee, before he leaves--before he leaves, I \nwanted to again compliment him for the work he has done on district \ncourt judges. I think we have made good progress, but on circuit court \njudges there are 23 who are pending, 1 of whom has had a hearing, Judge \nPickering, but of the 22 who have not had a hearing, several are \noutstanding, many of whom were nominated in May. I believe eight were \nnominated in May. I urge my friend and colleague to take a look at such \noutstanding individuals. I mentioned Miguel Estrada, John Roberts. \nMiguel Estrada argued 16 cases before the Supreme Court; John Roberts, \nalso for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, argued 36 cases before the \nSupreme Court. Undoubtedly, they are two of the most well-qualified \nindividuals anywhere in the country. They have yet to have a hearing \nscheduled.\n\n  I say thank you. The Senator has moved all of the district court \njudges from Oklahoma. I am pleased about that. All four were sworn in \nand will be good consensus judges. I ask and urge my colleague to move \nforward as quickly as possible on the 23 circuit court nominees, \nschedule their hearings, and see if we cannot move some of those \nnominees through as soon as possible.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield, that question is directed \ntoward me. I say to the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma that while \nhe was off the floor attending to other duties, I laid out some plans \nand intentions for the handling of judicial nominees, including those \nfor the courts of appeals--I believe those are some of those \nmentioned--including Mr. Estrada and others were referenced. With \nadequate cooperation, we will be able to move forward. We held hearings \nyesterday on another court of appeals nominee, Michael Melloy, of Iowa; \nas well as hearings on Robert Blackburn, to be U.S. district judge for \nthe District of Colorado; and James Gritzner, to be U.S. district court \njudge for the Southern District of Iowa; and Cindy K. Jorgenson, to be \nU.S. district judge for the District of Arizona; and Richard J. Leon, \nto be U.S. district judge for the District of Columbia; and Jay C. \nZainey, to be U.S. district judge for the Eastern District of \nLouisiana. Those hearings were held within 28 hours of coming back into \nsession.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my colleague. The committee has done a wonderful \njob on district court judges, and I urge them to consider some of the \ncircuit court nominees.\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF MARCIA S. KRIEGER\n\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, it is both an honor and a privilege to \nstand before my colleagues today and thank them for accepting the \nnomination of The Honorable Marcia S. Krieger to the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Colorado. Marsha S. Krieger is a person of \noutstanding legal credentials, and has served the people of Colorado \nand the United States with great diligence and dedication for many \nyears.\n  Judge Krieger has strong ties to Colorado and is familiar with the \nissues faced by people in the State, an important aspect of any Federal \njudge who will work with fellow citizens through a myriad of complex \nlitigation settings. She graduated from the University of Colorado \nSchool of Law, and has since spent many years as a sole practitioner, \npracticing in a law firm, and, most recently, serving as Judge.\n  Since 1994, Judge Krieger has served on the Bankruptcy Court--a key \nindicator of her efficiency and effectiveness; she was also unanimously \nchosen by the federal judges to become Chief Bankruptcy judge in \nJanuary 2000.\n  However, practicing law is not her only passion. Judge Krieger, \nmanages to find time to teach, sharing her knowledge of the law with \nfuture attorneys, teaching in a manner that provides hands-on learning, \nsharing with students her passion for the law.\n  Marsha Krieger presides over the court with a stern hand and keen \nintellect--she has the ability to decisively pull the issue from \ncomplex litigation with certainty and accuracy.\n  According to an article in the Denver Post, Judge Krieger is widely \nrespected by other judges and by lawyers that have appeared before \nthem. She has extensive experience, solid knowledge of the law, and has \na reputation for fairness.\n  This vote is significant for many reasons--Colorado hasn't added a \njudge since 1984. Making matters more serious, only four active judges \nstruggle to do the work of nine judges.\n  The legal community believes the Judge to be well qualified as well. \nThe Honorable Lewis T. Babcock, Chief Judge of the United States \nDistrict Court for the District of Colorado, in a letter to Senator \nLeahy and Senator Hatch stated, ``I know Judge Krieger, and believe her \nto be well qualified.''\n  I thank Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the editorial from the \nDenver Post and the letter from the Honorable Lewis T. Babcock, Chief \nJudge of the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Bush Taps 2 Judges\n\n       Tuesday, September 11, 2001.--The White House nominated two \n     distinguished Colorado judges to the U.S. District Court \n     yesterday, and both will receive the full support of U.S. \n     Sens. Wayne Allard and Ben Nighthorse Campbell.\n       President Bush's nominations, as predicted in these pages \n     Aug. 12, recommend U.S. Chief Bankruptcy Judge Marsha Krieger \n     and 16th Judicial District Judge Robert Blackburn for the \n     bench.\n       We are delighted by the White House decision. Both judges \n     have extensive experience, solid knowledge of the law and a \n     reputation for fairness. They are widely respected by other \n     judges and by lawyers who have appeared before them.\n       Both should prove extremely helpful to the Federal court in \n     Colorado, which hasn't added a judge since 1984 despite \n     increasingly complex and mushrooming caseloads.\n       We commend Republicans Allard and Campbell, as well as the \n     White House, for pushing to fill these vacancies quickly. We \n     also congratulate the senators for zeroing in on such highly \n     qualified candidates.\n       Krieger, daughter of retired Colorado Court of Appeals \n     Judge Don Smith, has served on the Bankruptcy Court since \n     1994 and was unanimously chosen by the federal judges to \n     become chief bankruptcy judge in January 2000.\n       Blackburn has been one of two district judges serving Bent, \n     Crowley and Otero Counties since 1988, having previously \n     served simultaneously as a deputy district attorney, Bent \n     County attorney, and municipal judge and attorney for the \n     town of Kim.\n       Both judges are graduates of the University of Colorado \n     School of Law.\n       The next step calls for the Senate Judiciary Committee to \n     send ``blue slips'' to Colorado's senators. Allard and \n     Campbell then will return the blue slips, signaling their \n     approval of Krieger and Blackburn.\n       Next, the Judiciary Committee will independently \n     investigate the candidates and vote on whether to approve \n     them. The nominations then would be sent to the Senate floor, \n     and approval there would result in ``judicial commissions'' \n     by the president.\n       The Senate process often drags on for months and months. We \n     urge the committee and the full Senate to exercise all \n     reasonable speed with the Krieger and Blackburn nominations. \n     The long-overworked federal court of Colorado needs qualified \n     new judges, and it needs them now.\n\n[[Page S128]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                              U.S. District Court,\n\n\n                                         District of Colorado,\n\n                                   Denver, CO, September 20, 2001.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Hon. Orrin Hatch,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Hatch: In this time of national \n     crisis I appreciate that you have much added to your ordinary \n     labors in government. I take to heart our president's \n     admonition to go to work and do our jobs. It is axiomatic \n     that our federal judiciary must perform not only its usual \n     role under our Constitution, but a heightened role in \n     response to terrorism. Specifically, at this time this nation \n     requires that judicial vacancies be fairly and expeditiously \n     filled.\n       More specifically, I urge you to act expeditiously on the \n     confirmation of nominees Marsha Kreiger and Robert Blackburn \n     to vacancies existing in the United States District Court for \n     the District of Colorado. I know Judge Kreiger and Judge \n     Blackburn and believe them to be well qualified. As you know, \n     the Honorable Richard P. Matsch did much to restore this \n     nation's confidence in its courts during the trials of \n     McVeigh and Nichols. He is now recovering from recent liver \n     transplant surgery. It will be a long period of recovery. So, \n     the District of Colorado struggles to do the work of seven \n     active judges with four. By the way, the Judicial Conference \n     of the United States has approved two additional seats for \n     the District of Colorado. Thus, the District of Colorado \n     struggles to do the work of a demonstrated need for nine \n     active judges with four active judges.\n       I urge you not only to act to fill the existing two \n     vacancies, but to address the demonstrated need for two \n     additional seats in this district.\n\n\n                      nomination of james c. mahan\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, it is an honor to come before the U.S. \nSenate today to lend my support to a man of the highest legal \ndistinction, Judge Jim Madhan.\n  A long-time resident of Las Vegas, NV, Judge Mahan began his studies \nnot in our great State, but at the University of Charleston in \nCharleston, WV. Following graduation he attended graduate school before \njoining the U.S. Navy where he served until honorably discharged in \n1969. Jim then studied and graduated from Vanderbilt University Law \nSchool.\n  Following graduation, Judge Mahan began his work in Nevada, first as \na law clerk and then as an associate attorney. In 1982 he formed the \nlaw firm of Mahan & Ellis, where he practiced law primarily in the \nareas of business and commercial litigation for 17 years. In February \n1999, Judge Mahan's legal experience and expertise were recognized by \nGov. Kenny Guinn, who named him as his first appointment to the Clark \nCounty District Court.\n  Since taking the bench, Judge Mahan has heard civil and criminal \nmatters involving a 3,000 case docket assigned to him. Judge Mahan's \nservice on the bench has been of the highest order. He has overseen \nmany of Nevada's most complex and controversial cases since taking the \nbench and has done so with great care, fairness, and prudence. In a \nsurvey conducted last year by Nevada's largest newspaper, Judge Mahan's \nretention rates scored the highest of any judge serving on State or \nlocal court in Nevada, and that includes the Nevada Supreme Court.\n  Judge Mahan's extensive legal background and his commitment to public \nservice make him an excellent choice as U.S. District Court Judge for \nthe District of Nevada. I know his wife Eileen and his son James, Jr., \nare proud of him for being here today, and the State of Nevada is proud \nof Jim and all that he represents for our great State. I am proud to \nsupport Judge Jim Mahan before the Senate today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/25/senate-section/article/S128-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S128-S131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HOPE FOR CHILDREN ACT--Continued\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2717\n\n  Mr. NICKLES.

I ask unanimous consent this be the next Republican \namendment filed in the normal course of business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NICKLES. I thank my friends and colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I rise to speak on the Bond-Collins amendment and give a \nlittle explanation of what has been submitted. I am sure most of the \nMembers of this body will want to back an amendment that supports small \nbusiness in the way that this particular amendment does. Senator Bond, \nof course, has worked extensively on it and is the ranking member on \nthe Small Business Committee. Senator Collins has been involved in \nsmall business most of her life. I appreciate all the thought and \neffort that went into this amendment. It will provide an immediate \neconomic stimulus and will provide a stimulus for small businesses in \nthis country. The details of this are very limited to small business. \nHowever, it is an area that will help out immediately a wide range of \nbusinesses, and I will explain how that will happen.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to talk about what our Nation and my \nState of Wyoming need in the way of an economic stimulus package. I \nwill talk on a broader issue first and then get into the details of \nthis particular amendment. While I have a degree in accounting, you \ndon't need to be an accountant to know that something needs to be done \nto kick-start our economy. We ended Congress last year with a well-\ncrafted economic stimulus bill that had bipartisan support, which the \nHouse passed, and the President said he would sign. In short, it was a \nbill worked out over several months of tough negotiations involving the \nadministration and congressional Democrats and Republicans. It included \nunemployment compensation and health insurance for unemployed workers. \nIt included tax relief for hard-working individuals and families, and \nit included much needed help for America's small businesses.\n  I was disappointed about the majority leader's refusal to schedule \nthe bipartisan bill for a vote before the recess. Today, rather than \nhaving an opportunity to vote on that bill, we are suddenly faced with \na vote on a totally new bill.\n\n  The bill we are currently debating did not go through the normal \ncongressional process. Instead, it was filed quickly. It was filed with \nlittle input from our Senate colleagues on either side of the aisle, \nand it was brought to the floor for purposes of a vote.\n\n[[Page S129]]\n\n  While we finally have an opportunity to vote on an economic stimulus \nbill, it is much like a patient needing emergency treatment. Our only \nchoice is to patch it up. That is what we have been doing through an \namendment process. When we work bills that do not come out of the \ncongressional committee review, it takes longer. The reason it takes \nlonger is because there has to be more consideration of amendments here \nthat would normally be considered in a much easier process in \ncommittee. This is one of them.\n  Today, we are arduously going through that process. I rise in favor \nof the Bond-Collins amendment which increases section 179 small \nbusiness expensing. I support that because it is one of the many \nbandages that is needed to patch up the current proposal. If we are \ngoing to stimulate our economy, and I think we all want to do that, one \nof the main ways to do it is to help small businesses who are suffering \nfrom recession. If we can help them, we can create more jobs.\n  Small business has been one of the successes of this country over the \nlast decade. We have had a great economy. Throughout that time, though, \nthere have been what I call the megamergers. The megamergers are when a \nbig company merges with another big company to become a huge company. \nWe find with the megamergers that shortly after that is done, there has \nbeen a downsizing, often referred to as a ``right sizing.'' If you are \nan employee who is affected by that, it means you get laid off.\n  Fortunately, during this time of the megamergers, we have had small \nbusiness. Notice the unemployment for almost a decade did not rise. It \nwent down in spite of megamergers. What does that mean? It means small \nbusiness was hiring up the people that were laid off from the \nmegamergers. They picked up the slack in the economy. Through their \ninnovation, drive, flexibility, their ability to react to the \nsituations, they created the success we have had.\n  Now, they are the part of the economy that can jump-start the \neconomy, and this amendment is designed to jump-start that small \nbusiness area. The Bond-Collins amendment contains a tax relief \nprovision that is similar to the bipartisan House bill, which calls for \nan increase in Section 179 business expensing for small businesses. In \nshort, it gives small businesses relief by increasing the amount of \nproperty a business can treat as an ordinary and necessary deductible \nbusiness expense.\n  Right now a business can deduct, or write off, up to $24,000 of the \ncost of business equipment or assets as an expense of doing business. \nThis type of expensing allows businesses to take an immediate \ndeduction, rather than treating their purchases as a capital \nexpenditure.\n  Let's see if I can put that a little bit more clearly. If you \npurchase something and it is in this capital expenditure category, that \nmeans that you are only able to count that as an expense in each of \nseveral years. You have to divide it over the period of years that the \ncapital expenditure would be useful. If you buy a computer, and deduct \nis as a capital expenditure, you must write that off over 7 years. Now, \ncomputers get outdated much quicker than that, so you might be able to \nmake an argument that it ought to be written off in a shorter period of \ntime. But under this provision you could write it off as an expense in \nthe initial year. You do not have to do all the division and all the \ncomplicated calculations that our depreciation system leads to.\n  I have to tell you, the toughest thing in calculating taxes is if you \nhave to figure depreciation. I know there are a lot of individuals as \nwell as companies out there who understand that. We have changed the \ndepreciation schedule so many times, we have changed the methods for \ndoing depreciation so many times, that some people have to calculate \ndepreciation on each item they have in several different ways. It is a \nbig part of the Tax Code itself. It is very confusing. Probably one of \nthe reasons a lot of people have to hire accountants to do their taxes \nis just to figure the depreciation section.\n  For a small business, what Section 179 allows them to do is to count \ntheir purchased business asset as a normal business expense rather than \ntrying to figure out which depreciation table applies and then making \nthem apply that formula and keep track of what part has been written \noff and what part has not been written off for a period of years. I \nthink you are getting the idea of how complicated this depreciation \nthing is. I want to tell you when you actually get to calculating it, \nit is a lot more complicated than what I have been talking about here.\n  But if you can call it a business expense, that means you get to \nwrite it off in that initial year. You have the revenue that comes in \nand you get to subtract the expenses. That winds up with a net figure \nthat you pay taxes on. So, if you get to write off more as an expense, \nrather than dragging it out over a period of years and trying to \nremember to calculate and recalculate all of this, then in this first \nyear, you will have more revenue because you will have less taxes. That \nis why this becomes a very important jump-start to our economy.\n  Right now, if you have $24,000 worth of those purchases, you can \nwrite them off. But if you go over that, you have to keep track of it \nand do all the calculations. So this amendment, the Bond-Collins \namendment, would give immediate relief and is preferable to treating \nsuch purchases as capital expenditures where the business purchases \nmust be deducted over a long period of time to reflect an asset's \nuseful life.\n  Even calculating useful life can be difficult. There are a whole set \nof principles set out in the Tax Code that help you to determine \n``useful life,'' but the easy part is writing it off in the year you \npurchase it. Direct expensing allows small business to avoid the \ncomplexities of depreciation rules and the depreciation, so to speak, \nis immediate rather than over the life of the asset.\n\n  The Bond-Collins amendment would increase the amount of small \nbusiness expensing from $24,000 to $40,000 for 2 years. What does this \nmean? It means small business would have an additional $16,000 in \nbusiness asset costs that they can deduct, above and beyond the $24,000 \nthat they can currently deduct, and they can deduct that expense \nimmediately.\n  That doesn't all become a tax break. The only part that becomes a tax \nbreak is the remainder, the revenue less this expense. The remainder \nwill be smaller and the remainder gets taxed. So there still is a tax \nimplication to the whole thing.\n  We are not talking about the $24,000 or the $40,000 increase as being \na tax write-off. It is a tax deduction, so it is a reduction in \nrevenue. It is a very difficult concept, but it will only reduce the \n$16,000 of additional expenditure; that would actually be a tax saving \nof whatever they are taxed on the $16,000.\n  But it is an immediate encouragement for the companies to purchase \nthings that they need, and they only get to write them off if they buy \nthem. They don't get to write them off if it is history. They don't get \nto write them off if it is a thought in the future. They only get to \nwrite it off if they go out and buy the equipment now. It is not \neverything they buy because vehicles are excluded and computer software \nis excluded. Computers are allowed. I will go into some other examples \nof some things that could be written off.\n  I also want to point out, though, that when small businesses go out \nand make this expenditure, this is an expenditure in the private \nsector. One of the things that the economic report shows is that an \nexpenditure in the private sector revolves money purchases around about \nseven times. One business buys something, the business that sold it to \nthem receives the money, the business that sold it to them turns it \naround and spends it at another company, who takes it and spends it at \nanother company who spends it. I think you get the idea. The money \nrevolves seven times.\n  We can get expenditures, too, by having the government just run out \nand buy things. But here is a very important point: Private sector \nexpenditures revolve seven times; government expenditures, twice. So \nthat increase of $16,000 is considerably more effective in the private \nsector than it is if we are spending it on government projects. Keep \nthat in mind. That is what this particular bill does.\n  Farmers can deduct up to $40,000 of the cost of a much-needed piece \nof farm equipment, such as a hay baler. Ranchers have an additional tax \ndeduction for the expense of their electric pump used to water their \ncattle. The local\n\n[[Page S130]]\n\nauto repair shop can deduct the cost of a much-needed welding machine \nor painting equipment. The local florist or dry cleaner can buy the \ncomputerized cash register it needs. The local barber shop maybe can \ndeduct the cost of a new chair. It is a stimulus to get them to go make \nthe purchases they need now, to make their business operate and be more \ncompetitive now.\n  Some folks will try to argue that this applies to big corporations, \nand we are trying to make the rich even richer. Not so. Remember this \namendment only applies to small business.\n  In the past, section 179 applies only to those small businesses with \nannual asset purchases up to $200,000. The Bond-Collins amendment will \nsimply increase that amount for 2 years to asset purchases of $325,000. \nAs a result, section 179 will still apply to small businesses, but will \nallow those small businesses to buy even more equipment up front and \nhave the small business expensing of that equipment apply immediately.\n  If they buy more than $325,000 worth of equipment in a year, they do \nnot qualify for this. If they buy $325,000, they are still limited to \nexpensing only $40,000 of that amount. It is a small business \nproposition.\n  There are a lot of companies that are at the $24,000 mark that will \njump to the $40,000 mark because of this incentive. That extra $16,000 \nfor thousands of companies across this country will cause other \nbusinesses to have a good year. They also will be stimulated to buy \nsome extra equipment; and, it grows and grows.\n  I support the Bond-Collins amendment because it gives small \nbusinesses more incentive to make investments in business assets or \nproperty immediately, causing an immediate, positive effect on our \neconomy. With a business deduction of up to $40,000 and resulting \nincreased purchases of business products from other businesses, many \nmore businesses will have the money necessary to hire additional \nworkers. In Wyoming, a $40,000 tax deduction can go a long way in \nproviding wages for an additional or part-time worker.\n  I should know. I owned a shoe store in Gillette, WY. Simply put, the \nless money I had to pay in taxes, the more money I had to invest in \ninventory, to maintain my building, and more importantly, to hire more \npeople to take care of the customers. With additional small business \nexpensing of $40,000, I could have bought that extra cash register I \nneeded and with the tax money I saved, I could have hired an extra \nsales clerk to run it.\n  I just spent a couple of weeks in Wyoming and walked down main street \nin places like Casper, Gillette, and Cheyenne, and smaller towns such \nas Sundance, Saratoga, and some that you have probably never heard of. \nEvery business in Wyoming could use some relief. Many of these are \nsmall Mom and Pop businesses that don't want a ``hand-out,'' but could \nuse a ``hand-up.'' The Bond-Collins amendment does just that.\n  As a member of the Senate Small Business Committee and a small \nbusiness owner for much of my life, I know we need the Bond-Collins \namendment. Right now, the current economic stimulus bill we are \ndiscussing does not provide a small business expensing increase. Small \nbusinesses on Main Street America deserve more. Small businesses in \nthis country have been the mainstay of our economy. In good and bad \ntimes, they have continued to stimulate our Nation's economy. We need \nto preserve this small business stimulus by providing this tax relief \nmechanism for small businesses.\n  I think it is something that is appreciated across the aisle and \nacross this building. I know on the other end of the building they have \nalready passed this kind of stimulus. A small, short amendment like \nthis doesn't appear to be much, but I think it will make a huge \ndifference because things start in small business and they grow. We \ndon't give them enough credit. But that is how it works.\n  For these reasons, I support the Bond-Collins amendment covering \nsmall business expensing. I hope we can come together and resolve to \npass an amendment that helps America's mainstay, the small businesses.\n  I think this amendment will make a huge difference. It will make it \nimmediately. It will grow in size more than is anticipated by anything \nelse in the stimulus package. I hope my colleagues will take a careful \nand close look at this amendment, see the value of it, and join me in \nsupporting it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly on the progress \nwe have made this week on a couple of matters. We will soon propound a \nlist of nominations. There will be 43 nominations total. Two of those \nhave already been considered; that is, the confirmation of two Federal \njudges. But there are 36 other nominations, including 10 Ambassadorial \nnominations which will be presented to the Senate in a short period of \ntime.\n  I thank colleagues on my side of the aisle in particular for their \ncooperative effort.\n  A lot of these nominations have worked their way through the \ncommittee. Chairmen and members of the committees have cooperated with \nthe administration. We are now in the position to move quite a large \nnumber of these executive nominations at the very beginning of this \nsession of Congress. There are others we hope to move, including \nadditional judges. But obviously we continue to hope the administration \nwill work with us in making sure that those nominations have been \nproperly vetted and that we have the confidence that all of the actions \nrequired prior to confirmation have been completed.\n  We will continue to work with them as we have over the course of the \nlast year. We have already reported and confirmed over 35 judges. I \nbelieve the number is now 38. We will have a lot more to confirm in the \ncoming weeks and months.\n  I thank in that regard Senator Leahy for his efforts and for his \nwork. I know there was a colloquy and exchange in the Chamber over the \ncourse of the last hour with regard to judgeships and other issues. I \nthank him for his leadership and for the extraordinary effort he has \nbeen making.\n  As I said at the beginning of this session, and at the beginning of \nlast session, it is my policy, and it is the policy of our caucus, that \nonce these matters have been brought to the floor on the Executive \nCalendar, they will get a vote. It may not be a direct vote, but it \nwill be a vote. And we will continue to work with our colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle to ensure that these votes are scheduled in a \ntimely way.\n  We have also begun consideration of the economic stimulus bill. I \nwish we could have accomplished more in the short time that we had. We \nwill be back on the bill on Tuesday. We will work all through the day \non Tuesday. There will be votes on Tuesday, beginning perhaps as early \nas Tuesday morning. We will also be in session on Monday, even though \nthere will be no votes on Monday.\n  Because of the Republican retreat, there will be no votes on \nWednesday, Thursday, and Friday of next week. The Democratic single, 1-\nday conference will take place on Wednesday.\n  We will come back the following Monday, and Senators should expect \nvotes on Monday of the following week. It is my hope that we can \ncomplete our work on the economic stimulus bill early in that week, the \nweek after next.\n  We have a lot of work to do. The economic stimulus package should be \ncompleted within the first couple of days, so we can move to the farm \nbill, election reform, and, of course, the energy bill.\n  So in a very short period of time there is a great deal of work to be \ndone. If necessary, I intend to file cloture on the economic stimulus \nbill in an effort to bring closure to our work on the bill. We have \nbeen debating it for weeks, one could say months in the last session of \nthe Congress last year. There is no need to extend the debate in this \ncase as well. We will have additional amendments. We will have \nadditional votes. But at the end, we must conclude our work and move on \none way or the other.\n  As I have said in this Chamber on many occasions, what I view this \nlegislation to be is nothing more, really, than a ticket to conference \nso we can continue to work and find some resolution. It would be ideal, \nof course, if the House would just take it up and pass it. That would \nbe my first choice. But at the very least, it is a ticket to \nconference. It would be a good thing if we got to conference and began \nworking out our differences in a way that would allow us to complete \nour work on the economic stimulus bill and, I might add, provide the \nunemployment benefits for 13 more weeks for millions of workers who are \nlooking to us for some sign of hope that they are going to have the \nwherewithal to at least maintain their quality of life and their \nability to buy groceries and pay their rent and pay their heating \nbills.\n  So while this has not been as productive a week as I had hoped, we \nhave ended it in a way that I think gives us some reason for additional \nconfidence next week as we take up the bill, and certainly confidence \nwith regard to the Executive Calendar and the nominations that will be \nconfirmed this afternoon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLEN.

Mr. President, I rise to ask for my colleagues support of \namendment No. 2702, my ``Terrorist Zone Tax Exemption Act.'' I would \nlike to share with the Presiding Officer, my colleagues, and the \nAmerican people the purpose of this amendment.\n  As we well know, the tragic events of September 11 demonstrated the \nworst attack that we have seen in this country, maybe in our entire \nhistory. At the same time--while seeing some of the most vile activity \nthat mankind has ever seen--we saw a demonstration of the best of the \nAmerican spirit. Unfortunately, our Nation has been forever changed \nsince those attacks of September 11, 2001. However, we should remember \nthat we have been changed in some good ways. We are now united and \nresolved--very resolved--to combat terrorism worldwide. This war on \nterrorism is unlike any other war we have ever fought. Indeed, the \nattack of September 11 has actually changed the definition of \ncombatants, so that now not only are military personnel tasked to \nlocate and eradicate potential terrorist threats, but also civilian \npolice, fire and rescue personnel are charged with maintaining public \nsafety after a terrorist attack. And they are all subject to attack and \nrisk.\n  In recognition of this new reality, I have offered this amendment \nthat will extend the current tax exemption for military service members \nserving in a combat zone--use that same logic, that same principle to \nprovide those same sorts of tax exemption benefits--to civilian \nuniformed employees who respond to terrorist attacks on our own soil.\n  Specifically, my amendment includes those brave police officers, \nfirefighters, and EMTs who risk their lives to defend us and our \nproperty.\n  It defines a terrorist attack zone as an area where someone has \nattempted to intimidate or coerce the civilian population or influence \nthe policy of a government by conducting criminal terrorist acts.\n  It also extends this exemption to those who are now an integral part \nof our growing homeland security network.\n  Congress has already recognized the extraordinary sacrifices that our \nmembers of the Armed Forces have performed in their service in combat \nzones. Let us take this opportunity to honor our law enforcement \nofficers, firefighters, and rescue personnel who have also placed \nthemselves in danger in service to their country, to their States, and \nto their communities in protecting their fellow citizens from the enemy \nand these terrorist attacks.\n  Let's recognize, whether they were in the World Trade Center, at the \nPentagon, or on airplanes that were commandeered, people were in \ndangerous situations, and many lost their lives. Others were rescuing \npeople in toxic air, where there was falling debris, where there was \nburning embers or plastics or fuel, and other dangerous situations.\n  Our enemies, in their attacks, make all Americans--not just our \nmilitary, but our civilians as well--the target of their attacks. They \ndo so without regard for the thousands of lives that would be affected \nby these attacks.\n  So now the Federal Government must adapt the Tax Code to account for \nthose who serve the public's safety here at home as it does for those \nwho serve our military objectives.\n  These wonderful men and women we have heard about, read about--many \nwho lost their lives; but also those who survived--these men and women \nare patriots; they are heroes. All of those who responded to this vile \nact of war on the United States on September 11, 2001, carry forth a \nunity of purpose for compassion, for liberty, and for justice. We must \nhonor their hard work and resolve, for their example truly exemplifies \nour diverse, strong, and respectful Nation.\n  And so I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting my amendment. It \nis an expression of gratitude to those who wear the badges, wear the \nfirefighter boots, carry the medical bags, and answer the call to \nprotect life and property in the wake of the dastardly, cowardly \nattacks of terrorists.\n  This measure has been supported by many organizations. It has the \nsupport of the 299,000 members of the Fraternal Order of Police; the \nInternational Association of Fire Chiefs; the New York City Detectives \nEndowment Association, representing 7,500 active New York Police \nDepartment detectives; the National Association of Police Officers, \nrepresenting 220,000 law enforcement officers across our country. The \nCapital Police Labor Board strongly supports it as well.\n  Some may ask what is the fiscal impact of this. If, say, you were a \npolice officer or firefighter or an EMT worker responding to a \nterrorist attack such as that attacks on New York City and the \nPentagon--and those are the only places that would fit the description \nof a terrorist attack zone under this bill--your income for that month \nof September, would be exempt from Federal taxation, just as a military \npilot flying over Afghanistan receives now. That income that he earns \nor she earns is exempt from Federal taxes for time spent in response, \nand is validated on a month-to-month basis. It comes out to \napproximately $205 a month for our rescue workers. It is not a lot of \nmoney, but it is an expression of gratitude.\n  The total fiscal impact is about $7 million. Again, not much in the \nwhole scheme of things here in Washington, but still an expression of \nsupport.\n  I would like to read from some of the groups that have endorsed this \nlegislation or this amendment. For example, the Detectives Endowment \nAssociation of the Police Department for the City of New York:\n\n       As President of the New York City Detectives Endowment \n     Association, representing 7,500 active detective members of \n     the NYPD, and as President of the National Association of \n     Police Organizations, representing 220,000 law enforcement \n     officers from all across the United States, I wish to commend \n     and support [this legislation.]\n\n  Mr. Tom Scotto, who is the President of both the Endowment \nAssociation and NAPO, goes on to write:\n\n\n[[Page S133]]\n\n\n       Having personally experienced the tragic events of the \n     terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center on September 11, \n     2001, I believe that this legislation is justifiable and will \n     go a long way towards boosting the morale of these public \n     servants who respond to such events.\n\n  From the Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order of Police, their \nPresident, Steve Young, writes that they very strongly support this \nTerrorist Response Tax Exemption Act or this amendment. They are in \nstrong support.\n\n       September 11 was a day of terrible tragedy, but in the \n     midst of flames and the rubble, we saw shining examples of \n     heroism from our law enforcement officers and other rescue \n     workers. Placing their own lives in jeopardy, these \n     courageous men and women helped rescue thousands. They called \n     their own nation to heroism in the face of the long and \n     difficult struggle that looms in our future.\n       Your bill would exempt the income of uniform rescue \n     personnel in ``terrorist attack zones,'' from income tax \n     during the months in which they perform their duties in \n     response to such attacks. Our nation is engaged in a conflict \n     that will not be fought between just armies or soldiers. Our \n     hidden enemies aim their attacks at civilian targets and \n     public safety officers--police, firefighters, and emergency \n     medical personnel--will be the first to respond to the \n     scene, not the U.S. military. We think it fitting, \n     therefore, that your bill mirrors current law giving \n     military personnel tax relief while serving in a combat \n     zone.\n\n  It goes on to commend the measure.\n  Finally, I would like to share with my colleagues a letter of \nendorsement from the International Association of Fire Chiefs. This is \nsigned by their executive director, Gary Briese.\n\n       Dear Senator Allen: On behalf of the International \n     Association of Fire Chiefs and America's 1.1 million fire \n     fighters, I would like to thank you for introducing \n     legislation to provide tax relief for fire fighters and other \n     first responders who respond to acts of terrorism.\n       As we understand it, your [measure], the Terrorist Response \n     Exemption Act, would provide an exemption from federal income \n     taxes to those who respond to terrorist incidents while they \n     are engaged in emergency operations. This exemption already \n     exists for members of our armed forces who enter into combat \n     zones.\n       Assistance of any kind to fire fighters is of great help, \n     particularly in the wake of the stunning and tragic events of \n     September 11. Thank you for your continued support of our \n     nation's fire fighters.\n\n  Those are the comments of many decent leaders who represent literally \ntens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of outstanding individuals who \ndevote their lives to protecting their communities and the lives of \npeople in their communities. Since these vile attacks of September 11, \nwe have seen the nature of warfare change dramatically. As long as our \nenemies are willing to conduct these suicide bombings, these terrorist \nattacks, acts we consider brazen and outrageous, and are particularly \noutrageous since they are attacking us here in our homeland, civilians, \nundefended men, women, and children, people commandeered on an \naircraft, people in office buildings, as long as this continues, our \nlaws should reflect this new reality.\n  Our firefighters, police and EMTs, other rescue personnel have all \nproven themselves to be not only heroes but superheroes in these \nattacks; they will hopefully never be called on again to perform such \nduty. But if they do, if that sad eventuality should occur, I think \nthey deserve all the protections and benefits in these modern combat \nzones that we can offer.\n  I ask my colleagues, in a bipartisan effort to support this amendment \nto this measure, let's support our firefighters, our police, our \nemergency medical personnel.\n  This is a sad new reality for our country. We are united. Let's \nsupport our heroes. It is not a lot of money, but it means a lot.\n  I think it expresses our sentiment that we want to support them as \nthey protect us and our lives and our livelihoods.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2721 to Amendment No. 2698\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf of \nSenator Baucus which would be the next Democratic amendment in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Daschle amendment includes 1-year 30-percent bonus \ndepreciation for assets either put in operation or binding contracts \nsigned by\n\n[[Page S134]]\n\nSeptember 10, 2002. The Smith amendment would have provided 30-percent \nbonus depreciation for 3 years, causing a deepening of the projected \nFederal deficit and extending the incentive beyond the forecasted \nperiod of the current economic downturn. Moreover, the incentive for a \ncompany to act now to acquire and place into service assets that do not \ntake years to produce would be reduced under a 3-year bonus \ndepreciation proposal, as proposed by Senator Smith. I would also note \nthat my absence for this vote did not affect the outcome of the vote. \nThe Smith amendment was rejected in a 39-45 vote, and would have \nrequired 60 votes to prevail.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/25/senate-section/article/S134-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to bring my colleagues' \nattention to the desperate situation of the people of Goma in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo. A natural disaster recently added to \nthe man-made tragedies that have already had a profound effect on the \npopulation in and around Goma. Basic human decency demands that the \nUnited States and the international community take prompt action to \nprovide relief to the Congolese people, and to help them in their \nefforts to rebuild their communities.\n  On January 17, Mount Nyiragongo, which is situated in the eastern \npart of the country near Lake Kivu, erupted and eventually produced \nseveral different paths of lava, including one that ran directly \nthrough Goma, destroying one-fifth to one-third of the city and \ndisplacing over 200,000 people. Some 62,500 people's homes were \ndestroyed, and reports indicate that hundreds of thousands have lost \ntheir jobs, their places of work utterly destroyed. It appears that \nscores lost their lives. For days, the displaced suffered without \nassistance, desperately searching for food, water, and shelter.\n  Witnesses to the misery of the Rwandan refugees who fled the 1994 \ngenocide, many were unwilling to become refugees themselves, and \nrapidly returned to the devastated city.\n  The international community has now been able to mobilize help. As of \nyesterday, the water system in Goma had resumed limited operations, but \nthere are still parts of the city with no access to clean water, \nforcing families to drink from contaminated sources and increasing the \nrisk of a cholera outbreak. Today, U.S. relief assistance has reached \nthe people of Goma, and I commend the Administration for working to get \nblankets, water, emergency food aid, and temporary emergency shelter \nmaterials to the communities in need.\n  I want to stress that life has been precarious for the people of this \nregion for far too long. They have been among the millions of Congolese \nsuffering from the all too often overlooked humanitarian crisis that \nhas gripped much of central Africa.\n  The Congolese people suffered unspeakably during the colonial era. \nThen they endured the repression and astonishing corruption of the \nMobutu regime. Next came the civil war that still leaves the country \ndivided. Throughout these political trials, the most basic \ninfrastructure of the country has crumbled, year by year, the victim of \nneglect, of corruption, and of conflict. Not only are the Congolese \npeople still denied basic political rights--no matter which force \ncontrols the section of the country in which they live--but many also \ndo not have access to even rudimentary health care. Several credible \nsurveys and reports indicate that malnutrition levels have reached \nappalling levels.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on African Affairs, I am committed to \nholding a hearing to focus attention on the DRC in the months ahead. My \ncolleagues will surely recognize that a vast country gripped by \ndeprivation and fear provides opportunities for some of the worst \ninternational actors. Surely they will see that the situation in the \nDemocratic Republic of the Congo creates a zone of instability at the \nheart of the continent--a direct challenge to our global efforts to \nstand on the side of both order and justice. Surely we will all realize \nthat both our interests and our morals demand that we help the people \nof Goma not just to survive their immediate ordeal, but to rebuild \ntheir communities. We must work to support the inter-Congolese dialogue \nthat aims to bring peace and a democratic political solution to the \ncountry, and we must demand all signatories to the Lusaka Accords \nrespect the fundamental human rights of the Congolese people. We must \nwork with the international community to provide desperately needed \ndevelopment assistance to the people who have long been denied \nmeaningful control over the course of their own country's destiny.\n  The disaster in Goma has finally drawn international attention to the \nplight of the Congolese. We cannot avert our eyes now that the lava has \nstopped its terrible advance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/25/senate-section/article/S134-3", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy in March of last \nyear. The Local Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to \ncurrent hate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any \nkind is unacceptable in our society.\n  I would like to describe a terrible crime that occurred November 8, \n1998, in Palm Springs, CA. A gay participant in Palm Springs' Gay Pride \nweekend was attacked by three men.

JEANNETTE L. WINTERS\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the seven \nmembers of the U.S. Marine Corps who died on January 9, 2002, when \ntheir KC-130 plane crashed in Pakistan. We are grateful for their \nservice to the United States and are humbled by the ultimate sacrifice \nthey made in defense of our country.\n  In Indiana, we grieve the untimely death of one of our own, Sgt. \nJeannette Winters. Sergeant Winters grew up in Gary, IN and followed in \nthe footsteps of her older brother, Matthew, when she joined the Marine \nCorps in 1997. Sergeant Winters was deployed for Operation Enduring \nFreedom in December and worked as a radio operator on the KC-130 plane.\n  Jeannette is remembered fondly by her friends and family as a caring \nperson who had a positive outlook on life. She loved her country and \nwas a proud marine who served honorably for more than 4 years. Her \ncourage and her commitment to our country are a credit to her family \nand to the State of Indiana.\n  It is my privilege to pay tribute to Sgt. Jeannette Winters for her \nbravery and sacrifice by honoring her in the official Record of the \nU.S. Senate. I send my heartfelt condolences to her family and friends. \nSergeant Winters and all of the brave men and women of our Armed Forces \nwill remain in our thoughts and prayers.\n  When I reflect on the just cause in which we are engaged, on our \ncommitment to routing out the scourge of terrorism across the world, I \nam reminded of the words of the prophet Isaiah who said, ``He will \nswallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will wipe away tears from \noff all faces.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/25/senate-section/article/S134-5", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S134-S135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DARRELL J.

Mr. President, we are all familiar with the \nquote ``I only hope that we don't lose sight of one thing--that it was \nall started by a mouse.'' Immediately, my mind turns to Walt Disney and \na smile comes across my face. His lifetime achievements are well known \nby all and often told, but today I want to talk about the boy. Walt \nDisney grew up with roots deep in Missouri. A boy whose early childhood \nexperiences and memories would be the foundation for the man who would \ntake the dreams of America, and make them come true.\n  This year we mark the one hundredth anniversary of Walt's birth, and \nall over America people are gathering to celebrate. In Marceline, MO, \nWalt's hometown, the Centennial Celebration drew a reported 50,000 \nvisitors anxious to participate. People came from all over the world to \nget a feel for what Walt experienced there, including a dedication to \nthe kind of group effort that was a hallmark of American farming around \nthe turn of the century. The idealized Main Street in Disneyland, the \ncountry life depicted in ``Old Yeller,'' and even the fascination with \nanimals that led to the True-Life Adventures, all have their origins on \nthat farm in Marceline.\n  In Kansas City they also celebrate one of the most successfully \ncreative men of the 20th century. At age 9, Walt and his family moved \nto Kansas City where his father bought a Kansas City Star newspaper \nroute. Walt and his brother, Roy, had to wake at 3:00 a.m. every day to \ndeliver newspapers, developing a work ethic in Walt that would later \nwear out all but the sturdiest of staff members. It was his father's \ngritty determination and resilience balanced by his mother's love of \nfun and a pleasure in people that added to his wealth of experience \nfrom which he was to draw in films and other creative ventures for the \nrest of his life. Legend has it that the idea for Mickey Mouse came to \nhim from a memory of a friendly mouse that begged for food in his \nKansas City art studio.\n  We all owe him our gratitude. Try to imagine a world without Walt \nDisney--a world without his magic, whimsy, and optimism. Fortunately we \ndon't have to. Walt did more to touch the hearts, minds, and emotions \nof millions of Americans than any other man in the past century. A \nmouse may have started it, but through his work he brought joy, \nhappiness, and a universal means of communication to the people all \nover the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/25/senate-section/article/S135-2", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT OF THE NATIONAL INTEREST RELATIVE TO JAPAN AND CHEMICAL \nWEAPONS--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT RECEIVED DURING THE ADJOURNMENT--PM \n                                   64\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 3, 2001, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on January 25, 2002, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received the following message from the \nPresident of the United States, together with accompanying paper; which \nwas referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 902 of the Foreign \nRelations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public Law \n101-246) (the ``Act''), and as President of the United States, I hereby \nreport to the Congress that it is in the national interest of the \nUnited States to terminate the suspensions under section 902 of the Act \ninsofar as such suspensions pertain to the export of defense articles \nor defense services in support of efforts by the Government of Japan to \ndestroy Japanese chemical weapons abandoned during World War II in the \nPeople's Republic of China.

A bill to establish the Green River National Wildlife Refuge \nin the State of Kentucky; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Green \nRiver National Wildlife Refuge Act of 2002. Seven years ago Kentucky \nwas the only State in the Nation that did not have its own national \nwildlife refuge. I was proud to remedy this problem by helping enact \nlegislation to establish the Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge in \nMarshall County, KY. Nearly half of the targeted 18,000 acres have been \nacquired for this refuge, all from willing sellers. And this spring, \nthe refuge headquarters building will be completed.\n\n[[Page S137]]\n\n  Given the success and progress of the Clarks River refuge, I am proud \nto partner with the efforts of the United States Fish and Wildlife \nService to establish Kentucky's second national wildlife refuge on \napproximately 23,000 acres in Henderson County along the confluence of \nthe Green River and the Ohio River. This targeted refuge area will \nprovide a diverse array of conservation, recreation, and environmental \neducation opportunities for everyone from tourists to wildlife \nenthusiasts to local school groups.\n  The proposed refuge site in the Green River bottoms area was once \npart of a large bottomland hardwood forest. Although this wetland area \nhas largely been replaced by agriculture, it serves as a popular spot \nfor a variety of waterfowl and migratory birds, especially when \ndesirable water levels occur. In fact, on February 1, 1999, more than \n10,000 ducks and 8,000 geese were recorded as visitors to the Green \nRiver area. The site also is home to several endangered or threatened \nspecies, such as the fanshell, Indiana bat maternity colonies, the \ncopperbelly snake, and a number of different mussels. Establishing a \nrefuge in this area offers a valuable opportunity to restore hardwood \nforest to the Green River bottoms area, which will, in turn, help \nprovide a safe and fruitful habitat for migratory birds and wildlife \nand help stop the erosion that threatens to change the course of the \nOhio River.\n  Outdoor recreationalists, including hunters, fishermen, birdwatchers, \nnature photographers, will enjoy many benefits from the protection and \nrestoration of a diverse and thriving wildlife habitat. Indeed, the \nproposed refuge area already hosts a large population of white-tailed \ndeer, gray squirrel, catfish, and carp, which will provide exceptional \nhunting and fishing opportunities.\n  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service already has taken significant \nsteps to make the Green River National Wildlife Refuge a reality. I \nthink it is important, however, to ensure that any land acquired for \nthis refuge is obtained only from willing sellers, just as is the case \nwith Clarks River National Wildlife Refuge. Although I understand that \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has no plans to condemn private \nproperty for the refuge, I believe that the landowners in Henderson \nCounty deserve a legislative guarantee to assure that the Refuge will \nnot infringe upon their rights as private property owners. My \nlegislation would provide that guarantee.\n  I look forward to partnering with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service \nto bring this project to fruition, and I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of this bill, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1898\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Green River National \n     Wildlife Refuge Act of 2002''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) the Green River bottoms area, Kentucky, was once part \n     of a large bottomland hardwood forest;\n       (2) most of the bottoms area has been converted to \n     agricultural use through--\n       (A) draining of wetland;\n       (B) altering of interior drainage systems; and\n       (C) clearing of bottomland hardwood forest;\n       (3) as of the date of enactment of this Act, the bottoms \n     area is predominantly ridge and swale farmland, with river-\n     scar oxbows, several sloughs, wet depression areas, and a \n     small quantity of bottomland hardwood forest;\n       (4) approximately 1,200 acres of bottomland hardwood forest \n     remain, consisting mostly of cypress, willow, hackberry, \n     silver maple, ash, and buttonbush;\n       (5) many of the interior drainage systems on the land offer \n     excellent opportunities to restore, with minor modifications, \n     the historical hydrology, wetland, and bottomland hardwood \n     forest of the bottoms area to high-quality wildlife habitats;\n       (6) in the bottoms area, waterfowl occur in large numbers \n     when sufficient water levels occur, primarily when flood \n     conditions from the Ohio River and the Green River negate the \n     extensive drainages and alterations made by man;\n       (7) the wooded and shrub tracts of the bottoms area are \n     used by many species of nongame neotropical migratory birds;\n       (8) migratory shorebirds use the bottoms area during spring \n     migrations;\n       (9) wading birds such as snipe, great blue heron, green \n     heron, common egret, and great egret frequent the bottoms \n     area;\n       (10) bald eagles and myriad other raptors frequent the \n     bottoms area;\n       (11) several species listed as endangered or threatened \n     species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1531 et seq.) have been found near the bottoms area, \n     including Indiana bat maternity colonies, fanshell, pink \n     mucket pearly mussel, and fat pocketbook;\n       (12) several species of mussel listed as endangered or \n     threatened species under that Act historically occurred near \n     the bottoms area, including purple cat's paw pearly mussel, \n     tubercled-blossom pearly mussel, ring pink, and white \n     wartyback pearly mussel;\n       (13) the copperbelly water snake, covered by the \n     Copperbelly Water Snake Conservation Plan, is found in the \n     wetland complex and buttonbush shrub in the Scuffletown area;\n       (14) significant populations of resident game species, \n     including white-tailed deer, swamp rabbit, cottontail rabbit, \n     gray squirrel, mink, muskrat, beaver, fox, and coyote, occur \n     in the bottoms area;\n       (15) the Ohio River and the Green River are important \n     habitat for big river species such as paddlefish, sturgeon, \n     catfish, carp, buffalo, and gar;\n       (16) conservation, enhancement, and ecological restoration \n     of the bottoms area through inclusion in the National \n     Wildlife Refuge System would help meet the habitat \n     conservation goals of--\n       (A) the North American Waterfowl Management Plan;\n       (B) the Lower Mississippi Joint Venture;\n       (C) the Interior Low Plateaus Bird Conservation Plan; and\n       (D) the Copperbelly Water Snake Conservation Plan;\n       (17) the valuable complex of wetland habitats comprising \n     the bottoms area, with its many forms of wildlife, has \n     extremely high recreational value for hunters, anglers, \n     birdwatchers, nature photographers, and others; and\n       (18) the Green River bottoms area is deserving of inclusion \n     in the National Wildlife Refuge System.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to establish the Green River \n     National Wildlife Refuge in the Green River bottoms area, \n     Henderson County, Kentucky, to provide--\n       (1) habitat for migrating and wintering waterfowl;\n       (2) habitat for nongame land birds;\n       (3) habitats for a natural diversity of fish and wildlife;\n       (4) nesting habitat for wood ducks and other locally \n     nesting migratory waterfowl;\n       (5) high-quality hunting and sportfishing opportunities; \n     and\n       (6) opportunities for environmental education, \n     interpretation, and wildlife-oriented recreation.\n\n     SEC. 4.

or\n       (ii) such individual does not meet requirements relating to \n     availability for work, active search for work, or refusal to \n     accept work, because such individual is seeking, or is \n     available for, only part-time (and not full-time) work, then \n     eligibility for temporary enhanced unemployment compensation \n     under subparagraph (A) shall be determined without regard to \n     the fact that such individual is seeking, or is available \n     for, only part-time (and not full-time) work, except that \n     this clause shall not apply unless--\n\n       (I) the individual's employment on which eligibility for \n     the temporary enhanced unemployment compensation is based was \n     part-time employment;

or\n       (II) $25.\n\n       (ii) Individuals not eligible for regular compensation but \n     eligible for teuc by reason of subparagraph (b).--In the case \n     of an individual who is eligible for temporary enhanced \n     unemployment compensation under this paragraph by reason of \n     either clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (B), the amount of \n     temporary enhanced unemployment compensation payable to such \n     individual for any week shall be equal to the amount of \n     compensation payable to such individual (as determined under \n     subparagraph (A)) for the week, plus an amount equal to the \n     greater of--\n\n       (I) 15 percent of the amount so determined; or\n       (II) $25.\n\n       (iii) Rounding.--For purposes of determining the amount \n     under clause (i)(I) or (ii)(I), such amount shall be rounded \n     to the dollar amount specified under the State law.\n       (c) Nonreduction Rule.--Under an agreement entered into \n     under this title, subsection (b)(2)(C) shall not apply (or \n     shall cease to apply) with respect to a State upon a \n     determination by the Secretary that the method governing the \n     computation of regular compensation under the State law of \n     that State has been modified in a way such that the average \n     weekly amount of regular compensation which will be payable \n     during the period of the agreement (determined disregarding \n     any temporary enhanced unemployment compensation) will be \n     less than the average weekly amount of regular compensation \n     which would otherwise have been payable during such period \n     under the State law, as in effect on September 11, 2001.\n       (d) Coordination Rules.--\n       (1) Regular compensation payable under a federal law.--\n     Rules similar to the rules under subsection (b)(2) shall \n     apply in determining the amount of benefits payable under any \n     Federal law to the extent that those benefits are determined \n     by reference to regular compensation payable under the State \n     law of the State involved.\n       (2) Temporary supplemental unemployment compensation to \n     serve as second-tier benefits.--Notwithstanding any other \n     provision of law, neither regular compensation, temporary \n     enhanced unemployment compensation, extended compensation, \n     nor additional compensation under any Federal or State law \n     shall be payable to any individual for any week for which \n     temporary supplemental unemployment compensation is payable \n     to such individual.\n       (3) Treatment of other unemployment compensation.--After \n     the date on which a State enters into an agreement under this \n     title, any regular compensation (or, as the case may be, \n     temporary enhanced unemployment compensation) in excess of 26 \n     weeks, any extended compensation, and any additional \n     compensation under any Federal or State law shall be payable \n     to an individual in accordance with the State law after such \n     individual has exhausted any rights to temporary supplemental \n     unemployment compensation under the agreement.\n       (e) Exhaustion of Benefits.--For purposes of subsection \n     (b)(1)(B)(i)(I), an individual shall be considered to have \n     exhausted such individual's rights to regular compensation \n     (or, as the case may be, rights to temporary enhanced \n     unemployment compensation) under a State law (or agreement \n     under this title) when--\n       (1) no payments of regular compensation (or, as the case \n     may be, rights to temporary enhanced unemployment \n     compensation) can be made under such law (or such agreement) \n     because the individual has received all such compensation \n     available to the individual based on employment or wages \n     during the individual's base period; or\n\n[[Page S140]]\n\n       (2) the individual's rights to such compensation have been \n     terminated by reason of the expiration of the benefit year \n     with respect to which such rights existed.\n       (f) Weekly Benefit Amount, Terms and Conditions, Etc. \n     Relating to Temporary Supplemental Unemployment \n     Compensation.--For purposes of any agreement under this \n     title--\n       (1) the amount of temporary supplemental unemployment \n     compensation which shall be payable to an individual for any \n     week of total unemployment shall be equal to--\n       (A) the amount of regular compensation (including \n     dependents' allowances) payable to such individual under the \n     State law for a week for total unemployment during such \n     individual's benefit year;

Mr. President, I enjoyed the opportunity last week in \nBrussels, Belgium, to address the permanent representatives to the \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, on the subject of the \nAlliance's forthcoming summit in Prague next November, as well as the \nlikely agenda that will include the issues of NATO enlargement and \nRussia-NATO cooperation.\n  Perhaps more importantly, I was asked to consider and discuss with \nthe Ambassadors of NATO the Alliance's future 3, 5, and 10 years out \nand to assess the impact of the events of September 11 and the \nconsequent war on terrorism with the future role of NATO. These are the \ncomments I made on that occasion.\n  There are moments in history when world events suddenly allow us to \nsee the challenges facing our societies with a degree of clarity \npreviously unimaginable. The events of September 11 have created one of \nthose rare moments. We can see clearly the challenges we face and now \nconfront and what needs to be done.\n  September 11 forced Americans to recognize that the United States is \nexposed to an existential threat from terrorism and the possible use of \nweapons of mass destruction by terrorists. Meeting that threat is the \npremier security challenge of our time. There is a clear and present \ndanger that terrorists will gain the capability to carry out \ncatastrophic attacks on Europe and the United States using nuclear, \nbiological, or chemical weapons.\n  In 1996, I made, the Chair will recall, an unsuccessful bid for the \nPresidency of the United States. Three of my campaign television ads on \nthat occasion, widely criticized for being farfetched and grossly \nalarming, depicted a mushroom cloud and warned of the existential \nthreat posed by the growing dangers of weapons of mass destruction in \nthe hands of terrorist groups. I argued that the next President should \nbe selected on the basis of being able to meet that challenge.\n  Recently, those ads have been replayed on national television and are \nviewed from a different perspective. The images of those planes \ncrashing into the World Trade Center on September 11 will remain with \nus all for some time to come. We might not have been able to prevent \nthe attacks of September 11, but we can draw the right lessons from \nthose events now, and one of those lessons is just how vulnerable our \nsocieties are to such attacks.\n  September 11 has destroyed many myths. One of those was the belief \nthat the West was no longer threatened after the collapse of communism \nand our victory in the cold war, and perhaps nowhere was that myth \nstronger than in the United States where many Americans believed that \nAmerica's strength made us invulnerable. We know now we are all \nvulnerable--Americans and Europeans.\n  The terrorists seek massive impact through indiscriminate killing of \npeople and destruction of institutions, historical symbols, and the \nbasic fabric of our societies. The next attack, however, could just as \neasily be in London, Paris, or Berlin as in Washington, and it could, \nor is even likely to, involve weapons or materials of mass destruction.\n  The sober reality is that the danger of Americans and Europeans being \nkilled today at work or at home is perhaps greater than at any time in \nrecent history. Indeed, the threat we face today may be just as \nexistential as the one we faced during the cold war since it is \nincreasingly likely to involve the use of weapons of mass destruction \nagainst our societies.\n\n  We are again at one of those moments when we must look in the mirror \nand ask ourselves whether we as leaders are prepared to draw the right \nconclusions and do what we can now to reduce that threat or whether it \nwill take another, even deadlier, attack to force us into action.\n  Each of us recognizes that the war against terrorism and weapons of \nmass destruction must be fought on many fronts--at home and abroad--and \nit must be fought with many tools--political, economic, and military.\n  President Bush is seeking to lead a global coalition in a global war \nto root out terrorist cells and stop nation states from harboring \nterrorists.\n  The flip side of this policy is one that I have spent a lot of time \nthinking about; namely, the urgent need to extend the war on terrorism \nto nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. Al-Qaida-like terrorists \nwill use NBC weapons if they can obtain them.\n  Our task can be succinctly stated: Together we must keep the world's \nmost dangerous technologies out of the hands of the world's most \ndangerous people. The events of September 11 and the subsequent public \ndiscovery of al-Qaida's methods, capabilities, and intentions have \nfinally brought the vulnerability of our countries to the forefront.\n  The terrorists have demonstrated suicidal tendencies and are beyond \ndeterrence. We must anticipate they will use weapons of mass \ndestruction in NATO countries if allowed that opportunity.\n  Without oversimplifying the motivations of terrorists in the past, it \nappears that most acts of terror attempted to bring about change in a \nregime or change in governance or status in a community or state.\n  Usually, the terrorists made demands that could be negotiated or \naccommodated. The targets were selected to create and increase pressure \nfor change.\n  In contrast, the al-Qaida terrorist attacks on the United States were \nplanned to kill thousands of people indiscriminately. There were no \ndemands for change or negotiation. Osama bin Laden was filmed \nconversing about results of the attack which exceeded his earlier \npredictions of destruction. Massive destruction of institutions, \nwealth, national morale, and innocent people was clearly his objective.\n  Over 3,000 people from a host of countries perished. Recent economic \nestimates indicate $60 billion of loss to the\n\n[[Page S148]]\n\nUnited States economy from all facets of the September 11 attacks and \nthe potential loss of over 1.6 million jobs. Horrible as these results \nhave been, military experts have written about the exponential \nexpansion of those losses had the al-Qaida terrorists used weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  The minimum standard for victory in this kind of war is the \nprevention of any of the individual terrorists or terrorist cells from \nobtaining weapons or materials of mass destruction.\n  The current war effort in Afghanistan is destroying the Afghan-based \nal-Qaida network and the Taliban regime. The campaign is also designed \nto demonstrate that governments that are hosts to terrorists face \nretribution. But as individual NATO countries prosecute this war, NATO \nmust pay much more attention to the other side of the equation--that \nis, making certain that all weapons and materials of mass destruction \nare identified, continuously guarded, and systematically destroyed.\n  Unfortunately, beyond Russia and other states of the former Soviet \nUnion, Nunn-Lugar-style cooperative threat reduction programs aimed at \nnon-proliferation do not exist. They must now be created on a global \nscale, with counter-terrorism joining counter-proliferation as our \nprimary objectives.\n  Today we lack even minimal international confidence about many \nweapons programs, including the number of weapons or amounts of \nmaterials produced, the storage procedures employed, and production or \ndestruction programs. NATO allies must join with the United States to \nchange this situation. We need to join together to restate the terms of \nminimal victory in the war against terrorism we are currently \nfighting--to wit, that every nation that has weapons and materials of \nmass destruction must account for what it has, spend its own money or \nobtain international technical and financial resources to safely secure \nwhat it has, and pledge that no other nation, cell or cause will be \nallowed access to or use of these weapons or materials.\n  Some nations, after witnessing the bombing of Afghanistan and the \ndestruction of the Taliban government, may decide to proceed along a \ncooperative path of accountability regarding their weapons and \nmaterials of mass destruction. But other states may decide to test the \nU.S. will and staying power. Such testing will be less likely if the \nNATO allies stand shoulder to shoulder with the U.S. in pursuing such a \ncounter-terrorism policy.\n  The precise replication of the Nunn-Lugar program will not be \npossible everywhere, but a satisfactory level of accountability, \ntransparency and safety can and must be established in every nation \nwith a weapons of mass destruction program. When such nations resist \nsuch accountability, or their governments make their territory \navailable to terrorists who are seeking weapons of mass destruction, \nthen NATO nations should be prepared to join with the U.S. to use force \nas well as all diplomatic and economic tools at their collective \ndisposal.\n  I do not mention the use of military force lightly or as a passing \ncomment. The use of military force could mean war against a nation \nstate remote from Europe or North America. This awesome contingency \nrequires the utmost in clarity now. Without being redundant, let me \ndescribe the basic elements of such a strategy even more explicitly.\n  NATO should list all nation states which now house terrorist cells, \nvoluntarily or involuntarily. The list should be supplemented with a \nmap which illustrates to all of our citizens the location of these \nstates, and how large the world is. Through intelligence sharing, \ntermination of illicit financial channels, support of local police \nwork, diplomacy, and public information, NATO and a broader coalition \nof nations fighting terrorism will seek to root out each cell in a \ncomprehensive manner for years to come and keep a public record of \nsuccess that the world can observe and measure. If we are diligent and \ndetermined, we will end most terrorist possibilities.\n  Perhaps most importantly, we will draw up a second list that will \ncontain all of the states that have materials, programs, and/or weapons \nof mass destruction. We will demand that each of these nation states \naccount for all of the materials, programs, and weapons in a manner \nwhich is internationally verifiable. We will demand that all such \nweapons and materials be made secure from theft or threat of \nproliferation using the funds of that nation state and supplemented by \ninternational funds if required. We will work with each nation state to \nformulate programs of continuing accountability and destruction which \nmay be of mutual benefit to the safety of citizens in the host state as \nwell as the international community. The latter will be a finite list, \nand success in the war against terrorism will not be achieved until all \nnations on that list have complied with these standards.\n  The Nunn-Lugar program has demonstrated that extraordinary \ninternational relationships are possible to improve controls over \nweapons of mass destruction. Programs similar to the Nunn-Lugar program \nshould be established in each of the countries in the coalition against \nterrorism that wishes to work with the United States and hopefully its \nNATO allies on safe storage, accountability and planned destruction.\n\n  If these remarks had been delivered before September 11, I would now \noffer some eloquent thoughts about the importance of continuing NATO \nenlargement and of trying to build a cooperative NATO-Russian \nrelationship. In a speech last summer preceding the remarkable call by \nPresident Bush in Warsaw for a NATO which stretched from the Baltics to \nthe Black Sea, I listed Slovenia, Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, \nRomania, and Bulgaria as strong candidates for membership \nconsideration. I visited five of these countries last summer to \nencourage continuing progress in meeting the criteria for joining the \nAlliance. After ten years of hands-on experience in working with \nRussian political, military, and scientific leaders to carefully secure \nand to destroy materials and weapons of mass destruction in cooperative \nthreat reduction programs, I anticipate that a new NATO-Russian \nrelationship could be of enormous benefit in meeting the dangerous \nchallenges which we must now confront together. In many ways, September \n11 has strengthened my conviction that both of these efforts are \ncritical.\n  But they can no longer be our only major priorities. As important as \nthey are, neither NATO enlargement nor NATO-Russia cooperation is the \nmost critical issue facing our nations today. That issue is the war on \nterrorism. NATO has to decide whether it wants to participate in this \nwar. It has to decide whether it wants to be relevant in addressing the \nmajor security challenge of our day. Those of us who have been the most \nstalwart proponents of enlargement in the past have an obligation to \npoint out that, as important as NATO enlargement remains, the major \nsecurity challenge we face today is the intersection of terrorism with \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  If we fail to defend our societies from a major terrorist attack \ninvolving weapons of mass destruction, we and the Alliance will have \nfailed in the most fundamental sense of defending our nations and our \nway of life--and ultimately no one will care what NATO did or did not \naccomplish on enlargement at the Prague summit in November this year. \nThat's why the Alliance must fundamentally rethink its role in the \nworld in the wake of September 11.\n  At the Washington summit in the spring of 1999, NATO heads of state \nmade a bold statement. They stated that they wanted NATO to be as \nrelevant to the threats of the next 50 years as it was to the threats \nof the past five decades.\n  The Alliance invoked Article 5 for the first time in its history in \nresponse to September 11. But, NATO itself has only played a limited, \nlargely political and symbolic role in the war against terrorism. To \nsome degree, Washington's reluctance to turn to NATO was tied to the \nfact that the U.S. had to scramble to put together a military response \ninvolving logistics, basing and special forces quickly--and it was \neasier to do that ourselves. Since it was the U.S. itself that was \nattacked, we were highly motivated to assume the lion's share of burden \nof the military role of the war on terrorism and we had the capability \nto do so.\n\n  But U.S. reticence to turn to NATO was also tied to other facts. Some \nAmericans have lost confidence in the Alliance. Years of cuts in \ndefense\n\n[[Page S149]]\n\nspending and failure to meet pledge after pledge to improve European \nmilitary capabilities has left some Americans with doubts as to what \nour allies could realistically contribute. Rightly or wrongly, the \nlegacy of Kosovo has reinforced the concern that NATO is not up to the \njob of fighting a modern war. The U.S. did have confidence in a select \ngroup of individual allies. But it did not have confidence in the \ninstitution that is NATO. The fact that some military leaders of NATO's \nleading power didn't want to use the Alliance it has led for half a \ncentury is a worrying sign.\n  Some in Washington did suggest to the Administration that it could \nand should be more creative in involving NATO. Senator Joseph Biden and \nI, for example, wrote an ``op-ed'' suggesting a number of tasks the \nAlliance could assume in the war on terrorism. But I am not here to \nsecond-guess the President and his national security team on these \nissues. Whether we should have used NATO more is a question best left \nto future historians. The strategy the U.S. employed in Afghanistan \nworked, and I congratulate the Administration for that success.\n  The key issue is: where do we go from here? Will we--Americans and \nEuropeans--now decide to prepare NATO for the next stages in the war \nagainst terrorism? If not, how should we organize outside of NATO to \nmeet the military challenges of the war on terrorism? What do we want \nNATO to look like in three to five years? How do we launch that process \nbetween now and the Prague summit next November?\n  We will not find a single American answer to these questions. Indeed, \nas I listen to the administration and my colleagues around Washington, \nI hear very different views. One school of thought holds that NATO \nshould simply remain the guarantor of peace in Europe. With successful \nintegration of all of Central and Eastern Europe into the Alliance, \nthey see NATO's next priority as trying to integrate Russia and Ukraine \ninto European security via the new NATO-Russia Council. They accept the \nfact that NATO is likely to become more and more a political \norganization such as the OSCE but one with at least some military \nmuscle. They consider any attempt to give the Alliance a military role \nbeyond Europe ``a bridge too far.'' If all NATO does is keep the peace \nin an increasingly secure Europe, that's enough.\n  A second school thinks NATO as it is currently constituted is about \nthe best we can do. It does not want to take a big leap forward either \nwith regard to NATO cooperation with Russia or with respect to new \nmissions such as a war against terrorism. This school would be willing \nto enlarge to some additional countries but is much more cautious about \nNATO-Russia cooperation. It is willing to work with allies on future \nmissions, but on an ad hoc basis and not as an Alliance, lest a NATO \nframework create ``war by committee'' and coalition ``drag'' on the \nprosecution of hostilities. It prefers a division of labor whereby the \nU.S. focuses on the big wars and leaves peacekeeping in and around \nEurope to the Europeans.\n\n  A third way of thinking about NATO is to see it as the natural \ndefense arm of the trans-Atlantic community and the institution we \nshould turn to for help in meeting new challenges such as terrorism and \nweapons of mass destruction. With Europe increasingly secure, the \nAlliance needs to be ``retooled'' so that it can handle the most \ncritical threats to our security. If that means it has to go beyond \nEurope in the future, so be it.\n  This last way of thinking about NATO's future is closest to my own \nfor several reasons. First, I have always had a problem with the \n``division of labor'' argument that assumes the U.S. will handle the \nbig wars outside of Europe and lets Europeans take care of the small \nwars within Europe. It presupposes that the U.S. has less interest in \nEurope and that Europeans have less interests in the rest of the world. \nBoth are wrong. We have interests in Europe and Europeans have \ninterests in the rest of the world--and we should be trying to tackle \nthem together.\n  Second, the U.S. needs a military alliance with Europe to confront \neffectively problems such as terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. \nWe cannot do it on an ad hoc basis. We were willing to proceed more or \nless alone in Afghanistan. But we might not be so inclined next time, \ndepending on the circumstances. What if the next attack is on Europe--\nor on America and Europe simultaneously? The model used in Afghanistan \nwould not work in those scenarios. Americans expect our closest allies \nto fight with us in this war on terrorism--and they expect our leaders \nto come up with a structure that allows us to do so promptly and \nsuccessfully.\n  Third, the problem we faced in Kosovo, and the problems we are \nencountering with respect to developing adequate military capabilities \nto meet the new threats, do not lead me to conclude that the answer is \nto reduce NATO to a purely political role. Rather, they are arguments \nto expand our efforts to fix capability problems so that NATO can \noperate more effectively in the future. Americans do not want to carry \nthe entire military burden of the war on terrorism by themselves. Nor \nshould we. We want allies to share the burden. The last attack may have \nbeen unique in that regard. We were shocked by attacks on our homeland. \nThe U.S. was prepared to respond immediately and to do most of the work \nitself. But what if the next attack is on Brussels, or on France and \nthe U.S. at the same time?\n  Finally, some of my critics have said: Senator, that is a great idea \nbut it simply is not ``doable.'' And it would be a mistake even to try \nbecause you might fail and that would embarrass President Bush and hurt \nthe Alliance. I find it hard to believe that the U.S. and Europe--some \nof the richest and most advanced countries in the world--are incapable \nof organizing themselves to come up with an effective military alliance \nto fight this new threat.\n  When NATO was founded, there were those who said it would be \nimpossible to have a common strategy toward the Soviet Union. And in \nearly 1993 when I delivered my first speech calling for NATO not only \nto enlarge but to prepare for substantial ``out of area'' activities, \nmany people told me that what I was proposing ran the risk of \ndestroying the Alliance. Those of us who believed in NATO enlargement \nstuck to our guns. We now have three new Permanent Representatives at \nNATO Headquarters, and a much more vital NATO as a result.\n\n  My view can be easily summarized. America is at war and feels more \nvulnerable than at any time since the end of the cold war and perhaps \nsince World War II. The threat we face is global and existential. We \nneed allies and alliances to confront it effectively. Those alliances \ncan no longer be circumscribed by artificial geographic boundaries. All \nof America's alliances are going to be reviewed and recast in light of \nthis new challenge, including NATO. If NATO is not up to the challenge \nof becoming effective in the new war against terrorism, then our \npolitical leaders may be inclined to search for something else that \nwill answer this need.\n  I believe that September 11 opened an enormous opportunity to \nrevitalize the trans-Atlantic relationship. It would be a mistake to \nlet this opportunity slip through our fingers. Neither side of the \nAtlantic has thus far grasped that opportunity fully. It is a time to \nthink big, not small. It is a time when our proposals should not be \nmeasured by what we think is ``doable'' but rather shaped by what needs \nto be done to meet the new existential threat we face.\n  In the early 1990s we needed to make the leap from NATO defending \nWestern Europe to the Alliance assuming responsibility for the \ncontinent as a whole. Today we must make a further leap and recognize \nthat, in a world in which terrorist threats can be planned in Germany, \nfinanced in Asia, and carried out in the United States, old \ndistinctions between ``in'' and ``out of area'' have become utterly \nmeaningless. Indeed, given the global nature of terrorism, boundaries \nand other geographical distinctions are without relevance.\n  At NATO's founding on April 4, 1949, President Harry S Truman \ndescribed the creation of the Alliance as a neighborly act taken by \ncountries conscious of a shared heritage and common values, as \ndemocracies determined to defend themselves against the threat they \nfaced. Those same values that Truman talked about defending in 1949 are \nunder attack today, but this time from a very different source.\n\n[[Page S150]]\n\n  In 1949, President Truman went on to say that the Washington Treaty \nwas a very simple document, but one that might have prevented two world \nwars had it been in existence in 1914 or 1939. Protecting Western \nEurope, he opined, was an important step toward creating peace in the \nworld. And he predicted that the positive impact of NATO would be felt \nbeyond its borders and throughout the World.\n\n  Those words strike me as prescient today. Truman was right. NATO \nprevented war in Europe for 50 years. It is now in the process of \nmaking all of Europe safe and secure and of building a new relationship \nwith Russia. That, in itself, is a remarkable accomplishment. But if \nNATO does not help tackle the most pressing security threat to our \ncountries today--a threat I believe is existential because it involves \nthe threat of weapons of mass destruction--it will cease to be the \npremier alliance it has been and will become increasingly marginal.\n  That is why NATO's agenda for Prague has to be both broadened--and \nintegrated. While NATO enlargement and deepened NATO-Russia cooperation \nwill be central to the summit's agenda, they must now be complemented \nby a plan to translate the fighting of terrorism into one of NATO's \ncentral military missions. NATO enlargement and NATO-Russia cooperation \nshould be pursued in a way that strengthens, not weakens, that agenda. \nThis means that new members must be willing and able to sign up to new \nNATO requirements in this area, and that the new NATO-Russia Council \nmust be structured in a way that strongly supports the Alliance in \nundertaking such new military tasks.\n  To leave NATO focused solely on defending the peace in Europe from \nthe old threats would be to reduce it to sort of a housekeeping role in \nan increasingly secure continent. To do so at a time when we face a new \nexistential threat posed by terrorism and weapons of mass destruction \nwill condemn it to a marginal role in meeting the major challenge of \nour time.\n  That is why this issue has to be front and center on NATO's agenda \nbefore, during and after Prague. The reality is that we can launch the \nnext round of NATO enlargement as well as a new NATO-Russia \nrelationship at Prague, and the Alliance can still be seen as failing--\nthat's right, failing--unless it starts to transform itself into an \nimportant new force in the war on terrorism.\n  I plan to work with the Bush administration in the months and years \nahead in an effort to promote such a transformation of the Alliance and \nhope that Allied governments as well as Members of Congress and the \nmembers of the legislatures we represent will strongly, \nenthusiastically join me in this effort.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to stand before the \nSenate today to wholeheartedly endorse the nomination of Mike Smith to \nbe the Assistant Secretary of Energy for Fossil Energy.\n  Mike is a red-white-and-blue American. He has an outstanding pedigree \nincluding the good common sense to come from the great State of \nOklahoma. In fact, in his own words, ``I was born and raised in the \nmiddle of the Oklahoma City Field and attended the only high school in \nthe Nation with a producing oil well in the middle of the front \nsidewalk.''\n  Mike then proudly donned the crimson and cream of the University of \nOklahoma for 7 years while earning his undergraduate and law degrees.\n  Immediately thereafter, he patriotically donned Army green during the \nVietnam war.\n  As an attorney he has represented oil and gas workers, drilling \ncontractors, service companies, exploration firms, independents, and, \nultimately, larger operators.\n  He knows business, too, having run a small, independent oil and gas \ncompany in central and western Oklahoma. He has served on the board of \ndirectors of the Oklahoma Independent Petroleum Association and been \nits president.\n  Moreover, Mike Smith brings to the Department of Energy an excellent \nbackground in government service. He served on the Oklahoma Energy \nResources Board, a State agency, providing environmental cleanup and \npublic education, voluntarily funded by our State's producers and \nroyalty owners.\n  Mike served under the sky blue and buckskin tan flag of Oklahoma when \nGov. Frank Keating appointed him to be Oklahoma's Secretary of Energy. \nIn that capacity Mike served my State as its official representative to \nthe Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, the Interstate Mining \nCompact Commission, the Southern States Energy Board, and the \nGovernors' Ethanol Coalition.\n  President Bush has assembled a banner group to assist him in running \nthe Department of Energy, beginning with my friend and former \ncolleague, Secretary Spence Abraham. Mike Smith is of the highest \ncaliber and another true-blue selection by President Bush.\n  I am proud of my fellow Oklahoman. I am excited to work closely with \nhim to develop our national energy policy, particularly to ensure \nadequate supplies of affordable and clean energy.\n  America's energy strengths derive from the rich natural bounty of our \ncoal, our natural gas, and our oil, as well as from our blessed human \ningenuity fostered by America's free market.\n  I am proud to testify to my fellow Americans that America's energy \nstrengths will be handled with flying colors by the ingenuity of \nOklahoman Mike Smith.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, as the majority leader indicated earlier \ntoday, we have confirmed, I believe, 43 nominations including action on \ntoday's 2 judges. That is really a good piece of work for the week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "25"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/01/25/senate-section/article/S151-1", "month": "01", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NOMINATIONS DISCHARGED\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF EDWARD KINGMAN, OF MARYLAND, TO BE ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF \n   TREASURY AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER AT THE DEPARTMENT OF TREASURY\n\n  Mr. REID.
