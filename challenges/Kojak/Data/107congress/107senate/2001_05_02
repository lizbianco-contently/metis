Under the previous order, the \nSenate will now resume postcloture consideration of the motion to \nproceed to S. 1.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to have the opportunity to \ndiscuss the education bill for 10 minutes, please.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is so \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we come to the floor again today to \nconsider education. I think, unfortunately, we are still talking about \nthe postcloture motion and have not yet had the opportunity actually to \nmove to the bill. We are hopeful there will be some decisions made in \nthe next hour, hour and a half, so that we can come to the bill.\n  Clearly, there will be differences of our views with respect to this \nlegislation. That is not a new idea. But we need to get on with it. We \nneed to come to this Chamber and begin to make our arguments and, where \nthere are differences of opinion, have amendments and move forward with \nthem.\n  I think most people agree that one of the major issues before us is \neducation. Certainly there are different views as to what the role of \nthe Federal Government is with regard to elementary and secondary \neducation. There are different views as to how much involvement the \nFederal Government ought to have with respect to financing elementary \nand secondary education.\n  I think most of us believe that is a primary function of the State \nand local governments, and has been traditionally over time, and I \nbelieve for good reason. No. 1, we want the control largely to remain \nthere; indeed, it should remain there.\n\n[[Page S4126]]\n\n  With respect to money, even though, obviously, it is very important, \nmoney is not the only salvation for education. There needs to be policy \nchanges. There needs to be more accountability, measurement of \nprogress. Money alone--and we talked about this when I was in the \nWyoming legislature--we know that money alone is not the only \nsalvation, that there need to also be these other principles. But \nwithout money, of course, those things cannot be accomplished.\n  Since 1994, when the Republicans took over Congress as the majority, \nthere has been a 50-percent increase in funding for education. We will \nhear about how the Republicans are reluctant to fund education \nproperly. The fact is, this Republican Congress has funded it at a much \nhigher rate than was done previously by the Democrats or, indeed, even \nsuggested under the Clinton administration. It still is an issue, but \nthe idea that Republicans have not been generous with money is just \nsimply not factual.\n  There are other issues, however, that are really key to what we want \nto do with S. 1. First, it is symbolic that it is S. 1. That indicates \nthat as we came into this Congress, education was our highest priority. \nSo there we are.\n  There are a number of things that are very important. One is \naccountability. Title I of this bill indicates that when schools fail \nto adequately have progress, they will receive technical assistance \nfrom the Federal Government. In order to make sure there is progress, \nof course, there has to be some testing.\n  Clearly, there are different views about testing: Whether it ought to \nbe mandated, whether it ought to be done only by the State's decision. \nI happen to believe the States ought to be the ones to decide how it is \ndone. But there needs to be testing if you are going to have Federal \nfunding. If you are going to have the kind of mobility we have where \nyoung people are going to school in Utah and end up working in New \nYork, there needs to be some measure of whether or not those \neducational opportunities are going to be similar so that you can deal \nwith the mobility we all have.\n  So under this title, there would be technical assistance available \nfor schools where the progress was not up to the average and certainly \nnot making advancement. If the school failed to have adequate progress \nin the second year, it would be placed in another category of \ncorrective action. Students in that school then would begin to be able \nto transfer to other public schools.\n  This is one of the things where you measure performance and then give \nsome kind of relief when, in fact, performance is not being exhibited. \nThis does not, at the present time, include the private school options. \nSome argue, of course, that there ought to be vouchers for private \nschools. Again, there is a very legitimate difference of view as to \nthat issue. I am sure it will be discussed at some point during the \nconsideration of this bill.\n  Accountability: Schools in a corrective action category that fail to \nmake progress over 3 years would be required to do something \ndifferent--to change staff, to close the school, to do something that \nwould show that progress needs to be made.\n  We mentioned public school choice. That is there. We happen to have \nsome experience in my hometown of Casper, WY, where they have started a \nnumber of charter schools. Casper, by the way, is not a big city--about \n50,000 people. It is our second largest city in Wyoming. They have \ncharter schools so there are some choices within the public school \nsystem so that parents can participate. In this bill there are \nopportunities for assistance in transportation for students of that \nkind and also some opportunities for low production schools for people \nto be able to use some of the Federal money for that.\n  The key to education, most everyone would agree, is teachers, quality \nteachers. We have excellent teachers generally, and teachers try very \nhard to do their things. I admire teachers very much, particularly \nsince my wife is one in a public high school. On the other hand, we are \ngoing to find a time soon when there will be lots of teachers retiring \nand running into that, whatever profession it is, whether it is nurses \nor teachers. We are going to need a great number of new teachers, and \nthere needs to be incentives for teachers to be trained. There needs to \nbe some opportunities for teachers to have continuing education \ncertainly and to do some things, to do some things particularly in \nspecifics. If they are teaching math, if they are teaching science, \nthere ought to be people who have really good backgrounds in that.\n  The technology, of course, is one of the things for which we will be \nsearching--opportunities to do that.\n  Here we are, talking about accountability. We are talking about \nimproving teaching opportunities, improving the skills of teachers so \nthey can be, indeed, more effective in the teaching they do.\n  One of the areas, of course, is going to be flexibility. This is \nalways a controversial thing with Federal money. With Federal money, do \nthere have to be regulations that go with it to use it this way or the \nhighway? No, it doesn't need to be that way. It can be much more \nflexible. I suppose in many things, but in education there is such a \ndifference between the needs in small towns of Wyoming or Utah as \nopposed to downtown New York or Philadelphia. In many of the schools, \nthat is one of the controversies we have had over time. With Federal \nmoney, according to the last administration, you had to use it for \nsmaller class size. That is the only thing you can use it for, or you \nuse it for construction of school buildings, and that is all you can \nuse it for. Both of those, of course, are very important issues, but in \ndifferent school districts those things are quite different.\n  I can take you to some schools in Wyoming where class size is not the \nissue. I went to a one-room school in Wapiti, WY. Class size wasn't the \nproblem. Other things--technology, for example, access to the Internet, \ndoing the kinds of technological things that may be in a particular \nschool--are much more important. So this idea is to have some \nflexibility and to allow local school districts and the States to have, \nof course, the decisionmaking, along with the accountability. We can't \njust expect to send taxpayers' money out from the Federal level and \nsay: Do whatever you want; we don't care what happens to it. That is \nnot the point. The point is, use it for what you want with some \naccountability.\n  Other provisions: Of course, there are going to be \nreading initiatives. Most of us do believe that the ability to read, \nand read early, is certainly the first prerequisite to becoming \nsuccessful in education. Bilingual education, of course, is one of the \nreal keys to many of the students who have difficulty in meeting \nstandards, and so is literacy in English. So there are going to be a \nnumber of these things.\n\n  School safety: Obviously, we have had lots of bad experiences in the \nlast several years in terms of school safety. The Columbine incident \nsort of remolded our ideas about what we do there in terms of drug \nprevention and in terms of other kinds of safety. That will also be \ndealt with in this bill. So there are just really lots of things that \nare very helpful and things on which we need to move forward.\n  I am afraid we are going to find ourselves, before this week is over, \ndealing with the budget. I believe there is going to be some agreement \nthere. So we continue to put off this very important issue, and we need \nto move forward with it.\n  I mentioned the expenditures. I wish I had some of those charts here. \nIt is really interesting, as you look at a chart on expenditures versus \nreading scores that we have now, that expenditures go up fairly \ndramatically, up to about an $8,500 per pupil expenditure in this \ncountry. But 12th grade reading, 8th grade reading, 4th grade reading \nstay very constant and, indeed, edge down a little bit in the 4th grade \ncategory.\n  So again, as we said, money is not the only element. Indeed, it may \nnot be the most important element in terms of turning around where we \nare with respect to making improvements in our educational direction.\n  So these are the things we have talked about; these are the things \nthat are before us. I don't find it particularly new that we have \ndifferent views on how to do this. That is what this Senate is all \nabout--to bring together different views, to bring together different \nrepresentations of the needs of our individual constituencies, and yet \nto blend them in with the overall need\n\n[[Page S4127]]\n\nfor the national values of education and what our role is in causing \nthose things to be even better.\n  This morning we will be talking in fairly general terms about the \ngeneralities that are in this bill, which has received a great deal of \nattention and effort. It is a good one. It is generally supported, of \ncourse, by the administration, by the President who, by the way, had \neducation as his No. 1 issue in his campaign. I have been very proud of \nthe President, as a matter of fact, as someone who went out and talked \nabout issues, put priorities on issues in his campaign, laid them \nbefore the people before the election, and now is committed to doing \nthings he said he was going to do. That is as it should be.\n  I hope we are able to move forward and have an opportunity to debate \nthese things and come to a favorable conclusion.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the \nSenator from Washington, the Senator from Idaho be able to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as the Senate gets ready to update our \nNation's Federal education policy, I want to talk this morning about \nthe importance of the education debate, some of the issues that we all \nagree on, the principles that guide my decision, and a few concerns I \nhave as we look at this bill coming before us.\n  Since 1965, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act has defined \nhow the Federal Government helps students across the country. In \nAmerica, we believe that no matter where you are born, no matter who \nyou are or where you come from, and no matter whether your parents are \nrich or poor, every child deserves an equal chance to succeed.\n  This law, the ESEA, puts that principle into practice. Forty years \nago, many students did not get the help that they needed. Many lived in \npoor or rural areas that didn't have the tax base to support them. Many \nwere discriminated against and many were left behind because they had \nspecial needs.\n  In 1965, Congress passed the historic Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act to fix those problems, providing a safety net for \ndisadvantaged students, a stepping stone to help all students succeed, \nand a way to help us meet our education goals.\n  During the Cold War, ESEA helped us focus on building skills in math \nand science. Today, with our high-tech economy, ESEA is helping \nstudents learn to use technology. As we update this law, we are not \njust changing letters on a page; we are changing the law that helps \nmake our schools more equal, more fair, and more successful for \nstudents across the country. I take this responsibility very seriously.\n  The Senate may only debate education for a few weeks, but what we \ndecide will be felt in classrooms across the country for a decade or \nmore. So let's make sure we do this right.\n  As we begin this debate, there are some things about which all of us \nagree. We all agree that we want every child to reach his or her full \npotential. We all agree that taxpayer dollars should be used for \nefforts that we know work. We all agree that we can make a difference \nat the Federal level with what we do. Otherwise, this debate would not \nbe so heated. We know that Federal support is an important part of \nevery child's education.\n  Finally, we all want to be proud of America's schools. Today, there \nis a lot to be proud of. Every day, we hear stories about the progress \nkids are making. Every day, we talk to leaders who were inspired by \nteachers in our public schools--teachers who helped them succeed. I \nknow I would not be here today without great public school teachers.\n  The truth is, we have made a lot of progress as a country in \nimproving education. This is an opportunity to build on that progress. \nI have been in classrooms where teachers are excited and where the \nkids' eyes are bright and their minds are eager to learn.\n  In Washington State, our teachers, parents, educators, and businesses \nhave put together annual assessments that are changing the way we think \nabout education and expanding our possibilities. We are working on this \nbill because we know that States and local school districts want a \nFederal partner, and we are excited because we know that being a \nresponsible partner can help make sure great things happen in every \nschool.\n\n  Because we will be talking about a lot of different issues, I want to \noutline some of the principles I have developed to make sure we are \ndoing what is right for our students.\n  First of all, we have to invest in the methods we know work. I have \nbeen saying this for years. It is critical as we update our Nation's \neducation policy.\n  Second, we have to protect disadvantaged students and make sure they \nget the extra help and support they need.\n  Third, we have to make sure that public taxpayer dollars stay in \npublic schools.\n  Fourth, we have to help meet the national education goals we are \ncommitted to, whether it is making sure that every child can read, \nmaking sure every child gets the skills they need for tomorrow's \nworkforce, or making sure every child attends a school where they are \nsafe.\n  Finally, we have to set high standards and provide the resources so \nall students can meet them.\n  Those are my five principles as we begin this debate on education \npolicy.\n  Next, I want to outline some of the concerns I have at the start of \nthis debate. First of all, so far, I do not see a commitment from this \nadministration to provide the resources so all students can reach high \nstandards. We can't just tell students they have to meet certain goals \nwithout giving them the support they need to get there. Just telling \nstudents they have to pass a test or their school will be reconstituted \nwon't help a single student to learn to read or write.\n  So far, this administration has been very vocal about saying it will \npunish schools that don't improve. But it has been way too quiet on how \nthey will provide the resources so students can improve. Imposing tests \nand punishments without resources will not help students to learn. It \nwill just punish them.\n  I have a second concern, and this is about the President's testing \nplan. As we all know there is a lot of discussion about testing and \nwhether or not it works. That is a debate we ought to have and I expect \nwe will. But one thing is clear: We cannot require States to conduct \nthese expensive tests on a yearly basis without also giving the States \nthe resources to do what we are requiring.\n  As a former school board member and a State senator, I can tell you \nwhat will happen. President Bush will send an unfunded mandate to the \nStates requiring them to test students every year. The States and the \ndistricts and the schools will have to take money--some estimate the \ncost at $7 billion--away from things such as hiring teachers and \ndeveloping curriculums to pay for the tests. That is going to end up \nhurting students.\n  If President Bush doesn't pay for the tests he is imposing, students \nwill get hurt. I know a lot of my friends on the Republican side are \nvery concerned about unfunded mandates from the Federal government to \nthe States, so I hope they will follow through by ensuring that we fund \nthe tests that we are demanding.\n  There is another important question related to these new Federal \ntests. How are we going to use the results of these tests? If we use \ntest results to punish, we are not helping students. We should use \nthose test results for what they are--a tool--to show us what areas \nneed improvement. And we cannot stop there. We need to invest in the \nareas that need improvement. That is the right way to use tests: to \nmake schools better and to allow students to learn.\n  Finally, as I look at this proposed bill, I see gaping holes. The \nbill leaves out dedicated funding for class size reduction, for school \nconstruction, for teacher recruitment, and for school libraries. We \nknow these efforts have made a very positive difference for students \nacross this country.\n  Amendments are going to be offered, as we work our way through this \nbill,\n\n[[Page S4128]]\n\nto make sure it funds those important efforts. I plan to introduce one \nmyself on class size. I look forward to supporting a number of the \nothers.\n  So as the Senate gets ready to begin this very important debate, I \nhope we will all remember that what we do here will have a real impact \non students for years to come. We have an opportunity to bring success \nto every student across the country, to support the efforts that are \nworking, and to continue our role as an important partner in \neducational excellence.\n  Students, parents, and teachers are looking for support and for \nleadership, and I am going to do everything I can to make sure we \nprovide it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Mr. President, as you know and certainly now as our \ncountry knows, for this week and until we have concluded, we are \nfocused on the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act and the important role it plays in the future education \nof our young people.\n  By overwhelming majorities, Americans have said time and again that \nthey want education in this Nation improved. We cannot improve \neducation by merely throwing money at the problem. We have tried that \nfor a long time. Yet the performance of our young people against the \nperformance of other young people around the world simply does not rate \nas it should.\n  Our educational system does not need money alone, and that is why we \nhave spent the last several years looking at the concepts that fall \ntogether to create a dynamic education program of the kind that is so \nimportant for the future of our country and our country's young people.\n  Increased funding alone, as I have mentioned, will not help. Do we \nneed money? Of course we do, and with this bill, there is a substantial \namount of more money authorized. What we really need to look at is the \ntremendous bureaucracy of education that has grown up over the years in \nthe public systems in our country and does that, in fact, function in \nthe dynamic ways that are necessary to stay on the edge of educating in \na contemporary society. At the same time, we need to deal with all \nyoung people and all levels of learning that are so necessary to have a \nthorough and responsible system.\n\n  Our President has said time and again over the course of the last \nyear that he wants to leave no child behind. Neither do we. The \ncombination of our work, with the leadership of this new President, I \nbelieve, can accomplish what Americans have been asking for a long \ntime.\n  We have underperforming schools, and when we have underperforming \nschools we have children who have not been provided the opportunity to \nadvance as rapidly as they are capable of doing.\n  Clearly, if schools are underperforming, then children are \nunderperforming. And if they are not able to compete, then the \nlikelihood is they run the risk of underperforming for the remainder of \ntheir lives.\n  With the reauthorization of this act and its modernization, we are \ncreating levels of accountability that can become the cornerstone of \nthe advancement of the quality of education in our country, the kind of \naccountability that will bring constant reform to the educational \nsystem.\n  Key to accountability is the commonsense notion that we should not \nallow Federal dollars to follow failure, but clearly we have. If we \nused the concept that the current system needed more money and the \ncurrent system, in some instances, is failing, that is exactly what has \nbeen going on. We were financing failure without any level of \nmeasurement that would determine what that failure was and how it could \nbe replaced.\n  Accountability is, without question, going to be the greatest key \nfactor in what we do with the reauthorization and the modernization of \nthis act: accountability in the schools and allowing the parents an \nelement of measurement, working to improve those schools that are \nunderperformers, but at some point if the system does not respond, \ngiving the parents the flexibility to move that child elsewhere. \nEmpowering parents and children in the educational system will, by its \nvery character, push it toward reform.\n  It is that kind of dynamic we must demand of our public education \nsystem in this country. To strengthen, to assure that a free society \nalways has access to a public learning system has been the strength of \nour country historically and can continue to be our strength. As we \nwork in this area of education and work to reauthorize this \nlegislation, that is clearly part of the goal toward passage of this \nact.\n  I am pleased to be a part of it. I will come back to the Chamber over \nthe course of the next several weeks as we debate this issue to \nparticipate with my colleagues in explaining to the American people \nwhat we are attempting to do, what role the Federal Government can play \nwith the States and local communities.\n\n  I and others believe that the bulk of the educational responsibility \ndoes reside with the State and the local communities. The funding, the \ntax base, the local school districts, the parents--that is where the \ngreatest responsibility lies. With help, we set standards that are \nflexible, that fit States, that States can participate in, so it is not \none Federal-size-fits-all, but there are levels of measurement, and \nmost assuredly there are levels of acceptance.\n  How do you determine an underperforming school? Clearly, that is \ndetermined by the child in that school who isn't performing at the \nrequired level.\n  All of these are components of what we work to accomplish in the \nreauthorization of this most important public law for our country. I am \npleased to be part of it, involved with it, to work with my colleagues \nwho spend most of their time in this area and understand it a great \ndeal better than I. I am pleased the Senate is now focused on what \nreally is one of the most important issues we will deal with this year. \nI am proud to have a President who has made education a priority and \nwho has said and now is backing up not only in words but actions that \nin his tenure as President of our country no child will be left behind.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Ensign). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, we had an hour of postcloture debate. That \ntime has expired. I ask unanimous consent that the next hour be equally \ndivided and the time be counted under the provision of rule XXII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, there are efforts being made to come to \nsome agreement to bring to the floor. I thank the Chair. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, we opened up the debate on education. And, \nof course, they tell us that we have an agreement in principle. So at \nthis point, for all who believe that it is good for kids, let's go on \nand do it. We are hearing a lot of words with regard to policy and \nmoney, and basically money will not be a part of this debate and should \nnot be a part of this debate. There is a good reason for that.\n  We hear stories--some of them are not too good--about the condition \nof some of our schools. There is no doubt about it; we see some schools \nin very poor condition.\n  I represent the State of Montana. Some of its schools are on our \nIndian reservations, and some of our Native Americans are under crowded \nconditions. In fact, there are a couple of schools that we are going to \nreplace to\n\n[[Page S4129]]\n\nhelp them get into new facilities next year; now young people are going \nto class in the janitor's closet.\n  Then we like to compare the good old days of our education. Sometimes \nI hear it said, in fact, that it is a wonder we as a nation have \naccomplished what we have because of our educational system. I don't \nwant to talk about that. We should be talking about the successes of \nour system and the successes of yesteryear in education.\n  I went to a rural school. It was a country school with one room. I \nthink it ranged in size anywhere from 18 to 25 or 26 kids. The eighth \ngraders taught the first graders how to read. We only had one teacher.\n  All of us could tell stories like that about our life as a young \nperson in a rural setting. We could talk about that. We could also say \nhow we graduated from a smaller high school. There were only 29 \nstudents in my graduating class. We could talk about all the things we \nmissed in our education, but we don't. We like to talk about our \naccomplishments.\n  When we hear the debate in this Chamber, do we, as policymakers, have \nall of the answers to the challenges of public education and what it \nfaces today? No, I do not think we do. We might think we do. We need to \nface the fact that we now come to a subject where success will be based \non how we make choices. That is the basis for the debate.\n  The Founding Fathers of this country placed a high priority on public \neducation. They did it for a simple reason. We cannot be a free society \nand understand the Constitution unless we do it with educated minds.\n  It is remarkable when you look at the documentation of the two great \nwars fought on this continent, in our country. If you look at the \nRevolutionary War, very small snippets of history are found in our \nhistory books because most of the people who participated in the \nRevolutionary War at ground level were illiterate. They could not read \nand they could not write.\n  Then almost 100 years later--not quite, about 90--we had the Civil \nWar, of which we find documentation and letters that soldiers wrote \nhome to their folks and to their loved ones, to their mothers and to \ntheir brothers and sisters, to their families and their friends. From \nthose letters we piece together a complete history of the Civil War of \nthis country. The Founding Fathers said that public education is a \nmust. We have to have a high degree of literacy in this country if we \nare to maintain a free and responsible society.\n\n  Ever since those days, we have seen strong public support for public \neducation. In fact, there has been overall support for a strong public \nschool system throughout my life--until, I would say, maybe the last 10 \nyears.\n  What happened along the way? And I say the only way we make a good, \nsound argument is when we relate to how things are in our own \nneighborhood. There was a time when you could pass a school bond, and \nit was nothing to it. If you needed more money for buildings--brick and \nmortar--if you needed more teachers, if you needed more money to run \nthe school, a school bond was fairly easy to pass because everybody \nsupported the local schools and what they were doing.\n  I look at my own neighborhood and the support of the teachers and the \nschools. It is still there. But there is something missing because we \nhave now experienced a history over the last few years of school bonds \ngoing down, voted down, to where it takes a real effort--a real public \nrelations effort--to pass just an ordinary school bond.\n  There is a given in this debate: Anytime education comes before this \nbody, it is sure to attract a great deal of attention. I do not know of \na soul in the public sector or in this Chamber who does not have an \nopinion on education, and they will readily give it to you.\n  I have also found some other things to be true. Everybody knows how \nto run a school. That is another given. But I also have found that very \nfew look at the record and can think their way through the idea that we \nhave arrived at a time in the history of the evolution of public \neducation and realize that systemic reform is now needed.\n  I am no different than most in this body. One could say: My schooling \nwas sufficient for me; therefore, it would be good enough for our \nchildren. But we know that is not true. If we did that, then we would \nbe stuck in low gear.\n  We have to look at this. Again, we should not be talking money. We \nshould be talking accountability. If we are to have great support for \npublic education, we have to have accountability. Everybody understands \nthat.\n  Accountability means testing. It means the product that you are \nproducing has to be a good one. Testing is the only way to do that. You \ncan have a big argument about who is going to give the test and all \nthat. I still say it should be left to the States. Testing also gives \nus, and public educators, the information needed to develop the sound \nsupport that public education should have.\n  We should be supporting the programs that work, reduce the \nbureaucracy, and give increased flexibility to those who run our \nschools.\n  I leave you with a closing thought. Money is not the answer. You will \nsee many charts throughout the debate. As this chart shows, we have \nincreased spending in education drastically. Look at the blue line on \nthe chart. It goes right on up. That shows how we have increased \nspending on education. But look where the achievement line is on the \nchart. Have we improved reading and math? No. So money is not the \nanswer. Systemic reform is what is needed.\n  I am looking forward to the debate. But I think we have to use some \ncommon sense because what we need to do now is restore the \naccountability in and the support for our public education system \nbecause it is the cornerstone of this free society.\n\n  Do not test the young people for reading. Do not test them for math. \nTest them on history because, I will tell you, that is where the seed \nof freedom remains in a society to be perpetuated for future \ngenerations.\n  Mr. President, in accordance with rule XXII, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the remaining time under my control be yielded to the Senator from \nTexas, Mrs. Hutchison.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask the Senator from Texas to yield me such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time on \nthe Republican side to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twelve and a half minutes is yielded to the \nSenator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Senator from Texas.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Montana for his excellent statement \non how we should approach educational reform--especially on his \nemphasis for the need for reform, not the need to put more dollars into \neducation to follow dollars that have already failed in helping our \nchildren receive a good education.\n  I want to continue this discussion on education which was started so \neffectively by the Senator from Montana. I want to review very quickly \nwhere we are.\n  The President of the United States has made education his No. 1 \npriority. The Senate has aggressively pursued trying to address the \nissues which the President has raised. Specifically, we have tried to \nadjust, with the bill that is before us today, the role of the Federal \nGovernment in education.\n  The Federal Government has traditionally taken small parts of \neducation and focused on them--whether it is the needs of special \nstudents or, in the case of this bill, the needs of students who come \nfrom lower income families. We have, as was pointed out so effectively \nby the Senator from Montana, not been very successful in our goal.\n  Our goal was to increase the educational capacity and achievement of \nkids from low-income families. We have spent $120 billion trying to do \nthat, and in fact during the decade of the 1990s we spent the majority \nof that money. Yet the educational scores and educational proficiency \nof kids from low-income families have actually deteriorated, according \nto the reviews that have looked at it, or remained the same, at best.\n  Unfortunately, the child who comes from a low-income family today \nreads at two grade levels below the children\n\n[[Page S4130]]\n\nfrom other families in the same classroom in the fourth grade. That is \ntrue right through the school system. That is true of math also. It is \nalso true of the graduation rates where there has been a distinct \ndropoff in graduation rates of kids who come from low-income families \nand in their proficiency upon graduation. So we have not succeeded in \naddressing the needs of kids from low-income families even though we \nhave spent a huge amount of money.\n  The President has suggested: Let's stop throwing money at the \nproblem. Although he is significantly increasing the funds, he is \nsuggesting: Let's first look at reforming the issue so we actually give \nthese kids from lower income families more of a chance in America to be \nacademically competitive with their peers and, therefore, to have the \nopportunity of the American dream. The American dream today depends on \nbeing educated and being able to compete in a technological society.\n  He has suggested four basic themes: First, that we change the Federal \nprograms from being focused on bureaucracy to being focused on the \nchildren. It is called the child-centered approach: Second is that we \ngive local teachers and parents and principals more flexibility, which \nis absolutely critical as to how they educate the child, especially the \nchild from low-income family. They know what they need. We here in \nWashington don't know what they need. We can't categorize programs so \nthat we are going to help a child. It is much more important that we \ngive the principal and the teacher and the parent more capacity to \ncontrol these dollars and have some decision processes which will lead \nto better education. So he has suggested more flexibility.\n  Third, however, in exchange for the flexibility, the President has \nsaid he expects and we should expect academic achievement. That means \nbringing the child up to the level of being competitive with their \npeers; in fact, doing even better than their peers in some programs. \nAnd fourth, the President has suggested that the academic achievement \nlevel be made accountable; in other words, that we not allow the low-\nincome child to be left behind because we norm them in with every other \nchild. We basically put them in with the law of averages, and by \nputting them there, we actually ignore them and lose them in the \nprocess.\n  His proposals make a great deal of sense as to fundamentally \nreforming the system, giving the system more flexibility, making it \nmore child centered, expecting more academic accountability, and \ngetting accountability of what is happening in our system in exchange \nfor more money. These are positive steps, and that is positive reform. \nIt is reflected in the bill that underlies this legislation and \nhopefully will be reflected in an agreement we can work out and we are \nattempting to work out with the Senator from Massachusetts who I see \njust came to the Chamber. He has been such a major player in this issue \nfor so many years.\n\n  I have been picking out certain sections of this bill to talk about \nto try to give people some exposure they might not have otherwise \ngotten because the bill is so big and complex. There are a lot of \ninteresting issues in it. I am trying to focus on them in sequence just \nfor the edification of my colleagues. Let me focus on one function \ntoday, and that is what we do relative to teachers, how we try to \nassist teachers.\n  There has been a debate raging in the Congress for the last few years \nwhich was energized, in great part, by President Clinton's initiative \ncalled classroom size. Essentially his proposal was: Let's put a lot of \nmoney out there to try to help schools hire more teachers because we \nknow there is a teacher shortage. That is a given. There is a huge \nshortage in this country. His proposal was: Let's create a categorical \nprogram which says, here is a bunch of money, $1.4 billion; you can use \nthat, school systems, to hire more teachers and to try to reduce class \nsize down to a ratio of 18 to 1.\n  This was an interesting proposal, and it was in some ways \nappropriate, but unfortunately the execution of it was not effective.\n  We have in this bill tried to reform that proposal and make it more \neffective. First, you should understand that teacher ratio is not \nnecessarily the function of a better education. Much like putting more \nmoney into the problem, reducing the number of kids in a classroom does \nnot necessarily improve education. If you put fewer kids in a classroom \nwith a teacher who is incompetent, the kids still aren't going to learn \nany better. The competency of the teacher, the teacher's ability to \nactually teach and to be an exciting teacher who excites the minds and \ninterests of the children with whom they are dealing, is the key \ncategory as to a teacher's capacity to improve that classroom.\n  That requires teachers who are well informed, teachers who understand \nand are teaching subject matters in which they have been trained, \nteachers who are up to date with the latest technology, if they happen \nto be in the science area, and the latest developments in the \ndisciplines in which they are teaching, teachers who have had the \nchance to maybe go to an extra course or an extra workshop to learn to \nteach better. We in Washington cannot unilaterally decide whether a \nteacher in Epping, NH, or Cheyenne, WY, or San Francisco, CA, is going \nto be a good teacher or a bad teacher. We can't even decide whether the \nclassroom size in that community is the right ratio.\n  It should be noted that the vast majority of the States in the \ncountry already have a classroom ratio which is below 18 to 1. I \nbelieve 41 States already have met that ratio. But that really isn't \nthe issue. It really is the local school district, the principal \nspecifically, working with parents, working with the teachers in the \nclass, who can understand whether they need more teachers to teach or \nwhether they need their teachers who are teaching to be better educated \non the subject matter, or whether they have some really good teachers \nin their classrooms who are being attracted to work outside the school \nsystem and they are afraid they are going to lose them because they \ncan't pay them enough, or whether those teachers need technical \nassistance in order to communicate better to their students. We don't \nknow that. We don't know any of those factors.\n\n  Unfortunately, the original program, as has been put forward and may \nbe put forward as an amendment on the floor, was, we are going to tell \nlocal school districts: You must, in order to get these dollars, hire \nmore teachers.\n  There are a lot of school districts in the country that don't need \nmore teachers, but they do need the teachers they have to be better \neducated. They need to be able to retain the good teachers they have or \nthey need more technology for those teachers.\n  What we have done in this bill is something called the Teacher \nEmpowerment Act. We have merged the two major funding streams for \nteaching--Eisenhower grants and classroom size grants--and we have \nsaid: Here is a large pool of money. Last year it would have been $2.3 \nbillion appropriated and $3.2 billion authorized. We have merged those \ntwo streams of money, and we are saying to local school districts: You \ncan use this money to hire more teachers. If you have a classroom size \nissue, if you have a teacher need, you can use this money to hire \nteachers. But you don't have to hire teachers. You can also use this \nmoney to pay your good teachers more, or you can use this money to \nbring your teachers up to speed in the disciplines in which they are \nteaching, or you can use this money to give them the technical support \nthey need in order to teach their courses better.\n  We are giving the local school districts a great deal more \nflexibility with these funds. We are actually giving them a lot more \nfunds, but we are also giving them more flexibility. Rather than a \nspecific top-down, Washington-knows-best approach, we are essentially \nsaying: You, the local school districts, make the decisions as to what \nyou need in the teaching area. These funds are dedicated to help you as \na supplement, essentially, to your local efforts in teaching. And as a \nresult, hopefully, the teaching in that school district will better \nserve the students in that school district.\n\n  I pick out this part of the bill to talk about because I think it \nreflects the overall thrust of this bill, which I believe is so \npositive in many ways. I have reservations about certain sections of \nthe bill, but the overall thrust of the bill is in the right direction. \nThis section on teaching reflects that.\n\n[[Page S4131]]\n\n  This Teacher Empowerment Act is essentially saying: OK, local school \ndistricts, we understand you have a problem. We are going to try to \nhelp you with some dollars, but we are not going to tell you that you \nmust do it one way or the other. We are going to give you a variety of \noptions to solve the problems.\n  I view it as a cafeteria line, where the Federal Government says here \nare three or four different programs you can use. In the teacher areas, \nthey include hiring more teachers, improving the pay of the teachers, \nimproving the knowledge base of the teachers, or improving the \ntechnical support for the teachers; and, you, the local school \ndistrict, can go down that cafeteria line and pick off the plate what \nyou need to help your students in your classrooms. Rather than saying \nyou only get one choice on your cafeteria line, we are saying you get \nfour choices.\n  I think it is much more constructive. I think we will have a much \nmore aggressive and effective impact on the quality of teaching--to the \nextent the Federal Government can assist in that.\n  It is basically the theme of this whole bill--at least of the \nPresident's proposals as they have come forward on the bill--to give \nthe local communities more flexibility. Let's also hold them more \naccountable. There are, by the way, more accountability standards in \nthis bill on teachers. We require higher levels of proficiency and of \ncertification within the bill. So this is just one concept that I \nthought should be outlined as we go forward.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 29 minutes.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has 20 minutes of his time under \npostcloture remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. So is it possible for me to use that 20 minutes and then \nuse a few minutes of the minority time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator would have to get unanimous \nconsent to do so.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I ask unanimous consent to be able to use up to 9 \nminutes, which would be the total amount allocated to the Democrats.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. No. Mr. President, the Senator very kindly gave his \ntime last night to the Senator from Vermont. So I ask unanimous consent \nthat he be allowed to use the 29 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I request just 15 minutes.\n  I thank the Senator from Texas. She is always gracious and courteous, \nas well as a gifted Senator.\n  I want to just take a few moments to go over the basic elements of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education legislation that will be before \nus this afternoon and then speak on what I consider to be the \noutstanding missing element in this bill. I ask the Chair to tell me \nwhen I use 10 minutes of my time.\n  The legislation we will be considering builds upon the excellent work \ndone in a bipartisan way on the Health Education Labor and Pensions \nCommittee. The bill includes the elements of our Committee bill plus \nsome of the other agreements that have been worked out over the recent \ndays.\n  The Nation's schools face many challenges that must be addressed if \nall students are to be challenged to achieve high academic standards. \nSchool enrollments are at record high levels and continue to rise. \nLarge segments of the teaching force are preparing to retire. Diversity \nis increasing, bringing new languages and cultures into the classrooms, \nand family structures are changing. More women are participating in the \nworkforce, creating a greater demand for quality before, after, and \nduring summer school activities.\n  In addition, many of the Nation's school buildings are deteriorating \nand must be renovated and modernized so all students can learn in a \nsafe learning environment. The demand for Internet skills is at an all-\ntime high, but the supply of computers connected to the Internet is \ninadequate in school buildings located in the poorest districts.\n  The BEST bill is a good start toward improving student achievement in \nthe Nation's public schools. This bill creates tough standards that \nmust be established for States, districts, and schools which hold them \naccountable for improving student achievement. We must drive resources \nand support the most chronically failing schools to ensure they get the \nhelp they need to turn around and to succeed.\n  The bill requires that every child should be tested each year in \ngrades 3-8, not as a punishment, but so that parents and educators know \nwhere every child stands and what more needs to be done to help them. \nWe hope to strengthen provisions within the bill to ensure that these \nState tests are high quality, so that parents will know that the \nresults of these tests are meaningful for their children.\n  All parents deserve a complete picture of what is happening in their \nchild's school. A recent survey by the Center For Community Change \nfound that 36 States produce some variation of a school report card \nthat includes student achievement in other factors. Report cards will \nhighlight school challenges and provide parents with information they \ncan use to become more involved in their child's education. They will \ninclude information on student achievement by desegregated groups of \nstudents; graduation and dropout rates; teacher quality; information on \nhow schools have progressed in relation to their State standards and \nassessments; and information on schools identified for improvement.\n  Reading is the golden door to opportunity. Unfortunately, forty \npercent of fourth grade students do not achieve the basic reading \nlevel, and 70 percent of fourth graders are not proficient in reading. \nChildren who fail to acquire basic reading skills early in life are at \na disadvantage throughout their education and later careers. They are \nmore likely to drop out of school and be unemployed. The BEST Act \ntriples funding for the reading programs and strengthens the Reading \nExcellence Act to ensure that all children learn to read--and learn to \nread well early--so they have a greater chance for successful lives and \ncareers.\n\n  Over the next 10 years, we will need to recruit more than 2 million \nteachers to teach the record number of elementary and secondary \nstudents in our public schools. Nothing in education is more important \nthan ensuring a highly qualified teacher for every classroom. Research \nshows that what teachers know and can do is the most important \ninfluence on what students learn. Increased knowledge of academic \ncontent by teachers and effective teaching skills are associated with \nincreases in student achievements.\n  The BEST bill includes strong definitions of professional \ndevelopment, mentoring, and highly qualified teacher and contains \nstrong accountability and application requirements. In particular, the \nbill contains many of the elements that research indicates constitute \neffective mentoring and professional development--sustained, intensive \nactivities that focus on deepening teachers' knowledge of content, \ncollaborative working environments, and training that is aligned with \nstandards and embedded in the daily work of the school.\n  Under this bill, limited-English-proficient students will get \nsubstantially more support to help them learn English and achieve high \nacademic standards. We are experiencing a tremendous growth in the \nnumber of limited-English-proficient and immigrant students in our \nNation's classrooms--from 3.4 million students in the 1997-98 school \nyear to an estimated 4.1 million of our school children today.\n  Dramatic shifts are taking place in the growth of our immigrant \npopulation in the United States, and immigrant students are emerging in \nareas where their presence had previously been invisible. The most \nrecent census data shows that, between 1990 and 1998, our States in the \nSouth have experienced a growth in the Hispanic population by 93 \npercent.\n  The BEST Act responds to this challenge by providing additional \nopportunities for success. The BEST Act increases the federal \ncommitment to provide educational assistance to our limited English \nproficient students through the Bilingual Education Act.\n\n[[Page S4132]]\n\nWhen the program is appropriated at $700 million, it will become a \nstate formula program based on 67 percent LEP population, and 33 \npercent new immigrant population. Our bill responds to States in which \nthe limited English proficient population has grown at a tremendous \nrate, and where there is little or no infrastructure in place to \nprovide for the educational needs of these students.\n  Research shows that children who are home alone after school hours \nreport higher use of alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana. Nearly 45 \nmillion children ages 14 years and younger are injured in their homes \nevery year and most unintentional, injury-related deaths occur when \nchildren are out of school and unsupervised. The bill expands the \nsuccessful 21st Century Community Learning Centers, increasing the \nauthorization from $846 million to $1.5 billion in fiscal year 2002. It \nalso changes the program to a state formula program, ensuring students \nin every state will have expanded after-school opportunities. After-\nschool opportunities are necessary to keep children safe before, after, \nand during summer school to keep children safe, help parents work, and \nexpand children's learning opportunities. Yet demand for these programs \ncontinues outpace supply. According to a report from the U.S. Census \nBureau last year, almost 7 million children aged 5 to 14 are left \nunsupervised on a regular basis during the after school hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 19 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair.\n  Prior to the passage of the Class Size Reduction program in 1998, \nunder the leadership of Senator Murray, more than 85 percent of the \nNation's students were in classes with more than 18 students, and 33 \npercent were in classes of 25 or more students. Because of the Class \nSize Reduction Act, 1.7 million children are benefitting from smaller \nclasses this year: 29,000 were hired with fiscal year 1999 funds; 1,247 \nare teaching in the first grade, reducing class sizes from 23 to 17; \n6,670 are teaching in the second grade, reducing class size from 23 to \n18; 6,960 are teaching in the third grade, reducing class size from 24 \nto 18; 2,900 are in grades 4-12; 290 special education teachers have \nbeen hired. And, on average, 7 percent of the funds are being used for \nprofessional development for these new teachers. We should continue the \nClass Size Reduction Act.\n  When we send childen to crumbling schools, we send them the message \nthat they don't matter. Fourteen million children attend schools in \nneed of at least one major repair, such as fixed heating or plumbing \nsystems. Half of all schools have at least one environmental hazard, \nlike inadequate ventilation. One-third of all schools are more than 50 \nyears old. Urban, rural, and suburban communities are struggling with \nnational school modernization costs of more than $127 billion. The BEST \nbill as reported by the committee is silent on school construction \nneeds.\n  We should really commit to leaving no child behind by fully funding \ntitle I. It takes resources, as well as testing and accountability, to \ndo school reform right.\n  We should maintain our commitment to reduce class sizes for 2 million \nchildren instead of backing away from it. Senator Murray will address \nthat issue.\n  We should provide subject matter training for every teacher in high \npoverty schools.\n  New teachers should have mentors to pass on wisdom and keep them in \nthe profession.\n  We should fix 5,000 crumbling schools over the next 10 years.\n  And we should ensure every child has a safe and supportive place to \ngo after-school.\n  Without these types of investments, our efforts at school reform will \nfall of their own weight.\n  Mr. President, in order to reach the elements of this legislation, we \nhave to provide the resources.\n  The fact is only one-third of the neediest children are going to \nbenefit from what we have developed if we do not increase the funding. \nWe are going to leave behind two-thirds of the children who qualify for \nassistance.\n  The fact remains, we have approximately 12 million poor children in \nAmerica. We made a decision in the early 1960s to give special \nassistance to those children. It is still primarily a State and local \nresponsibility.\n  When I listen to my colleagues on the other side talk about the \nfailure of these programs, it is really an indictment of the failure of \nStates and local communities to provide the kind of assistance which is \nnecessary to make a difference to these children. We know what it takes \nto educate children. That is not a great mystery. We have many schools \nthat annually produce very talented and creative students.\n  I will tell you, Mr. President, what I fear about this legislation.\n  Looking at the funding levels for this legislation, we see we are \ncurrently reaching one-third of these children. We state in this \nlegislation that all of these children, the 12 million who are \nbasically poor and somewhat smaller numbers who are actually eligible \nwho are very poor. None of these children should be left behind.\n  Under the President's budget, in fiscal year 2001, 3.5 million \nchildren are served under title I funding; fiscal year 2002, 3.7 \nmillion; fiscal year 2003, 3.9 million; fiscal year 2004, 4.1 million, \nand fiscal year 2005, 5.2 million children.\n  The Democrats start off with the same base at 3.5 million, up to 5.2 \nmillion, 6.9 million, 8.6 million, and by fiscal year 2005, no child is \nleft behind. That is the basic and fundamental gap. This legislation \noffers these opportunities to only a small percent of the eligible \nchildren, and that is wrong.\n  We have fashioned a good bill that can benefit all children. So it is \na reasonable question to ask: Why aren't we taking care of all the \nchildren? Why are we taking care of just one-third? Do we have the \nresources? Yes. Do we have the will? Evidently not. Do we have other \npriorities? Apparently so. A small percentage of the extraordinary tax \ncut of $1.3 trillion, about $5.3 billion a year over 4-years, would \nallow every one of these children to get the assistance they need to \nachieve success.\n  There is a high demand for afterschool programs. Last year, there \nwere more than 2,250 applications for afterschool programs, and only \n310 were funded.\n  What happens in these afterschool programs if we do not have enough \nresources? Why are afterschool programs so important? First, we have 7 \nmillion children between ages 9 and 13, who are left unsupervised after \nschool hours. Afterschool opportunities are necessary to keep children \nsafe, help parents work, and expand children's learning opportunities.\n  Do parents want this service? Yes. Do children need it? Yes. Are they \neffective? Yes. Do we have the money? No.\n  We are talking about the future of the country. We are talking about \n80 percent of the children going to inner-city schools in the eighth \ngrade are without an adequate math teacher who can teach them algebra. \nWe know all educators will effectively agree if children do not learn \nalgebra, they have a difficult time advancing on to college. Unless \nsomeone is going to help provide the well-trained teachers who can \nteach student necessary math skills, we are effectively saying to \nmillions of children in the country, that opportunity is closed to \nthem.\n  This issue effects the future of our Nation. We are talking about a \nworld economy, a highly educated society; we are talking about updating \nskills; we are talking about continuing training programs for people in \njobs so they can compete. Are we meeting that challenge at the local \nlevel? We are not. That is the extraordinary tragedy in this program.\n  This legislation is the basis of something that can be enormously \nimportant and, I believe, can make a real difference in the education \nof some of the neediest children in our country. However, we are going \nto fail to meet that test unless we have the resources. Unless we are \ngoing to provide those resources, we are going to fail our children.\n  We know that many poorer schools are more challenged today. We have \nadded approximately 5 million specially challenged children, who were \nnot in the schools 10 years ago. They are taking the tests.\n  We have seen the expansion of the number of homeless children in our\n\n[[Page S4133]]\n\nschools, some 600,000 homeless children. We have approximately 500,000 \nseasonal workers' children, a third attending school, and then moving \non. We have migrant children in our school. We have challenges with \ndifferent languages, with more than 4 million school age children who \nare either limited English Proficient or immigrants. We have seen an \nincrease in separations and divorces, which has placed pressure on \nchildren. We have also seen the explosion of violence in our society--\nand in our schools. Many of the schools and teachers bear the brunt for \ndealing with those special needs. All of these factors are impacting \nchildren as they go to school.\n  We must not fail to do what works. That means a well-trained teacher \nin every classroom. It is amazing so many teachers in the inner-city \nschools working as long and as hard under such circumstances. They are \nextraordinary individuals making a difference in people's lives under \nextraordinary conditions. We need to give them help, assistance, and \nconfidence. We need to make sure they will have the equipment they need \nto get a first-class education.\n  Why do we say education counts and then have children go to a \ncrumbling school? It makes no sense. We can talk the talk but unless we \nare prepared to walk the walk, we fail the children.\n  We need accountability to make sure the children are actually \nlearning. We want to make sure those schools will be safe. We want \nsmaller class sizes in the early grades, so a teacher can take a little \ntime with a child that has a particular need during the course of the \nday, rather than looking at the child as a number.\n  On this side of the aisle, we are virtually united in insisting we \nare going to get the resources to be able to do that.\n  We know now there are 10,000 failing schools. We also know that it \ncosts about $180,000 to turn a school around. There are a series of 57 \ndifferent options that have been tried and tested that are suitable for \ndifferent schools. It would take $1.8 billion out of a trillion dollar \nbudget, to try and turn schools around.\n  We are missing an extraordinary opportunity and responsibility in \ndoing something about these children's education. If this is going to \nbe a first priority for the administration, it ought to draw on first \npriority dollars and resources and invest in the children who need it. \nWe ought to provide the resources necessary to leave no child behind, \nto reach every child before we even consider providing the tax breaks \nin the President's budget.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, with the \nagreement of the minority, that Senator Frist be given 10 minutes of \nthe next 30 minutes of divided time, that then Senator Gordon Smith be \ngiven up to 5 minutes, following which the minority would have their 15 \nminutes, following which Senator Bunning from Kentucky would have 20 \nminutes, following which the minority would have 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Mr. President, I rise to speak very briefly--for 10 \nminutes--on the Better Education for Students and Teachers Act, a bill \nthat was passed out of the Health, Education, and Pensions Committee, a \nbill that speaks very well to the principles, to the ideals, to the \npractical application of what President George W. Bush has put forth as \nhis principles for education reform.\n  Let me say at the outset, as most people know, that there is a lot of \ndiscussion today about funding. We have a bill with significant reforms \nthat I hope will very soon be brought to the floor. That reform effort, \nwhich is terribly important, as we all know, and as both sides of the \naisle agree, is being linked in concept, but also in process, to \nincreased funding, as we just heard from my colleague from \nMassachusetts. I want to quickly provide some perspective about the \nfunding side. While we have been talking a lot about the reform side, \nand will continue to talk about it, the funding side has been pushed \naside. People know negotiations are underway. But I want to put it in \nperspective.\n  The primary argument for increased funds, according to the other side \nof the aisle, is that the modernization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act requires increased funding to pay for those reforms. I \nwant to make it very clear, again, to my colleagues and to people who \nmay be watching this debate across the country, that when the Democrats \nwere in charge of this body, that was not the principle that was \napplied. There was no dramatic increase in funding for reforms.\n  One example: In 1988 a Democrat Congress reauthorized the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act, the same law enacted in 1965 that has been \nreauthorized seven times, and in the subsequent appropriation year--\n1989--a 5.1-percent increase in title I was enacted to cover those 1988 \nreforms.\n  Five years later, in 1994, a Democrat Congress reauthorized ESEA, \nagain hailing at the time that it was the most significant reform \npackage since the bill was initially put into effect in 1965. I quote a \nSenator from the other side of the aisle who said:\n\n       It is the most important reauthorization of ESEA since the \n     landmark Act was passed in 1965.\n\n  That particular Senator went on to hail the bill's accountability and \nhigh academic standards. I want to point out that for the major \ncomprehensive reform effort, at that time, to the title I 1994 \nreauthorization, the Democratically-controlled Congress appropriated a \nmere 5.7-percent increase in the following year, fiscal year 1995.\n  So, when in control, the other side of the aisle has offered \nincreases associated with reforms of somewhere between 5 and 6 percent \na year. Yet in our negotiations several weeks ago they asked, not for \nwhat they had put forward, and appropriated, throughout their history \nof being in charge, which is an increase of 5 to 6 percent, but instead \ncame to the table recommending, suggesting, insisting, on a 75-percent \nincrease, and not in 5 years or 10 years, but in just 1 year.\n\n  At this moment negotiations are underway. I am not in the middle of \nthose negotiations, but the figures being negotiated by the other side \nof the aisle are a 50-percent increase, a 49-percent increase. That \nends up being about $5.2, $5.3 billion.\n  I point out to my colleagues that never, ever in the program's entire \nhistory has it grown by even $1 billion. So these proposals are \nsignificant increases. But I hope that when agreement is reached in the \nnext several days, whatever figure we end up with, that the American \npeople will understand that it is a figure dramatically larger than any \never suggested by the other side of the aisle.\n  President George W. Bush has demonstrated a strong and remarkable \nleadership position in reforming and modernizing education. He has \nfocused in particular--and this is reflected in the agreements and in \nthe policy that is being formulated in a bipartisan way--on serving the \nmost needy students, so that, indeed, no child will be left behind.\n  We have all talked a lot about the achievement gap which has not \nnarrowed but in fact gotten wider over time, the gap between the most \nneedy students and others, between the underserved and others. The \ncommitment of the President of the United States, and the bipartisan \ncommitment in the underlying policy, is something, again, that we need \nto keep first and foremost in our mind--putting the emphasis on \nchildren, on individuals, and not on bureaucracies, on programs, or, I \nwould add, indeed, not just throwing money at a system uncoupled with \nreform.\n  The President of the United States has expressed a willingness to \nsupport the largest increase in education funding, focusing on title I, \never proposed in the 35-year history of the program. I mention that \nbecause we tend to lose perspective. The bottom line is this President \nhas proposed, and we support, the largest increase ever in the 35-year \nhistory of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.\n  We have a great opportunity as we go forward. We look at the failure \nof performance of ESEA, especially as we focus on the neediest \nstudents, and the opportunity to reform and modernize with, yes, an \nincrease in investment, but also with reform that captures the\n\n[[Page S4134]]\n\nvery best of what the American spirit is all about, and that is the \ncreativity, the innovation, and the freedom to address issues and \nreward success rather than failure, as we have done in the past.\n  The underlying bill, which I am very hopeful will be released by the \nother side and brought to the floor so we can talk about it, stresses \nissues such as accountability.\n  Let me also point out that although people say we do not know what is \nin the underlying bill, that bill is before us, on all of our desks. \nYes, there are modifications and there are certain agreements that are \nbeing reached that will be added to that bill. But they can look at \nthat bill. I hope that bill will be brought to the floor. Basically, it \ndoes four things. No. 1, it increases accountability for student \nperformance; No. 2, it rewards success; No. 3, it increases flexibility \nand freedom; and, No. 4, it puts emphasis on parents.\n  No. 1, it increases accountability for student performance. Over the \nlast 24 hours in negotiations, we have reached general agreement on how \nto build in that accountability in a strict way. Yes, we give more \nfreedom to innovate, but we link that to demonstrable results, \nmeasurable results. It is called average yearly progress. The technical \naspects that have been worked out, and that language will be available \nshortly today.\n\n  No. 2, the BEST bill. It is called the B-E-S-T bill, Better Education \nfor Students and Teachers Act. Again, the emphasis is on teachers and \nstudents. It focuses on what works. As I pointed out in my previous \nremarks on the floor, what is important is that we have an \nunderstanding, a measurement, of what works based on good science, on \ngood research.\n  No. 3, the BEST bill will also reduce bureaucracy. It will get rid of \nred tape, and it will increase flexibility. That really comes back to \nthe importance of having local control and innovation, of rewarding \nwhat works and recognizing what does not work. Additional flexibility \nwill be given to the States, to the districts, and to the schools, \nstripping away the unnecessary and needless red tape that results in \nteachers not being able to teach; that takes time away from teaching; \nthat prevents principals from spending time administering their \nschools.\n  No. 4, the underlying bill focuses on parents and on the individual \nstudent. It involves an element of choice. No longer will a child be \nlocked into a school that fails today, that will fail next year, and \nthe year after that. in spite of reform, in spite of additional \nresources. That child, for the first time in the history of this \ncountry, will be given an opportunity to choose another public school.\n  Those principles are accountability, rewarding success, reducing \nbureaucracy, increasing flexibility, and empowering parents.\n  I am very excited about this opportunity to move forward. I am very \nhopeful that we can, even though the other side objects to its being \nbrought to the floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Collins). The Senator from Kentucky is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be allowed \nto take my 20 minutes now and concede to the opponents or the \nopposition 20 minutes following my 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I rise today to talk for a few minutes in support of \nS. 1, the President's education reform bill.\n  We all agree that every child should receive a top-notch education, \nand that no child should be left behind. There isn't one Senator who \ndisagrees with that.\n  But we can disagree on the best ways to meet this goal, and that's \nwhat much of the debate is going to be about.\n  I believe that the bill before us today deserves our support for a \nnumber of reasons. And it ensures that no child left behind is more \nthan a campaign slogan--it's a promise to our families and their \nchildren.\n  First, the legislation makes badly needed changes to the Department \nof Education--changes that will help us do a better job at educating \nour kids.\n  In the past we've relied too much on creating new programs and the \nfailed notion that spending more and more money, and that creating more \nand more government, are answers to the question of how to best educate \nour kids.\n  If that were true, Federal welfare spending would have ended poverty \nyears ago.\n  And Federal education spending would have ensured that every child \ncould read and write. That hasn't happened because money isn't the \nanswer.\n  Many of my friends on the other side of the aisle talk about spending \nmore money as if it were a magic pill that will fix all of our \nproblems.\n  This just isn't true. Look at the schools in the District of \nColumbia. Per student spending there is among the highest in the land, \nand the school system has been in terrible shape for years.\n  More money and more programs aren't the answer. It might sound good. \nIt might make some of us feel better. But it's a false promise that \ncheats our kids.\n  And I would like to remind my friends on the other side who are now \nquestioning our commitment to kids that the last time Congress worked \non reauthorizing the ESEA back in 1994 that they didn't say one word \nabout linking the bill to appropriations--not one word.\n  So all of their complaining now rings a little bit hollow.\n  You can't prove your commitment to children, your commitment to \neducation just by tossing around dollar figures. Talk is always cheap. \nThere is a difference between just spending more money and spending it \nwisely. This bill recognizes that difference.\n  For instance, today there are 58 programs funded through the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act alone, and we are going to spend \napproximately $18 billion on these programs this year alone.\n  The bill before us simply doesn't just tack more programs onto \ncurrent law and increase spending as part of a hollow promise to \nimprove education.\n  That would be a cheap out, an easy way to make us all feel better. \nInstead, this legislation makes more fundamental and significant \nchanges. It folds many of these programs into more constructive \napproaches, and repeals others that don't work.\n  That does not happen often in Washington--getting rid of a program \nthat doesn't work.\n  But this bill does it. And I think it's going to make a difference \nfor the kids. And by folding programs and some spending into block \ngrants, we put more power in the hands of the local officials and \nteachers who are on the front lines and have the most experience with \nwhat methods really work.\n  Another good aspect in this bill is that it requires results and \ninstead of just tossing funding at a problem, it injects serious \naccountability into education.\n  By testing students annually from grades three to eight, we make sure \nthey are actually learning and not simply getting passed along to \nbecome someone else's problem.\n  And it holds teachers and school boards accountable for these \nresults. If scores don't improve, the kids can leave those failing \nschools and funding will follow them to institutions that work and \nteach.\n  Schools that fail to educate their students will face the \nconsequences. Parents will be notified and students will be allowed to \ntransfer to other public schools.\n  If the problems continue, the school could be forced to implement a \nnew curriculum, the school's staff could be replaced, or the school \ncould be reopened as a charter school.\n  This legislation contains other promising initiatives, including the \nReading First Program that makes sure all children read by the end of \nthird grade.\n  Instead of social promotion, we are actually going to make sure that \nkids master the most fundamental skill of all--reading. And there is an \nEarly Reading First program that focuses on reading for children ages 3 \nto 5.\n  I realize that this sort of testing and accountability is a change \nfrom the past for many and makes a lot of folks nervous.\n  However, there are times when change is necessary. And this is one of \nthose times. We should not be happy\n\n[[Page S4135]]\n\nwith the status quo when it comes to educating our children, and should \nalways be looking for better ways to educate.\n  If something doesn't work, you change it. Fear of improvement or a \nfresh approach is no reason to continue to shortchange our kids. By \nrequiring the States to test children, this bill maintains another \ncrucial aspect of our educational system--local control.\n  Some of my colleagues might remember last year when President Clinton \ntook a tour around the country to promote one of his education \nproposals. Some of the Washington bureaucrats put together a map of his \ntour that included a stop in Owensboro, KY.\n  Of course the map and the PR material they put out about the \nPresident's trip to Owensboro showed it being in the middle of \nTennessee, and actually lopped off the western part of Kentucky and \ngave it to Illinois.\n  That is just a funny little mistake, but it demonstrates my point \nthat Washington does not know best.\n  I definitely trust folks in western Kentucky--who know where \nOwensboro really is--to educate our Kentucky kids than officials who \nwork here at the Department of Education.\n  I already talked a little but about block grants and about how \nthey'll work. I'm also glad that the legislation strengthens the \nsuccessful ED-Flex Program and I hope it eventually includes the \nimportant straight A's Program.\n  Those are crucial parts of this bill that guarantee local control and \nthe best possible results. Under the President's plan, States test kids \nin grades 3-8 in reading and math, States are responsible for creating \nthe tests as well as setting performance goals and creating a plan for \nensuring that all of their students are proficient on their statewide \ntests within 10 years. Additionally, States will also administer a \nnational test, called the National Assessment of Educational Progress \nin grades 4 and 8, to make sure all students across the country are not \nbeing cheated out of a good, positive education.\n  By protecting the role of State boards of education, we help ensure \nthat local communities can play their traditional role in instructing \nour children. And just to make sure that the work gets done, the \nFederal Government will foot the bill for these testing procedures by \npaying for half of the cost of the statewide tests, and the full cost \nof the national assessment test.\n  Local education agencies will be held to the same standards of \nimproving student achievement, and will face similar consequences if \nthey fail. Just as students have to pay a penalty if they fail, so \nshould teachers and schools if they fail in their responsibilities. \nEducation is a serious business. There should be real consequences for \nfailing our kids. We trust schools and educators with our kids' \nfutures, and there is no reason why they shouldn't be called to task \nfor the results. Personally, I think that one of the most effective \nparts in this bill is the provision that gives children the power to \nchange schools if their school fails them. To sum it up, in this \nlegislation the money follows the kids. If a child escapes a failing \nschool, the money used to help educate them follows them to an \ninstitution that works.\n  I support completely the choice of schools for children. I think it \nis the best way to give schools an incentive to do a good job. \nCompetition is the way to ensure the best results when it comes to \nmarkets and practically every other part of our society. But for some \nreason, when it comes to education and our kids the opponents of choice \nsay no. I don't know why the opponents of choice think that it won't \nwork for kids and schools. I believe that this cheats our neediest \nstudents and takes power away from them. I look forward to this part of \nthe debate. But even if we don't succeed in giving complete freedom of \nchoice to students, the fact that this bill gives students in public \ninstitutions the power to change their schools is a dramatic \nimprovement over the status quo.\n  In conclusion, I urge support for the bill. The legislation before us \npresents an important choice to us: Do we continue with the status quo, \nor do we take an important step in improving education for children, \nand ensuring a bright future for them? Do we listen to those who sing \nthe tired old songs about more money and more money, or do we opt for \nreal reform and accountability? I, for one, will vote to improve \neducation and for a fresh start for our kids. I urge support for this \nlegislation before us today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have come to this Chamber in \nthe past to express my frustration when things have not seemed to be \nproceeding and we seemed to have been stuck in gridlock. Today is a \nvery real exception to that feeling. I rejoice that we have a budget \nagreement, and that we are working on education reform that puts \nserious resources behind serious reform in our educational system.\n  I am here as well to thank the leaders of the conference committee on \nthe Budget, specifically Senator Domenici and Senator Lott on our side, \nand others in the House and Senate who have, I am told, preserved the \none thing I wanted most in this budget, which was a $28 billion \nauthorization for 3 years to expand health care to the uninsured.\n  I came to this issue not this year, but from the first year I entered \npublic life as an Oregon State senator and won membership on our health \ncare committee. I was not around when we created the Oregon Health \nPlan, but I did play a role in obtaining funding for it. The Oregon's \nMedicaid program, known as the Oregon Health Plan, has dramatically \nreduced the number of the working uninsured in the State of Oregon.\n  We have a tradition in our State of trying to take care of those who \ncannot take care of themselves. I express gratitude to my colleagues on \nthe Democrat and Republican side for this budget agreement that will \nhelp our State and others do just that.\n  I believe we need tax reduction and tax reform. I think we are going \nto do something very significant in our generation with what we will \nlikely adopt very soon in this body and the other, and that President \nBush will sign. It will put real dollars into the pockets of working \nAmericans.\n  But I must say how grateful I am that this budget item has been \npreserved--$28 billion for the uninsured--because while we cut taxes \nfor Americans, it is also appropriate that we care for those who cannot \ncare for themselves.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent an editorial from the \nWashington Post of this morning entitled ``Timeout for the Uninsured'' \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 2, 2001]\n\n                       Timeout for the Uninsured\n\n       House conferees have been fighting with their Senate \n     counterparts to reduce the spending levels in the \n     congressional budget resolution. No doubt some cuts can be \n     made in the Senate totals without the country's suffering \n     harm. But at least one relatively minor Senate proposal \n     deserves to remain.\n       Oregon Sens. Gordon Smith and Ron Wyden won inclusion in \n     the budget of an additional $28 billion over three years to \n     reduce the number of Americans without health insurance. The \n     money would mainly be spent on lower-income people. Exactly \n     how would be up to the authorizing committees, but an add-on \n     of some kind to Medicaid and/or the children's health \n     insurance program that Congress enacted several years ago \n     seems most likely. The modest expansion would hardly solve \n     the un-insurance problem, but it would push in the right \n     direction.\n       About a seventh of the population remains uninsured. Most \n     are poor or near poor. They lack insurance mainly because \n     they can't afford it. The administration has proposed a tax \n     credit to help those whose employers don't offer insurance. \n     But the credit would cover only part of the cost of an \n     average policy, and most uninsured families still would find \n     such a policy beyond their means. Some people think the \n     industry might respond by offering only partial policies, but \n     it's not clear that would be a good result, either.\n\n[[Page S4136]]\n\n       The administration proposal has some interesting features \n     and would do limited good, but limited is the operative word. \n     The spending programs for the lower-income uninsured have \n     shown themselves to be efficient ways of increasing coverage. \n     Whatever the fate of the tax credit, they should be expanded. \n     Much attention has lately been paid to the health care \n     problems of the already insured. The elderly lack a drug \n     benefit; people enrolled in managed care complain that care \n     is sometimes sacrificed to cost. But at least these people \n     have insurance. More than 40 million don't. The budget \n     argument this year has been mainly about how large a tax cut \n     to give the better-off. What about a timeout to pay a little \n     heed to those who can't afford to get sick?\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. The Washington Post editorial states:\n\n       House conferees have been fighting with their Senate \n     counterparts to reduce the spending levels in the \n     congressional budget resolution. No doubt some cuts can be \n     made in the Senate totals without the country's suffering \n     harm. But at least one relatively minor Senate proposal \n     deserves to remain.\n\n  They are referring to this $28 billion that we can use to reduce the \nranks of the uninsured. Currently that is about 17 percent of our \nfellow citizens, over 43 million Americans.\n  Senator Wyden and I, when we came up with this idea, hoped we could \ncut this number in half. It is now up to the Finance Committee to \nachieve that. They have the money now authorized to accomplish that.\n  Good programs do exist for providing health care to the uninsured. \nMedicaid, as we all know, is working. It needs more resources. There is \nalso the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, which has also \nreduced the number of uninsured children in this country.\n  One of the things I was most grateful to have been a part of when I \nfirst came to the Senate was a compromise between Senator Hatch and \nSenator Kennedy for the CHIP program, which became the pivot point for \nthe balanced budget agreement. Oregon's Children's Health Insurance \nAssistance Program has enrolled 13,000 children in our State. But there \nare more than 61,000 eligible children without coverage because of the \nlimited amount of money budgeted for this purpose. Senator Wyden and I \nhope the Finance Committee will expand this program to include their \nparents.\n  What we are doing is providing access to health care for low-income \nAmericans. This is the No. 1 bipartisan agenda item we have. We have \nstarted on that plan and will build on its past successes.\n  I believe expanding coverage can be done in a way that will promote \nState flexibility, avoid new bureaucracies, and protect the employer-\nbased coverage system, while providing a meaningful, affordable benefit \nto millions of Americans.\n  Our first component that we will propose to the Finance Committee \nwill be to give businesses incentives to make quality health insurance \nmore affordable for their low-income workers. Our plan will give \nbusinesses a tax credit if they chip in more to offer quality health \ncare to their low-income employees. Many low-wage employees are working \nhard but are having trouble paying the full amount for health \ninsurance.\n  Second, our plan will extend Medicaid coverage to more low-income \nAmericans. Many low-income adults who cannot afford or are not offered \nhealth insurance will be eligible for Medicaid coverage. As I \nindicated, we want to expand the CHIP program.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bunning). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 \nmore minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon. We believe that expanding health insurance to \nmillions of hard working low-income Americans will relieve the \nuncertainty and fear many people face, knowing that they are one \nillness away from losing their life savings or their home. It is the \nright thing to do. It is the right time to do it.\n  As the editorial in the Washington Post says:\n\n       What about a timeout to pay a little heed to those who \n     can't afford to get sick?\n\n  I thank my colleagues on the budget conference committee for \npreserving this critical line item for the uninsured. I urge all my \ncolleagues to vote for it when it comes out of this conference and then \nlater when it is crafted into final form by the Finance Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Roberts). The distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/02/senate-section/article/S4136-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4136-S4138]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, yesterday the President of the United \nStates gave a very broad outline of a new national security strategy \nthat moves away from the reliance on deterrence and arms control \ntowards missile defenses and unilateral arms reductions.\n  Frankly, the President's brief remarks raise more questions than they \nanswer. I wanted to take a few minutes to address in this Chamber some \nof the key issues he touched on yesterday.\n  First, the President stressed that we must move away from our \nreliance on deterrence to keep our citizens and our allies safe from \naggression or from nuclear blackmail. While I agree that in principle \nwe want to find alternative methods of being able to protect ourselves \nfrom the potential of nuclear blackmail or terrorism, the hard reality \nis that there will always be a measure of deterrence in any approach we \nfind with respect to the prevention of attack or maintaining the \nsecurity of the United States of America.\n  If there is a real potential of a rogue nation--and I underscore \n``if'' there is a real potential of a rogue nation--firing a few \nmissiles at any city in the United States, responsible leadership \nrequires the most thoughtful steps possible to prevent losses as a \nconsequence thereof.\n  The same is true of accidental launch. If at some point in time, God \nforbid, there were to be an accidental launch of a nuclear missile, the \nnotion that any country in the world, if technology were available, \nshould be subject to that possibility would be unacceptable. All of us \nin the civilized world need to take steps to try to protect ourselves \nagainst the potential of that ever happening.\n  Let me make it clear. The rogue missile rationale that has been \noffered on many occasions really merits much greater analysis than many \npeople have given it. For a state to develop a missile capacity, it \nwould require some measure of testing, some measure of actual \ndeployment, such as we have seen in North Korea with its Taepo Dong 2. \nIt would also require a launch site and capacity, all of which are \ndetectable by the United States, all of which are traceable over a \nperiod of time.\n  If, indeed, a state is to such a degree a rogue state that we think \nits leadership might be in a position of firing one or two rogue \nmissiles at the United States, we ought to also think beyond that as to \nwhat they would be inviting as a response. Clearly, one or two missiles \nclearly traceable, obviously coming from a particular rogue state, \nwould invite their annihilation.\n  So when we measure threats, we don't just measure capacity to be able \nto do something. We measure the intent to do something. We measure the \nconsequences of somebody doing something. Indeed, Saddam Hussein, who \npossessed weapons of mass destruction, saw fit not to use those weapons \nof mass destruction when we went to war against him, even when he was \nlosing the war. The reason that he didn't was because, Secretary Baker \nmade it patently clear what would happen to them if they did.\n  Even the most unreasonable, most demonized of leaders still \ncalculates risk and still calculates the repercussions of his actions.\n  Indeed, our military, in making a judgment about the different tiers \nof threat we face, places the threat of a rogue missile attack at the \nvery bottom of threats the United States might face.\n  Here we are in a debate about education and we are being told we are \nnot sure we have enough money for education; we are not sure we have \nenough money for alternative and renewable fuels; we are not sure we \nhave enough money for a prescription drug program for seniors; we are \nnot sure we have\n\n[[Page S4137]]\n\nenough money to fix our schools and provide the next generation with \nthe kinds of education we want--we need to balance what we get for our \nexpenditures in terms of national security against other initiatives \nthat also have an impact on the national security of our country.\n\n  I say, with respect, that the President's efforts with respect to the \nrogue missile threat seem to be willing to do things to the ABM treaty, \nto our relationships with Russia and China that go well beyond what we \ncould possibly gain in terms of our security.\n  Let me come back to missile defense, which is really only a response \nof last resort when diplomacy and deterrence have failed. I support \nresearch and development of a limited missile defense system that, \nindeed, might have the ability to knock down one or two incoming \nmissiles. I think it would be, in fact, a step forward for the United \nStates to be able to at least know that we have that capacity. I \nsuggest, very respectfully, that most scientists and most strategists \nwho are well respected in this country recognize the extraordinary \ndifficulties developing a system that might do much more than take out \na selected number of missiles, and that if this were something more \nthan a limited system, if it were a system designed to provide some \nkind of shield or some kind of larger protection against the potential \nof a larger attack, and was in fact deployed in that way, we would \nsimply be inviting the kind of counterresponse we saw throughout the \ncold war, when we unilaterally initiated some advance in technology \nwhich the Soviet Union interpreted in a way that invited them to \nrespond.\n  Most people who make judgments about the potential of knocking down \nmissiles, given the difficulties of decoys, of the extraordinary \ntechnological difficulty of discerning the difference between \nartificial and real targets, the capacity of 1 warhead to potentially \ncarry 100 different bomblets, which you have to discern the difference \nbetween in a matter of seconds--to suggest you can somehow have a \nsystem that is going to be 100- percent effective would be to stretch \nthe imagination to where I think no strategist would want to go. I \ndon't think anybody worth their salt in making judgments about \npotential conflict would come to a conclusion that one is 100-percent \nfailsafe protected.\n  So if you are not 100-percent failsafe protected, you are still \ndependent, ultimately, on deterrence. We can't get rid of that \nequation. If you know you are going to suffer some damage, the judgment \nthen becomes, well, how much damage? If we suffer that amount of \ndamage, what is it going to take in return to be able to guarantee that \nthey will, too? So, in effect, you are pushed back into a corner where \nyou are still dependent on the mutual assured destruction equation--the \nvery equation we have lived with since the beginning of the Cold War in \n1945.\n  If you have a system that is 100-percent effective, you have also \ndramatically changed the equation of the balance of power because if \nyou are sitting there and your adversary says, well, they have a system \nthat is 100-percent effective against an intercontinental ballistic \nmissile, so we had better deliver systems that completely avoid the \nintercontinental ballistic missile--if, indeed, they are an adversary--\nif China is sitting there and their strategists are saying the United \nStates now has the ability to shoot down all of our missiles--they have \na 100-percent effective defense--that means they have the first strike \ncapacity because the minute you have developed a 100-percent defense, \nyou have translated defense into offense because if you are 100-percent \nprotected, you can fire with impunity first, knowing nothing hits you \nin return.\n\n  So what you have done is really turned on its ear the very concept of \nfear by both sides that the consequences of a conflict are so great \nthat you avoid the conflict. In point of fact, one of the reasons the \nUnited States restrained itself from considering even greater \nescalation in Vietnam, and in other parts of the world in conflicts, \nwas knowing that the Soviet Union and China have this extraordinary \ncapacity to escalate to the ultimate confrontation. It was always the \nfear of the ultimate confrontation that drove us to restrain ourselves \nand ultimately to put in place the ABM Treaty.\n  The ABM Treaty represents the conclusion of Republican and Democrat \nadministrations alike that we need to find a way out of the continuing \nescalation of the arms race. That is why we put it in place. It gave us \na guarantee that we knew we could begin to reduce weapons because \nneither side was going to upset this equilibrium. That is why China and \nRussia are so deeply upset at what we are now considering doing--if we \ndo it unilaterally. I am not against doing it if it is arrived at \nmutually. I want to research the capacity. I think there is a value to \nbeing able to say to New York City or Los Angeles, you are never going \nto be hit by a rogue missile or an accidental launch.\n  But what good is it if you deploy it in such a way that you abrogate \nthe treaty that has held the balance and invite your adversaries to \ninterpret it as the efforts of the United States to gain this superior \nedge, which then leads them into the same response--the tit-for-tat \nsyndrome that led us through the entire arms race in the first place?\n  That arms race is completely traceable. We were the first people to \nactually use an atom bomb. People forget that. We used it for a noble \npurpose--to end the war and hopefully save lives. But we used it. After \nthat, quickly Russia did an atom bomb. Then we did the hydrogen bomb. \nRussia did the hydrogen bomb. Then we did long-range bombers. They did \nlong-range bombers. We put them on submarines, and they put them on \nsubmarines. In one--maybe two--instances, they beat us. With Sputnik, \nthey beat us. In every other instance, the United States led. We were \nthe first to put out the more sophisticated weaponry capacity.\n  But what happened? Inevitably immediately it may have taken we found \nourselves in this race. The whole purpose of the SALT talks and the \nSTART talks--now START I and START II--where we have the capacity to \nlower from 7,200 weapons down to the 3,500, is the notion that we have \narrived at an equilibrium and we are prepared to ratchet down together \nto make the world safer.\n  I say to my colleagues, very simply, if we can get China and Russia \nand our allies to understand that a mutual deployment of a clearly \nverifiable, highly transparent system, mutually arrived at in \nprotocol--if we can deploy that, all of us together, with a clear \nunderstanding of the reductions we are seeking, that could be salutary \nin its extraordinarily limited way.\n\n  But if the United States insists on moving unilaterally, abrogating a \ntreaty, we will send a message to already paranoid hardliners in other \ncountries that the United States once again wishes to have \ntechnological superiority. That will drive them to respond as a matter \nof their security perception and as a matter of their politics, the \nsame politics we have, where a bunch of people sit around and say: How \ncan you allow them to do that? You are a weak leader. You had better \nrespond. If you don't respond, you are going to be thrown out of \noffice. And they respond. What happens? We wind up spending trillions \nof dollars on something that takes us to a place that we will \nultimately decide is more dangerous than the place we are in today and \nfrom which we need to back off.\n  Sam Nunn and Dick Lugar, two of the most respected Senators--one \nformer Member and one current Member of this institution--have led this \nbody in a well known effort to reduce the nuclear threat from the \nformer Soviet Union. We had distinguished bipartisan testimony in the \nForeign Relations Committee a few weeks ago that we need some $30 \nbillion more than we are allocating now just to reduce the threat of \nthe nuclear missiles we are trying to dismantle in the former Soviet \nUnion. Yet we are talking about spending more than that to create a \nwhole new round of mistrust and misunderstanding.\n  The President, yesterday, also stressed the fact that national \nmissile defense is only one part of a comprehensive national security \nstrategy. I could not agree more; it is. But let me underscore that \nmissile defense will do nothing to address what the Pentagon itself \nconsiders a much more likely and immediate threat to the American \nhomeland from terrorists and from nonstate actors, who can quietly slip \nexplosives into a building, unleash chemical weapons into a\n\n[[Page S4138]]\n\ncrowded subway, or send a crude nuclear weapon into a busy harbor.\n\n  I ask my colleagues: What do you think is the more likely scenario? \nDo you really believe that North Korea will leave the trail of a \nmissile, a targetable trail and send a missile to the United States, \nand like the sleeping giant that was awakened in Pearl Harbor, have us \nreturn the compliment, or do you believe if they were intent on doing \ninjury to the United States, they would take a little bottle of anthrax \nand drop it in the water system in Washington, DC?\n  What do you think is more likely? Do you think it is more likely \nperhaps that some rogue nation might say: Wait a minute, they have the \nability to knock down our missile, so let's put one of these illegally \npurchased weapons in the marketplace--because we are not doing enough \nto stop proliferation internationally so they can go out and purchase a \nsmall nuclear weapon--and they bring it in on a rusty freighter under \nthe Verrazano Bridge, and detonate a nuclear weapon just outside New \nYork City.\n  I would like to see us focus on those things that most threaten us, \nnot create these notions of false threat that require us to debate for \nhours to stop something that does not necessarily promise a very \npositive impact for the long-term interests of our Nation.\n  Obviously, the President gave very few details yesterday because he \ncannot. We do not have an architecture yet. We do not even have a \nbudget yet. We do not even have enough successful tests yet to suggest \nwe should be rapidly deploying and abrogating the ABM Treaty. What are \nwe talking about?\n  The President said he wants to pursue technology that would allow us \nto intercept a ballistic missile at the boost phase when they are \nmoving the slowest. I agree with that. In June of 2000, I called on the \nprevious administration to explore the technology for a boost phase \nintercept system which would build on the current technology of the \nArmy's land-based THAAD and the Navy's sea-based theater-wide defense \nsystem to provide forward-deployed defenses against both theater \nmissile ballistic threats and long-range ballistic missile threats.\n  I welcome President Bush's commitment to investing considerable \nresources needed to make those systems capable of reaching the speeds \nnecessary to intercept an ICBM. A forward-deployed boost phase \nintercept system would allow us to target relatively small ballistic \nmissile arsenals and shoot down a very few accidental or unauthorized \nlaunches.\n  Deploying such a system, even though it might require amendments to \nthe 1997 ABM Treaty Demarcation Agreement, would establish the line \nbetween theater missile defense systems that are not limited by the \ntreaty and the strategic defenses that the treaty prescribes.\n  In a nutshell, these agreements allow the United States to deploy and \ntest the PAC-3, the THAAD, and the Navy theater-wide TMD systems, but \nthey prohibit us from developing or testing capabilities that would \nenable these systems to shoot down ICBMs.\n  Russia might not be happy about that, but I believe they would prefer \nthat to a system that would really scrap the entire treaty and all the \nlimitations on strategic defenses that would come with it.\n  I agree that the strategic situation we confront today is worlds \napart from the one we faced in 1972, but nothing in this changed \nenvironment suggests that we will be better off by walking away from \nthe ABM Treaty. If somehow Russia and China are not persuaded by \nPresident Bush's assurances that our missile defense system is not \naimed at undermining their nuclear deterrent capabilities, and instead \nthey perceive a growing threat to their interests, they will act to \ncounter that threat. We will not be safer if our NMD system focuses \ntheir energies on developing--and eventually selling--new ways to \noverwhelm our defenses.\n  The ABM Treaty can be amended to reflect our changed security \nenvironment. But to abandon it all-together is to welcome an arms race \nthat will make us more vulnerable, not less.\n  The President made a point of announcing that he will begin high-\nlevel consultations with our allies about his plans for NMD and he \nstressed that he would seek real input from them as he moves forward. \nThis is critical. Even if, as can be expected, our allies in Europe and \nAsia accept a U.S. NMD system, they have a lot at stake in how we \ndevelop and deploy that system. The President must take their views \ninto account as he determines what architecture he will pursue and the \ntiming of deploying. Clearly, these are important discussions that will \nrequire more than one or two cursory consultations.\n  The administration must also pay close attention to our allies \nconcerns about Russia. Because they are keenly aware that a fearful, \ninsecure Russia is a dangerous Russia, they have consistently stressed \nthe importance of including Moscow in our discussions on NMD. Let me be \nclear: the importance of working with Russia as we move forward is not \nto suggest that Moscow has a veto over our missile defense plans. But \nwe have an obligation to avoid unilateral steps that will throw our \nalready tenuous relations with Russia into further turmoil. Serious \ndiscussions with Moscow on amending the ABM Treaty--even if they are \nnot ultimately successful--will allow us to move toward NMD deployment \ntransparently and with minimal provocation.\n  As with Russia, if an NMD decision is made absent serious discussions \nwith China, the leadership in Beijing will perceive the deployment as \nat least partially directed at them. The Administration must try hard \nto reach a common understanding with China that there is a real threat \nfrom isolated regimes bent on terrorism and accidental or unauthorized \nlaunches. The Clinton administration invested a great deal of time and \ndiplomatic effort convincing Russia that the threat is real and it \naffects us both. We must make the same effort with China. If we fail to \ntake this task seriously, we will jeopardize stability in the Pacific.\n  The President's proposal on NMD lacks specifics and his intentions on \nthe ABM Treaty are vague. He and his advisors know that the American \npeople will not support an expensive, ineffective NMD system, or one \nthat comes at the expense of a Treaty that has made them safer over the \nlast 20 years. So to sweeten the President's bad news on these two \nissues, he promised--again without any detail--to unilaterally reduce \nthe U.S. arsenal of strategic nuclear weapons.\n  The proposal to unilaterally reduce U.S. nuclear stockpiles is an \nimportant and overdue first step toward reducing the nuclear danger. \nUnfortunately, before the President can make good on this promise, he \nwill have to convince his Republican colleagues in the Congress to \nrepeal a provision in the FY 98 Defense Department Authorization bill \nthat prohibits the reduction of strategic nuclear delivery systems to \nlevels below those established by the START I treaty.\n  Senate Democrats have tried for the last three years to repeal this \nprovision, which prevents exactly the kind of nuclear reduction \nPresident Bush has spoken about. But they have been stymied by a \nRepublican leadership that believes the U.S. should not move to START \nII arms levels even though the Senate ratified that treaty in 1996--\nbefore Russia has done so.\n  I hope we can move immediately to repeal this prohibition and begin \nthe process of cutting our strategic arsenal in half--from more than \n7,000 warheads today to the 3,500 allowed under START II. While those \nreductions are underway, the President should immediately proceed to \ntalks with Russia on a START III agreement, which could bring our \narsenal to below 2,000 warheads and codify similar, transparent, \nverifiable and irreversible reductions by Russia.\n  Mr. President, for 40 years, the United States has led international \nefforts to reduce and contain the danger from nuclear weapons. We can \ncontinue that leadership by exploiting our technological strengths to \nfind a defense against ballistic missiles, and by extending that \ndefense to our friends and allies. But we must not jeopardize stability \nin Europe and Asia by putting political ideology ahead of commitments \nthat have kept us safe for decades.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/02/senate-section/article/S4138-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4138-S4156]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  BETTER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED--\n                               Continued\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed for a \nfew\n\n[[Page S4139]]\n\nminutes within my hour on the motion to proceed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair and my colleagues. I will be brief. I \nsee the Senator from Maryland is here, as well as others.\n  Mr. President, I do not think there is a person in the Senate who \ndoes not view education as the single most important domestic priority \nthis year. A number of us have been working for a long period of time \nto advance the dialog with respect to education. Indeed, a couple of \nyears ago, we Democrats were prepared to move forward on the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act. We were prevented from doing so because, \nfrankly, our colleagues on the other side, for political reasons, were \nunwilling to allow President Clinton to be the person who signed a bill \nthat passed education reform in the country.\n  Politics trumped real reform. Politics trumped, once again, the \ninterests of young people in our country.\n  I remember Joe Lieberman, others, and myself talking for hours with \nPaul Coverdell, our late colleague, with Slade Gorton, and others \ntrying to find the common ground so we could move forward on this \ncritical issue.\n  Here we are this year with Democrats having moved in ways that many \npeople would have argued they never would have moved previously. There \nhas been a challenging of the orthodoxy that has governed the debate on \neducation for a long period of time. So we have a consolidation of \nprograms. We have an effort to deal in a realistic way with the problem \nof accountability.\n  It used to be there were some pretty one-sided discussions. Some \npeople on the other side of the aisle thought it was just good money \nchasing after bad, and so they did not even want to talk about \nresources. All the discussion was about an alternative to the public \neducation system--fundamentally, vouchers. On this side there was \nfundamentally only a discussion about school construction or class \nsize. Nothing happened. Most important, nothing happened for our kids. \nThe schools did not get much better, except in isolated instances where \nextraordinary leadership managed to break through.\n  The fact is that 90 percent of America's children go to school in \npublic schools. There are not enough vouchers and there are not enough \nprivate and parochial schools to offer enough choice to all of the \nstudents of this generation to get the education they need by \nalternatives.\n  The bottom line is if 90 percent of America's children go to school \ntoday in public schools, if we are going to have the workforce we need \nfor the future, but equally important, if we are going to have the \nskilled labor force we need, and much more important, if we are going \nto have young people who grow up to understand the obligations of \ncitizenship, who have the capacity in an age of managing more \ninformation to be able to process the information and translate it into \ngood civic activities, the acceptance of values, the acceptance of \nfamily responsibilities, the acceptance of community responsibilities, \nthen every student, indeed, better have the best of opportunities.\n  I have joined with Joe Lieberman, Evan Bayh, Mary Landrieu, Blanche \nLincoln, John Breaux, Tom Carper, and a host of Democrats in agreeing \nwe have to change the dynamics of this debate; that we need strict \naccountability; that we cannot put money into a school and allow it \nyear after year as a consequence of some kind of reform to fail. But \neverybody in this institution knows there are countless communities in \nthe United States of America that just cannot afford to do the basics. \nProperty tax is what funds education. Come to Lawrence, New Bedford, or \nHolyoke, MA, or countless other communities in America where they don't \nhave the tax base, particularly through the property tax, where people \nare on fixed incomes trying to hang on to a home and cannot afford \nhigher property rates. In many States, there are limits on what can be \nraised on the property tax--mine among them.\n\n  The question is, how do we provide adequate numbers of teachers to \nhave a class size where a teacher can actually cope with children? How \ndo we keep school doors open into the evening if the community can't \npay the custodians or the additional teachers or have remedial classes? \nHow do we put in the technology if they can't afford to buy it?\n  The bottom line is, we have put in place in this bill an enormous \nchange, a sea change, in how we are prepared to try to encourage \naccountability, to encourage reform and encourage change. But we cannot \ndo it if there isn't an adequate commitment of resources for IDEA, the \ngreatest burden we hear principals talk about in schools, to the \ncapacity to be able to have a teacher for certain classes. We have some \nschools where 80 percent of the children in the school do not have an \nalgebra teacher. Teachers are teaching out of field.\n  Test students all you want, but if they do not get the fundamentals, \nthey will be in deficit from the beginning.\n  This is a choice for the Senate. Either we fund education reform to \nthe degree that will empower it to actually take place or we will \ninvite an incredible new round of cynicism. We will pass something and \ncall it reform, and teachers and parents across the country will say: \nThank God, reform at last. It is coming. But if you don't empower them \nto be able to do it, you can see the next wave of discussion. It will \nbe: The public schools have failed; they did not live up to the \nexpectations. We gave them the opportunity, and they didn't make it. \nNow it is alternatives.\n\n  I am not going to buy into, as I think many of my colleagues will not \nbuy into, a false equation of reform. We insist there be adequate \nfunding of those communities that simply do not have the ability to be \nable to make the difference. That is the best of what the Federal \nGovernment exists for in the sense we assert a national priority, \nsomething in the interest of everybody in this country--educating our \nkids, making sure they have values, making sure they are in safe \ncommunities, where they can grow up to full citizenship. We share the \ncapacity of our country to be able to guarantee that no child is left \nbehind.\n  In the budget that President Bush has presented, with only a 5 \npercent increase in disadvantaged children's funding, how can one \npossibly live up to that promise? This is not a political fight. This \nis not a political food fight. This is not just Washington somehow \nbeing the same.\n  I respect President Bush's effort to change the tone and be \nbipartisan. Right now, the only bipartisanship has been movement on our \nside of the aisle to consolidate the programs, to move toward a more \nsensible regime for accountability. The question we are asking is, \nwhere is the bipartisanship on the other side of the aisle that moves \ntoward us with respect to this critical element of funding?\n  You can have accountability, but if you don't have adequate funding \nto make it happen, it is a complete sham and waste of time. Likewise, \nwe believe you can have a lot of money but if you don't have the \naccountability, it is equally a sham and waste of time. If we are \nprepared to change the dynamic and provide this country with education \nreform it deserves, we must be prepared to adequately fund the reform \neffort.\n  I reserve the balance of my hour, and I ask unanimous consent I be \npermitted to speak again within the hour, if necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The distinguished Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the motion to proceed \nto the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and I yield myself 15 \nminutes.\n  I hope we will proceed. I intend to vote for the motion to proceed so \nwe can get on the bill and get serious in the Senate about addressing \nthe compelling human needs that exist in America's public schools.\n  I believe education is the most important crucial rung in our \nNation's opportunity ladder. During the coming days, we will discuss \nhow we can strengthen this opportunity ladder. The Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act is only the first step. It sets the framework \nfor reform, and also it will establish how we will address our public \neducation.\n  We do need reform in our public schools, and at the same time we need \nto have the resources to put the reforms into action. However, if we \nput\n\n[[Page S4140]]\n\nthe reforms on the Federal law books but do not put the resources in \nthe Federal checkbook, this will be a hollow opportunity.\n  There are some on my side of the aisle who question whether we should \nembark upon testing. First, I stand squarely in the corner of \nsupporting the concept of accountability. I also stand squarely in the \ncorner of supporting testing, but making sure the Federal Government \ndoes pay the bill.\n  In the State of Maryland, we have had testing for more than a decade. \nTesting enabled us to provide an inventory of where our schools were, \nwhat schools needed intervention and what type of intervention.\n  I view testing like a CAT scan. It gives an inventory of where the \nproblems might be and identifies other areas of potential problems. I \nbelieve we should proceed with testing and also aggressively fight for \nthe resources. At the same time, we should not hold up on getting an \ninventory of where we are.\n  In keeping with this principle, I support six priorities for \neducational reform. One is something I am calling ``digital \nopportunity.'' I know the Presiding Officer is deeply troubled about \nthe need to have more people educated in math, science and technology \nin order to meet our growing national security needs. The Rudman-Hart \nreport clearly indicates we need to have children technologically \ncompetent, not only for the new economy but also for the new security \nthreats facing the United States of America. Issues such as \ncyberterrorism are an example of why we need to make the availability \nof educational technology a priority.\n  I worked very hard to have a series of amendments creating digital \nopportunity. One, a national goal that every child be computer literate \nby the time they finish the eighth grade. I enjoyed bipartisan support \non this issue in the committee and it passed. To make the goal a \nreality, I offered an amendment to make technology funds more robust \nand more effective. The BEST bill authorizing $1 billion for education \ntechnology.\n  The new technology block grant that President Bush is advocating is \nsomething I will support because it will mean the programs will no \nlonger be scattered through the Department of Education. As we are \ndealing with the scattered problem, we also have to deal with the \nskimpy problem and make sure we have the funds for hardware, software, \nand teacher training.\n  I know, also, we are not considering the e-rate in ESEA. Sometimes in \nlegislation the best thing we can do is do no harm. The Bush \nadministration talked about eliminating the E-rate or consolidating the \nE-rate with ESEA technology programs. I am pleased that in our \ndiscussion with the White House they clarified the E-rate will be a \nsubject of further discussion in the future. I am a big supporter of \nthe E rate. I hope we do not change it.\n  A weakness in the bill is that it focuses entirely on schools and not \nenough on the communities where children learn. Everybody does not \nentirely learn in school. Many people learn in structured afterschool \nactivities and in the community. This is why I will offer an amendment \non community tech centers, to establish 1,000 community tech centers, \nthroughout the United States of America. That means that they can be \nrun by nonprofits including the Boys and Girls Clubs, faith-based \norganizations, and Latino heritage organizations. Let's get tech into \nthe community. In some instances our children are in schools that are \nso dated they cannot be wired. We want to make sure our kids are wired \nfor the future.\n\n  We also need to focus on teachers, recruiting the best, training the \nbest, and retaining the best. I am pleased the education bill \nauthorizes almost $3 billion for teacher training. At the same time, we \ncould use more. I believe we need at least $2 billion more for teacher \ntraining to bring them into the classroom and also to upgrade their \nskills.\n  Another priority I believe we need to focus on is smaller class size. \nEveryone will tell you we do need smaller class sizes. I will be \nsupporting Senator Murray's effort to continue to try to hire 100,000 \nnew teachers for our classrooms.\n  Coming back to where children learn, I support structured afterschool \nactivities. Children need structured afterschool activities where they \ncan learn, have fun, and be safe. In many of these neighborhoods this \nis absolutely crucial.\n  Speaking of safety, this then takes us to school modernization. The \naverage school in the United States of America is 42 years old. Many of \nthem are crumbling. Many are dated. Some are even dangerous. We really \nneed to work out how we can be a partner with State and local \ngovernments on the improvement of schools to modernize those \nfacilities.\n  The other area where we also need to keep our commitment is on \nfunding for IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. The \nFederal Government passed, some years ago, a mandate that local school \ndistricts are supposed to come up with individual education plans for \nchildren who are disabled. We promised them if they did that, they \nwould get 40 percent of the cost from the Federal Government. Guess \nwhat. We only provide about 15 percent. In Maryland it's 9 percent. I \nbelieve we should keep the policy, but let's really, now, meet that \nmandate. If over the next 3 years we could work every year to increase \nthe funding for IDEA, the money would go right into the school \ndistricts. It would help the local communities. It would alleviate a \nlot of the financial pressure on the state and locals to serve our \nspecial kids, without us becoming the schoolmarm or chairman of the \nschool board in local school districts.\n  These are the issues on which I look forward to working. I believe we \ncan move the bill on a bipartisan basis. Let's have reform with \nresources so we can have results. Those are the three R's I want: \nReform, resources, and results. Let's get our kids and our country \nready for the 21st century. We have made great progress in the past, \nand I know we can do so in the future.\n  I yield the floor. I yield back any time I may not have consumed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The distinguished Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I would like to be recognized \non the motion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized. The minority has 16 \nminutes 6 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I listened closely to the \neloquent comments of our colleague from Massachusetts this morning. It \nwas his late brother, President Kennedy, in 1962, who said in a message \nto the 87th Congress: ``A child miseducated is a child lost.''\n  Today, nearly four decades later, these words ring truer than ever. \nFar too many of our children, particularly poor and minority children, \nremain miseducated today despite efforts over the years to strengthen \nand reform America's public schools. The latest tests by the National \nAssessment of Educational Progress, for example, showed that only 32 \npercent of our Nation's fourth graders were proficient or better in \nreading and more than one-third of the fourth graders read below basic \nminimum standards. That is unacceptable, especially today, when the \nconsequences of such poor performance have never been greater.\n  In this era of rapid technological change, business and industry \nrequire highly skilled, highly educated workers. If we fail to improve \nour school systems, many of our young people will be locked out of \nwell-paid jobs and denied opportunities to succeed in a changing global \neconomy. We cannot deny them that opportunity, nor can we deny this \nNation the talent and skills it needs to grow and prosper. This 107th \nCongress must lead so no child is left behind.\n  As for their leadership thus far, I wish to compliment many of our \ncolleagues who have engaged in tough and bipartisan negotiations aimed \nat ensuring that we adequately address our Nation's educational \npriorities. The administration has proposed one plan, and some parts of \nit are very good. They are certainly in step with the reforms many of \nus have advocated in the past--particularly as I tried to articulate in \nthis last election cycle in Florida. But other parts of the \nadministration's plan are seriously flawed or are grossly underfunded. \nAt the outset we must decide to put partisan interests aside and do \nwhat is right for our children.\n  By the way, more than 90 percent of our children attend public \nschools. We\n\n[[Page S4141]]\n\nmust debate and resolve the important issues that still separate us, \nkeeping in mind our common goal of giving every child the opportunity \nto succeed, not only in school but also in life.\n  The teachers and public schools in Melbourne, FL, along with my \nparents, gave me my start and instilled in me a lifelong love of \nlearning. Public elementary and secondary schools gave me the \nopportunity to go on to college and to law school, and to serve in the \nArmy and the Florida legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives. \nThat public school education also allowed me to serve as Florida's \nState treasurer and as a member of the State cabinet, as a member of \nthe State board of education, overseeing public education. Now I have \nthe privilege of being here as a Member of the Senate.\n  I am forever indebted to my teachers and to those schools. Those \nschools were good ones, located in a growing, prospering community \nalong the east coast of Florida. I was blessed. As we know and as the \nrecent reading scores demonstrate, not every child is that fortunate. \nToo many of them come from broken families, too busy putting food on \nthe table to worry about the absence of books in their homes. Too many \nattend failing schools in failing neighborhoods, or crumbling schools \nwith overcrowded classrooms. Too many have outdated textbooks, \ninsufficient numbers of books to go around, and tired teachers who \nbelieve they lack the support they need.\n  Thanks to economic growth and the fiscal discipline imposed by the \nCongress, we now have a unique opportunity this session to help our \nStates and local school districts address these problems. We have an \nopportunity not only to provide more of the financial help needed but \nalso to ensure that those dollars help produce a better education for \nour children. We must not squander that opportunity now.\n  I am encouraged that the White House has emphasized education. I also \nam encouraged that progress has been made in the negotiations so that \nwe can give the States and school districts greater flexibility on \nspending while also holding them more accountable for results. These \nare goals we all share.\n  I am confident that we can resolve our remaining differences on this \nlegislation and work out the details on how best to achieve those goals \nthat we share. But I am also convinced that the administration's \ncommitment to leave no child behind will be nothing more than an empty \nslogan unless we bolster it with sufficient resources needed to get the \njob done. Reform without resources is not reform.\n  In this regard, the President's demand for excessive tax cuts \ncontradicts his pledge to do right by America's schoolchildren. I \nbelieve that it would be reckless to risk a return to the annual budget \ndeficits that you and I, Mr. President, experienced in the 1980s and \nreturn to mounting national debt by committing this Nation to a tax cut \nthat could overwhelm the projected surplus. It is a tax cut that is \nsaid to be $1.6 trillion, but in a real estimate of what it would cost \nin terms of deficit reduction, it is $2.5 trillion. It would be \nreckless to use the surplus for that instead of investing any increase \nin Federal education over the next 10 years. The White House claimed \nits proposed budget would provide an 11.5 percent increase for \neducation in the coming fiscal year. But the real increase would be \nhalf that amount, and could leave the States with unfunded mandates, \nsomething the Congress in 1995 vowed that it would never do--put \nunfunded mandates on the States.\n  If we are truly to leave no child behind, then we can do a whole lot \nbetter. We must do better.\n  In my view, there is no higher priority than providing a first-rate \neducation for the children in our public school systems. Our Federal \nGovernment, which now provides just 7 percent of the money for all of \nour schools nationally, ought to provide a larger investment for school \nconstruction, for dropout prevention, for smaller and safer classes, \nfor teachers who are both well trained and well paid, and for programs \nthat assist children with preschool education and afterschool care.\n  The amendments we adopted last month in our Senate budget resolution \nwould strengthen the Federal investment in public education and \nchildren with disabilities by more than $250 billion over the next \ndecade. We can also help failing schools succeed by strengthening our \nprograms for disadvantaged children and targeting additional Federal \nmoney to needy students and to the poorest schools, some represented by \nthe distinguished Senator who honors me with his presence here, the \ndistinguished Senator from West Virginia.\n  Along with increased support, the education bill that Congress enacts \nthis year should provide for greater accountability. It should \ncondition future help on academic performance standards set by the \nStates and measured by testing students yearly and uniformly within \neach State.\n  We also need to ensure that the States set meaningful standards and \nmeasure real progress.\n\n  We can do all of this in part by using the National Assessment of \nEducational Progress tests of fourth and eighth grade students and as a \nway to audit the results of the yearly State reading and math tests \nthat would be provided under this bill in grades three through eight.\n  So the States do their thing, with their own accountability, but we \nthen will have a national measure, a standard by which to compare the \nStates with the National Assessment of Education Progress test. This \nwill then enable us to confirm that Federal dollars were well spent.\n  Parents have an important role to play. They are entitled to timely \nreport cards from their school districts on the performance of their \nchildren's schools, not just their individual child's report card. If, \ndespite our best efforts, a school continues to fail, they ought to \nhave a choice so their kids are not trapped in failure. But when the \nNation's taxpayers are paying for it, the choice ought to involve \npublic schools, and not private ones, if it is public school money.\n  I believe our negotiations are on the right track for providing \noptions for transfers to charter schools, magnet schools, or other \nschools within a district, or for extra help from outside tutoring to \nsummer school.\n  I want to make sure that we don't divert public school tax dollars to \nprivate schools through vouchers. We need to improve public schools \nthat perform poorly. We don't need to abandon them. As we make our \nschools and local school systems accountable, we also need to give them \nmore control and greater flexibility to use the Federal funds in ways \nthat better meet local needs. I believe that we can consolidate \nprograms and cut bureaucratic strings without sacrificing those Federal \ninitiatives that are an essential part of the solution.\n  For example, we know that children learn better in smaller classes. \nWhy in the world would we want to abandon our national commitment to \nreducing class size, to building new schools and renovating the old \nones if we know that creates an environment in which children can \nbetter learn? We can do better.\n  In February, I joined with 10 other Senators in introducing the \nPublic Education Reinvestment, Reinvention, and Responsibility Act, \nwhich we call the three Rs. Its aim is to streamline the Federal role \nin education and eliminate some of the bureaucratic strings that hinder \nlocal school districts. Its goal is to establish a clear national \npriority to ensure that every child has a chance at a quality \neducation. These priorities include--and let's think about these; they \nare common sense--closing the achievement gap between poor and more \naffluent children; helping immigrant children learn English; improving \nteacher quality; reducing class size in the early grades; spurring \ninnovative practices; and promoting choice within the public school \nframework.\n  I am pleased that many of our proposals are now embraced in the \ncommittee bill that is now pending before us. As our deliberations \nproceed, I will be fighting to ensure that they receive adequate \nfunding.\n  We must succeed in this endeavor. Failure is not an option. We cannot \nafford to abandon our young people. In the long run, such failure would \nbe far more costly than investing in quality education for all of our \nchildren.\n  Let us make sure that no child is miseducated, and let us make sure \nthat no child is lost.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for being kind\n\n[[Page S4142]]\n\nenough to be interested and to be on the floor as I present my maiden \nspeech on education.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the distinguished Senator has \nexpired. The time of the minority has expired.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Florida may have 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and thank the \ndistinguished Senator from Florida for yielding. I thank him for the \nthoughtful remarks he has just made. I heard him as I was in my office, \nand I came to the floor because I knew I would hear something worth \nlistening to. I gave some time to the Senator from Florida. I am very \nimpressed with his dedication to his Senate duties, and I appreciate \nhis love for the Senate. I am going to have a few remarks later \nconcerning education and our schools and this legislation. I will want \nto scan very carefully--perhaps it would not be scanning--I will want \nto study very carefully the words of the Senator from Florida before I \nmake my own remarks.\n  I thank him for his contribution to the Senate and for his \ncontribution to the debate on this extremely important subject. I look \nforward to reading his comments and hearing him from time to time. It \nis a pleasure to work with him.\n  (Mrs. CLINTON assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, just in the remaining moment, \nI say to the Senator from West Virginia what a tremendous role model he \nhas been to all of us new Senators, including the Senator now presiding \nin the chair. What a tremendous pillar of historical example he has \nbeen in carrying forth the traditions of the Senate and imparting those \ntraditions to the new Senators, and then in his vision for the future \nto keep alive those traditions.\n  I have been so educated sitting in this Chamber listening to Senator \nByrd bring in the history of the world to make his point on a \nparticular argument in which he might be engaged. He recalls to mind, \nfor me, the great orators who have been in this Chamber. Again, that is \nanother part of he being a wonderful role model for all of the new \nSenators.\n  So I am eternally grateful, and I am especially honored that he would \nthink me worthy of coming and listening to my comments today on \neducation.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator for his \ngenerous and overly charitable remarks. I thank him very much.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the next 30 \nminutes of postcloture debate be equally divided between the majority \nand Senator Hollings from the minority and that the time be deducted \nfrom each individual Senator as provided under rule XXII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I am waiting for one of our Senators. In \nthe meantime, let me again say how important it is that we move on with \nwhat we started to do in this Chamber. We have been working on the \neducation bill now for a very long time. The committee has done a great \ndeal of work. But we find ourselves now sort of postponing \nconsideration of the bill. This is the third time I have been in this \nChamber today to ask for another hour of postcloture activity.\n  The time has come, certainly, for us to begin consideration of the \nbill, to begin to move forward, to begin to talk about those areas of \ndisagreement, and to begin to offer the amendments that need to be \nconsidered.\n  I think, clearly, this bill is one of the most important issues on \nwhich we will be working. We have talked for a long time about the need \nfor accountability. We have talked for a very long time about the need \nfor additional funding. We have talked a long time about the \nflexibility that should exist when we have Federal money going to local \nand State governments so that there can be enough changes made to allow \nfor the differences that exist in communities. Certainly that is \nimportant.\n  We have talked a lot about how we need to help teachers become more \nefficient and more effective in that they are the most important aspect \nof education.\n  We have talked about parental choice so that students can move \nbetween public schools in the various communities at the choice of the \nparent. Certainly that is an important item.\n  There will never be agreement on all these things among all of us, \nbut certainly it is an issue with which we have to proceed. I look \nforward to that.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor to my friend from Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. HUTCHINSON. I thank the Chair and thank the distinguished Senator \nfrom Wyoming for his leadership in this debate.\n  Madam President, I will just take a few moments to again speak on the \nvery important issue of education and the legislation we have pending \nbefore us, and to urge my colleagues to support the motion to proceed.\n  I believe we have spent close to a week--perhaps more than a week--\ntalking about education without having yet taken a single vote on an \namendment.\n  I believe this issue is of such great importance that while we do not \nwant to shortchange the amount of time we spend on this issue, and \nwhile we do not want to short circuit the process, we also do not want \nto become victims of the process.\n  I saw last year where we spent weeks on the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, and where we had other items of important business that \nwould interrupt the education debate, and where we would return to the \neducation debate, and while there was never a formal filibuster, the \neffect last year was to have a filibuster by amendment and by process, \nso that extraneous amendments prevented us from ever getting a final \nvote on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the \nreauthorization of this important bill. The losers, as always, are the \nAmerican people and, more critically, the children of this country.\n  I urge my colleagues to allow us to proceed with the bill. I know \nthere are good-faith negotiations occurring on important subjects. I \nhave been involved in those. I think they are in good faith. I applaud \nthe efforts that are ongoing. But we have spent a long time on this \nissue. The differences now are fairly small, whether it be in funding \nor whether it be in policy. It is critically important that we go ahead \nand proceed to consider the bill and begin the process of offering \namendments and debating this issue.\n  The process of what occurred in the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee and the bill that was voted out of that committee, \nas well as the bipartisan policy agreements that have been reached \nthrough negotiations, have produced, I suspect, 95-percent agreement \nnow on policy. In both of these instances--both the committee and the \nnegotiated agreement--we have taken a tremendous step forward in \neducation in this country and have made a tremendous move toward real \neducational reform.\n  Let me mention a few of the areas. Let's reiterate them again. We \nmust have accountability in educational reform. To pour billions of \ndollars more into the Federal contribution to educate our children \nwithout requiring real accountability would not only be foolhardy but \nwould be a waste of taxpayers' dollars. So we must have accountability.\n  The bill that is before us--the negotiations and what has resulted \nfrom those negotiations--brings us real accountability, and it \ntransforms the way we have thought about accountability for the last 35 \nyears. What it has been in the past has been asking the local schools, \nlocal education authorities: Are you spending the money the way we \nprescribed that you spend it? That is what we have defined as \naccountability. Did you fill out the paperwork correctly? Did you cross \nthe t's correctly? Did you dot the i's correctly? Did you spend it the \nway we prescribed you to spend it?\n  Whether it made good sense locally or not, whether it was in the best \ninterest of the children or not, if it conformed with what we in \nWashington believed was the right way to spend it, we\n\n[[Page S4143]]\n\nsaid, then that is accountability. You have met the accountability \nrequirements.\n\n  We have changed that and gone in a whole new direction. We have said \nevery child ought to be tested every year. We ought to know whether or \nnot children are learning. We are taking a giant step away from how old \nare you, what grade should you be in, have we shuffled you through the \nsystem, to what do you know.\n  I have heard the critics of testing and the testing proposals. \nTesting is by no means perfect, but I ask my colleagues, is there a \nbetter way to measure what children know? The answer is, of course, no. \nThat is the best tool we have to know whether or not children are \nprogressing academically, whether or not they should be moved ahead and \npromoted. That is very important. If you are going to have real \naccountability, you must not only measure through testing; there must \nbe consequences to those schools that are not teaching, that are not \nsucceeding, that are not preparing their students to go out into the \nworkplace and compete in this global economy.\n  Under this bill, there are real consequences for those schools that \nwill not teach and will not change. Yes, additional resources; yes, \nadditional help, but in the end, if a school will not change and it \nwill not teach and the children are being trapped in a school that is \nhandicapping their future, then we say, in this legislation, there \nshould be consequences to those schools.\n  The best consequence, the best way you hold schools accountable is to \nensure that parents have greater choices. Yes, after schools are given \nan opportunity to improve and to address the shortcomings of failing \nschools, and still they do not make the changes, then we would say \nparents should have the right to take those children and move them to \nthe public school of their choice. I would prefer that the choices be \nexpanded, but in the bill before us at least there is the expansion of \nparental choice in the sense that they can go to another public school. \nCompetition is good in any sector in our economy. It is good in \nbusiness and in education. The public schools will be better when that \nelement of competition is injected.\n  The evidence is overwhelming, whether you look at Milwaukee, WI, or \nwhether you look at the State of Florida, that where you have \ncompetition, you have improvement in the public schools.\n  We recently heard from the Milwaukee superintendent of schools, the \nlongest choice program in the Nation. His testimony was that the public \nschools in Milwaukee are better today because of the choice element, \nbecause parents of low-income children have the right to take those \nchildren and move them into a private, public, parochial, or charter \nschool where they have a whole range of options; that choice has made \nthe public school system better. We suggest in this legislation that \nreal consequences mean greater parental choice.\n  We also say that where a school will not change and will not teach, \nthose parents should be able to find supplemental services to assist in \nthe education of their children. Parents should not be forced to \nsacrifice the future of their children because they happen to be in a \nschool that will not make the academic investment in those children.\n  We say, yes, if a parent has children who are in a school that after \nyears does not improve and is still not doing the job, is still a \nfailing school, the parents ought to be able to take those children to \na Sylvan Learning Center or they should be able, with their title I \ndollars, to hire a tutor. They ought to be able to take that portion of \nthe Federal contribution to local education and ensure that their \nchildren are not sacrificed in a failing system.\n\n  Accountability is a huge part of the legislation that is before the \nSenate and that I hope we will begin voting on soon.\n  A second aspect of this legislation is the consolidation that occurs. \nOne of the frustrations of local educators for many years has been the \nplethora of programs that we have created at the Federal level, \noftentimes well intended, oftentimes with a very good purpose in mind, \nand frequently never funded by the Federal Government, just authorized \nwithout any funding. Sometimes when we question officials at the \nDepartment of Education about how many programs they have, it is very \ndifficult to get a clear, unequivocal answer. They simply don't know \nhow many programs are under their jurisdiction that have been created \nthrough the years, since the department was established, authorized, \nsome funded, some not funded, some having wilted away but still on the \nbooks. They don't know how many programs there are.\n  We know that while it has been repeated frequently during the debate \non education that we contribute between 7 and 9 percent of the local \nschool's budget from the Federal Government, we contribute about 50 \npercent of the paperwork with which local educators are required to \ncomply. That is probably the best gauge of how many Federal mandates \naccompany that 7 to 9 percent of the funding at the local level.\n  What the President has suggested and what the committee has produced \nin the committee deliberations is a bill that consolidates this \nplethora of Federal programs into a more manageable, more simple stream \nof funding for the local schools. The funding is still there but, as a \nresult, there is far greater flexibility than there has been in the \npast because we have consolidated these many programs.\n  That is something that needs to be done. Local educators acknowledge \nthat. Yes, every program has a constituency. When we try to \nconsolidate, to eliminate, we hear from those constituencies. But let \nthe educators of this country realize, there is no reduction in \nfunding. In fact, the funding is dramatically increased in this \nlegislation.\n  The flexibility for local educators to use those resources in the \narea they feel is most essential for local educational reform is \nenhanced under this legislation. Whether that is class size reduction, \nhiring more teachers, whether it is tutors, school nurses, whether it \nwould be a form of merit pay, paying the best teachers more, enhanced \nflexibility would be there for these local educators under this \nlegislation. So consolidation is a very important part of what we are \ndoing in this education reform.\n  Then what I hope comes out of the ongoing negotiations is a form of \nthe President's proposal regarding charter States. This was a bold \ninitiative that President Bush campaigned on and spoke eloquently about \nand that has been whittled down and whittled down and diminished and \ndeluded, but there is a form of it still remaining. We are talking \nabout perhaps seven States as a demonstration project with perhaps 25 \nlocal educational authorities or school districts that would be given \nthe option of applying for this new status created called charter \nStates. In last year's deliberations, we called it the Straight A's \nProgram.\n  The concept is we will give States broad new flexibility to \nconsolidate streams of funding and to make local education reforms in \nexchange for strict accountability standards.\n  The concept of charter schools has for years been used successfully \nacross the country. That is why they are increasing in number. We say \nto a charter school: You have a waiver in effect from local and State \neducation requirements in exchange for results we expect from what you \nare doing in that charter school. If it works at the local school, why \nshouldn't it work if we give States, the laboratories of democracy, \nthat kind of flexibility. So States would be given a new element of \nfreedom and flexibility in exchange for a performance agreement with \nthe Department of Education and the Secretary of Education as to what \nthey intend to accomplish and how they intend to accomplish it and \nensuring that there is going to be increased annual yearly progress.\n\n  That is a good deal for schools; it is a good deal for States; and it \nis a good deal for the American people. There will be a little bit of \nthat proposal that survives so that a few States can apply, and a few \nStates will be willing to try it, to break out of the old mold. The \nresult will be an example that a lot of other States will want to try \nin the future.\n  I commend the President for his strong emphasis upon early childhood\n\n[[Page S4144]]\n\neducation and particularly his emphasis upon reading programs, his \nwillingness to triple funding for reading programs. So often the \ntragedy of shuffling children through the system all begins in \nkindergarten and first grade and second grade, where the foundation is \nnot adequately laid. The President's emphasis upon reading is to be \ncommended and is an important part of this legislation as well.\n  One aspect that I and my staff have been involved in, that will not \nget a lot of attention but is going to be a very significant step, is \nthe change that is made in the bilingual education program.\n  Historically, that has been a competitive grant program. Many States \nthat have had growing minority populations--particularly--in the State \nof Arkansas, with a growing population have received almost nil under \nthe current system. Because of the changes made in the legislation, we \nwill not only have increased funding nationwide, but we will have a \nformula that will benefit many of these States such as Arkansas and \nAlabama, and many of the rural States that have fared so poorly under \nthe past approach on bilingual education. In addition, there will be \nemphasis--in fact, a requirement--on teaching English in these \nprograms.\n  This is a huge step in the proper direction of reform. I know my \ncolleague, Senator Bond, is on the floor. I am anxious to hear what he \nhas to say on this subject. Senator Bond has been involved in education \nfor years.\n  I will conclude by addressing an issue that we have heard repeatedly \non the floor, and we are going to hear a lot more about it in the next \ncouple weeks, and that is the issue of spending. For those who say this \nis an unfunded mandate upon the States, for those who say it is \nunconscionable to do education reform without fully funding the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, I just say: Where have you \nbeen? This is the first time that the Republican Senate, with a \nRepublican Congress and with a Republican President, has had an \nopportunity to reauthorize the ESEA. Historically, with a Democrat \nPresident and Democrat Congress, the funding increases when ESEA has \nbeen reauthorized, have been between 5 and 6 percent. So to demand that \nthe only way you will support education reform is if there is a full \ncommitment to funding ESEA for the next so many years is really \ndisingenuous.\n  The President has made a strong commitment to dramatic increases in \neducation funding--in fact, more than in any other Cabinet department--\nand has been willing to move even higher on those numbers in the \nnegotiation process across the aisle.\n  So I just plead with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that we \nnot allow a bogus debate on funding to distract us from the very \nimportant task of giving the children of this country and the families \nof this country the kind of education reform they deserve, and that \nwill truly put meaning behind what has become a very popular phrase--\n``leaving no child behind.'' We are leaving them behind today. We have \nan opportunity to leave far fewer behind. Every child can learn if \ngiven the opportunity and the expectations.\n  This legislation, through accountability and flexibility, testing \nrequirements, through increased funding, does many good things in \nmoving us in the right direction toward greater educational opportunity \nfor every child in America. I hope that we get on with it, get on the \nbill, and pass the bill and send it to the President, who has been a \ndynamic leader on education reform in this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I know I am out of order, but I do not see \na representative from the other side. I ask unanimous consent that I \nmay be allowed to proceed out of order for up to 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise today to support President Bush's \neducation initiative and S. 1, the Better Education for Students and \nTeachers Act. As a new member of the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee I have been involved in the tremendous bipartisan \nprogress that has been made in Congress thus far on public education \nreform. I look forward to the swift conclusion of the debate, the \nsigning ceremony that will take place, but most importantly--the \nimprovements to public education that will result to ensure that ``no \nchild is left behind.''\n  It is obvious that the American public places improvement of our \npublic education system as a top priority. Parents and communities are \naware of the same statistics that have been provided to us. Our \nchildren are not reading at the basic level. Too many students never \ngraduate from high school. U.S. students lag behind too many countries \nin science and math. Our higher education institutions are spending too \nmuch money on remedial education and businesses have to spend billions \nof dollars teaching their employees what the schools did not teach \nthem.\n  I believe there is agreement that education, while a national \npriority, is a responsibility and obligation of the state and local \ncommunities. The education of our children has always been carried out \nand implemented at the local level. The American public is interested \nin the debate here in Washington, but they understand what really \nmatters is what takes place in the schools and classrooms around the \ncountry--not the Senate or House floors.\n  The decisions that are going to improve children in a particular \nschool district are going to be made by the teachers, parents, school \nboard members, and administrators who know the names of the children, \nknow their problems, know their opportunities.\n  Every single one of us have a vested interest in the success of \ntoday's generation and future generations of youth in this country. \nTherefore, we have a vested interest in the improvement of our public \neducation system.\n  For many decades Congress has debated numerous education issues, \nincluding the federal role and federal funding. Even after the \ncompletion of this specific debate, discussions and debates will \ncontinue. The debates continue because we are constantly seeking ways \nto improve upon our public education system.\n  However, we must be careful. One of the main reasons that I support \nPresident Bush's plan and S. 1 is because it streamlines and \nconsolidates many of the countless individual education programs that \nexist. We have all read the reports and have heard several colleagues \ntalk about the 760 education programs scattered throughout 39 different \nfederal agencies. According to the Education Commission of the States, \n``In the 1999-2000 budget, the federal government spent almost $44 \nbillion on elementary and secondary education programs. This funding \nwas spread across 35 different education programs in 15 different \nfederal departments.''\n\n  All the programs that exist today were started with good intentions. \nSome I have advocated and numerous others I have supported. All along, \nall of us have tried to do the right thing. But--what have they gotten \nus?\n  Today, our good intentions have gotten us burdensome regulations, \nunfunded mandates, and unwanted meddling. Parents, teachers, and local \nschool officials have less and less control over what happens in the \nclassroom. The myriad of federal education programs make the jobs of \nour school administrators and teachers harder than they should be. \nTeachers are taken of the task of teaching, preparing lesson plans, \ntaking on after school student activities and instead are researching \nfor grant opportunities, reading regulations, preparing applications, \nfilling out paperwork requirements, complying with cumbersome rules, \nand reporting on how they spend the little federal funding received. We \neven have teachers and administrators that decide that the little extra \nfederal funding is not worth the time and effort that it will take to \napply and comply so they do not even bother with the process. Instead \nof empowering parents, teachers, and local school officials we have \nempowered the federal government and bureaucrats.\n  We have slowly eroded the opportunity for creativity and innovation \non the local level and have established a system where supposedly the \nOlympians on the hill know what is best for the peasants in the valley.\n  Knowing where we now are, how can we afford to keep spending our \nfederal\n\n[[Page S4145]]\n\neducation dollars in the same way we have been doing for years if it is \nnot simulating academic success for our children? We can't. Not only \nwill I not stand for it, but parents, teachers, school boards, \ncommunities, and businesses cannot afford to stand for continued \nlackluster performance and failure in some cases.\n  The President's education plan and S.1 are huge steps in the right \ndirection recognizing that the answer to improving public education \ndoes not lie within the Halls of Congress or in the granite buildings \nof the downtown Washington education establishment. As an editorial \nfrom one of my homestate newspapers, the Southeast Missourian stated, \n``The answer to fixing America's educational woes rests with individual \nschool boards and passionate educators. The bureaucrats must reduce the \nred tape and mandates that are strangling our schools. Give those who \nknow best the time, talent and incentives to finally fix public \neducation.'' I agree with what the Southeast Missourian said.\n  The President's proposal and S. 1 stress high academic achievement \nfor all students so the achievement gap that exists will erode. The \nlegislation stresses the importance of literacy and making certain our \nchildren can read. We know that reading is a basic, essential, and \nfundamental tool for personal growth and self-sufficiency. Reading \nprovides the foundation for all other learning and eventually for \nproductive employment. Accountability, as well as flexibility, are \nincorporated in the Bush plan and S. 1 to ensure that the needs of the \nindividual child and school can be addressed while also ensuring that \nour tax dollars are resulting in academic success. Finally, one of the \nmost important aspects from my perspective--advocation for increased \nparental involvement. It is very simple and well documented. Children \nwhose parents are involved in their education from the very beginning \nare more successful in school and score higher on tests. Parents are a \nchild's first teacher, and we can do things to help them be better \nteachers.\n  Parental involvement, especially as it relates to early childhood \neducation, is something that everyone has heard me talk a lot about, \nand they are going to hear more about it.\n  There is bipartisan recognition that we must try something new to \nimprove our public education system. My dear friend and colleague, the \nSenate leader from the other side of the aisle, Senator Byrd, said the \nfollowing on the Senate floor in the 105th Congress:\n\n       . . . when one goes the last mile of the way and concludes \n     from what he sees, from what he hears, and from what he \n     reads, concludes from analytical reports about public \n     education that we are not doing well, that there is something \n     working, then it seems to me that, in the interest of the \n     public schools system, we may have to try a little different \n     approach, else the confidence of the American people in that \n     system and the support of the American people for that system \n     are going to erode. We see that happening.\n\n  From all the newspaper articles, television reports, letters to the \noffice, et cetera, we know that the American people want more, demand \nmore, and deserve more when it comes to public education. Let's put \npartisan rhetoric aside, let's move past the squabbling, and let's move \nforward on our common goal. Let's get on with our business. Let's have \nour votes. We want to be a positive contribution to educating our \nchildren for a lifetime of achievement.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the next 30 minutes of \npostcloture debate be equally divided between the majority and minority \nparties and the time deducted from each Senator as provided under rule \nXXII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise to speak again on the \neducation bill that I hope will be before the Senate very shortly. We \nhave been talking about this bill off and on for 2 weeks. It is time \nfor the Senate to get down to the real debate.\n  Let us bring the bill forward, propose amendments, let everyone have \ntheir say, and send a bill to President Bush he can sign. We have the \nopportunity in this debate to change the course of public education in \nthis country, and I believe it needs changing.\n  We have seen year after year, in the last 25 years in this country, \nmore spending going into public education from the Federal level but \nnot improvements in the overall education of our children. I do not \nthink throwing more money at education is the only answer. We are going \nto put more money into education, but we are going to do it in a \nreformed education system. In fact, we need to shake up the system.\n  We have some very good public schools in our country, but we don't \nhave a uniform standard of public schools where we can say all of them \nmeet the test of giving every child the chance to reach his or her full \npotential with a public education. That should be the standard. We must \nbe able to help each individual child learn in the best way that child \npossibly can, if that child is going to reach his or her full \npotential. That is exactly what we are trying to do with the bill we \nhope to bring up soon.\n  I will talk about a couple of amendments I want to include in the \nbill that are not included now. One is to help bring more good teachers \ninto the classroom. Every Member knows of a teacher shortage in a \npublic school in their area. Rural schools have problems, urban schools \nhave problems getting qualified teachers in some of the core subject \nmatters, and especially math and science are lacking in qualified \npublic teachers.\n  We are trying to add some creativity into the process by giving \nincentives to school districts to bring more people into the teaching \nprofession. We must be a partner with the States. It is the States that \nset the salaries and the benefits and the hours for the teachers. That \nis first and foremost what needs to be improved. I don't know of one \npublic school teacher making enough money--not one. Not even in our \nbest public schools are teachers making what they are worth. Our \nteachers should be making what our major corporate CEOs are making. \nWhat they are doing is more important than what any corporate CEO could \npossibly do. They are determining if our democracy is going to stay \nintact. We should pay them more. Most States are trying to do that.\n  My home State of Texas is in its legislative session now and they are \nlooking for ways to augment what teachers are paid, as well as benefits \nfor teachers. I imagine most States are trying to do it because I think \nwe all agree, public school teachers are not being paid what they are \nworth.\n  We can do more at the Federal level where we can't set the salaries \nand we can't set the hours and we can't set the school days. We can be \ncreative. We can reach out, and we have done so, as in the Troops to \nTeachers Program which would go for the many wonderfully qualified \nmilitary personnel who are retiring, sometimes at the age of 40, 45. \nThey are looking for a second career. We want them to go into teaching. \nMany of them have skills where there are teacher shortages.\n  For instance, a military person is fluent in French, Spanish, \nChinese, or Japanese. We have schools all over our country that cannot \nteach these courses because they don't have qualified teachers. We are \noffering incentives for alternative certification to get those people \ninto the classrooms in their areas of expertise, although they don't \nhave educational certification or educational degrees.\n  Someone has a math degree, but they didn't get an educational degree. \nHowever, they are very qualified to teach math. Why not give them an \nincentive to come into the classroom and teach the area in which they \nare expert?\n  My amendment will be called careers to classrooms. It is modeled \nafter the Troops to Teachers Program. It says to a retiree of a \ncomputer firm, perhaps one of the wonderfully successful computer firms \nthat has done well and the person can retire at the age of 40, 45, 50, \nor 55, if they would like to do something else, they are not ready to \nretire, why not encourage them to teach computer skills to our young \npeople in the classroom by offering an incentive for an \nalternative certification for that\n\n[[Page S4146]]\n\nteacher to be able to come into the classroom with a minimum of hassle, \na minimum of bureaucratic red tape. Let's break the red tape. Let's get \nthe qualified people into our classrooms, targeting the schools that \nhave teacher shortages--rural schools and urban schools.\n\n  My careers to classrooms amendment will be just such an incentive \nthat we hope will reach out to more teachers or more potential teachers \nand bring them into the classroom and enrich the experience of the \nyoung people in the classroom.\n  The second amendment I am planning to offer, along with Senator Susan \nCollins, with the help of Senator Barbara Mikulski and others, is the \nsingle sex option for public schools. I believe if our public schools \nare going to compete, we are going to have to give every option to \nparents. Many parents can afford to send their children to private \nschools. So they have their young girl attend a girls' school, or their \nboy attend a boys' school.\n  However, if you go to public schools or you cannot afford to send \nyour children to private schools, you probably don't have that single \nsex option. It has proven, time and time and time again, some young \npeople at certain ages, usually in that junior high school to high \nschool age range, and not later than elementary school, some young \npeople do so much better in a single sex atmosphere. It was found girls \ndo better in math in a single sex atmosphere in those age levels. It \nwas found that rowdy boys do better in a single sex atmosphere, \nparticularly in an urban setting.\n  Why not allow parents the options? We are not talking mandate. Many \nparents prefer to have their children in coeducational schools. Some \nparents might want to give a special needs child that single sex \natmosphere. They can't afford to send their children to private \nschools, so why not let them have the option of going to their school \nboard and saying they would like to have a single sex math class in the \nfifth grade in the elementary school. Why not give them the option? We \nwant to take away the barriers being put in front of the parents, \nputting schools in fear they may be sued if they have a single sex \neducational opportunity.\n  There would be a requirement for a comparable opportunity for young \npeople of the other sex. That is fair. We want that to be allowed, \nalso.\n  We want to offer all the options a parent could possibly have if the \nparent had the opportunity to go to parochial schools or private \nschools for their children. We want those options to be available in \npublic schools. I will offer the single sex amendment to this bill \nbecause I want to grow the opportunities; I don't want to kill them. I \nwant public schools to be the best.\n  I always like to proudly say I am a total product of public schools. \nI grew up in a small town of 15,000. I went to public schools. I \ngraduated from the University of Texas and the University of Texas Law \nSchool. I want every child to have the same opportunity I had. I want \nevery child to be able to go to public school and compete in any arena. \nI have competed in debates, I have had opponents who have had a \nwonderful Harvard education, and I won. I couldn't have done that \nwithout the quality public education.\n  I want every child to have the same opportunity I had so that young \npeople with private school degrees and public school degrees will have \nthe equal opportunity to reach their full potential.\n  Madam President, the choices are what make our country great. The \nbasis we must provide is quality public education. I am excited about \nthe opportunity to reform education, and I am excited about the \nPresident's plan. I am excited about what Congress will be able to do \nto make sure that future generations have the quality public education \nthat has been the foundation of our democracy. That is what I want for \nevery child for the future in our country.\n  I hope we can get on to the bill. I think it is time. We have talked \nabout policy and all the priorities that we have for a long time--about \n10 days now. It is time for us to start amending this bill and going \nforward so we will have the winds of change in this country in public \neducation. I urge my colleagues to come together and make it happen.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. I ask unanimous consent I may speak notwithstanding the \nprevious agreement. If someone from the other side of the aisle arrives \nto the floor, I will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I rise to continue our discussion as we \nprepare to bring to the floor a very important bill that I believe \nrealizes the dream of the President of the United States, his campaign \npledge, the vision he has put forward of dramatically shaping and \nreshaping and modifying and changing Washington and the Federal \nGovernment's role in education.\n  We are at a unique time. I believe never before in this body, at \nleast in the history of the last 35 years since the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act was first enacted, have the American people, \nand their Representatives on both sides of the aisle, been so focused \non education, kindergarten through 12th grade, and the reform of \neducation so that we truly leave no child behind.\n  With that attention and that focus, come great expectations. I \nbelieve as a Congress we must seize that opportunity. We must work \ntogether, both sides of the aisle, to work with the President of the \nUnited States and take advantage of that opportunity to creatively \nimprove how the Federal Government addresses education and to answer \nthe question: What is the appropriate Federal role and how can we best \nleverage that Federal role to leave no child behind?\n  I spoke a little bit to that point yesterday. It was to get \nWashington out of the business. Remember, of the total amount of money \nspent on education for K-12 in this country, only 7 percent comes from \nthe Federal Government--from the taxpayer, I should say, through the \nFederal Government.\n  In my mind, it means we need to change that Washington role from one \nof regulator to one of education investor--to invest in education and \nto regulate only to the degree that we accomplish that goal of reducing \nthe achievement gap, of boosting the academic achievement of all \nchildren to make them more ready for the world they inherit. It comes \ndown to the concept of allowing innovation and creativity to address \nthe problems we have identified and then coupling the freedom to \ninnovate and create, the freedom to teach with measurable results, \nwhich clearly is a Federal role, to couple whatever requirements and \nassessments we place, mandates--yes, mandates--that we place in terms \nof testing and assessing that we attach to freedom and flexibility, to \nhave those measurable results.\n\n  We must continue, I believe, to cut the redtape, to cut the \nunnecessary bureaucracy that has resulted from a litany, a myriad of \nprograms that were all well-intended. They were Federal programs passed \nin this body over the last 35 years, but they have resulted in a \ncomplex network of overlapping responsibility in terms of the target \npopulation: excessive and confusing bureaucracy, and paperwork. We need \nto get rid of the overly prescriptive Federal mandates on the Federal \nrole in education, those mandates put on the floor, taken through the \nlegislative arena, and imposed on our communities. I believe it is our \nopportunity today to cut that red tape and remove those overly \nprescriptive mandates.\n  I think the result of our discussion and debate on this bill, once we \nare allowed to bring it to the floor, will result in innovation, in \ncreativity, all of which will translate, again, to leaving no child \nbehind.\n  One aspect of our bipartisan discussion of the last 3 months that I \nlook forward to talking more about at the appropriate time is what is \ncalled Straight A's, the Academic Achievement for All Act. That is why \nit is called Straight A's, which really in a demonstrable, optional way \nallows for a consolidation of a lot of the programs that we have \ninherited--given that\n\n[[Page S4147]]\n\nconsolidation of programs in funding all the way down to the State or \ndown to the district--and allows those funds to be used but attaches \nthem to demonstrable, measurable results of academic achievement.\n  This is, again, a demonstration program that hopefully will allow up \nto seven States to participate. They will have what is called a \nperformance agreement. In that performance agreement with the Secretary \nof the Department of Education and the administration, there will be \nhigh standards, high accountability, measurable results coupled with \nfreedom, with consolidation of programs so we can, with a performance \nagreement, link, to the maximum extent possible, flexibility and \nfreedom to innovate with measurable results.\n  I see we have other Members on the floor. As I said, by unanimous \nconsent I will be glad to yield the floor at this juncture and look \nforward to coming back and continuing a discussion of what is in the \nunderlying bill as well as what I hope will be added to the bill over \nthe course of the day as the language becomes available.\n  Madam President, I request recognition to briefly speak on behalf of \nthe leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Lincoln). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the next 60 \nminutes of postcloture debate be equally divided between the majority \nand the minority parties and the time be deducted from each individual \nSenator as provided under rule XXII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Tennessee.\n  Madam President, I rise today to speak about the landmark educational \nreform bill and plan we are currently debating, and in fact are \ncurrently negotiating, a plan that, I think, if it reaches its proper \ndrafting conclusion and, most importantly, is adequately funded, will \nspur bold changes and innovations in our public schools and will \nultimately help improve the quality of education for every child in \nConnecticut and every child in America.\n  It is premature at this moment to talk about this comprehensive \nlegislation with total certainty and in all of its details, so I intend \nto make a fuller statement about the bill once the negotiations are \ncomplete. But I did want to come to the floor today as we work out the \nfinal pieces of this complicated policy puzzle to offer both a few \ncongratulations and a few concerns about what I would call this \nimportant near agreement on reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  Let me start by saying how encouraged I am about the process we have \nfollowed for formulating this plan to reauthorize ESEA and its \nprospects for stirring a real revolution in our public educational \nsystem.\n  The discussions we have had over the last several weeks involving \nSenate Democrats and Republicans and the White House have been a model \nof how this place should work. There has been civility. There has been \nhealthy debate. There has been disagreement from time to time. But \nthere has also ultimately been a shared sense of common purpose. We \nhave had our disagreements--some of them profound--but the Members and \nour staff have negotiated in good faith and with good will. In doing \nso, I think we have demonstrated that we can find common ground on a \nconsequential issue and move this country forward as we do so. This can \nbe a real breakthrough given some of the rancor and division that have \nplagued the education debate too often in recent years.\n\n  I commend our leaders, my colleagues from both parties, the \nPresident, and representatives from the White House who participated in \nthese negotiations. I think we all want to realize the same goal, which \nis the best public educational system in the world. We all understand \nthat today we have significant challenges ahead of us if we are going \nto achieve that goal.\n  We all want to close the persistent achievement gap separating the \nhaves in our society from the have-nots. That is by far the biggest \nhurdle I think we have to overcome. We all want to deliver on the \npromise of equality and opportunity for every child. We all want to \nincrease the supply of highly skilled workers, which we all know is \ncritical to our future economic competitiveness and the long-term \nprosperity and security of this Nation. Now, through the reforms in \nthis bill, we are not just talking the same points of principle; we are \nactually walking the same path to progress.\n  I am particularly encouraged and gratified that a number of the \nideals and ideas that Senator Bayh and I and so many other Members of \nthe new Senate Democratic coalition have been advocating for the past \nfew years through our three R's reform bill and that so many of these \nideas presented by the distinguished occupant of the Chair, and other \ncolleagues, are reflected in the historic agreement on a core \nbipartisan amendment to ESEA that we are very close to achieving.\n  As some of my colleagues know, we started out with the three R's bill \nwith the new vision of education policy, one that focuses not on \nprogress but on performance, not on rules and regulations but on \nresults, not so much on what we put into the system, although obviously \nthat is important, but ultimately on the real test, which is what we \nget out of the system. What are the results? How well are our children \nbeing educated?\n  We drew up a reform blueprint that translates these principles into \npolicies, calling for increased investments to help our public schools, \nhelp every child learn at a high level, for greater flexibility to \nallow the local educators to decide, as they know best, how best to \nspend their Federal dollars to meet the specific needs of their \nstudents, and also to encourage innovation and experimentation with \ndifferent educational reform models at the local level.\n  We have in this bill stronger accountability. That is the way we test \nthe results. That is the way we make sure we are not giving up on any \nchild in America and that we are going to take them to the highest \nlevel their God-given potential gives them to achieve in education. \nThat is particularly true of low-income and minority students. We \npropose this new equation, which we call invest in reform, and insist \non results, as a possible bridge to a bipartisan compromise.\n  Last year, President Bush went across a bridge of his own and \nembraced some of those same goals and values and articulated a similar \nreform plan for realizing them, and for encouraging and accelerating \nthe growing movement in many States towards standards and \naccountability--focus on results. What are our children learning?\n  This year, the President made that plan a legislative priority and \nsignaled his seriousness not just on the subject of education but on \nthe kind of educational reform that is embraced in our three R's bill.\n\n  It was focused on transforming the Federal Government into a catalyst \nfor change, on demanding results, and on no longer tolerating failure, \nso that this bill, about which we are now debating a motion to proceed \nand around which negotiations are continuing and coming ever closer to \na bipartisan agreement, builds on that common ground we have forged on \nthose critical innovative ingredients to the recipe of reform.\n  The centerpiece of the three R's plan and of the President's \nblueprint was a tough new accountability system that would reward \nStates in making real progress in meeting high standards while \nsanctioning those that did not and would require local districts to \ntake strong remedial action to fix chronically failing schools.\n  We are not going to sit back and let schools continue to fail to \neducate our kids. We are not going to continue to push kids ahead from \none grade to another just because a year has passed, regardless of \nwhether the school has taught them anything or whether they have made \nprogress.\n  This is a system that tracks the progressive reform that State \nleaders around America, including my own State of Connecticut, have \nalready implemented. It has proven effective.\n  I will say that in the negotiations that have gone on over the last \nfew weeks, we have had some differences on how to set those standards \nfor judging performance, which is to say, How do\n\n[[Page S4148]]\n\nwe define progress for our students? How do we strike the right balance \nbetween truly holding schools and States accountable for raising \nacademic achievement, and particularly closing the achievement, without \nsetting the bar so high that we end up grading most schools as failing?\n  We have worked through those problems over the last few weeks.\n  I want my colleagues to know that we have reached an agreement \ncertainly on policy on a reasonable and realistic middle ground. That \nagreement is now being drafted. Hopefully, we will have the opportunity \nto present it in this Chamber before very long. But it is a \nsignificant, real, and hopeful agreement.\n  While I would have liked, in some ways, to have made the provisions \nstronger, I have not given up hope of enhancing them in our discussions \nwith the House. I do think this agreement is suitably explicit and \ndemanding, as well as suitably fair, and will achieve our goal of \ndriving real change and bold reform. I hope soon to be able to share \nthe details of that agreement with our colleagues.\n  But as much as I appreciate this significant bipartisan achievement, \nI remain deeply concerned--as I believe almost all my colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle do--about one missing, indispensable ingredient \nto the recipe for genuine educational reform in America, and that is \ninvestment. It is clear to us that these reforms will not work without \na significant increase in resources from the Federal Government.\n  To date, the Federal Government supplies only about 7 cents of every \ndollar spent on public schools in America. Under the President's \ncurrent budget, we will not provide much more than that. Some would go \na step further and suggest we may, in fact, be setting up schools and \nchildren to fail if we do not back up the new demands for results that \nare in this bill--which we all agree are critically important--with new \ndollars to meet those demands. If that becomes the case, then we do not \nhave a system of genuine accountability; we have a system that sets \nstandards and does not help the local school districts meet those \nstandards.\n  We clearly recognize, of course, that money alone will not solve the \nproblems plaguing our public schools. Money will not spur innovation \nand lasting reform, and it will not streamline inert and inefficient \nbureaucracies. Money will not set high standards and hold schools \nresponsible for meeting them.\n  That is why we New Democrats pushed so hard in this bill to shift our \nFederal focus from process to performance, to streamline duplicative \nand ineffective programs, to accentuate the freedom of local teachers \nto innovate--they are the heart of our whole educational system--to \nhave principals enact reforms, superintendents to set new standards, \nand try new, bold ideas.\n  That is why we pushed so hard to recognize that we cannot have more \nblue ribbon schools without less redtape. And not least of all, that is \nwhy we who advanced the three R's bill decided that imposing real \nconsequences on schools and districts that chronically fail to educate \ndisadvantaged children is a necessary and critical element of a true \neducational reform proposal.\n  But we also recognize that money is a crucial part of the equation. \nWe simply cannot expect States and local districts to improve the \nquality of teaching and reduce class size to help every child--for \ninstance, an immigrant child to master English, to reconstitute \nchronically underperforming schools, and in particular to end the \nnational disgrace of having African American and Latino American \nchildren reading and doing math, on the average around our country, at \na level that is substantially below their fellow students in America's \nschools--if we do not substantially increase our investments in our \npublic schools. This is something most Americans recognize, which is \nwhy there is overwhelming support for significantly increasing our \nnational investment in education.\n\n  At home, in conversations I have had with people in Connecticut, and \nfrom public opinion surveys I read about American attitudes, it is \nclear that the American people put education at the top of their \npriority list, and sensibly so. The American people know you cannot \nbring millions of children, particularly low-income children who cannot \nread, up to grade level on the cheap. It cannot be done.\n  Consider a few specific examples, such as teacher quality. The \nreality is that we must hire, train, and ultimately retrain about 2 \nmillion new teachers over the next several years--2 million new \nteachers over the next several years.\n  The reality is, 95 percent of urban school districts are experiencing \na shortage of qualified math and science teachers and that 50 percent \nof new teachers quit high-need schools during the first 3 years of \ntheir teaching there.\n  The reality is, educational reform will not succeed if we do not \nprovide every child with a good teacher. Many people in our society do \nimportant work, but no one in our society today does more important \nwork than a good teacher. We learned that lesson in Connecticut, which \nhas invested millions of dollars--tens of millions, hundreds of \nmillions--over the last several years to raise teachers' salaries, to \nattract and train high-quality professionals, and develop a nationally \nrecognized mentoring program to nurture young teachers in their early \nyears in the profession. That has produced, I am proud to say, one of \nthe best teaching forces in the Nation. In turn, they have helped to \nproduce consistently high scores by Connecticut students on national \neducation tests.\n  The bill we are working on will push all of America in all of \nAmerica's school districts to take similarly strong steps to strengthen \nthe quality of their teaching force, setting a firm goal of having all \nteachers in the highest poverty districts highly qualified within 4 \nyears. But reaching that benchmark is clearly going to take a \nsignificant increase in funding for recruitment, retention, and \nprofessional development. We have an obligation--since we are making \nthese demands on the local school districts and on the schools and on \nthe teachers--to help States meet those high standards by giving them \nadequate financial resources to do so.\n  Also, consider title I, the heart of our traditional Federal focus on \ndisadvantaged children. Here again, the distinguished occupant of the \nChair, the junior Senator from Arkansas, and I have talked often about \nthis problem. It is real, from the cities of Connecticut to the cities \nand towns of Arkansas. The reality is that one-fifth of urban and rural \ndistricts, with 50 to 75 percent of their students living in poverty, \nreceive no title I funding today. It is hard to believe.\n  Title I was a program established 35 years ago to help disadvantaged \nkids, low-income kids. Yet today, I repeat, one-fifth of urban and \nrural districts, with 50 and 75 percent of their students living in \npoverty, receive no title I funding. That is, in good part, because we \ndo not target those dollars well with the formulas we are using today. \nThat is a shortcoming we are working very hard to fix in these \nnegotiations that are ongoing. But it is also because we are not \nproviding the resources--enough money--to fully serve disadvantaged \nchildren and carry out our responsibilities under the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  According to independent estimates, it would take $17 billion to \nfully fund title I, an increase of about 100 percent above current \nfunding levels. That is an annual number.\n  The accountability system we are working on now will help make title \nI a much more effective program for kids in high-poverty districts--\nwhether they live in Connecticut, Arkansas, or anywhere else throughout \nAmerica--requiring States and local districts to turn around \nchronically underperforming schools, empowering parents whose children \nare trapped in those failing schools with new choices and new options \nto help their kids get a better education, sanctioning States that do \nnot make progress in raising the academic achievement of disadvantaged \nstudents, and closing the gap between the haves and the have-nots.\n  Again, we cannot expect those interventions to succeed, those choices \nto be meaningful, or those sanctions to be fair if we do not invest in \nreform while we are insisting on results. That means infusing title I \nwith substantial increases in funding.\n  Unfortunately, the Bush administration has to date been unwilling to \nmatch their commitment to reform\n\n[[Page S4149]]\n\nthat we are so near agreement on with commensurate resources on which \nwe are still some distance from agreement. The President's initial \nproposal for ESEA programs included only a $700 million increase for \nthe next fiscal year and less than $500 million for title I. In the \nlast few days, the White House has increased that now to a total number \nof more than $2 billion. But this counteroffer is still far from \nsufficient to meet either the needs we have identified or the demands \nwe will place on America's schools with this legislation.\n  That is particularly hard to justify when we know that we are \nprojecting a $200 billion surplus for next year, $69 billion of which \napparently will be spent on the President's tax plan. That is almost 35 \npercent of the projected surplus next year for the tax plan and a \nlittle more than 1 percent for additional funding for education.\n  We can do better. Hopefully, together, as we have come some \nsubstantial distance on most of the critical policy issues facing \nAmerican education over the last several weeks in our bipartisan \nnegotiations, we can similarly close the gap when it comes to our \nremaining disagreement on resources to make reform real.\n  In the same spirit in which we have negotiated this agreement to \ninsist on results, we appeal today to the President to join us in \ninvesting in reform. We have a unique opportunity at this moment, and \nwe cannot afford to let it slip away. The truth is, we can afford to \ngive every child in America a quality education. That is our \nresponsibility and, if we do it right, that will guarantee that our \nfuture is brighter.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I wonder if the Senator would be good \nenough to yield for a question.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I certainly would.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. First of all, I commend the Senator for an excellent \npresentation and, more importantly, for all of his good work in the \npast weeks in helping move the process along and for the work that has \nbeen done in the past.\n  As the Senator spoke, one of the points he underlined was the need \nfor additional funding. As we understand funding, for the Senator from \nConnecticut and myself, we are talking about investments. We are \ntalking about investing in children and in their future and our \nNation's future. The Senator has made that case very effectively.\n  I join with the Senator from Connecticut in the importance of \ndeveloping the kind of blueprint which has been developed which we \nbelieve can really make a difference if it reaches out to the children \nwho are out there who need the assistance. One of the major struggles \nand one of the major battles has been over funding.\n  Yesterday, we saw the President and our Republican friends make the \nannouncement on the budget for this year and projected over future \nyears. In that budget, the negotiators found $1.35 trillion in tax cuts \nover the next 11 years. Yet they declined to find the funding which \nwould be necessary to support the amendment of our colleague and \nfriend, Senator Harkin.\n  As my colleague remembers, Senator Harkin, during the budget debate, \ninitiated an amendment that was passed with strong bipartisan support \nfor $250 billion for education over the life of the budget. That \nvirtually disappeared in these negotiations. That cannot be found. The \nposition of the Senate, which was bipartisan, and the majority, is \nvirtually eliminated.\n  I find it difficult. In looking over this budget and consulting with \nmembers of the Budget Committee and asking them whatever happened to \nit, it just disappeared. It virtually was eliminated. In that was the \nfunding, as the Senator remembers, for the expansion of Head Start \nPrograms. It had funding in terms of increased funding on title I. It \nhad additional programs in terms of child care support, the block grant \nprogram, other programs that were targeted on children and needy \nchildren.\n  We have been told in these conversations that we have had with the \nadministration: We are prepared to give some funds, some additional \nfunds for title I, but we are unable to make a commitment in future \nyears.\n  I notice in those budget figures that came out from the Budget \nCommittee, they are prepared to list for millionaires what the \nreduction of their inheritance tax will be in the year 2011. Here we \nhave, for the wealthiest individuals, a very clear roadmap about how \ntheir taxes are going to be reduced in 2011, but we can't get the \nadministration to commit that over the next 4 years they are prepared \nto allocate sufficient funds so that the benefits of this bill will \nreach the children who are qualified to benefit from the program.\n  Is the Senator from Connecticut troubled by that development?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Responding, if I may, to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, this Senator certainly is troubled by that.\n  Let me say, before I respond directly, what a pleasure it has been to \nwork with the Senator from Massachusetts on this bill. There is not a \nbetter lawmaker/legislator in the literal meaning of that word in this \nChamber than the Senator from Massachusetts. I have seen his talents, \nhis persistence, his knowledge, and his great skill as an advocate at \nwork. I have actually enjoyed the experience.\n  I thank him for his leadership. He has been responsible for \nsuccessive advances in the quality of life in our country, particularly \nfor our children. If we can bring this one to a conclusion, it will be \nyet another extraordinary accomplishment that he has led, working not \njust with members of this party but across the aisle and, in fact, with \nthe White House.\n  The numbers the Senator from Massachusetts cites are troubling to me. \nThey are particularly troubling today, as the two of us have said, \nbecause we have essentially reached agreement on the core issues \nrelating to this bill. Our staffs are drafting and we will meet again \nlater in the day, but this is a substantial accomplishment. It shows \nthat we have common purposes, and we can reach common ground across \nparty lines, across Pennsylvania Avenue, because what is on the line \nhere is the well-being of our children and the future of our country.\n  All of these agreements we have now reached and are drafting are just \nnot going to mean anything much unless we help the States and local \ngovernments and school districts meet the additional responsibilities \nwe are placing on them through this bill.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts has spoken about the amendment to the \nbudget resolution introduced by Senator Harkin, our colleague from \nIowa. It passed with bipartisan support. It took over $200 billion from \nthe tax plan, used it to pay down the debt, took a similar amount, over \n$200 billion, and asked that it be invested in education. This \nexpresses the concern across the aisle here in the priority placed on \neducation.\n  In that amendment, as I read it, over the 10 years there was \napproximately $100 billion of that money that was to go through the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act that we are considering now, \nabout $50 billion there for the first 5 years which we are considering \nas part of this authorization; therefore, $10 billion a year. That is \nwhat was voted by this Senate in a bipartisan vote.\n  Here we are with the President saying to us that the most he can do \nat this point, as I understand it, is somewhat over $2 billion. And \nwhile so much more next year--$69 billion--is being put into the tax \ncut, 35 percent of the projected surplus in the tax cut, 1 percent is \nin education. I agree with the Senator. It doesn't make any sense to \nsay we can't make a long-range commitment to the children of America \nfor their education, but we can, in the budget resolution, somehow make \na long-range commitment to the wealthiest taxpayers who, if I may say \nso personally, don't need the help as much as the children of America.\n\n  So the Senator is right. I say, again, when you think about the \nplenty that we have available to us, when you think about the strong \neconomy we have had for the last several years, and the restraint we \nhave shown at the Federal Government level that produces these \nextraordinary surpluses ahead, the likes of which we have never seen \nbefore, this all comes down to priorities and choices. How do we want \nto invest this money?\n  I say proudly, with the Senator from Massachusetts, who has been the \nleader, we want to invest it in our children's education.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the 30 minutes \nallotted to the Democrats has expired.\n\n[[Page S4150]]\n\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FRIST. Madam President, I want to take the next 7 or 8 minutes to \ncomplete the remarks I had begun 30 or 40 minutes ago. It really boils \ndown to this whole theme of a change, a change in the Washington \napproach to education, from kindergarten through 12th grade. That is \nvery much what I believe the underlying bill is all about. We recognize \nthat 35 years and $125 billion later, we have failed to accomplish the \noriginal goal of the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We \nhave not met that goal, that is we have not reduced the achievement gap \nbetween the served and underserved, or the advantaged and \ndisadvantaged, and we want to accomplish that, working together in a \nbipartisan way, under the leadership of President Bush and the \nprinciples he has laid out.\n  An important element of the President's plan is flexibility based on \nlocal identification of the problems and challenges facing schools \ntoday, coupled with strong accountability--accountability for the \ntaxpayer dollars that are being invested, accountability in exchange \nfor the freedom that we, through this legislation, will give local \nschools, teachers, school districts, communities and States in return \nfor measurable results.\n  As I mentioned, we must cut the red tape and get rid of the overly \nprescriptive regulations, which we know have not worked. We must change \nthe Washington approach, and transform the Federal role from that of \neducation regulator, which has not worked, to education investor, \nbecause we are investing in education, in policies that we know are \nsuccessful, in programs that work. We must not reward programs that \ndon't work by investing in them further.\n  Education investor versus education regulator. To me that's what it's \nall about.\n  One element of our education investment plan is a piece of \nlegislation called Straight A's. The formal name, of course, is the \nAcademic Achievement for All Act--a lot of A's in there, which is why \nwe call it Straight A's. That is an easy way to remember what it is all \nabout.\n  Ultimately, Straight A's addresses the fact that we know there is \nexcessive regulation out there--well-intended, but excessive. It \naddresses the fact that we know there are and hundreds of programs, \nagain well-intended, but programs that straitjacket our teachers to the \npoint that they can no longer teach because they are spending all their \ntime complying with federal law. Rather than teaching that individual \nchild face-to-face, they are doing paperwork.\n\n  Straight A's will free them up of that red tape, get those \nregulations off their backs, so they can do what we want them to do, \nwhat we'd like to hold them accountable for doing: teaching our \nchildren. Yes, it's what they want, but more importantly, its what our \nchildren need and deserve.\n  Today they do not have that flexibility.\n  Straight A's is an optional program. There is no school district that \nmust participate in this demonstration project if it chooses not to. \nThat is the way it is outlined and presented in the bill. It is an \noptional program, limited to just seven States. Even if there is a \ngreat demand, we will limit it to seven States. Personally, I would \nlike to increase the number of participation states, but in \nnegotiations we decided that as many as seven States would have the \noption of being freed from regulations if they agree to be held \naccountable for strong, measurable results.\n  Straight A's is not a block grant. We hear that, and it scares \npeople. Block grant means when you give money to a group of people en \nbloc instead of having a hundred different programs and saying the \nmoney has to be used for a computer or software or to hire another \nteacher. The idea is to give that money in the aggregate. This is not a \nblock grant program. It is a performance grant, linked to results. \nThere is strong accountability. It is not just giving the money away. I \nthink we have done that for too long. If you look at the last 35 years, \nwe have spent about $120 billion. And for that $120 billion we neither \nreceived nor demanded results.\n  What I think is great about this bill is that it provides both local \ncontrol and flexibility. Local folks receive the funds, they are held \naccountable for results, but how they use those funds is up to them.\n  Teachers in a classroom know what they need. Is it a piece of \nsoftware? If so, they can use the money for that. Is it a new computer? \nIf so, they can use the money for that. Smaller class size? Those \nthings are best determined by an individual school or perhaps an \nindividual subject area of a school. Why should we be dictating that \nfrom above when local schools, teachers or parents can make those \ndecisions and participate in the process?\n  It might be that this money could be used for reducing class size or \nimproving technology, or hiring better teachers. I can also be used for \nteacher development. If, for example, a teacher does not feel qualified \nto teach in a certain area, that money, available for the first time, \ncan be used for teacher development, to ensure that every child in this \ncountry is given the opportunity to be in a safe classroom, drug-free \nclassroom, with an excellent teacher at the head of that class.\n  So, this is not a block grant, it is a performance agreement. \nAccountability is part of that agreement, it is written in. You will \nhear a lot about accountability, accountability and high standards, \nbecause we all feel very strongly that boosting student achievement, \nreducing that achievement gap, is the essence of accountability \nmeasurement.\n  For this increased flexibility we have built even higher standards of \naccountability. We have very specifically addressed the idea of \ntargeting both for the title I component and the title II component. An \nelement of targeting is written into the bill, and the demonstration \nproject, to ensure that the money goes to the people who need it the \nmost.\n  Today, States, localities, and school districts are the engines of \nchange. Not Washington. We are locked into a system where change is not \nallowed. That is the sort of reform I am very hopeful we will be able \nto debate and put forward. We want to support that engine of change \nthat is going on in States all across America. We want to encourage it, \nmake it possible, because there are teachers out there who care, who \nwant to teach, who will teach, if we get rid of the bureaucracy.\n  We have parents who care, nobody cares more about children than \nparents. But right now, they have little in the way of choice, very \nlittle power to direct resources. We talk about supplemental services \nand how important they are so parents can have some element of choice, \nsome way to direct their taxpayer dollars in a direction that will \nbenefit their children.\n  This is very different than the current system. That system over the \nlast 35 years, involved always thinking up new programs, and funding \nthose programs--usually inadequately--hoping it would do some good. So \nthat now we have hundreds of programs each with their own bureaucracy, \neach their own requirements, each inadequately funded, and all of which \nhave resulted in the failure we see today.\n\n  I just want to share with my colleagues what the Chicago school \nsystem officials--again, this is not partisan--reported to the task \nforce on education that we conducted in the Budget Committee under the \nleadership of Senator Pete Domenici. Those officials from the Chicago \nschool system extolled the virtues of flexibility and credit much of \nthe success they have seen in Chicago to this increased flexibility. I \nquote:\n\n       We know the system and we believe we know the things that \n     it needs to have in order to improve. So the more flexibility \n     we have with Federal and State funds, the easier it is to \n     make those changes.\n\n  It makes sense. People at the local level can best identify those \nneeds. So we need to free up, get rid of those unnecessary regulations \nwhich have tied their hands, that have prevented them from boosting \nstudent achievement and reducing that achievement gap.\n  We will have time, hopefully, in the next several days to continue \nthe discussion of this concept of flexibility, accountability, and \nlocal control. I appreciate the opportunity to share with my colleagues \nthis concept of Straight A's which will be a part of the underlying \nagreement by allowing greater flexibility, coupled with those demands \nof achievement.\n  Washington will become, not the education regulator, but the \neducation investor.\n\n[[Page S4151]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee \nfor his leadership in the area of education. We do have an opportunity \nto reform the system. What Senator Frist was discussing on the issue of \naccountability is the key. We can pass all the laws in the world. We \ncan pass all the regulations that fill the books, but if we do not have \naccountability, it will not work.\n  We know that because it has not worked so far. We have poured in more \nmoney. We have tried to give mandates; we have given them red tape; we \nhave given regulations; but that has not helped.\n  What we need to do is have accountability. We need parents, teachers, \nand principals to work together to determine what is best in any \nparticular area. Then we need to test to see if it is working, not so \nwe can point fingers. We need to test so we can identify weaknesses and \nstrengthen those weaknesses. That is the difference.\n  We have 15 more minutes of our time, but I understand the Democrats \nwould like to start a little early. I ask Senator Sessions to take up \nto 10 minutes, and then we will allow the Democrats to take the rest of \nthe time until we determine the next amount of time that we will have \non the subject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak. \nI thank the Senator from Texas for her steadfast leadership and \ncommitment to education. She has been a stalwart on these issues and \ncares about them deeply.\n  I also appreciate the leadership on the Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee of Dr./Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee. He is one of \nthe champions for doing something different this time.\n  Yes, we have the largest increase in spending percentagewise in \neducation than any other budget item, but that is not what is so \nspecial about our education debate today.\n  Our debate today is about children. Our debate today is about making \nsure what we do furthers not just a system that has not been as \neffective as it should be, but actually furthers learning. That magic \nmoment in a classroom when a child and teacher come together and \nlearning occurs is what it is all about. Nothing else really counts.\n  When you visit schools as I have for the last year, 25 or more \nschools around the State, and talk to teachers, principals, and \nsuperintendents, and you hear them express their deep frustration at \nthe burdensome strings that are attached to the Federal Government's \neducation funding. The Federal Government only makes up about 10 \npercent of education spending--90 percent of it is funded by the State, \nand well it should be. States have always been the primary engine of \neducation in America. The Federal Government does not need to take \nover.\n  I do not think there is anyone who will stand up and defend a major, \nmassive Federal takeover of education in America, but we are paying a \nsubstantial sum of money. We spend $125 billion improving the education \nof low-income children, trying to narrow the gap, and it has not \nworked.\n  What do you learn when you talk to the teachers and principals? They \nare frustrated. They tell me the paperwork is substantial; the \nregulations are burdensome; the money they get can only be used for \ncertain programs which may not be programs they need in their school, \nand they cannot use the money for things they think are important and \nwould improve learning in their school system.\n  They tell me the Federal Government--and I spend a lot of time \ndealing with this issue--is creating mandates under IDEA. School \nofficials are not able to discipline children with disabilities who are \ndisrupting a classroom. They must keep them in the classroom day after \nday, even though the child is not benefiting from being in the \nclassroom and even though that child is disrupting the other children \nin the classroom.\n  I started in recent months to ask teachers, Which would you rather \ndo: Take the 10 percent from the Federal Government or let them go away \nand run the schools the way you want to run them?\n  You would be surprised how many say: Take your money and leave us \nalone. That is shocking. I am not sure they really meant that, but \ntheir hands went up when I asked that question. It reflects a deep \nfrustration that we are not being good partners in this deal.\n  How do these programs come about? How have we ended up with 700 \nFederal education programs in America? It is something like this: Some \nState develops a good idea for an education program. A Senator or \nCongressman hears about it. He thinks it is popular and would be \npopular back home if he authored a bill to fund that kind of program \naround the country, and program after program gets adopted over the \nyears.\n  Some are good, some not good. Some may have been good 15, 20 years \nago, but are not good today. Some of the programs are successful, and \nmy colleagues have to understand that some of those special programs \nwere successful because the teacher who ran it was special, and they \ncould make certain things happen in a way that cannot be replicated \nwith a teacher who does not have that passion to run that particular \nprogram. So we created all these systems.\n  We send the money and say: You can only use it for this science \ninstruction, this reading instruction, this math instruction. It has \nburdened our school systems and has not created as much good will as we \nwould like.\n  I believe our legislation today is a big step in the right direction. \nThis legislation is designed to provide a way to give schools more \nmoney with less strings in return for accountability.\n  Many Senators have talked about accountability. It seems to me they \nhave a misconception of what accountability actually is. They seem to \nthink accountability is when somebody spends Federal Government money \nprecisely, exactly as written in a rule book. They think that if they \nspend it that way, that is accountability, even though learning has not \nbeen improved one bit.\n  The growing consensus, I think, is bipartisan. Our bill came out of \nthe committee almost unanimously. We believe accountability means \nfinding out if the children are learning. Have they benefitted from the \ninstruction or are they falling behind? We must look at those test \nscores and make sure they are brought up to speed. We must ask what can \nbe done, at the earlier grades, to identify when children are falling \nbehind? We must not let even one child fall behind.\n  When the Secretary of Education, Dr. Paige, was in Houston, he \ndoubled the number of students passing the basic Texas proficiency \ntest. Dr. Paige says if you love children and care about them, you will \ntest them and find out if they are keeping up. If they are not, and you \nlove them, you figure out a way to help them do better. He did that in \nHouston. Some say he got a lot of extra money to administer these \ntests, but he did not. The third or fourth year he picked up bit extra, \nbut in 5 years he doubled the test scores mainly through changes in \npolicy by doing things differently, with the passion to achieve. If \nschools in his system were not conforming, he confronted them, and \nfixed them. He did not let continue to fail.\n  In Alabama we have an excellent State superintendent of education and \nsome wonderful schools and magnificent teachers. The new superintendent \nbelieves in testing. He has been testing for some time, and test scores \nare moving upward. Some say the tests in Alabama may be the most \ndifficult in the Nation. Students cannot get a degree if they do not \npass the basic proficiency test, and the test scores are moving up. If \na school allows children to move to a higher grade without learning, \nthe State superintendent can take over the school system and fix it. \nThe State is putting a lot of money into this testing, and we need to \nknow it is being spent well.\n  Let's get out of the business of micromanaging schools. Let's make \nsure progress is being made, that children achieve, that the school \nsystem is not leaving children behind, that they are not being \nabandoned, are not given up on. Because when children reach the ninth \ngrade, still unable to read, unable to do basic math, they drop out of \nschool with no prospects for any good economic future.\n\n[[Page S4152]]\n\n  We can do better. Every child may not be able to handle advanced \nmathematics and the high sciences, but most children are able to do the \nbasic reading, writing, and mathematics necessary to be successful in \nAmerica today.\n  Some complain about tests, calling it punishment, a way to categorize \nor stigmatize a child. I don't see it that way. Neither does Dr. Paige \nwho believes it is part of a good education. The way to teach is to \nfind out how children are learning and progressing. When we know what \nthey need, we can do it better. I think it is the right thing to do.\n  First, we want the States to conduct the tests. We encourage them to \ndevelop tests that fundamentally are fair and objective. If a test \nfocuses on basic reading, basic math, basic science, and students are \ntested on those things, how can anyone complain if a teacher teaches to \nthe test? Isn't that what we want? Don't we want to make sure that the \nbasics are not being overlooked in the classroom?\n\n  I am excited about the possibility today that, across the Nation, we \ncould achieve a fraction of the progress that our Secretary of \nEducation achieved in Houston.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Will the Senator yield?\n  The distinguished Senator from Alabama mentioned Rod Paige was the \nsuperintendent of schools in Houston before he became Secretary of \nEducation. What struck me most about Rod Paige's attitude was that he \nwanted testing. He wanted parents to have a choice. He wanted parents \nto be able to send their children wherever they thought they could get \na better chance. He was open to it. Because he was open, the public \nschools ended up winning the competition. More students came into \npublic schools rather than into private schools because he said, I want \nparents to have the freedom.\n  He has had the experience at the grassroots level. He is not somebody \nreading about it out of the book. He has been there. He had a troubled \nschool system, and he turned it around by seeking creativity, by \nseeking openness, by seeking choice, by seeking more opportunities for \nparents, because he wants parents to know they are getting the very \nbest chance for their children.\n  That is what struck me about Rod Paige's style of leadership.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I agree. That is precisely the way I feel. To hear him \ntalk with such compassion and concern and determination was exciting.\n  His advice was, ``[If we don't care about a child, we will let them \njust go along and we won't find out if they are falling behind.]'' What \nhappens if we don't test? A child will be left behind.\n  He deeply believes in President Bush's vision that no child should be \nleft behind. The Houston example is perfect.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent the period for postcloture \ndebate be extended until 4:40 p.m. with the additional time equally \ndivided between the majority and the minority parties, and the time be \ndeducted from each individual Senator as provided under rule XXII.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Crapo). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. CORZINE. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the importance of \nadopting legislation to expand and improve the Federal Government's \ncommitment to education. In my view, there is no more important issue \nbefore the Congress than how we deal with education. As our economy \nbecomes increasingly global, based on high technology, its future is \nincreasingly dependent on the quality of our workforce.\n  The better our educational system, the stronger our economy and our \nNation will be. That is why as a nation we should make education our \nnumber-one priority.\n  Let me begin by saying our current educational system, while it has \nmany faults, does have real strengths. Today, throughout our Nation, \ndedicated teachers are working long, hard hours to educate our \nchildren. Often they get little public recognition and acknowledgment \nfor their contributions. Almost always, they are paid much less than \nindividuals educated similarly can earn in the private sector. I know \nbecause my mother was a teacher for 30 years, my wife for 7.\n  We have an incredible commitment to teaching from folks across the \ncountry. We should start this debate on education by saying thank you \nto these teachers. They deserve our appreciation and our support.\n  Of course, while our Nation is fortunate to have so many dedicated \nand selfless teachers, the fact remains our educational system still \nhas serious problems. Too many of our schools are dilapidated, ill-\nequipped, and unsafe.\n  During the recent recess I visited schools in Jersey City, NJ, that \nwere 100 years old or older. There are still too many children in too \nmany classes that are not up to the latest standards. Too few schools \nare at the cutting edge of new technologies and new approaches, and \nmediocrity continues to be tolerated in too many of our school systems, \nwithout the accountability necessary to improve performance.\n\n  Some have suggested that local school boards should be left alone to \nsolve these problems on their own. I disagree. I do support local \ncontrol of education. It is fundamental in America. But local control \ndoes not mean much if you don't have adequate resources within your \ncontrol. And it's not enough to leave the problem to states, which can \npit urban areas against suburban communities--a fight with no winners.\n  Common sense makes clear that a property-tax-based financial system \nfor our public education leaves unequal education rampant in our \nsociety.\n  No, if we are serious about education, we need to make it a national \npriority. We need to ensure that our national government plays an \nactive and aggressive role, making sure every child has access to \nquality public education.\n  Our public schools can not assure equal outcomes in life, but they \nshould provide equal opportunity.\n  I am optimistic that we can make that happen, and that we will soon \npass a strong bill that addresses the most serious pressing issues \nfacing education today. I thank Senator Jeffords, Senator Kennedy, and \nthe many other leaders in the Senate for their tremendous bipartisan \nefforts to ensure we have an exceptional bill. These are true leaders, \nmaking sure our children come first. I want to do what I can to help \nensure their efforts are rewarded with passage in the Senate.\n  Today, I would like to take a few minutes to discuss some of the most \nimportant issues that I hope we will be addressing in the debate ahead.\n  First, let me mention some of the areas in which I think most of us \nagree. For example, I think we all agree that we need to promote \nparental involvement in education. It is common sense. That means \ngiving parents more information about their children's schools, and \ngiving them increased options in choosing among public schools. That is \nthe right thing to do, and I am glad these ideas have broad support.\n  I am also glad that we generally agree about the value of promoting \nliteracy. President Bush--and I compliment him for this--has proposed \n$1 billion annually for a reading first bill, and I applaud him for \nthat. We need to make sure appropriations follow the authorization. We \nneed to make sure we put our money where our mouth is, so we ensure \nthat all children can read by the end of the third grade.\n  Another area of broad agreement is the need to improve teacher \nquality.\n  A good teacher is probably the most important single factor in the \nquality of a child's education. We can do everything else right, but if \nwe do not have excellent teachers, the educational system just will not \nbe top drawer.\n  That is why it is critically important that we provide real resources \nto attract and retain quality teachers, and to help teachers develop \ntheir skills and create a career of teaching our children.\n  Unfortunately, there is a lot of work to do in this area. Last year, \nschools in high poverty areas hired 50,000 unqualified teachers, and \nonly 39 percent of teachers in these areas have an undergraduate major \nor minor in the primary field of instruction. That is not acceptable. \nAnd I am grateful that colleagues on both sides of the aisle seem to \nagree.\n  Unfortunately while there is much about education with which we can \nall\n\n[[Page S4153]]\n\nagree, there are also some areas of disagreement.\n  I'm especially concerned about the need to reduce class sizes. In my \nview, it is abundantly clear that smaller classes are better for \nchildren, and we have made progress in recent years. But we have not \ngone far enough.\n  That Jersey City school I visited, the average class size was 29--29 \nchildren. No one believes that is the right size to make sure that you \nhave quality education going on in the classroom.\n  It is abundantly clear that smaller classes are better for children \nand we have made some progress in recent years, but we have not gone \nfar enough.\n  The Bush administration in my view is walking away from the class \nsize initiative. In my view, that's a serious mistake. I look forward \nto working with Senator Murray and my other colleagues to secure \napproval of an amendment to reduce class sizes later in the debate. We \nought to move that down to 18 per class.\n  I am also disappointed that the administration has failed to address \none of the most compelling needs in education: the need to modernize \nour schools. Mr. President, 14 million children now attend schools that \nneed major renovations, like fixed heating and plumbing systems. \nNationwide, school construction needs total more than $127 billion. The \nproblem is worse in our cities, where two-thirds of the schools--\nserving 10 million students--report problems. In my State of New \nJersey, 87 percent of schools report a need to upgrade or repair a \nbuilding; one in six say that the effort will require between $1.7 \nmillion to $30 million. The average age of all New Jersey school \nbuildings is 47 years, compared to the national average of 35 years. \nThat is why in New Jersey, we have begun a $12 billion funding program \nto modernize our schools. I believe the Federal Government should be a \npartner in that effort.\n  Despite the size of these needs, the Bush administration is proposing \nto eliminate virtually the entire school construction program that \nmeans higher taxes at the local level. That would be wrong. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to protect the program, and \nincrease our commitment to school modernization.\n  We have heard a lot of rhetoric lately about the need to ensure that \nno child is left behind, and about the need for school reform. But, at \nleast until now, Congress simply has been unwilling to put our money \nwhere our mouth is. Whether we do now may be the most important issue \nof all.\n  There may be broad support for increased testing in our schools. But \nit does no good to diagnose a problem if you lack the resources to \ntreat it.\n  I have heard in the last few hours that even in the conference \ncommittee on the budget we have now dropped the Harkin amendment, \nputting $225 billion over 10 years into supporting our school system. \nThis is a mistake. We need to put money where we want our priorities to \nbe--and our children should be that.\n  If we want to reform schools, we need to provide them with real \nresources. I would highlight, in particular, the title I program, which \nfocuses funds on areas with the greatest needs. Title I can and should \nbe the real engine for reform. Yet today we are meeting only one-third \nof related needs. And that is just not good enough. My own State \nstruggles to cover the costs of implementing parity in education for \nthe school children in our Abbott Districts--urban districts, the \neconomically deprived. Especially given our historic surpluses, is not \nthe time to leave behind the children from low-income families who need \nour help the most. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \ndramatically increase our commitment to the critical title I program.\n  I also want to take a few moments to discuss an issue of particular \ninterest to me: teaching students the basic principles of financial \nliteracy.\n  Unfortunately, when it comes to personal finances, young Americans do \nnot have the skills they need. Too few understand the details of \nmanaging a checking account, for example, preparing tax returns or \nusing a credit card. A recent survey by the non-profit JumpStart \nCoalition for Personal Financial Literacy revealed the extent of this \nproblem, finding that only 36 percent of surveyed high school students \ncould correctly answer basic personal finance questions, and only 33 \npercent of students believed that financial issues strongly impacted \ntheir daily lives.\n  In my view, it is time to make sure that our education system teaches \nour children all the skills they need, including the fundamental \nprinciples involved with earning, spending, saving, and investing.\n  These skills will help them stay out of debt and maintain a good \ncredit record, save money for the future, and negotiate an increasingly \nexceedingly complex financial system.\n  I filed an amendment that would include financial education in S. 1, \nand I am very fortunate to have the support of my colleagues, Senators \nEnzi and Akaka. I am hopeful that, working together, we can ensure that \nour next generation is prepared to meet the challenges of the new \neconomy.\n  In conclusion, I again thank Senators Jeffords and Kennedy for their \nremarkable leadership on this legislation. I look forward to working \nwith them and with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make a real \ncommitment to education in the legislation before us.\n  But we must put resources with reform. The stakes couldn't be higher \nbecause the future of our children and our Nation depends on it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. HOLLINGS. Mr. President, many in the Senate today have not seen \nthat much participation with respect to the education debate. I have \nfound out after 30-some years up here that you have to direct your \nattention to where you can do the most good. I am not on the Education \nCommittee.\n  Let me qualify. No. 1, 50 years ago I wrote a 3-percent sales tax for \npublic education in the State of South Carolina. We were trying to play \ncatchup ball with our sister State, North Carolina. They had passed \ntheirs in 1936, some 14 years ahead of us. They were getting the \nindustry in, and we were getting no investment whatsoever.\n  Right to the point, if somebody wants to attract an industry, don't \ntell me about the taxes, the highways, the climate, the rivers, the \navailability of water and that kind of thing. Get yourself good school \nbuildings and a school system.\n  So I venture to say of the six-person committee that I headed up, \nfive lost the election right after that.\n  But be that as it may, no one has put in to repeal that particular \nmeasure. It has been a saving grace in the sense that not only is it 3, \nbut we have now increased it to 5 percent, and we have embellished it \nwith technical training.\n  I immediately started to work the week after I was elected in 1948. \nThe superintendent of the schools in my hometown said, Fritz, I want \nyou to get in the car and I want to show you something. We went across \nthe river on the bridge on Christ Church Parish Road, and there was a \nbig square building of just one story with four sides and a roof and a \npot-bellied stove. It was November. There was a class in one corner, a \nclass in another corner, a class in the third, and a class in the \nfourth corner, and one teacher.\n\n  Those were the schools we had at that time for minorities in South \nCarolina. I have this to say for those who weep and wail about the past \n36 years, I have been putting money into education for the past 50 \nyears and it's still not enough.\n  Yes. I started an equalization of facilities with that sales tax. But \nwe have yet to perform the sort of catchup where we provide schools in \nrural areas, and those we have abandoned within the city, with equal \nfacilities as those in the wealthier suburbs.\n  I came to Washington with that bone in my craw, as the saying goes, \nand I put in a revenue-sharing plan. But in taking the plan around, I \nfound that I couldn't put it in just for education. That is what I was \nintent upon. If you can single out and target the program, I thought \nyou could get the support. But I was told no, you couldn't get the \nsupport unless you could get it back to the States for general \npurposes. They did not suffer the ills and needs of my great State of \nSouth Carolina.\n  So I put in on February 1, 1967, the first revenue-sharing bill, \nlater abolished in the 1980s, interestingly, from the standpoint of \nHoward Baker who\n\n[[Page S4154]]\n\nled the abolition, or repeal. He said we were just financing the \nGovernment and we should send money back to the Governors so they could \ntake the money and do with it what they wanted. So we were financing \nour opposition. We weren't financing education. We were financing our \nown education. We learned the hard way. So we did away with revenue \nsharing.\n  The next thing I got into was a tuition tax credit. I can see the \ndistinguished Senator from New York now talking about his Boston Latin \nschool. I had the assistance of the Senator from Arkansas, Kaneaster \nHodges. We fought that particular diversion of funds from public \nschools to private schools, and thereupon they fought the institution, \nthe Department of Education. We, along with President Carter, \nestablished the Department of Education. They wanted to, by gosh, avoid \nand oppose the Department of Education.\n  Then I have been on the floor, of course, with the vouchers and \ntrying to force those. But I had not paid good enough attention to the \ntesting and accountability debate until I started listening to the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota, Mr. Paul Wellstone, and now I \nknow we have to fight. He knows of what he speaks. He is not talking \nabout the pollster thing. That is the thing I resent and resist around \nhere, this entire operation--that it's pollster driven. The cardinal \nrule of the pollster is: Never take a position that divides the voters. \nDon't say you are for chairs and desks. Don't say you are against them. \nSay I am concerned about these chairs and desks; they trouble me. All \nthe Senators are running around, and they are all troubled. That is the \nnonsense we are engaged in.\n  But I take a poll, and everybody is for tax cuts. We have forgotten \nfrom whence we came. I am completely absolutely opposed to the budget \nsettlement of $1.235 trillion, plus the stimulus $1.35 \ntrillion, because I believe in paying down the debt, not increasing it.\n\n  But the polls do not do that. They ask you if you are for a tax cut, \nbut they do not tell you we are spending surpluses that do not exist. I \nwill bet anybody any amount of money, with any odds, that we will end \nthis fiscal year with an increase in the national debt. We have done \nthat each year, since Lyndon Johnson was President, for the last 30 \nyears.\n  But now comes education, and it is polled also: Accountability, \naccountability. Here is the crowd that says: We want to find out what \nis wrong. Heavens above, they come to government as if it begins with \nthem.\n  Senator Wellstone is really fighting the fight for the youngsters of \nAmerica, for the economic strength of America, and for its defense. The \nbest defense is an educated citizen. Do not give me all the toys--the \nOsprey: Jump, move forward, jump around, get in it, and kill everybody \nwho gets in it. I am not for these toys. I am for education. That is \nthe best defense.\n  Give me $225 billion; give me the Harkin amendment. That is what I \nwant. Give me the moneys to flesh out these programs that have worked. \nBut they come and say the programs have not worked. It is ignorance.\n  I say to Senator Wellstone, the Governors met in 1988. The \ndistinguished Governor from Arkansas got together with another \nGovernor, a Republican leader at the time, and they founded, so to \nspeak, Goals 2000. But President Bush would not put it in. Then when \nPresident Clinton got here to put it in, they fought it.\n  So I begin to wonder when they say: We don't know how the schools are \nperforming. Ha, they fought the Department of Education. They fought to \nprivatize all the public money for public schools with vouchers, \ncharter schools, tuition tax credits, any way they could, to destroy \nthe public support for public schools. And they come now and say they \ndon't know, when they fought Goals 2000.\n  We had testing in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1994. \nThey act as if we haven't heard of testing. We have testing coming out \nof our ears. But the polls say: Accountability; discipline, discipline, \nyes.\n  I say to the Senator, in relation to that discipline, I remember the \nmother who sent her little boy to school with a note for the teacher. \nIt said: Dear teacher, my boy Ivan is very sensitive. If he misbehaves, \nslap the child next to him. That is punishment enough for my Ivan.\n  They say: Discipline, yes. I am for accountability. We are going to \nfind out. Don't give me that stuff. Bug off. As my grandchildren say: \nGet a life.\n  We provide $7 of every $100 spent--or 7 cents for every $1 spent--on \neducation. We act as if we have invented education and all of a sudden \nwe are going to do something about it. One way or the other, we are not \ngoing to do much. But what we do that is working ought to be allowed to \ncontinue.\n  Specifically, we have the women's, infants, and children's nutrition \nprogram, which is not part of the education budget, but it is an \nimportant part of education. I worked with Senator Humphrey from \nMinnesota, a state where I worked on and wrote a book on hunger. I got \nwith him, and we put in the women's, infants and children's program. \nYou have 21 billion brain cells, and I have 21 billion brain cells, and \n17 billion of the 21 billion brain cells have developed in the first 5 \nmonths in the mother's womb. Without the proper nutrition in relation \nto the protein and the synthesis of the nerve cells during those first \n5 months, there can be as much as 20 percent less cellular development \nwhen that child is born, causing what we call organic brain damage. The \nchild can't function, can't assimilate. That has everything to do with \ntheir education, and yet WIC is not adequately funded to meet the needs \nof all those who are eligible.\n\n  They want to know what works. We have had mathematical studies \nconducted about the benefits of title I for the disadvantaged. For \nevery dollar we put in title I, the Government and society reap $7. For \nHead Start, it is $4. That works.\n  We are going to have this testing to find out who is failing and who \nis succeeding, but we are not testing the school building, we are not \ntesting the principal, we are not testing the school board, we are not \ntesting, really, the pupil.\n  As my distinguished colleague from Minnesota says, we are testing \nwealth. Why? Because the wealthy student--the one who starts his \neducation in a good pre-school and has books read to him, and \neverything else of that kind--by the time he's tested in third grade, \nhe has had 6 years of schooling. Without these advantages, a child has \nonly three years of schooling coming into the test. So you are testing \nwealth.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has educated this Senator. He has really \ngotten into things that mean something to this body and this country. \nWe are about to go the way--as I am convinced we are running up the \nnational debt, and we have interest costs of $1 billion a day--of \nhollering surpluses, surpluses, surpluses, when we have deficits, \ndeficits, deficits. That is their way of getting rid of the Government. \nAnd this is their way of getting rid of public education--anything to \nget rid of public education.\n  We have not really equipped our minority teachers, and yet they have \noutstanding schools here, there, and yonder. And then we have very poor \nones. We know. I read in the morning paper--I do not have to wait to \npass this bill--about schools that are practically closed. So they are \ngoing to take the test. And what are we going to find out? What we \nalready know. It is like taking a fellow who can't swim, who is \ndrowning 100 yards offshore, and throwing him a 50-yard lifeline. We \nhaven't made it all the way for Head Start, for title I, for all of \nthese measures. And then we are going to have the test to see whether \nhe can swim, while the poor fellow drowns. No. We ought to be realistic \nand look at what we know is there.\n  I campaigned all over the State of Texas. I have never forgotten it. \nIt was not the ``best little whorehouse in Texas,'' it was the best \nlittle poorhouse--poorhouse. The Rand Corporation agreed last year that \nTexas had failed to improve on key education points. I can get into \nthat debate on schools, but it isn't the point here. The point is, we \ndo not want to really find that 20 percent or a third of our schools \nare failures. You do not have to administer a test to see what the good \nschools are doing.\n  So what are we going to do about it? What are we going to do about \nit? Mr. President, nothing. We are going to talk. We are going to speak \nto the polls\n\n[[Page S4155]]\n\nand say in the campaign: I was for accountability. I am for \naccountability and I voted for testing.\n  The Senator from Minnesota and some of us others are going to have an \nextended debate on this issue. We have to educate our colleagues and \nget the support to kill the so-called accountability in its crib, the \naccountability they refused in Goals 2000 and earlier with the testing \nin the 1994 act. Now they act as if they have a discovery to identify \nthe problem--hit-and-run driving.\n  Yes, accountability, accountability, accountability. Ask them about \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. There are too many lawsuits when you \nbring a suit to get accountability. No, no, we are not for \naccountability. We have too many lawyers. Get rid of the lawyers. That \nis also in the polls. Kill all the lawyers, said Shakespeare in Henry \nVI. Accountability.\n  Unfunded mandates, where are they? They were jumping all over the \nplace 7 years ago on unfunded mandates. Now they are pell-mell down the \nroad. For what? The President has put in $320 million to cover an \nestimated $2 to $7 billion in costs over the 4-year testing period. I \nam concerned that the states will have to pick up a substantial part of \nthat cost.\n  We had the Governors. We had the local people say, heck, we know, we \nare there. It is amazing to me the distinguished President, who had \nbeen a Governor, acts as if he never has been in government before. He \nwould know that this would hackle every Governor, every school board, \nevery school superintendent, every principal. They know about testing. \nThey are trying to get the money. But, no, we have accountability. We \nhave unfunded mandates now, and right on down the road with a program \nthat can't possibly work. But it is only going to highlight the need, \nthey say, for vouchers.\n  The Senator from Minnesota has an amendment that fleshes out a \nprogram that works; namely to fully fund Title I before we proceed with \na testing mandate. You have to teach the course before you give the \nexam. The U.S. Congress has not taught the course. We haven't given \nstudents, in many instances, the building. We haven't given them the \nprofessional classroom teacher. We haven't given them the right size \nclass so that they can get the teacher's attention. We haven't given \nthem counselors, and they need counseling. We haven't given, of course, \nthe different courses and other assistance that we have all found, from \ntime to time, is very necessary. So we haven't taught the course, but \nwe are going to give them the exam. We are going to have \naccountability, and we are going to puff and blow and walk all around \non the political stump saying: I was in Washington and I told that \nWashington crowd that we had to have accountability.\n  I want them to come with the Patients' Bill of Rights, because that \nis what we have in the Patients' Bill of Rights, some accountability. \nIf they absolutely step aside, if they engage in malicious and reckless \nconduct, malpractice, then we can bring the suit. That makes them \naccountable. But, no, they are opposed to that kind of thing.\n  If the test shows schools are failing, we are not going to put up the \nbillions to improve schools. Instead, they are going to put on a full \ncourse drive for vouchers to $1,500. What is that going to do?\n  The real need is to get teachers' pay up. If I were king for a day--I \nran for the Presidency on this back in the 1980s--they laughed but it \nis still just as efficacious--I would increase teacher pay, because \nthat $36,000, the average pay of a teacher in South Carolina, doesn't \ndo the job.\n  But I go across the stage having made a graduation speech, and \nstudents approach me and say: Senator, I wanted to get into teaching, \nbut I couldn't save enough money with the pay to send my kids to \ncollege. We have a lot of dedicated teachers in the classrooms and a \nlot of great schools, but we are missing out on bringing in the \nfeedstock of that professional teacher because we are not paying \nenough. We are doing it on the cheap. We are doing it on the cheap, and \nwe know it.\n  But we are going to tinker around. We are going to have reading. We \nare going to have math and science, and we are going to have the size \nof the classroom. And we are going to build another building, and we \nare going to toy around with it to try the hit-and-run drive, to \nidentify with the problem but not solve it.\n\n  Begin at the beginning. Somehow let's get some revenue sharing with \nthe teacher out in that rural school or combat pay for the inner-city \nclassroom teacher. They deserve combat pay trying to keep law and order \nand act as a parent at the same time. The role of a teacher is just \nalmost unable to be performed in the sense that teachers can't get \naround to teaching because of the other particular duties at hand.\n  I will have plenty more to say when this measure comes up about \naccountability. Please spare the Senator here from all of these \nexpressions, the pollsters. Has anyone ever heard of a pollster being \nelected to anything? If they can find me a pollster who has been \nelected to office, I would like to find one. A pollster has never \nexperienced anything.\n  Here are some expressions. We have to give the child ``a real \nchance.'' We want to ``find out what works'' and so forth like that. We \nneed to ``increase flexibility.'' We need to ``reduce bureaucracy.'' We \nneed to ``empower parents.'' Come on. Don't give us all of that. \nParents are working day and night and the child is home and nobody is \nhelping him with his homework. And we know it. We don't need a test to \nprove it. Let's get away from all of this gamesmanship and polling \npolitics and really do something for public education in the United \nStates.\n  If they want a starting point, our distinguished friend from \nMassachusetts has led the way and held the line on public schools for \nthe years I have been up here. I have been glad to associate with him.\n  But I can tell you here and now, this is dangerous to come in and \nstart, under the auspices of accountability, testing from the third to \nthe eighth grade every student in all of America. They are going to \ncreate the very cost and the bureaucracy they want to get rid of and \nwaste money that is needed for teachers' pay. The ultimate is, of \ncourse, finding out that there are a lot of schools in need, and we \nknow where they are, and we are trying to get assistance to them. I saw \nit 50 years ago when I put in a county-wide millage for a school in \nAwendaw. You put in 100 mills property tax in that rural area, and you \ncouldn't build a lunchroom, much less a school. So as chairman of the \ndelegation, I put it in.\n  So don't give us these nebulous statements of flexibility and \nempowerment and all these buzz words around here. Let's give us some \neducation and test the Senate. That is where we ought to have a test. \nFind out if we have passed the test first. Have we really fleshed out \nthe women, infants, and children's program? Have we really fleshed out \nand supported 100 percent Head Start. Have we really financed title I \nfor the disadvantaged? Have we built school buildings so that students \ncan learn without the ceiling falling in on their heads or freezing to \ndeath? Have we done that? Give us the test first. Find out what we have \ndone.\n  Or have we regarded what we have already known to be the case, what \nthe Governors have come in with, Goals 2000? Have we responded to the \ntest that we prescribed with the flexibility they said they wanted? In \n1994, they wanted the States to be able to decide.\n  Have we passed that test? Give us a flunking grade, a zero--except \nfor the Senator from Massachusetts, the Senator from Minnesota, the \nSenator from Iowa, and some others, such as the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd. They have been out here working for education. \nBut there are only a handful of them who can pass the test if given to \nthe Senate itself. That is what I want to see. Cut out the pollster's \ngamesmanship and the campaigning and let's think not of our needs to be \nreelected, but the needs of the country to prosper and survive.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S4156]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I understand our time would start in \nabout 10 minutes. I am going to yield time to Senator Byrd, the time up \nto 4 o'clock, and then we will reclaim our time because we have \nspeakers coming at 4. So such time as he may consume, until 4, I yield \nto Senator Byrd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Texas yield time from \nthe Republican side to Senator Byrd until the hour of 4 p.m.?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield up until 4 o'clock to Senator Byrd, but I \nwould not want it to come from the Republican time if others come and \nwant to speak on the Republican time.\n  Mr. BYRD. If the distinguished Senator from Texas will yield, may I \nsuggest that I only take--I think we have 5, 6 or 8 minutes----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is 7\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. May I suggest that I take that amount of time now and make \na few remarks about Bob Schieffer. Then I will wait until 4:30. I could \nhave more time at that point, as I understand it.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the Senator for her efforts to accommodate me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this evening, politicians, celebrities, and \nnewscasters alike will gather to honor one of the most trusted \nreporters in Washington; namely, Bob Schieffer of CBS News. Bob \nSchieffer has gained a reputation as a man of integrity, an honest man, \na man who holds fairness and the truth in the highest regard.\n  Nothing better can be said about a politician, and certainly nothing \nbetter can be said about a news reporter. I will say that again about \nBob Schieffer. Mr. Schieffer has gained the reputation as a man of \nintegrity, an honest man, a man who holds fairness and the truth in the \nhighest regard. We will remember that Plato, while visiting with Hiero, \nwas asked, ``Why have you come here?'' Plato said, ``I am looking for \nan honest man.'' So we have one here--a man of integrity, an honest \nman, a man who holds fairness and the truth in the highest regard. Now \nthat is saying something in today's world. That is saying something \nabout a news man.\n  Bob Schieffer is a Texan who started in journalism as a reporter for \nthe Fort Worth Star-Telegram. He moved on to a local television station \nand then to CBS. For 20 years, Bob was the network's Saturday evening \nnews anchor. For the past decade, he has hosted ``Face The Nation'' on \nSunday mornings. He has called Sunday mornings the smartest time period \non television, saying, ``It is the last place on television where \npeople can lay out their ideas about things and discuss them at \nlength.''\n\n  Well, if Sunday morning is the smartest time period on television--\nthat is what Bob Schieffer says it is--I say another reason for that \nwould be that it is Bob Schieffer's time when he is reporting to the \nNation. He decries--as do I--the 30-second sound bite that has replaced \nthe true interaction between voters and public officials. One reason I \ndecry it, of course, is I am not very good at it. A 30-second sound \nbite--it takes me about that long to say hello or good morning.\n  Sitting in the anchor chair at CBS is a high responsibility, a high \nresponsibility, an important responsibility. It was the chair from \nwhich Roger Mudd and Walter Cronkite would report every night. It was \nthe chair in which Edward R. Murrow--perhaps the grandfather of in-\ndepth, thorough television reporting--hosted ``CBS Reports'' and \n``Person to Person'' and ``See It Now.'' Edward R. Murrow set the \nstandard. Bob Schieffer excels at meeting that standard.\n  There is no obstacle that cannot be overcome by the vigorous mind \ndetermined to follow truth. That seems to be the philosophy that guides \nthe work of Bob Schieffer. He follows the truth. He has a vigorous \nmind, and he follows the truth, he keeps after it. He does not invent \nthe truth. There is a difference in following and pursuing the truth \nand attempting to invent it. Bob Schieffer does not invent the truth, \nhe asks the questions. He asks the questions, but he does not assume \nthe answers. He listens and, from the answers he receives, we all then \nlearn.\n  Bob Schieffer once told an audience, ``Your trust is the greatest \nhonor I can receive.'' Now that says it all. I am not a news man, but \nif I were a news reporter, it would seem to me that that would be the \npith, the crux, the milk in the coconut. ``Your trust is the greatest \nhonor I can receive.'' We know that, as a general rule, the people of \nAmerica do not trust news people. They do not trust news reporters. \nThey do not trust the news media. They do not trust politicians. So Bob \nSchieffer said it well when he said, ``Your trust is the greatest honor \nI can receive.'' He can speak for me as a politician on that line also. \nThe trust of the people, he says, is the greatest honor he can \nreceive. That trust is well earned.\n\n  I congratulate Mr. Schieffer on his decade of service at ``Face the \nNation,'' and I look forward to watching him for many years to come. He \nis a man I trust.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I, again, thank the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia. I so appreciate the remarks he made about my friend, Bob \nSchieffer, and ``Face the Nation.'' I, too, have known Bob Schieffer \nfor a long time. He grew up in Fort Worth, TX. His brother and I served \ntogether in the Texas Legislature. I have known him and his family for \na long time.\n  There is not a more principled, fair person in the entire news media \nthan Bob Schieffer. I certainly appreciate the kind remarks made by the \nSenator from West Virginia. I know Bob Schieffer is very happy tonight, \ncelebrating the anniversary of ``Face the Nation.'' He has taken it to \nnew heights just by being a person who is trusted and respected by the \nAmerican people. Both Presidential candidates choosing Bob Schieffer to \nbe the moderator of a debate shows he is well regarded by Republicans, \nDemocrats, and Independents throughout our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/02/senate-section/article/S4156-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4156-S4158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  BETTER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED--\n                               Continued\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I want to talk about the education \nbill that is so important to all of us. We are hopefully very close to \nagreement on bringing the bill before the Senate.\n  We are all a little frustrated because we have been waiting for the \nbill for about 10 days. There have been a lot of negotiations.\n  There are some very key issues that need to be discussed, and I hope \nthey will be discussed in the open. I hope they will not be negotiated \naway. Reform is the key to success in education.\n  We are going to spend more money on education. In fact, President \nBush has put forward a budget that provides an 11.4-percent increase in \nspending in education. That is warranted because we do need to add \nemphasis to certain areas of public education.\n  What is going to determine success or failure is whether we reform \nour system, whether we make it accountable, whether we give parents the \nability to know what their children are doing and how they are doing. \nIf a child comes home with A's or B's and is promoted to the next \ngrade, and you, as a parent, find out 5 years later the child did not \nread at grade level, that is a failure in the system.\n  If a parent does not have the tools to find out if there is a \nweakness in the child's education, the parent is at a significant \ndisadvantage, and the child is doomed forever.\n  We need to make sure parents have the knowledge of how a school is \ndoing. A lot of people say we should not have tests. If we do not have \ntests, how will we have a benchmark? How will we know where the \nweaknesses are?\n  If we have tests, even if the test is not perfect, it will show a red \nflag and we will see the weakness. We can determine if the test is not \nright, if the failure is not real. At least we will check on it to make \nsure, but most of the time the failure is real.\n  If we catch the failure at third grade instead of eighth grade, we \nwill save that child's future. We will save that child's productive \nlife because we can make sure that every child can read at grade level \nin the third grade. If we do that, then every child will have the \nchance to absorb the rest of his or her\n\n[[Page S4157]]\n\neducational experience. But that child will never be able to absorb the \nhistory, the geography, the math, and the science if that child cannot \nread at grade level in the third grade and have the chance to progress.\n  That is why we are trying to set a standard, not a mandate to every \nState about the test that is given but a mandate that there be some \nkind of accountability, some kind of test so parents know where the \nweaknesses are.\n  In addition, we want to take the schools that are doing well in the \nsame socioeconomic area and give that information about what works to \nthe school that is not doing well. That is the purpose of \naccountability: to find out what does work so we will have a chance to \nhelp those that are not performing up to speed by showing them what has \nworked in schools with the same weakness areas.\n  If it is reading that is a weakness, or math, or computer sciences, \nwe will have some examples to show what does work because we do want to \nmake sure no child is left behind.\n  We are talking about reforms that include accountability, some kind \nof testing to see where they are and where the weaknesses are. We are \ntalking about creativity to make sure schools that have teacher \nshortages have a bigger pool from which to choose. If we do not have a \nteacher who can teach French and the students are not able to learn \nFrench in that school district, why not go the extra mile to certify a \nperson who majored in French in college but does not happen to have a \nteacher's certificate? Why not expedite the teacher certification so \nthe young people in that particular school district will be able to \nlearn French?\n\n  That is what we are trying to do: give creativity incentives so there \nwill be more teachers available to teach French, Russian, Japanese, or \nthe Chinese language; more teachers who can teach math, science, and \ncomputer skills where there are teacher shortages.\n  We must be creative. We must leave no stone unturned to make sure \nevery child will get the chance to succeed with a public education.\n  We are going to increase spending. We are going to triple the funding \nfor children's reading programs to over $1 billion next year. We will \nhave a 30-percent increase in funding for Hispanic-serving institutions \nand historically black colleges because these programs, which have been \nincreased for the last few years at a very large rate, are doing a \ngreat service for our country. They are nurturing students in those \nschools to keep them in school to get those degrees to be eligible for \nthe good jobs that a college education can give them.\n  We are adding an additional $1 billion for Pell grants next year. At \ncolleges and universities where I have made commencement addresses, I \nhave had so many students tell me it is Pell grants that are \nresponsible for their ability to get an education because their parents \nnever could have afforded to send them. The Pell grants are an added \nincentive for them to go to college. In fact, one of the creative parts \nof this bill is increasing Pell grants by $1,000 to any low-income \nstudent who will enter the math or science field in college.\n  That would be an exciting opportunity for our minority students, for \nour low-income students, for students who have not had a chance to have \nthat extra Pell grant. If that extra Pell grant will give them an \nincentive to go into the field of math and science, then that student \nis going to have a bright future.\n  We are going to increase by $412 million teacher professional \ndevelopment, making sure teachers have the tools they need to teach, \nthat the best techniques are given to the teachers teaching our young \npeople.\n  We are going to have a $90 million increase in the National Science \nFoundation, the math and science partnerships program, so we can assure \nquality opportunities in math and science to nurture our potential \ninventors.\n  There is a $40 million increase in school construction funding for \nimpact aid schools. An impact aid school is a school that is near a \nmilitary base. These are school districts that do not have the same tax \nbase because a military installation does not pay local taxes. Many of \nthese schools have been starved over the years. We are going to give \nthem a boost to try to upgrade the school construction in these heavily \nimpacted school districts where there are large Federal institutions.\n  There is a lot of increased spending in this bill. But that is not \nall this bill is. If we just increase spending, we don't need to debate \nthe issues of reform; we don't need to talk about accountability; we \ndon't need to talk about vouchers or choice for parents or charter \nschools or trying to get more teachers to take up the teaching \nprofession. Why would we do that if we just throw money at it and not \ndo anything more? We could just pass an appropriations bill. That is \nwhat we have been doing. That is what hasn't worked.\n  What we are hoping to do is to now reform the system. We want to give \nindividual attention to every child. We are trying to give the Federal \nmoney in block grants to the State and local governments with \nbenchmarks--not mandates, not heavy books of regulations they have to \nthumb through before they can take a step. That is not what we are \ntrying to do.\n  We are saying: Here is the standard we want you to meet. We want \nevery child to read at grade level at the third grade. How you do it is \nyour choice. We will give you extra money for teaching teachers how to \nteach reading for Pell grants, for the added emphasis on math and \nscience classes, all of those things that would go toward making sure \neach individual student has the opportunity to reach his or her full \npotential with a public education. That is the point of this bill.\n  Increased accountability. Focus on what works. Look at the other \nschools to see what they do that works. Talk to people who have made it \nwork.\n  I visited a school in my hometown of Dallas, TX, an elementary \nschool. I have never seen so much creativity. The students have parents \nwho are interested. The PTA is very active in the school. The principal \nwelcomes the PTA. Stonewall Jackson Elementary School has a diverse \nstudent body. They are excited about learning. The teachers are pumped \nup; the principal is open and creative; the parents love working for \nthe school. It works because everyone comes together to try to make \nsure every child has the most opportunity that child can have.\n  This particular school also has a number of deaf students. They are \nintegrated into the elementary school. Deaf students and hearing \nstudents are in the same classes, so the hearing students know how to \nfunction with the deaf students; the deaf students know how to function \nwith the hearing students. It is wonderful to see it work because of \nthe interest of the parents, the teachers, the principal, the school \nsuperintendent, and school trustees. It is a teamwork effort. That is \nwhat we are trying to foster in every school in our country.\n\n  We want to reduce bureaucracy in Washington and increase flexibility. \nWe want school districts to do what fits them best. Maybe they need a \nsingle-sex school in part of an urban area where they have problems \nwith discipline. Why shouldn't they be able to offer an all-boys school \nor an all-girls school in a public school environment, if that is what \nthe parents believe will focus their children on education. Why don't \nwe open our horizons and look at what we can do to be more creative?\n  Most of all, we are trying to empower parents. We are trying to give \nparents the information they need to make the best decisions for their \nchildren. We are trying to make sure parents will be able to get their \nchildren out of a bad environment and into an environment where their \nchild can learn and progress and do better. That is exactly what this \nbill is trying to do.\n  I am very pleased we have a President whose major priority is \neducation. I am very pleased we have a bill that will put some \ncreativity into the schools. I am very pleased we will have some \namendments that I hope will add to the creativity and the choices \nparents will have. The bottom line is, if parents know what their \nchildren are learning and if they have an interest in their schools, \nthey are not going to let their children stay in a bad environment; \nthey are not going to let their children stay in an environment that is \nnot serving the needs of their children.\n  I hope we can start the amendment process on this bill because I \nthink we\n\n[[Page S4158]]\n\nhave a chance to recreate public education in our country. It needs to \nbe recreated. It has fallen down in the last 25 years. It is time we \nbrought it back up. It is time we do not take no for an answer. It is \ntime we do not allow someone to say that some children just can't \nlearn. Every child can learn. We just must make sure we fit that \nchild's individual needs and every child will learn. The key is \ncatching the child early enough that we can give the child the full \nchance to have a quality public education. If we find out in the ninth \ngrade that the child is reading at the third grade level, 6 years will \nhave been lost for that child's development. That is not fair. We can \ndo better. That is what I hope we will do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, I would like to continue under the time on \neducation, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. I suppose we are all hopeful the committee will soon come \ntogether with their proposal and have some agreement on the bill and \nbring it here.\n  As we think more and more about the education bill, and we begin to \nthink what are the elements of a successful education for young people, \nof course we immediately begin to think, first of all, about families, \nabout parents. That is the early responsibility. It is so interesting \nto watch in our communities, as we see the youngsters with parents who, \nwhen the children are very small, begin to help with reading, begin to \ngive parental support. Then as they get to school, we can see their \nopportunities are much greater.\n  The other things, of course, that we talk about are the facilities, \nthe teaching opportunities that are provided by the community. We begin \nto try to put all these things together. Then we begin to say what is \nthe role of dollars? I think the average expenditure per child is maybe \n$500. There are substantial differences in the costs of education \nthroughout the country. Then we begin to measure reading performance \nagainst the amount of dollars that are spent. We see as dollars go up, \nreading capacity does not necessarily go up. So we say what is it that \nhas to be done besides dollars?\n  We begin to think of the role of the Federal Government versus the \nrole of the school board and the State, in terms of decisions about \nschool buildings, for example. Traditionally, the building of school \nfacilities has been a responsibility of local governments. Local \ngovernments make the decisions. Then we find ourselves looking at \nthings that need to be done in that area and we see we need Federal \nmoney. When Federal money comes, along with it comes regulation. People \nsay: Wait a minute, get the Federal Government out of our lives.\n  It is not an easy issue. Do we want to have the best education we \ncan? Of course, nobody argues with that. That is our goal and it should \nbe. We start with preschool and go on to have the best kind of \neducation we possibly can have for everyone. Not only is that good for \neveryone, the people themselves, but it is good for our society. We \ncannot really have successful democracy unless we have educated \ncitizens.\n  That is what we are talking about. It sounds easy: we are going to \nsupport schools, we are going to do this, we are going to do that. Then \nwe think it out and say: How do we best do this? How do we get \naccountability? Where should the money come from? How important is it \nas compared to teaching expertise, for example? What does that have to \ndo with buildings, facilities, and these things?\n  It is an interesting topic. I hope we will get to it soon. The bill \nbefore us will cover almost all these things. It will have to do with \naccountability. It will have to do with financial capacity. It will \nhave to do with choice. It will have to do with how the money is spent \nand who decides that. I look forward to that.\n  I think the arrangements have been for the Senator from West Virginia \nto begin now, so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brownback). The Senator from West \nVirginia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/02/senate-section/article/S4158-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4158-S4161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         BUSH TAX CUT PROPOSAL AND THE PSEUDO-RECESSION OF 2001\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, last Friday, the Commerce Department \nreported that the U.S. economy grew at a rate of 2 percent during the \nfirst 3 months of this year, January 2001 to March 2001. That is twice \nthe rate that forecasters were projecting. It doubles the pace of late \nlast year, October 2000 to December 2000.\n  Saturday's Washington Post quoted economist Jim Glassman of J.P. \nMorgan Securities saying:\n\n       These are great numbers. They suggest that the economy is \n     not nearly as weak as was feared and that we are not close to \n     being in a recession.\n\n  This information stands in stark contrast to what the administration \nhas been telling the American people in recent months. In presenting \nhis budget and tax cut proposals to a joint session of Congress on \nFebruary 28, President Bush declared:\n\n       the long economic expansion that began almost 10 years ago \n     is faltering.\n\n  As recently as March, White House aides warned that $1.6 trillion in \ntax cuts were needed to avert an impending recession.\n  Contrary to the administration's dire warnings, the economy has \ncontinued its unbroken 10-year expansion--the longest economic \nexpansion in U.S. history. The Nation's unemployment rate is near \nhistoric lows at 4.3 percent. Consumer spending increased from a 2.8 \npercent rate in February to a 3.1 percent rate in March. Construction \nspending remains strong, business infrastructure investment is rising, \nmanufacturing activity is inching up, and factory inventories are \nfalling.\n  Even the stock markets--and we have learned that the stock market is \nnot the economy--but even the stock markets are rebounding from their \nrecent lows. The Dow Jones increased from 9,500 in early March to \nalmost 10,900 yesterday--10,898.34--a 15 percent increase. The Nasdaq \nincreased from 1,619 in March to 2,168 yesterday--a 34 percent \nincrease.\n  In the midst of the Great Depression of 1932, which I lived through, \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt cautioned that the only thing we have to \nfear is fear itself. In the midst of the pseudo-recession of 2001, the \nonly thing that the Bush administration has to fear is stirring up \npublic doubt.\n  This administration has been walking a fine line between promoting \nthe President's tax cut proposal on the one hand and alarming consumers \nand investors. The Bush administration has touted the President's tax \ncut plan as a possible ``second wind for economic growth,'' so that bad \neconomic news becomes good news for the tax cut.\n  That is the tune the administration plays.\n  The problem is that, in attacking an illusory problem through the \nbogus cure of massive tax cuts, this Administration creates two very \nreal problems. It threatens our debt repayment efforts and cuts back on \nour ability to address a backlog of infrastructure needs.\n  Let's consider, for a moment, our national debt. The Congressional \nBudget Office projects that the national debt will increase from its \ncurrent levels of $5.7 trillion to $6.7 trillion in FY 2011. The \nPresident's budget would set aside $2 trillion to retire the national \ndebt over the next ten years, but that number is based on two highly \nunlikely assumptions: (1) that $5.6 trillion in budget surpluses will \nmaterialize in spite of CBO warnings that they might not, and (2) that \ndiscretionary spending should be limited to the unrealistically low \nnumbers proposed by the President.\n  If the massive-permanent tax cuts are enacted, our debt retirement \nefforts may be compromised and that could significantly disrupt the \nfinancial markets, resulting in higher interest rates and slower \neconomic growth.\n  An equally important concern is whether these tax cuts will allow us \nto adequately address this country's failing infrastructure. Roads, \nbridges, airport runways, mass transit systems, water and sewer \nsystems, and energy delivery systems--we could go on and on--are \nvitally important to support thriving businesses. They enhance \nproductivity. They provide jobs. They are basic to a strong economy.\n  Yet, according to the American Society of Civil Engineers, ASCE, one-\nthird of the nation's major roads are in poor or mediocre condition, \ncosting American drivers an estimated $5.8 billion a year.\n\n[[Page S4159]]\n\n  The latest ASCE survey revealed that 29 percent of the nation's \nbridges are structurally deficient or functionally obsolete.\n  Airport capacity has increased only 1 percent in the past 10 years. \nNo wonder airport congestion delayed nearly 50,000 flights in one month \nalone last year.\n  Due to aging, outdated facilities, and severe overcrowding, 75 \npercent of our nation's school buildings are inadequate to meet the \nneeds of school children--to meet the needs of America's \nschoolchildren, tomorrow's citizens, and tomorrow's leaders.\n  The nation's 54,000 drinking water systems face an annual shortfall \nof $11 billion to comply with federal water regulations.\n  Some of the nation's 16,000 wastewater systems are 100 years old. \nMore than one-third of U.S. surface waters do not meet water quality \nstandards.\n  These statistics show the infrastructure needs of a third-world \nnation, not the world's last remaining super power.\n  Furthermore, these statistics only reflect the gap between federal \nfunding and our nation's physical infrastructure needs. What about our \nhuman infrastructure needs?\n  The Senate voted last month to set aside $225 billion in tax cuts to \nfinance investments in education.\n  The Senate also declared its intent to set aside $300 billion for a \nprescription drug benefit--twice the amount allotted in the President's \nbudget.\n  Medicare is estimated to have 45 million beneficiaries in 2015 (11 \nmillion more than 2000), yet the program will not have the resources to \nfinance benefits after 2016, 15 years from now.\n  Let me say that again. This should be of interest to everybody in \nthis country.\n  Medicare is estimated to have 45 million beneficiaries in 2015; yet \nthe program will not have the resources to finance benefits after 2016.\n  Likewise, the Social Security program provides a financial safety net \nfor our Nation's seniors; yet it will not be able to rely on payroll \ntax revenues after 2016.\n  Let me say that again, talking about the Social Security program.\n  I can remember when we didn't have any Social Security program in \nthis country. I can remember when Franklin Delano Roosevelt and a \nDemocratic Congress provided the Social Security program in the \ncountry.\n  Before that time, when people became too old to work, they either \nstood at the gates of their children with their hats in their hands \nhoping that their children would take them in, or, otherwise it was \nover the hill to the poorhouse. I can remember that.\n  All through the years, the workpeople of America, the people who have \nlabored and earned their bread by the sweat of their brow, paid into \nthat Social Security program as did their employers, and looked forward \nto the time when they could retire in dignity, and not have to sit on \nthe porch of the old county poor farm, and not have to call upon their \nchildren, who were already struggling, to take them in.\n  What do we see happening?\n  We see that the Social Security program provides the financial safety \nnet for our Nation's seniors, yet it will not be able to rely on \npayroll tax revenues after 2016 just 15 years from now. Unless we plan \nnow for this eventuality, where will the revenue come from to ensure \nthat these retirement benefits are paid if the surpluses don't \nmaterialize?\n\n  Federal dollars also support high-technology research which, in turn, \nis transferred to the private sector to help domestic businesses \ncompete more efficiently in the international market place.\n  Where will the money come from to finance these human infrastructure \nneeds--if the kitty is blown--if the kitty is blown on tax cuts?\n  The reality of this year's budget process is that if the Senate \ndecides to approve 10-year tax cuts as large as $1.6 trillion, or even \n$1.35 trillion or $1.2 trillion, it is likely to do so at the expense \nof everything else that we owe to the American people.\n  You, the people as I am looking right into your eyes through that \nelectronic camera behind the Presiding Officer's chair. It is you. Yes, \nit is your money, but it is also your Social Security program, it is \nyour Medicare program. Whether you are young or whether you are old, it \nis going to affect you, the American people.\n  The administration is fond of saying that these projected surpluses \nare the people's money. And they are. Yes, it is the people's money. \nBut what the American people expect for their tax dollars-- modern and \nsafe roads--safe roads on which they can take their children to the \nchildcare center, on which they can go to church, on which they can go \nto school, on which they can go to the bank, on which they can go to \nthe grocery store, on which they can go to work--safe roads, modern \nroads, clean drinking water, adequate health care, reliable retirement \nbenefits, access to higher education, and better public schools.\n  The President's budget does not even allow for what the Congressional \nBudget Office says is necessary to maintain current services in such \nkey areas as transportation, agriculture, and energy--we have an energy \nproblem in this country, don't we?--and certainly does not provide what \nis necessary to address the backlog of infrastructure needs in \neducation, health care, and a whole host of other areas.\n  Consider the following: Highways, bridges and transit: The President \nproposes to divert--yes, you heard me exactly; divert--$430 million of \nTEA-21 funding in FY 2002 from highway construction to other \ntransportation programs.\n  Schools: The President proposes to terminate the $1.2 billion school \nconstruction program. How about that?\n  Drinking Water/Wastewater: The President proposes to reduce funding \nfor EPA clean and safe drinking water by $463 million and grant and \nloan levels for the rural water/wastewater by $100 million.\n  I traveled around the world in 1955, 46 years ago. In most of the \ncountries where I traveled, we did not find clean drinking water. We \nwere told not to turn on the faucet, not to drink the tap water: Don't \ndrink it. Boil it in advance. Oh, I saw many of the beautiful sights of \nthe world--the Taj Mahal, the pyramids of Egypt, Angkor Wat in \nCambodia--but the most beautiful sight I saw, after that 66 days of \ntraveling around the world, were the two little lights, the two little \nred lights in the top of the Washington Monument when I flew back into \nNational Airport at the end of that journey. And what a joy it was just \nto be able to go to the spigot in the kitchen and turn on the water and \nget a glass of fresh, clean, safe drinking water.\n  There are millions of people in this country today who cannot go to \nthe water faucet and turn it on and get safe drinking water--right in \nthis country. One does not have to go to Kandahar, one does not have to \ngo to Afghanistan or to Pakistan or to Vietnam or to Korea in order to \nexperience what I am talking about. Just go to West Virginia. There are \nsome places in West Virginia where the people do not have safe, clean \ndrinking water.\n  What about dams and navigable waterways?\n  The President proposes to reduce funding for the Corps of Engineers \nfrom $4.5 billion to $3.9 billion. The President proposes no new starts \ndespite a backlog of $38 billion of authorized but unfunded projects.\n  Hazardous waste disposal, what about that? Despite a $13.6 billion \nbacklog for cleaning up toxic sites on the national priority list, the \nadministration proposes to freeze Superfund at the FY 2001 level. \nFreeze it. Do not increase it. Leave it at the 2001 level.\n  Instead of addressing the Nation's infrastructure needs, this \nadministration chooses to devote its resources to a so-called fiscal \nstimulus, even though the economy seems to be correcting itself without \none.\n  The President has said that the economic engine is beginning to \nsputter, and that tax cuts are needed to accelerate the economy. What \ngood does it do to rev up the economic engine if the roads are in such \na state of disrepair that they cannot be traveled? Even the fastest, \nmost expensive, most shiny, glossy car in the world cannot travel over \nbridges that are dangerous, falling apart, and roads filled with \npotholes.\n  And one does not have to travel very far to see potholes. Just drive \naround in the Nation's Capital. Potholes--one sees on television the \npictures of automobiles hitting those potholes and then having to go to \nthe nearest garage to have the axle replaced. The tires are blown. \nRight here, in the city of potholes, Washington, DC. One does not\n\n[[Page S4160]]\n\nhave to go to Mud, WV, or to Duck, WV, or to Sophia, WV. Just go to \nWashington, DC. The potholes are there.\n  Most people expect to get something for the taxes they pay. They \nexpect clean, safe water. The taxpayers expect to see, modern highways, \nand transportation systems. They expect to see food free of toxics, a \nsound education system, decent health care, and safe streets and \nneighborhoods. The frustration comes when the taxpayers don't see their \ntax dollars working for them. We tell them their tax dollars are \ncollected to buy these things that will improve their lives.\n  When we don't deliver, we break faith with our promise and we \nundermine the trust of the taxpayers. I say the people don't want their \nmoney back, they want their money's worth. We hear this refrain being \nsung. I can hear it now wafting its way in the refreshing air of May \nfrom the White House at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue: The \npeople want their money back. No, I say; the people want their money's \nworth.\n  If I go to the grocery store with my wife Erma to buy food for the \nweekend, I don't want the grocery man to smile at me and say: I won't \nfill up your shopping cart but I will give you your money back. I don't \nwant my money back; I want my money's worth.\n  When I hire a contractor to fix my roof if it is leaking, I don't \nwant him to tell me he won't do the job but he will give me my money \nback. I want to be dry. I don't want the rain to come into my modest \ncottage. I don't want my money back; I want my money's worth.\n  If I take my old Chevrolet to a mechanic because it won't run, I \ndon't want to be told that the car can't be fixed but I will get my \nmoney back. I don't want my money back. I want my money's worth. Fix my \ncar. That is what the American people want. They want us to get the \nmost from the taxes we collect. They want us to plan ahead and invest \nin our country. They want us to exercise stewardship in their best \ninterest. They don't want us to creep up to them with our head down and \nwith a long face and say to them: Here, you gave us this tax money. I \nhid it in a napkin. Here is your money back. No. That is like the \nunfaithful steward in the Biblical proverb.\n  The American people want to get the most from the taxes we collect. \nThey want us to plan ahead and to invest in our country. They want us \nto do the basics that feed the economy, to allow for future growth and \nanticipate future change. We fail them if we don't do these things. We \nhave failed them if we say: Here, just take your money back. The people \ncan't repair highways. They can't build sewers and clean up water \nsystems. They can't build new airports. They can't inspect the food \nsupply. Government exists to take care of things that people cannot do \non their own.\n  It also exists to make intelligent choices about future trends and to \nanticipate needs. How can we do that if we squander our ability to make \ninvestments for the future because of huge tax cuts, huge tax give-\nbacks now, based on projections which may not be real?\n  The Associated Press is reporting today that President Bush has \nstruck a deal with the Republican leadership on a so-called budget \ndeal. Further, I understand that the House and Senate Budget Committee \nchairmen are rushing to file the budget resolution conference report \nthis evening. This is another example, if it is true, of the President \nand the Republican leadership disregarding the President's promise to \nbring bipartisanship back to Washington.\n  The House and Senate took up the budget resolution without a detailed \nPresident's budget. For the first time in its history, the Senate \nBudget Committee did not mark up the budget resolution. And now we hear \nwe will have a budget resolution conference report that was produced \nwithout the involvement of the ranking members of the House and Senate \nBudget Committees, also without any input by the ranking members of the \nSenate and House Appropriations Committees.\n  So what is in this conference report? We do not have the report, but \naccording to the press reports, it contains $1.35 trillion for tax cuts \nover 11 years and it limits discretionary spending to a 5-percent \nincrease for fiscal year 2002.\n  Where is the bipartisanship? I am not in on such a deal. I am the \nranking member of the Appropriations Committee. Where is the \nbipartisanship? The Administration puts on a big show, having invited \neverybody down to the White House. Where is the bipartisanship in this \nbudget conference report, if what we are reading in the press is true?\n  I am also told that it contains budget process provisions, such as a \ndefense firewall, that were in neither the House nor Senate \nresolutions.\n  What will be the effect of a 5-percent increase for discretionary \nprograms? That is what I hear: Discretionary will be 5 percent.\n  At best, this level provides only enough of an increase for \nnondefense programs to maintain last year's funding levels, adjusted \nfor inflation. This level will leave no resources for increases that we \nall know are necessary for education, for infrastructure, for research \nand development, and for promoting our energy independence. What about \nSocial Security or Medicare?\n  The increases being debated on the floor for elementary and secondary \neducation this week could not be funded, to say nothing of other \neducation programs such as Pell grants. During debate on the budget \nresolution in the Senate over twenty amendments were adopted to add \ndiscretionary spending. Almost half of those amendments were offered by \nRepublicans. Where are we going to get the money to pay for increases \nfor veterans' medical care, the Wellstone and Bond amendment, or for \nfossil fuel programs, or for the National Science Foundation, the Bond \nand Mikulski amendment, for food safety, the Clinton amendment, for \nconservation funding, the Murkowski amendment, for energy research, the \nReid amendment, or for law enforcement, the Leahy amendment? The \nPresident proposes to cut State and local law enforcement by over $1 \nbillion. Where will the money come from to restore those cuts? Where \nwill the money come from to add funds for health centers, the Bond \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. And what about our Nation's infrastructure? Where will we \nget the money to restore the cuts proposed for clean water and safe \ndrinking water, for the Corps of Engineers, and for school \nconstruction?\n  Very often in this country, there seems to be nothing on our radar \nscreen except the immediate, the here and now. We think no further than \nnext week, next year or the next election. Where are we if our leaders \nfashion fiscal policy on such things, on such bases? Where are we as a \nNation if the most vision we can muster is a colossal tax cut for the \nwealthy that may jeopardize such basics as our ability to ensure a \nclean water supply to all of our citizens? It is a hollow vision. It is \na vision that appeals to greed. It is a vision that fails to ask us to \npull together as Americans for the good of the whole country. It is a \nvision that sets up a patchwork quilt of a nation, with areas of \nprosperity next to areas of poverty. It is a vision that makes a hollow \njoke out of the word ``bipartisanship.'' It is a ``fold your hands,'' \n``you do it'' vision, based on an ideology and an experiment that \nfailed in the 1980's. Most people in West Virginia won't benefit from \nthis tax cut, but they will suffer from the continued lack of \ninvestment in the basics. They are not by themselves. West Virginians \nwon't be suffering alone. There will be others like them in every State \nof the Union. They don't want their money back. I am talking about my \nconstituents. They don't want their money back; they want their money's \nworth.\n\n  I implore this administration to take off the dark sunglasses and \nthink about that word ``bipartisanship'' and lift its nose from the \nideological bible of the tax cut religion. Let me say that again. I \nimplore this administration to lift its nose from the ideological bible \nof the tax cut religion. There is much more to keeping faith with the \nAmerican people than tax give-backs for the better off.\n  Building a strong Nation does not just mean building another weapons \nsystem. Building a strong Nation means giving our people the basics, \nthe education, the health, the opportunity\n\n[[Page S4161]]\n\nto compete in an increasingly global economy. It means providing the \nroads, transportation, water and sewer facilities which support a \nthriving economy and allow the people to follow their dreams.\n  This morning's newspapers reported that the Republican leadership had \nreached a tentative deal on the overall amount of tax cuts that can be \npassed by the Senate. I noted that no deal has yet been reached with \nregard to discretionary spending, although a consensus seems to be \nconsolidating around a 5-percent figure. That is not bipartisanship. \nWhere was I? Where were the ranking members? Where were the chairman \nand the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee in this \ndeal? Where is the ranking member of the Senate Budget Committee in \nthis deal? Does the White House call this bipartisanship?\n  I hope the Senators will give due recognition to the real threats \nfacing this country--the declining state of our infrastructure and our \nnational debt--and not chase will-o'-the-wisp, pseudo-recessions, and \nmoney-back guarantees that cannot deliver the goods.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/02/senate-section/article/S4161-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4161-S4166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  BETTER EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS ACT--MOTION TO PROCEED--\n                               Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The Senator from Utah is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, we have had a lot of conversation on the \nfloor in the last week about education, and given that education is the \nNo. 1 issue before us and the one that, according to the polls, is the \nNo. 1 issue on the minds of most Americans, I think that is \nappropriate. So I am going to join in that conversation and make some \ncomments on education tonight. I trust I will have an opportunity to \nmake some comments on education a little later on as the debate \nproceeds.\n  Members of this body have heard me before talk about my experience as \nfar as education is concerned. It was the educational issue that got me \nback into public life. I was enjoying a career as a businessman at a \nrelatively prosperous organization. I was the chief executive officer, \nso I got to make a lot of decisions. For example, I got to choose what \nkind of health care I had. None of the other employees got to do that, \nthe way the health care system works in America, but I did because I \nwas the chief executive.\n  I got a phone call from the chair of the Utah State Board of \nEducation asking if I would serve as a member of the strategic planning \ncommission for that body, and I agreed. Then she called back a little \nlater and said, ``We want you to chair.'' I said, ``Well, all right.'' \nSo I became chairman of that planning commission and immersed myself in \nissues of education.\n  It was a wonderful experience. The most distressing part of it is \nthat happened over 10 years ago, and as I sit here in this Chamber and \nlisten to the debate on education, it hits me that nothing has changed. \nThe issues that were prominent 10, 15 years ago are still the issues we \nare dealing with, and that is very depressing.\n  I go back to a comment that was made to me by one of the employees of \nthe Utah State Board of Education when we were talking about changes \nthat needed to be made. He said to me, ``Bob, don't be so hard on us. \nWe are changing. We are changing a little bit all the time. It is just \nthat we are not changing as fast as you want us to change. Some of the \nthings you are asking us to do, it will take us 15 years to do.''\n  I stopped and pointed out to him that 15 years is longer than it \ntakes a child entering school in kindergarten to graduate from high \nschool. I said, ``In other words, you are saying if we come to the \nconclusion that this is the right thing to do, no one currently in Utah \nschools will get the benefit of that. A whole 15-year cycle could go by \nand somebody could enter kindergarten and graduate from high school \nwithout getting the benefit of something we decide now has to be \ndone.''\n  The depressing thing is that conversation took place close to 15 \nyears ago and we are still having the same debates around here.\n  I have put up a chart, which the Senator from Maine, Susan Collins, \nhas used. I want to refer to it again because we need to reinforce a \nfundamental truth. The source for the chart is the National Center For \nEducation Statistics, in the Digest of Education Statistics. The red \nline is expenditures on education in 1999 dollars. So these are \nconstant dollars adjusted for inflation. Back in 1971, this is where \nthey were, and now you see the line goes up. This is where they are \ntoday. It is roughly double the dollar amount. Here are the reading \nscores; it is absolutely flat. The yellow line is the fourth grade; it \nis absolutely flat. The eighth grade is also absolutely flat. The 12th \ngrade is absolutely flat.\n\n  We keep spending more and more money on education and keep getting \nexactly the same results. The former Senator from New York, Mr. \nMoynihan, once made a comment while looking at a chart that was even \nmore distressing than this, where the expenditures per pupil were going \nup and reading scores were going down, and with his sense of humor and \nsense of irony he said, ``Maybe we can postulate that spending more \nmoney on education causes education to get worse, because that is the \ntrend line. The more we spend, the worse things are.''\n  Well, this chart indicates, at least, that the more we spend, the \nmore things stay the same. If we are satisfied with what we are getting \nin education right now, then all we should do is leave things exactly \nas they are but spend more money on them. We will get exactly the same \nresults we have been getting for the last 20 years. We will spend more \nmoney and we won't get anything any better.\n  Unfortunately, as I listen to speeches in this Chamber, particularly \nthe speeches from those who are disappointed with President Bush's \nproposal, I discover that there is an interesting attitude in \nWashington: If a program is good, Washington says spend more money on \nit. If a program is bad, Washington says spend more money on it. They \ndon't seem to differentiate between one situation and the other because \nthey have a one-size-fits-all solution, which is to spend more money. \nIt makes us feel good to spend more money. It makes us feel good to be \nable to go home to town meetings and say, as I have said--I fall into \nthe same category when somebody starts attacking me on education--I \nhave voted to increase the budget on education every time since I have \nbeen in the Senate. That kind of shuts them up. They can't attack \nSenator Bennett for being anti-education if he promises to keep \nspending more money on education. They never ask me the fundamental \nquestion: What have you done to change the system so that it gets \nbetter?\n  What have you done to change the system so that the reading scores \nstart to go up? Well, that is a little harder. It is much easier to \nsay, well, I voted to spend more money, and send me to Washington and I \nwill vote to spend more money.\n  President Bush wants to spend more money on education. A lot of \npeople say, boy, that is unusual for a Republican. The Democrat \nreaction is, we want to spend even more money than President Bush wants \nto spend, and we are back in the same Washington trap, which is, if it \nis a good program, spend more money on it; if it is a bad program, fix \nit by spending more money on it.\n\n  We need to get away from that. We need to break out of that syndrome \nand say: Let's not spend more money; let's spend smarter money; let's \nbegin to demand a return on our investment; let's begin to say this is \nnot good enough and we are not going to give you more money until we \ncan be convinced that the money we are spending is producing better \nresults.\n  That brings me smack into the issue that has been discussed today, \nwhich is fully funding title I.\n  That is a great political hot button: we must fully fund title I. \nThat is why it is not working. That is why we are not getting the \neffectiveness. We have only funded it to this level, and we should be \nfunding it to that level.\n  That is a great way to put off this decision. That is a great way to \ncontinue doing what we have been doing without facing the fundamental \nquestion, which is, Why has title I not been effective? Is there a \npossibility there is a reason other than the fact that we have not been \nspending enough money on it?\n  Oh, that is very hard to discuss in Washington because, as I say, the \nall-\n\n[[Page S4162]]\n\npurpose answer to everything is, fund it; spend more money on it.\n  Have we ever looked at title I to determine if there are other \nreasons why it is not as effective as it is supposed to be, other \nreasons besides money? The last comprehensive study of title I and how \nit works was made in 1994, 7 years ago. We have been flying blind for 7 \nyears. For 7 years we have been going on faith.\n  I believe in faith. I will yield to no Member of this body in my \nfaith in a religious concept to which I have made a very firm and solid \ncommitment. But when it comes to things that are not of the spiritual \nworld, I want some proof. I want something besides just blind faith. I \nthink in 7 years we ought to be able to come up with some assessments \nand some understanding of how things are going that will cause us to \nspend our money smarter.\n  We now have a President who is saying, let's test the results school \nby school and monitor who is doing well and who is not. I come out of \nthe business community. That is a little like saying, let's start to \nkeep books on our sales. Instead of just saying, well, we have a sales \nforce, let's spend money on sales, let's start to keep track of which \nsalesman or saleswoman is performing better than which other one.\n  To a businessman and businesswoman, that is just obvious. You do not \nmake an expenditure until you have an assessment of how things are \ngoing. You do not hire somebody or give somebody a raise or hand them a \nbonus until you have at least some understanding of how well he is \ndoing. If you have somebody who is not doing very well, you do not give \nhim a bonus. You try training him; you try motivating him; you transfer \nhim to another position where he might be better suited; but you do not \nautomatically say, Well, you are not doing it very well, but the way to \nsolve your problem is to give you more money. That is the attitude in \neducation: We do not really care whether you are doing well or not. All \nwe know is we can feel good about spending money on education because \nwe are all for education.\n  The core of the Bush proposal is assessment of results. The core of \nthe Bush position on education is to find out where we are. The driving \nforce behind everything he is pushing is understanding what is \nhappening, and that is so threatening to people who are committed to \nlife as it has been, the status quo, that they can all find reasons to \ncomplain about it.\n\n  One of the reasons to complain about it that I have heard is that it \nis going to cost money. Hey, we cannot spend money on assessments; we \nmust spend money in the traditional way to get the traditional results.\n  Some say, All right, we will go along with the assessments as long as \nthe Federal Government pays for it. We should not put that burden on \nthe States. We should not insist the States measure where they are \nwithout paying them to measure where they are.\n  I ask the question, What responsible State superintendent is not \nanxious to conduct assessments right now? I can say that with some \nvalidity because in my home State of Utah, they are already doing the \nassessments. They are paying for it with State dollars.\n  Why? Because they have come to the same conclusion that President \nBush has: If you are going to spend the money smarter, you have to \nunderstand what is going on. So it is intelligent stewardship on the \npart of the State board of education in Utah for them to take precious \nmoney in the State and spend it on assessing where people are, what is \nhappening, what are the outcomes, how well are we doing.\n  One of the questions I will raise when the amendment comes up that \nsays we have to have Federal funds to pay for the assessment is this \none: What happens if the State is already paying for the assessment? \nDoes it still get the Federal funds that it would otherwise get or are \nyou going to penalize the States that are doing the right thing now by \nsaying we will not give you the money and, thus, reward the States that \nare avoiding assessments by giving them the money?\n  These are issues that are very different from the standard Washington \nanswer which is: Just give them the money; just spend the money.\n  No, we need to know where we are. One of the first places that we \nshould start in assessments is appropriately title I. Yes, title I \nmoney and title I circumstances are very controversial. We have not had \na complete analysis of how well that has been doing since 1994. Let's \nstart to assess title I. Before we say the magic words ``fully fund,'' \nlet's ask the magic question: What are we funding? Are we funding \nfailure? We do not know. Are we funding mediocrity? We do not know. We \nare funding a wonderful sounding goal, but are we funding results or \nare we funding failure?\n  Let's find out. Let's do the assessments. Let's spend the money to \nfind out what is happening with title I kids, how it could be done \nbetter, how it could be done smarter, how it could be done quicker, and \nthen I am perfectly willing to vote for the money. I am perfectly \nwilling to spend the money if I know it is being spent on something \nthat will get results.\n  My history as a businessman was that I was willing to take a risk \nwith the shareholders' money. Some of the shareholders did not like it. \nThey wanted business just as it was always done: Don't try anything \nnew; don't launch any new product, that is risky; don't try to break \ninto any new market, that is expensive. A business that takes that \nposition is a business that dies over time.\n  When I was running our business I tried some new products and some of \nthem failed badly. They were expensive. I tried to go into some new \nmarkets and it turned out to be really stupid--heavy investiture with \nlittle or no return. But some of the products revolutionized the \ncompany. Some of the new territories we entered turned into vast new \nopportunities and overall, by being willing to try and assess and, yes, \nspend more money, we grew the company from a few hundred thousand \ndollars a year to a $400 or $500 million business. You say schools are \ndifferent; you are not trying to grow the school or trying to be \nentrepreneurial. I am not trying to grow the school, but I am trying to \ngrow the trim lines and see that after 20 years of being flat, can't \nthere be a wiser spending of money.\n\n  If you want to get the results you are getting, keep doing what you \nare doing. That is a fundamental truth they teach in business school. \nIf you want to keep getting the results you are getting now, keep doing \nwhat you are doing now. If you want different results, you have to do \nsomething different. That, ultimately, is the challenge of the Bush \nproposal on education.\n  It has taken a little while for a lot of people to understand that, \nfor a lot of people to come to grips with that. President Bush is \nproposing something different. How threatening that is. How unsettling. \nHow disturbing. The President of the United States is saying we are not \ngetting what we need to get; let's try something else. And he is \nwilling to spend for it. The amount of money that the President has \nproposed as an increase in education spending is more than the Clinton \nadministration ever proposed. So no one can say he is being cheap about \nthis. No one is saying he is not willing to put his money where his \nmouth is, to use the language of the gambling community. He is willing \nto put up the money. But he is saying, I don't want to spend it in the \nsame old ways; I want to try something new. I am willing to fund the \nexperiment, but I want to find out if we can't do it better.\n  In order to find out if we can't do it better, we have to start \nmaking assessments and then we have to pay attention to what the \nassessments tell us. Boy, is that revolutionary. Is that scary. Track \nwhat is happening as we spend this money in different ways and then pay \nattention to what that tracking says.\n  No, the President's opponents say, it is all too threatening. It is \nall too different. Better fall back into the old political ruts we have \nbeen in forever in this town, which is, pick up the slogan, pick up the \ngood-sounding title, and paste money on it. Then go home and brag to \nyour constituents that you are pro-education. After 20 years of doing \nthat, there has been no progress.\n  Maybe it is time we did something different. Not ``maybe''--it is \ndefinitely time we did something different.\n  Let me ask this question rhetorically. Suppose the Bush program \ndoesn't work. Suppose we spend all of this money that President Bush is \ntrying to get us to spend in different ways\n\n[[Page S4163]]\n\nand the reading scores stay flat. What have we lost? What has that cost \nbeen compared to business as usual?\n  Yes, President Bush can be faulted for spending that extra money on \neducation and not getting any tangible results. But I suggest if we go \nthe route many in this Chamber want to go, which is to say ``don't \nchange the system in any fundamental ways, but do raise the money,'' we \nwill get exactly the same result. Everybody will feel good about it, \nexcept the kids.\n  That is where I want to end up because that is where the primary \nfocus should be. That is the fundamental issue of education--the kids. \nWe don't fund education in this country to make politicians feel good, \nor at least we shouldn't. We don't fund education because we want to \nmaintain the sanctity of those buildings that we put up or because we \nwant to provide employment for the teachers, the aides, the janitors, \nand the school lunch people. Boy, they would all be in the unemployment \nranks if we did not keep funding education.\n  That is not why we fund education. We fund education for one purpose \nand one purpose only: to empower our children to function effectively \nin society. Put in place whatever subdefinition you want. We fund \neducation to empower our children to become good citizens. We empower \nour children to become good wage earners. We empower our children so \nthey can become good parents. Put whatever subset you want, but the \nfundamental reason we fund education, the only reason we fund \neducation, is so that our children will be able to function effectively \nin society, in whatever role they have.\n\n  For far too long the focus of educational funding and educational \nreform and educational structure has been the system and not the \nchildren. I went through that when I was in my situation as chair of \nthe strategic planning commission that I mentioned. Over and over \nagain, everybody who came before me talked about ``the system.'' This \nis how we tweak the system; this is how we change the structure; this \nis how we work on the organization.\n  I kept saying, Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Your focus is in the \nwrong place. Your focus should be on the children.\n  They would say, Sure, sure, sure, that's right. Now, let's go back. \nIn order to fix things we have to change the structure, we have to \nchange the organization, we have to change the reporting relationship.\n  No, no, no, I would say. Your focus isn't on the children.\n  Finally, I came up with this analogy. It is imperfect, but I hope it \nmakes the point. I remember when the big three auto manufacturers had \none common enemy, the one thing they were absolutely united on. That \nenemy was named Toyota. They were determined they would do everything \nthey possibly could to see to it that Toyota did not enter the United \nStates; that Toyota cars were stopped at the shore and not allowed to \ncome in. Toyota was so threatening to them, they even came to the \nCongress and asked for legislation that would have effectively kept \nToyota out.\n  Why was Toyota so threatening? There was a fundamental difference in \nfocus. General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler were focused on the car. What \ndoes the car look like? How does the car drive? What is the engine in \nthe car? What can we change in the car? The whole focus was on the car.\n  Toyota came to America with the focus on the driver. What does the \ndriver want? Well, they did a little surveying and they discovered that \nthe driver wanted, among other things, reliability in the car. They \ndidn't want it to break down after 20,000 miles. The driver wasn't as \ninterested in style as he was in stability. Toyota said, Find out what \nthe driver wants and then design a car that fits it. By focusing on the \ndriver, they made cars smaller so they could fit in parking lots. By \nfocusing on the driver, they made cars cheaper to operate so you didn't \nbuy as much gasoline. They found a ready market in the United States \nfor their cars.\n  Fortunately, the American manufacturers were not successful in \nkeeping Toyota out, and the pressure of the competition of Toyota made \nthe American cars substantially better. The American manufacturers \ndecided they had better focus on the driver, too, and each manufacturer \npicked a niche of drivers and began to produce products that would fit \nthose drivers and they began to prosper and discovered that Toyota was \nnot going to put them out of business. They had a shift in their focus: \none group focusing on the car, the other group focusing on the driver. \nThe group focusing on the driver was winning until the other group \nstarted focusing on the driver as well.\n\n  I use that analogy to say, You people are focusing on the car. You \nare focusing on the school building. Should it be painted blue or \nyellow? How many rooms should it have? What kind of air conditioning \nshould we have in the school? What kind of landscaping should there be? \nWhat should be the structure of organization? Should the principal have \none aide or two aides? You are focusing on the system. Who is focusing \non the kids?\n  It is just possible that the kids are going through this school, this \nsystem you have built and created, and they are not being empowered to \nfunction effectively in society. What do the kids need to function \neffectively in society? As soon as you put your focus on that, you may \ndiscover a very different kind of school needs to be constructed around \nthe needs of the children. That is what President Bush is talking \nabout. Let's make some assessments of what is happening with the \nstudents and then see if, from those assessments, we can create a \nsystem that will meet those needs. If we can, we can start to see these \ntest score lines on this chart begin to come up along with the \nexpenditure line.\n  President Bush is not afraid to raise the top line, the expenditures. \nWe Republicans are not afraid to do it with him. But we don't want to \ndo it focusing on the system. We want to do it focusing on the child.\n  So when somebody says fully fund title I, my question is, How is \ntitle I helping the children? How is title I working?\n  Well, we don't know.\n  Why don't we know? Because the last study that has been done on the \neffectiveness of title I was done in 1994.\n  All right, I have gone around the argument. I do not want to repeat \nit one more time. But I do want to summarize it and make the point one \nmore time. This is a fundamental crossroads for the Senate, the \nCongress, the Government as a whole. Are we going to keep doing what we \nhave always done, which gives us a warm, personal, political feeling \nand political cover when we go home, by saying we spent more money on \neducation, to prove how much we love education? Or are we willing to \ntake the risk that President Bush is asking us to take, to say the time \nhas come to think about doing it differently? The time has come to \nthink about spending the money differently. The time has come to make \nassessments and evaluations that will help us direct the money more \nintelligently.\n  The time has come, instead of congratulating ourselves on the fact \nthat we make the red line go up, to say, Let's hold ourselves \naccountable for the fact that the blue and the green and the yellow \nlines have not budged in 20 years.\n  That is the challenge President Bush has given us. I hope we are \nequal to it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be dispensed with.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennett). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALLARD. Mr. President, I listened to your comments with enormous \ninterest because I think you made some very good points. I wanted to \nbring some comments to the floor from a neighbor's perspective, a \nneighbor of the great State of Utah, what I have been hearing about \neducation in Colorado.\n  Colorado has taken a very progressive approach to education with the \nnew Governor of Colorado, Governor Owens, and the Colorado Legislature. \nThey have decided to try to do something about education. In that \nregard, they are probably somewhat ahead of what we see happening in \nother States.\n  What they are attempting to do is very much the same type of program\n\n[[Page S4164]]\n\nthat the President is proposing to the Congress. As a Congress, we need \nto help the President give the States more control over the educational \nsystem--with accountability. I do think accountability is the key. I \nshare the observations of my colleague from Utah that test scores are \nnot getting better. I am looking at the test score trend, not recently \nbut over several decades, as to how we compare with other countries in \nmath scores, how we have been doing over time in math and English \nscores, and I am disturbed by the trend.\n  We need to do things that will improve the math skills of our \nstudents. We need to do things that will improve the English-\nproficiency skills of our students. Not only am I responding to what I \nam observing as to the scores, but when I go out and visit the \nemployers of the State of Colorado, I hear the same message that I have \nobserved as far as test scores; that is, students are not as well \nprepared for math or not as well prepared to deal with the English \nlanguage in the workplace. I think that goes right down to the \nSenator's bottom line, that education is to prepare people to carry on \nwith their daily activities in a democracy such as we have in the \nUnited States. I do think education is key to that.\n  I am here to praise President Bush for his commitment to education, \nmaking it his top legislative priority. I like his commitment to making \nsure that no child is left behind.\n  Over the last 35 years, the Federal Government has spent $120 billion \non poor kids. They have shown no improvement in basic math and reading \nskills. The President's education blueprint demands accountability. He \nis asking the States to set higher standards. I think that is great. \nThen he holds the States and school districts and individual schools to \nthose standards and allows some flexibility because not all States are \nthe same, not all school districts' problems are the same, certainly \nnot all community problems are the same. School districts and local \nagencies should have more flexibility to spend the Federal money.\n  In addition to that, he has suggested we need to come close to \ntripling the amount of money we provide for education, an increase as \ncompared to the rest of the budget. In other words, the rest of the \nbudget he proposed had a 4-percent increase. Education was somewhere \naround an 11-percent or 12-percent increase. With added flexibility \nmust come more accountability. So he is saying to the States: OK, \nStates, go ahead and design a test so you can measure performance, \nwhich is very important, grades 3-8.\n  Then you measure the progress within the State. That allows the \nstudents as well as the parents to measure what is happening as far as \ntheir educational effort in the various school districts. It allows the \nparents to take a greater role in the progress of the child's \neducation. I think that is entirely appropriate.\n  I have talked with educators in the State of Colorado. I have members \nin my family who are educators. I have a great uncle who is president \nof the Teachers College. Obviously, education is important to our \nfamily. It is important to me.\n  We have to develop a ``can do'' attitude in education. We need to \nencourage the fact that we can do better than what we have been doing. \nWe need to look at ways in which we can give local school districts the \nflexibility they need to do a better job in educating students and \nallowing parents to have a greater role in educating students. It is \ngoing to require a team effort with parents working within the school \nsystem to make sure that things get better.\n  I admit that in some cases we need to look at the disciplinary \nsituation in classes. When I talked about education and improving \neducation, I mentioned the fact that we needed to do something to \nimprove discipline in the classroom. One of the problems I see with \ndiscipline in the classroom is the type of liability the school \ndistrict and the teacher may incur trying to impose discipline on the \nclassroom. I think that is a Federal problem as well as a State \nproblem, and it is certainly something that perhaps as a Congress we \nought to investigate at a later date. I think the State legislators \nthemselves ought to look at the liability of the teacher and school \ndistricts in trying to apply discipline in the school districts or \nwithin the classrooms.\n  This is a good first step that the President is suggesting. I think \nwhat is coming to the floor of the Senate and that was reported out of \nthe education committee is a good first step. It is moving us in the \nright direction.\n  I hope we can quickly get this piece of legislation moved out of the \nSenate without any further delay. It disturbs me when I see the delay \nin one piece of legislation after another. And the education bill we \nnow have before the Senate went through some of that delay process. \nThen when we vote to move it on, we get a very substantial margin in \nmoving forward with a particular piece of legislation.\n  It is important to the history of this country that we do something \nabout education. It is important to the employer. It is important to \nthe future of the child. We want to make sure that no child gets left \nbehind.\n  The solution in the past was that we would have more money for \neducation from Washington but with more mandates. We are seeing some of \nthose issues that will probably come up as amendments on the floor as \nwe debate the education bill. Some of these amendments are going to say \nwe will take the flexibility from the school districts and put it in \nthe buildings, or they will say we will have to put it in teachers. I \nthink the proper and sensible approach is to give maximum flexibility \nfor those dollars to the school district to decide where their needs \nare. It may be that they just built a new school building and they \ndon't need more money for a school building. So they can't participate \nin the dollars that go towards a new school building. Their need is for \nteachers. So the school district, in that case, needs to have the \nflexibility to move that money into teaching. It may be that they have \nplenty of teachers and the school building is not in good shape. So \nthey need to have the flexibility to take those dollars and put it in a \nbuilding program so they can have a better environment for learning.\n  That is just one example. There are a number of other examples that \nmost of us could point to as to what could be done in the way of adding \nmore flexibility to the school districts so they can meet their various \nneeds.\n  I travel throughout the State of Colorado, and I don't think we are \nany different than any other State. But there are a lot of differences \nin Colorado between the various school districts depending on where you \nare in the State.\n  We have a lot of different problems throughout the country because \nthere are different types of school districts. I think to try to put \nforth a solution in Washington where you have a one-size-fits-all \nprogram is a mistake.\n  When the President says he wants to have more flexibility, I believe \nthis is what he is talking about. That is why I think it is important \nthat we give school districts the flexibility they need.\n  A teacher in Weld County recently told me that his school is using a \njanitor's closet as a classroom because of the lack of space available. \nIf we can give him more dollars for flexibility, then that would give \nhim an opportunity to change that classroom situation. If we pass \namendments that say our extra dollars will go to hiring more teachers, \nit is not going to do that school any service in trying to create a \ngood education for its students.\n  I am here to support the bill that we have on the floor. I think it \nis moving us in the right direction. I am here to support President \nBush because I think he is moving in the right direction. I like his \ntheme that we don't leave any child behind because it provides \nflexibility to States and school districts. It promotes accountability \nand it increases parental involvement.\n\n  My hope is that as we move forward with this debate, we don't linger, \nand that we get the bill passed quickly and be supportive of what the \nPresident is trying to do. He is bringing some new ideas to education.\n  I know there are individuals in this body that get real apprehensive \nwhen you start talking about new ideas for education. But we need to \ntake some of those inherent risks. I think that the risk is minimal \nwhen you put the confidence in local school districts and you measure \nresults. We do that with a flexible testing program that is established \nwith the States.\n  I am one who is saying we ought to change education, and we need to \nmove\n\n[[Page S4165]]\n\nforward. We need to take a positive attitude in education. We can do \nbetter with math and we can do better with English. We need to measure \nthose results.\n  I yield the time. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Allard). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am here also to add my voice to those \nwho have already spoken on this bill. I would like to talk on two \nparticular subjects. I am not going to elaborate on how important \neducation is to America. We all know that. Nor the problems that our \nschools are having. We know those, too. But I would like to talk about \ntwo areas that I will be addressing as we move to debate this very \nimportant bill.\n  The first area is funding. Frankly, I have been--I couldn't use a \nbetter word--shocked at the low level of funding proposed by the \nadministration. Initially, the administration proposed a $700 million \nincrease. And this from the President who says he is the education \nPresident I find--to be kind--troubling.\n  We all know that throwing money at a problem does not always yield a \nsolution. We also know that the starting salary for teachers is very \nlow. We know that class size has dramatically increased. We know that \nthe property tax which has funded education throughout America is such \nan unpopular tax that local school boards--any one of them you talk \nto--are totally strapped in terms of providing the new dollars that \nthey need to lure teachers, to keep teachers, to expand their schools, \nto wire them.\n  My children attend public schools in New York City. I believe in the \npublic school system. It was good to me; it is being very good to them. \nBut go to any school and talk to the principal--it can be in a large \ncity; it can be in a small rural town; it can be in a suburban area--\nand they will tell you that these days, with all the demands placed on \neducation, they do not have the dollars, plain and simple. And their \nschool boards tell them that the property tax taxpayers, justifiably \nand understandably, believe that the property taxes are so high they \ncannot raise them.\n  That may not be true in every school district that I visit, but it is \ntrue in the overwhelming majority throughout my State, and my State is \nso large it has school districts that mirror those in just about every \nother State. There are even many that resemble those in rural Colorado, \nsuch as in the Adirondack Mountains, I say to the Presiding Officer.\n  So money is a problem. We will debate during the consideration of \nthis bill how to spend money, as we should. I tend to be supportive of \nthe President's desire for accountability in testing. Testing isn't the \nonly answer, but it is part of the answer. If you have too subjective a \ntest, teachers, recognizing they will only be measured by how they \ngrade their own students, will inflate the values. So you need some \nkind of objective testing. I agree with the President on that.\n  I do not want to lower the bar. I do not think a child should be \npromoted from the second grade to the third grade if they are reading \nat the first grade level. I do not think there should be teachers in \nour schools who do not know much about math who are teaching math. But \nkeep the bar high, my colleagues. You have to provide the wherewithal \nto get people over that bar. The localities can no longer do it.\n  So if you believe that education is a national imperative--which I \ndo--if you believe in this country, and want us to stay the leading \neconomic power in the world, and you believe that education, No. 1, \nwill keep us there or sink us, you have to then increase the Federal \nrole.\n  The President campaigned on that. Thank God he said the days when \nmany wanted to abolish the Department of Education are over. He \nunderstood there was a Federal need and a Federal role. In the way he \ncampaigned, I was very enthusiastic about his role in education. If you \nhad to sum it up, you would say: Do not lower the bar but provide some \nof the wherewithal to help the localities, the students, the teachers \nto get over that bar. I think that is a great way to do it.\n  I think there are many on our side who will meet the President on \nstandards. But we wish he would be more forthcoming in meeting us on \nincreasing the dollars that education needs because no matter how you \nslice it, every school board is pressed and cannot do the things it \nwants to do.\n\n  So when we propose that there be full funding of title I, when we \npropose, in relation to IDEA, that the Federal Government finally live \nup to its promise and fund 40 percent of what we mandate on localities \nin terms of special education, we are supported by just about every \nschool board in the country, just about every teacher, and almost all \nwho study education.\n  We need to do this to keep our country great. When I see that the \nPresident proposed $700 million, and then goes up to $1.7 billion, but \nproposes 5 times that increase in the military, and proposes 50 times \nthat increase in tax cuts, I say, this is not the education President \nbecause, my colleagues, you cannot just talk the talk. You have to walk \nthe walk. Part of the walk is standards and part of the walk is \nupgrading our schools, but part of the walk is more dollars.\n  So I will be offering an amendment, on which I will be working with \nthe Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, as well as our minority \nleader, that will say, No. 1, there ought to be a certain amount of \nmoney there but, No. 2, the teeth of this amendment says that if we do \nnot appropriate the amount of money that we authorize, then parts of \nthis legislation will not take effect.\n  If we emerge with a paltry increase in education funding, I believe \nthat, first, the President will pay a price, and those who are against \nincreased funding will pay a price but, far more importantly than that, \nAmerica will pay a severe price.\n  We cannot continue to attract the best people into teaching if the \nsalaries are going to be so low, particularly in areas such as math and \nscience. We cannot educate our children very well if they do not have \nup-to-date technology in their classrooms. We cannot educate children \nin schools where the plaster is falling from the ceiling.\n  When my daughter attended kindergarten in PS 230, there were two \nkindergarten classes in one classroom because they did not have enough \nclassroom space for the students. She does not get the extra curricular \nactivity going to a New York City public school that she should. It is \na price we are willing to put up with because of the other advantages \nthat she has going to a public school. But that is just the frills. It \nis the sinew of education that is suffering. As costs go up--the \nenergy, the salaries, and everything else--and education budgets fall \nflat, we fall further and further behind.\n  So if I could make one point to my colleagues it is this: All the \nverbiage and all the legislative language are not going to make much \ndifference if we do not fund them. I urge my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle just to look at our priorities as a whole and ask, Is \nthe tax cut more important than adequately funding education? Is an \nincrease in a new military program more important than funding \neducation? Admittedly, all three are important. But the priorities in \nterms of the amount of money the Republican majority and the President \nhave proposed in this bill are out of whack, not only out of whack with \nthe priorities I might have but out of whack with their own rhetoric. \nIt just does not add up. And that is not right.\n  The second area I would like to talk about is a related area, which \nis teacher quality and attracting teachers. Since I care a lot about \neducation, I go around my State, as I mentioned earlier, and I talk to \nthe superintendents of school districts, principals of schools, \nteachers, and parents.\n\n  When you ask them what their largest problem is, it is very rarely \nthings we talk about. It is recruiting and retaining good teachers. I \nwill talk more about this later because I have some amendments that I \nhave been working on with some of my colleagues--many of them are \nbipartisan--to try to improve the quality of teachers.\n  In almost every corner of America, you cannot get new, good teachers \nin\n\n[[Page S4166]]\n\nmath and science because the starting salary for a teacher in those two \nareas is so outweighed by the amount that the private sector will pay \nyou just cannot get good teachers. We had 40,000 new math and science \nteachers in America last year, and 3,000 majored or minored in math or \nscience--3,000. The other 37,000 did not have the background. Some of \nthem might be good teachers, but if this is such an important subject, \ndon't we want someone with an adequate background?\n  In every corner of my State, people talk about this problem. In the \npast, we were lucky in America. We had captive cohorts of people who \nwent into teaching. In the 1930s and 1940s, we had Depression babies, \npeople who knew the pain of unemployment in their homes. They went out \nand got a civil service job. It might not have paid that much, but they \nhad job security.\n  Then in the 1950s and 1960s, we had fabulous women go into teaching. \nIn those days, so many other careers were not open and available to \nwomen, so they became teachers. Some became nurses. I am talking about \nteachers today, but for both fields the cause was the same. Because of \nthe lifting of the barriers, half the medical school enrollees today \nare women and half the law school enrollees are also women. That is \ngreat. That is America living up to its potential. We no longer have a \ncaptive audience of teachers.\n\n  Then there was a third cohort. We often forget, but large numbers of \nyoung men in the late 1960s and early 1970s went into teaching because \nyou would get draft deferment. And particularly during the Vietnam war, \nwhen millions of young men did not want to go fight that war for \nwhatever reason, they became teachers. Many stayed.\n  At open school night for my daughter, who is in the 11th grade, I \nasked her six teachers in her six subjects how they became teachers. \nThere were three women. They fit the category I mentioned. And there \nwere three men, all three of whom started teaching in the late 1960s.\n  Those captive audiences of teachers are gone. In fact, the average \nage of a teacher in America is around 50. Half our teachers will retire \nin the next decade. If we don't do anything, the people we replace them \nwith will not be close to as good or as dedicated, and our educational \nsystem, which has trouble now, will get worse.\n  Studies show that the most important things in how well a student \ndoes in school are the values and input from that student's family. We \nare not here changing that right now. We need prayer and internal \nworkings and spirituality and a lot of other things to bring the family \nback up. I believe strongly in that, although I don't think it is a \ngovernmental matter. But the second largest thing that influences how \nwell a student does is the quality of the teacher.\n  I have always supported reducing the number of kids in the classroom, \nbut I don't think it is as important as improving the quality of the \nteacher. I would rather have a good teacher for 21 kids than a mediocre \nteacher for 18. If we can't replace all the good teachers for the 21 \nkids, we have real trouble. We can't even start talking about class \nsize. Yet that is what is happening. We have to change that. If we \ncould do one thing in the educational system, that is what we have to \ndo.\n  Now, how do we do it? Well, certainly we want teachers to have more \nprestige. I am totally befuddled by those who would try to improve the \neducational system by bashing teachers. It makes no sense to me. Most \nteachers I meet are pretty good and pretty dedicated. There are some \nbad apples, as there are in every profession, but overall they are \npretty good.\n  I just flew home last night. My young daughter, who is 12, was in her \nschool concert. She plays the oboe. We have been hearing the oboe play \n``Watermelon Man'' for the last 3 months in the house. Why the oboe? \nBecause she is a nice kid, and her music teacher said: Alison, if you \ndon't play the oboe, we will have no oboe in the Hudde Junior High \nSchool band. She said: OK.\n  Now she regrets it because she is more a trumpet-type girl than an \noboe-type girl. But the music teacher was fabulous, a dedicated man; \nyou could see him get up there. These kids who were in the sixth grade, \nwho had only been playing their instruments for 6 months, were great. \nLast night, that person personified, to me, the dedication of so many \nteachers, to take these kids, sixth graders, 12-year-olds--they would \nrather be doing a lot of other things--and get them to play so well \ntogether.\n  We have to make teaching more prestigious, and we should praise our \nteachers when they do good. We have to give teachers more authority in \nthe classroom. The rules and regulations that prevent a teacher from \ndealing with an unruly student go overboard. I would rather see those \nchanged and give the teacher more authority and not see teachers \nworried that they will be sued for this or that if they try to exercise \nsome authority. All those things are necessary. Most of them are up to \nthe locals.\n\n  But we will not improve teachers unless we raise the salaries. The \nreality is, right now we ask people to make sacrifices. In New York \nCity, we can't get certified teachers for all the reasons I mentioned. \nHow about in our wealthy suburbs where a starting salary for a teacher \nis pretty good, $35,000, which in New York, Long Island, for instance, \nis not a lot. You can do a lot more with $35,000 in Mississippi than \nyou can in Long Island, but it is still not bad. When do they all quit? \nThree years later when they have to buy a home.\n  Unless we do more for teachers' salaries, we won't solve the problem. \nUnless we do more to help give prestige to teachers, we won't solve the \nproblem. Unless we give teachers some support in the classroom, we \nwon't solve the problem. It takes money, and it takes standards, both. \nYou can't have one; you can't have the other. You need both. Just \nmoney, low standards, forget it. It is wasted. Just standards, low \nmoney, you won't get the people who can meet the standards.\n  The second area I will be focusing on as we debate this bill in the \nweeks ahead is how to improve the quality of our teachers. It is key. I \nwouldn't want this choice, but I would rather have a school that is a \nlittle old and a little grimy with a teacher who really cared and did a \ngreat job than a brand spanking new school and a mediocre teacher. I \nwould rather have almost nothing in the education world except for \nparents who watched their kids and taught them values and helped them \nwith their homework. That is probably first. But second? Good teachers.\n  You get what you pay for, when the starting salary for a teacher now \nin America is $26,000 in what should be the exalted profession of the \n21st century, particularly in math and science, but even some other \nareas, special ed, languages, computer skills.\n  I hope my colleagues will pay attention to this debate. It is crucial \nfor America. I hope it will be a long and full debate. I hope that I \nwill get the kind of bipartisan support that I think the measures I am \ntalking about deserve.\n  I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions).

We reauthorized \nit last year finally after 5 years. It is important we did that because \nso many of those programs drive results at the local community level \nthat are extremely valuable to all of us.\n  With this authorization, Congress was able to add an important \ncomponent to the act, and that was the program to authorize $125 \nmillion to establish a new National Family Caregivers Support Program \nto provide grants to States to provide information and services to \nfamily caregivers, another one of those broadening concepts on which we \nwork with the senior community of our Nation.\n  I wanted to take time briefly this morning to recognize May as Older \nAmericans Month and the resolution that was submitted yesterday by \nmyself and others.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/02/senate-section/article/S4167-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GET-WELL CARD\n\n  Mr. BURNS.

Mr. President, today I rise before you to honor the service \nof recently retired Chief Robert E. Langston of the U.S. Park Police. \nChief Langston has honorably served the Department of the Interior, the \nNational Park Service, and U.S. Park Police for over 30 years.\n  Chief Langston has led America's oldest Federal uniformed law \nenforcement agency, formed by President George Washington to serve the \npublic squares of the District of Columbia. Congress later gave the \nPark Police the same powers and duties as the D.C. Metropolitan Police, \nand the Park Police have become a primary partner in keeping the peace.\n  Countless numbers of the visiting public tour Washington's monuments \nat all hours of the day and night with a confidence that they can visit \nthese national treasures safely. What a testament that is to the Park \nPolice, and to the Park Police leadership. How many other places, in a \nmajor urban area, can so many have so much confidence on such a regular \nbasis, at all hours of the night? In fact, the Park Police are so good \nat what they do, that it is sometimes all too easy to take their \nvaliant services for granted.\n  So in honoring Chief Langston, today, we also honor the entire Park \nPolice, a full service department with over 800 officers and \ninvestigators and over 100 civilian employees. Among its jurisdiction, \nthe Park Police are assigned to National Park Service lands, parkways, \nmonuments, and memorials in Washington, DC, New York City, and San \nFrancisco, CA.\n  Members of the force are trained at the Federal Law Enforcement \nTraining Center in Georgia, and provide a complete range of police \nservices from foot and cruiser patrols to highly complex missions such \nas search and rescue, antinarcotics operations, and dignitary \nprotection that includes protecting the President of the United States.\n  To support its operations, the force draws on resources that include \naward-winning air, water, and horseback units. The Park Police are so \nrenowned for their attention to detail that they often are called upon \nby other law enforcement agencies to sites often far away from their \npermanent headquarters.\n  For over three decades, Chief Robert Langston has been an active and \nintegral part of this esteemed and proud organization. Indeed, it is \nfrom a long tradition of police personnel who are of his high caliber \nthat the Park Police have drawn their source of pride in their \ncompetence and their quality.\n  Chief Langston began his career with a bachelor of science degree in \ncriminology from Florida State University. He started work as a Park \nPolice patrolman covering foot, cruiser and motorcycle assignments. \nEven with the challenge of full-time police duty and a young family, he \ncontinued his education at the University of Virginia with master level \ncourses in police administration, and at the FBI Academy in Quantico, \nVA. He was promoted to sergeant in 1971 with service in the training \nbranch and later in the operations division as a patrol sergeant. In \n1973, he was promoted to lieutenant and served as shift commander \nbefore accepting command of the communications section. He was promoted \nagain, in 1975, to the rank of captain, and assigned as watch commander \nin the National Park Service's Southeast Region. Upon returning to \nWashington, he served as commander of the operations division's central \ndistrict, and was promoted to major. His upward progress only \ncontinued, and he was selected as deputy chief in charge of the field \noffices division. In 1988, he became the assistant chief of police, and \nwas named Chief of Police in 1991.\n  After nearly a decade of service as chief, Bob Langston still is the \nsame gentleman of great enthusiasm and commitment that shows through in \neverything he does. His selfless dedication to duty has been thoroughly \ntime-tested and consistently proven throughout each stage of his \ncareer. Even when resources were stretched and duty was intense, he \ncalmly provided direction and oversight for the department. Through \nsome of the most trying times literally in our Nation's history, Chief \nLangston always did much more than his duty.\n  Through it all, he stayed active in professional and civic \norganizations, such as the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice, the D.C. and Maryland Chiefs of Police Association, and the \nFederal Law Enforcement Training Commission, to name only a few. Here, \ntoo, he willingly accepted the call to leadership, and served as \npresident of the FBI National Academy Associates, and a member of the \nBethesda-Chevy Chase Rescue Squad for over 40 years, with 15 years as \nrescue squad president.\n  Chief Langston has gained much recognition for his service and \nexceptional efforts as part of the U.S. Park Police. He has been \nawarded the regional director's award for excellence as well as the \nMarshals Service award for outstanding service and the State \nDepartment's diplomatic service award for outstanding service.\n  For all his professional achievements, Chief Robert Langston is most\n\n[[Page S4168]]\n\nadmired and respected for simply being a kind, decent human being who \nnever let rising through the ranks cloud his eyes from seeing things \nfrom the grassroots perspective as well as from the bird's eye view. \nHis associates know him as a seasoned professional and his subordinates \nknow him as a mentor; but, his neighbors know him simply as a trusted \nfriend, and his wife Beverly, son Robert and daughter Kellie know him \nas a caring husband and faithful father. All who know Bob Langston know \nhim as an upstanding Christian man of sterling integrity who is a role \nmodel in all that he does.\n  I know his colleagues, friends and family join me today when we say \nto Chief Robert Langston, thank you for staying the course and thank \nyou for helping mold and maintain the Park Police into one of the truly \ngreat police forces of our Nation. In an unpredictable world, Chief \nLangston and the men and women of the Park Police do their duty with a \ndiligence that is dependable, supporting us and keeping us safe to \nenjoy sacred symbols of freedom that the Department of the Interior, \nthe National Park Service, and the U.S. Park Police both protect and in \nfact embody for the people of America and for the future of our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/02/senate-section/article/S4168-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF CONGRESS'S CREATION OF AMTRAK\n\n  Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, Yesterday marked the thirtieth \nanniversary of Congress's creation of Amtrak. Congress acted then \nbecause we realized that along with cars and planes, passenger rail was \na vital part of America's transportation future. Today the need for \npassenger rail is greater than ever. All across this great land, \ntravelers are facing gridlock not only on our highways but we are \nquickly approaching it in our skies too.\n  I believe many Americans are growing tired of spending so many hours \nstuck in traffic, or hanging around airport terminals. They want an \nalternative, now.\n  Fortunately, there is an alternative to growing gridlock and \n``winglock.'' It is called high-speed passenger rail, and it is a way \nof traveling that is pleasant and easy, and allows travelers to make \nthe most of their valuable time.\n  So far, high-speed rail exists only in the Northeast. But Amtrak's \nvision is to build a national passenger railroad system consisting of \nmany regional high-speed corridors linked by long-distance service. \nThis plan will bring another option to the American business traveler, \ncommuter and tourist no matter where they live.\n  That is why I strongly support the High Speed Rail Investment Act of \n2001. It will provide Amtrak with what our highways and airports \nalready have: a source of long-term capital with which to build the \nhigh-speed rail corridors of the future.\n  With high-speed rail, we can give travelers the choices they deserve, \nand improve our over burdened transportation system. Passage of the \nHigh Speed Rail Act of 2001 isn't just in Amtrak's interest; it is in \nAmerica's interest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/02/senate-section/article/S4168-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    THE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY CARE ACT\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

The bill will \ncreate three Centers of Excellence under the National Institutes of \nHealth. These centers will conduct basic and clinical research that \nwill help move scientific discoveries from the laboratory to the \nbedside. The act also ensures that the Centers of Disease Control and \nPrevention will conduct basic epidemiological research and data \nanalysis of the impact this disease has on our country.\n  The passage of this legislation will help improve the quality and \nlength of life for tens of thousands who suffer from muscular \ndystrophy.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about hate \ncrimes legislation I introduced with Senator Kennedy last month. The \nLocal Law Enforcement Act of 2001 would add new categories to current \nhate crimes legislation sending a signal that violence of any kind is \nunacceptable in our society.\n  Today I would like to detail a heinous crime that occurred June 1, \n2000, in Baltimore, MD. Gary William Mick, 25, pleaded guilty to first-\ndegree murder, attempted murder, and armed robbery after admitting that \nhe murdered a gay man and tried to kill another because, he told \npolice, he thought gay men were ``evil.'' In the first attack, a New \nJersey man was bludgeoned to death with a claw hammer at the Admiral \nFell Inn in Fells Point. Mick met his second victim, a dentist, at a \nbar, had dinner with him and went home with him. He later attacked him \nwith a knife. The men struggled and the victim escaped. The perpetrator \ntold police that a childhood incident caused him to hate homosexuals.\n  I believe that government's first duty is to defend its citizens, to \ndefend them against the harms that come out of hate. The Local Law \nEnforcement Enhancement Act of 2001 is now a symbol that can become \nsubstance. I believe by passing this legislation, we can change hearts \nand minds as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/02/senate-section/article/S4168-4", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, I ask that a ``Passover Message from \nRabbi Israel Zoberman'' be printed in the Record.\n  The message is as follows:\n\n       The Biblical account of the Exodus from Egypt became the \n     Leitmotif of Rabbinic theology, perceiving in the Israelites' \n     redemption from a House of Bondage God's guidance and \n     goodness. Thus the three Pilgrim Festivals of Pesach, Shavuot \n     and Sukkot, revolving around the common theme of the Exodus, \n     point at the divine gifts of both freedom and responsibility \n     as essential requirements for fulfilling the human potential.\n       The awesome and complex journey-physically, spiritually and \n     psychologically--from servitude to liberation of the people \n     of Israel was to be a model for the entire human family, \n     culminating the Messianic vision of a world redeemed in the \n     prophetic promise. We have chosen to transform the bitter \n     herbs of our exile into the sweet charoset of homecoming in \n     all. It is the symbolic hovering presence at the Seder table \n     of the prophet Elijah for whom we open the door and set aside \n     a special cup of wine, which provides the eternal hope for \n     universal shalom. It is the peace we have kept alive as a \n     flickering light in the darkness of a trying and challenging \n     history.\n       Our Passover joy is diminished through by the continued \n     detention in China of the twenty-four-member crew of the U.S. \n     Navy plane as we pray and call for their release, as well as \n     the release of Dr. Gao Zhan, who has been separated for too \n     long from her husband and child in Virginia. The festival's \n     promise by a compassionately passionate heritage is \n     ultimately rooted in its revolutionary view of the infinite \n     worth of each of the Creator's children, recalling that God \n     silenced the angels on high when jubilant at the drowning\n\n[[Page S4169]]\n\n     of the Pharaoh's troops. When we particularly preserve our \n     adversary's humanity, difficult as it is, we maintain our own \n     essential human stature.\n       We rejoice in the presence of our special guest, Adam \n     Nguyen, who escaped from Vietnam in 1971 and is president of \n     the Zen Buddhism Association of Hampton Roads and whose first \n     Seder it is. As we share our celebration with him, we protest \n     the destruction and desecration of the irreplaceable, \n     precious and priceless two giant Buddha statues from the \n     third and fifth centuries respectively, by the oppressive and \n     repressive Taliban regime in Afghanistan.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment out \nof this morning's business to commemorate a very special occasion in \nthe life of a dear friend and a valued advisor, Lillie Petit Gallagher. \nThis Friday, May 4, 2001, marks the last day of a long and \ndistinguished career in public service for Lillie. As the Executive \nDirector of St. Elizabeth Foundation in Baton Rouge, she has not only \ncounseled hundreds of birth mothers but also helped in placing their \nchildren with loving families. In the thirteen years she has served as \nexecutive director of this fine organization, she has been a trusted \nfriend, a surrogate mother, a guardian angel and a wise counsel to \nhundreds of parents and families.\n  The US Census Bureau estimates that in one year 500,000 teenagers \nwill choose to parent their babies; 450,000 will have abortions. \nBecause of people like Lillie, these young adults have the confidence \nand support they need to choose adoption for their child. To \ndemonstrate for you the kind of impact Lillie has had in shaping St. \nElizabeth's, let me read an excerpt from a letter from one of her birth \nmothers, ``I was eighteen and fresh out of a bad relationship when I \nfound out I was pregnant. I can remember not knowing what I was going \nto do. I guess in a lot of ways I just acted as if there was nothing \nwrong. For about three months no one knew of my pregnancy but me and a \nfriend. Then we just really started talking about what to do one day \nand that's when it happened, just like a sign from God, a billboard \nsign saying: ``Pregnant and alone call . . .'' so we rode back to her \nhouse and called. A soft sweet voice answered the phone, ``St. \nElizabeth Foundation.'' That is how I started my friendship and love \nfor the people at St. Elizabeth's.'' This is just one of many examples \nof the special interventions that bring strength, hope and comfort to \nhundreds of families.\n  A native of Cut Off, LA, Lillie's work on behalf of the children of \nLouisiana is not limited to her outstanding work at St. Elizabeth's. \nAfter graduating from St. Mary's Dominican College in New Orleans, she \nreturned to LSU to obtain a graduate degree in child development and \nsocial services. She used those skills to teach early childhood at the \ncollege level, found a Montessori pre-school and served as the founding \ndirector of the statewide Gifted/Talented Program in the Louisiana \nState Department of Education. As if that is not enough, she also spent \nseveral years as host of a popular TV education program.\n  Anyone who meets Lillie knows they have met someone very special. Her \nloving heart and determined spirit make her a tenacious advocate for \nchildren and their families and Louisiana and the Nation have been the \ngreat beneficiary. Her 36 year marriage to her husband, George, serves \nas a loving example, not only to her four beautiful children and \nprecious grandchild, but to the young people she serves. My best wishes \nto you, Lillie, your husband, George, and your beautiful \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/02/senate-section/article/S4169-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4169]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TIMEOUT FOR THE UNINSURED\n\n Mr. SANTORUM. Mr. President, I ask consent that the following \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  The article follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 2, 2001]\n\n                       Timeout for the Uninsured\n\n       House Conferees have been fighting with their Senate \n     counterparts to reduce the spending levels in the \n     congressional budget resolution. No doubt some cuts can be \n     made in the Senate totals without the country's suffering \n     harm. But at least one relatively minor Senate proposal \n     deserves to remain.\n       Oregon Sens. Gordon Smith and Ron Wyden won inclusion in \n     the budget of an additional $28 billion over three years to \n     reduce the number of Americans without health insurance. The \n     money would mainly be spent on lower-income people. Exactly \n     how would be up to the authorizing committees, but an add-on \n     of some kind to Medicaid and/or the children's health \n     insurance program that Congress enacted several years ago \n     seems most likely. The modest expansion would hardly solve \n     the un-insurance problem, but it would push in the right \n     direction.\n       About a seventh of the population remains uninsured. Most \n     are poor or near poor. They lack insurance mainly because \n     they can't afford it. The administration has proposed a tax \n     credit to help those whose employers don't offer insurance. \n     But the credit would cover only part of the cost of an \n     average policy, and most uninsured families still would find \n     such a policy beyond their means. Some people think the \n     industry might respond by offering only partial policies, but \n     it's not clear that would be a good result, either.\n       The administration proposal has some interesting features \n     and would do limited good, but limited is the operative word. \n     The spending programs for the lower-income uninsured have \n     shown themselves to be efficient ways of increasing coverage. \n     Whatever the fate of the tax credit, they should be expanded. \n     Much attention has lately been paid to the health care \n     problems of the already insured. The elderly lack a drug \n     benefit; people enrolled in managed care complain that care \n     is sometimes sacrificed to cost. But at least these people \n     have insurance. More than 40 million don't. The budget \n     argument this year has been mainly about how large a tax cut \n     to give the better-off. What about a timeout to pay a little \n     heed to those who can't afford to get sick?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/02/senate-section/article/S4169-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4169-S4170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            DR.

The \ndedication and compassion demonstrated by these 10 inspiring senior \ncitizens who have been nominated to the Dr. Nan S. Hutchison Broward \nSenior Hall of Fame is truly exceptional. The selfless efforts of these \nnominees to address the needs of individuals in all walks of life serve \nas an example for others throughout our Nation to emulate.\n  This year's honorees are Ilo Cox, Sydney Dworkin, Flora Fasciani, Ena \nHenry, Edward Levy, Johnnie McCray, Elizabeth Phillips Scheuerman, Bert \nSoft, Lotte Stein, and Ralph Weinstein.\n  Ilo Cox has endeavored to improve the quality of life for Floridians \nby promoting such diverse initiatives as crime prevention, community \ndevelopment, advancement of the arts and funding research to find a \ncure for cystic fibrosis. In addition, she has held positions of \nleadership with the Fort Lauderdale Woman's Club.\n  Sydney Dworkin has given generously of his time to the Florida Lakes \nAlzheimer Care Center since its inception in 1993. At the center he \nbrings warmth and light into the lives of all those whom he assists. He \nhas recognized the importance of a friendship in the life of someone \nafflicted by a mentally debilitating disease.\n  Flora Fasciani has been a steadfast supporter of children's programs \nand charities, coordinating and supervising several fundraising \nSalvation Army balls in Broward. She also acts as a spokesperson for \nthe University of Miami Organ Donor Program and organizes the biannual \nRed Cross blood drive.\n  Ena Henry has been an active member of her church community; \nvolunteering her time in programs aimed at educating the youth and \nfostering a\n\n[[Page S4170]]\n\nbond between the younger and older generations. In addition, she \nprovides relief to disaster victims and aids indigent families of \nprisoners during the holiday season, supplying them with food and \ngifts.\n  Edward Levy uses his own experience as a wounded ex-soldier to aid \nfellow ex-servicemen. For the last 25 years he has generously \nvolunteered countless hours assisting veterans, widows, and dependents. \nHe also participates in the Broward Meals on Wheels program, delivering \nmeals to homebound seniors.\n  Johnnie McCray is an invaluable asset to her community. She has acted \nas a key fundraiser for the executive board of the Sylvia Poitier T. \nWilliams Senior Center. Moreover, she has been active in a multitude of \narea organizations, including the Negro Chamber of Commerce, the South \nFlorida Association of Woman's Clubs and the Florida Association of \nWomen's and Girl's Clubs.\n  Elizabeth Phillips Scheuerman has been a champion of literacy in the \nBroward area. Through the efforts of this former Florida State \npresident of the American Association of University Women, the \ncommunity was able to obtain its first bookmobile. In addition, she has \nbeen active in the Symphony Society, the Gold Circle of NOVA \nUniversity, and the American Cancer Society.\n  Bert Soft is a woman of valor. Overcoming personal tragedy, she \nfounded the Frank Soff Chapter of the Alzheimer's Family Center. Under \nher leadership, the chapter's membership has grown from 13 to 170 \nmembers. Her initiative and persistence have earned her acknowledgment \nas the Deborah ``Woman of the Year'' and the Florida Association of \nNon-Profit Organizations' ``Woman of Valor.''\n  Lottie Stein has been instrumental in implementing community \nimprovement and awareness programs. She is actively involved with \ncitizen crime-watch organizations and has been commended for her \nefforts in launching the GIVE program, which attempts to attract people \nto the volunteer experience.\n  Ralph Weinstein was a key actor in the foundation and incorporation \nof the first Alzheimer's Day Care Center in Broward County at the \nNortheast Focal Point Center. Through this organization he addresses \nthe physical and emotional needs of children, adults, seniors, and \nAlzheimer's patients.\n  Florida and Broward County are fortunate to have these exceptional \nmen and women who have given so much of themselves to the community. I \ncongratulate them today and wish for them many more productive and \nhealthy years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/02/senate-section/article/S4170-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4170]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JAMES SCHIBIG\n\n Mrs. CARNAHAN.

Mr. President, it is with both pride and sadness \nthat I ask the Senate to pause briefly so that I may share a little of \nthe remarkable life of Betty Times, a long-serving Marin County civil \nservant, political activist and human rights advocate, who died last \nThursday after an 8-year battle with cancer.\n  Betty Times was born 62 years ago in Louisiana, and moved at age 5 to \nMarin City where her father worked at the Marinship shipyard in \nSausalito. Mrs. Times lived in and enriched the community of Marin City \nand the County of Marin for 56 years.\n  She leaves a lasting legacy of community service that includes 14 \nyears as head of Marin County's Citizens Service Office, 18 years on \nthe Sausalito School Board, one term on the Marin General Hospital \ndistrict board, and countless years of leadership in Marin City, as a \nmother of five, a mentor, chairman of the board of the Community \nDevelopment Corporation and as executive director of the Marin City \nProject.\n  I first got to know Betty more than 20 years ago when I served as a \nMarin County supervisor, and we were both founding members of the local \nchapter of the National Women's Political Caucus. She also served as \nvice president of the national NWPC.\n  Betty somehow also found the time to serve as an active member of the \nDemocratic Party, and was a longtime member of the State and local \nDemocratic Central Committees as well as a 1976 delegate to the \nDemocratic National Convention. In 1991, she was elected to the Marin \nWomen's Hall of Fame.\n  Just this February and as her health was failing, Betty was honored \nfor her years of service by the Marin County Grass Roots Leadership \nNetwork. She is also the recipient of the Martin Luther King \nHumanitarian Award from the Marin County Human Rights Commission.\n  I think Betty's daughter, Ida, put it best when she said: ``My mother \nwas the strongest person I know. She instilled very strong values in \nall of us, even her grandchildren. She was my best friend, and we were \nall incredibly proud of her. Her impact in this county rippled \nthroughout the State.''\n  I am a better person for having known and worked wit Betty Times. I \nextend my sincere condolences to Betty's husband John, her mother Alice \nColeman, and to her large and loving family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/02/senate-section/article/S4170-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4170-S4171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRIBUTE TO STATE OF HAWAII REPRESENTATIVE HELENE HALE\n\n Mr. INOUYE.

Mr. President, I want to tell you about one of \nmy constituents, Julianne Woodle. Julianne was raised in St. Louis and \nwent to the University of Missouri-Columbia after high school. As she \nworked toward a bachelor's degree in children and group settings, she \nplanned to take her degree and find a job in the classroom. She dreamed \nof working with preschoolers in a childcare center, helping them \ndevelop the social and mental skills necessary to start school.\n  When she graduated in 1998, she started looking for a job. There were \nmany available, but none of them paid enough for her to live on. She \nlooked for more than a month, but seven or eight dollars an hour was \nthe most anyone could pay her. Julianne still dreamed of working with \nyoung children in a classroom setting, but she had to make a living. It \nwas a hard choice, but Julianne decided to go back to school. She hopes \nthat a master's degree will allow her to find a job where she can work \nwith children and still earn a decent salary.\n  It is because of people like Julianne that I cosponsored S.R. 79, \ncalling for the designation of May 1, 2001 as ``National Child Care \nWorthy Wage Day.'' This resolution calls on the President to set aside \nthe first day in May as ``National Child Care Worthy Wage Day.''\n  Study after study has shown that good quality infant and toddler care \nhas positive long term effects on children, and that poor quality care \ncan have devastating effects. Despite the extreme importance of their \nwork, child care providers earn an average of only $7.42 an hour \nnationally. In Missouri the average is even lower, just $7.02 an hour. \nThe average housekeeper and restaurant worker make more.\n  Child care providers are largely responsible for the social, \nemotional, and mental development of the children in their care, yet we \ndo not pay enough to attract qualified individuals to the field. \nInstead young graduates like Julianne, who really want to nurture and \nteach young children, are forced to look elsewhere for jobs. It is a \npressing national problem, and it deserves recognition and attention \nfrom our national leaders. The resolution is a symbolic action, but it \nis an important one. We must bring this issue to the forefront of \npublic discussion.\n  We owe it to our children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/02/senate-section/article/S4171-2", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/02/senate-section/article/S4171-3", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/02/senate-section/article/S4171-4", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4171]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA COURTS FISCAL YEAR 2002 BUDGET \n             SUBMISSION--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 16\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the District of Columbia Code, as amended, I am \ntransmitting the District of Columbia Courts FY 2002 Budget Submission.\n  The District of Columbia Courts have submitted a FY 2002 budget \nrequest for $111.7 million for operating expenses, $41.4 million for \ncapital improvements to courthouse facilities, and $39.7 million for \nDefender Services in the District of Columbia Courts.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Massachusetts relative to \n     benefits for all retired career military personnel; to the \n     Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n       Whereas, American servicemen and women have dedicated their \n     lives and careers to protect the rights we all enjoy; and\n       Whereas, in serving our country, career military personnel \n     endured hardships, deprivation and threats of death, \n     disability and long separations from their families; and\n       Whereas, integral to the success of our military forces are \n     those military personnel who have made careers of defending \n     our great Nation during times of both war and peace from the \n     revolutionary war to present day; and\n       Whereas, there exists a gross inequity in the Federal \n     Statutes that denies equal rights to disabled career military \n     who seek to receive Veterans Administration disability \n     compensation concurrent with the receipt of earned military \n     pay; and\n       Whereas, legislation has been introduced in the United \n     States Congress to remedy this inequity applicable to career \n     military personnel dating back to the nineteenth century; and\n       Whereas, the injustice concerns those who are retired, are \n     denied concurrent receipt of hard earned military retirement \n     pay and Veterans Administration awards for service-connected \n     disabilities; and\n       Whereas, career military earn retirement benefits based on \n     longevity for honorable and faithful service and rank at the \n     time of retirement; and\n       Whereas, Veterans Administration compensations serve a \n     different purpose from longevity retired pay and are intended \n     to compensate for pain, suffering, disfigurement, chemicals, \n     wound injuries and loss of earning ability, with a minimum \n     requirement of 90 days active duty; and\n       Whereas, the prevailing idea that military retirement pay \n     is free is false as there is a contribution to retirement pay \n     which is calculated to reduce military base pay and \n     retirement pay by 7 per cent when pay and allowances are \n     computed and approved by Congress; and\n       Whereas, traditionally, a career military person receives a \n     lower pay and retirement than his or her civilian counterpart \n     and has invested a life of hardships and long hours without \n     the benefit of overtime pay and with a lack of freedom of \n     expression through the unions; and\n       Whereas, the Veterans Administration awards to disabled \n     veterans with a 30 percent disability or more an allowance \n     for each dependent and the allowance is increased with the \n     amount of disability; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Defense deducts the entire \n     amount of a dependent's allowance, essentially leaving a \n     disabled military retiree without a dependent's allowance, \n     thereby extending the discrimination to families of military \n     longevity retirees; and\n       Whereas, it is unfair to require disabled military retirees \n     to fund their own Veterans Administration compensation by \n     deductions on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the Department of \n     Defense; and\n       Whereas, no such deduction applies to similarly situated \n     federal civil service or congressional retirement benefits to \n     receive Veterans Administration compensation; and\n       Whereas, a statutory change is necessary to correct this \n     injustice and discrimination in order to insure that \n     America's commitment to national and international goals will \n     be matched by the same allegiance to those who sacrificed on \n     behalf of those goals; now therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Massachusetts Senate respectfully urges \n     the Congress of the United States to enact legislation to \n     provide parity of benefits to all retired career military \n     personnel; and be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be transmitted \n     forthwith by the Clerk of the Senate to the President of the \n     United States, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairmen of the \n     Armed Forces Committee and the Veterans Affairs Committee, \n     the House and Senate Majority and Minority Leaders, the \n     presiding officer of each branch of Congress and to the \n     members thereof from the commonwealth.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-39. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of Guam \n     relative to Federal funds for upgrades in education, water, \n     and hospital; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                           Resolution No. 27\n\n       Whereas, Guam's tourism-based economy has been suffering \n     over the last few years due to the Asian economic crisis, \n     resulting in government budget shortfalls, an increased \n     government deficit, layoffs of many private and public sector \n     employees, and an unemployment rate that may be as high as \n     twenty percent (20%); and\n       Whereas, such economic reversal and a high unemployment \n     rate would be considered an economic disaster in most parts \n     of the United States; and\n       Whereas, Guam's water and sewer infrastructure has \n     deteriorated over the years to the point where it is no \n     longer sufficient to support the Island's growing population; \n     and where it is badly corroded and in disrepair in some \n     areas, resulting in a costly waste of water, costly spot \n     repairs, and low or no water pressure in some areas of the \n     Island; and\n       Whereas, Guam's population has grown beyond the capacity of \n     its school facilities, resulting in the overcrowding and \n     deterioration of existing school facilities, a condition that \n     is a detriment to the education of the Island's youth, and \n     ultimately is detrimental to all aspects of the local \n     community; and\n       Whereas, the Guam Memorial hospital, Guam's only hospital \n     and emergency care facility, is also badly in need of upgrade \n     and expansion, to the point where many patients must be sent \n     to off-Guam facilities for emergency or specialized care at \n     great expense to the government and local families, an \n     expense that many families cannot afford; and\n       Whereas, Guam's tourism industry, which faces an uphill \n     struggle to recovery after a prolonged slump, is in need of \n     an economic boost and an upgrade in infrastructure and \n     facilities; and\n       Whereas, the United States economy has seen a tremendous \n     boom in the last decade, whilst the Federal Government has \n     seen budget surpluses unprecedented in recent times, with the \n     budget surplus for Fiscal Year 2000 expected to be One \n     Hundred Seventy Billion Dollars ($170,000,000,000) and the \n     surplus through 2010 predicted by President Clinton to be \n     Seven Hundred Forty-six Billion Dollars ($746,000,000,000); \n     and\n       Whereas, Guam has made its contribution to the political \n     security and stability of the United States that has helped \n     to nurture this vibrant economic growth by giving up a large \n     portion of its small land mass to the U.S. Department of \n     Defense for military installations, which were critical to \n     American security for decades, now therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That I Mina'Bente Sais Na Liheslaturan Guahan \n     does hereby, on behalf of the people of Guam, respectfully \n     request that the United States Congress appropriate One \n     Hundred Ninety-three Million Dollars ($193,000,000) to the \n     government of Guam for the following purposes:\n       (1) Forty-eight Million Dollars ($48,000,000) to build \n     eight (8) new elementary schools in the Villages of Dededo, \n     Yigo, Tamuning, Mangilao, Barrigada, Yona, Sinajana, Agat and \n     Mongmong-Toto-Maite;\n       (2) Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) to build one (1) \n     new middle school in Dededo, which is by far the most \n     populated village on Guam;\n       (3) Thirty Million Dollars ($30,000,000) to build one (1) \n     new high school in Northern Guam, which has deteriorating and \n     dangerously crowded schools in Tamuning and Yigo that suffer \n     from teen violence and other problems as a result of the lack \n     of attention that comes from overcrowded schools;\n       (4) Seventy-five Million Dollars ($75,000,000) for the Guam \n     Waterworks Authority to improve a badly corroded and leaking \n     sewer and water infrastructure that results in low water \n     pressure in many areas, wasting water resources daily and \n     incurring large numbers of manpower hours fixing spot leaks \n     that surface;\n       (5) Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000) for upgrading and \n     expanding facilities at the Guam Memorial Hospital, which is \n     insufficient, as Guam's only hospital and emergency care \n     facility, to provide for vital health care services to people \n     on Guam, who must seek prohibitively expensive care off-Guam, \n     as well as providing health care to the people of Micronesia \n     who have been granted access to Guam's medical infrastructure \n     due to the compacts of free association entered into by the \n     United States of America and these Pacific Nations; and be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the United States Congress and the President \n     of the United States delegate the Officer In Charge of \n     Construction (``OICC'') of the U.S. Naval command on Guam, \n     otherwise known as Commander Naval Forces Marianas, to \n     oversee all aspects of infrastructure construction detailed \n     herein, inclusive of contract management, procurement, etc.; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the United States Congress is requested to \n     stipulate as a condition of this funding, in legislation, a \n     detailed deficit reduction plan for Guam which the government \n     of Guam shall adhere to for the purpose of eliminating the \n     deficit in the General Fund of the government of Guam within \n     seven (7) years; and be it further.\n       Resolved, That the Speaker certify, and the Legislative \n     Secretary attests to, the adoption hereof and that copies of \n     the same be thereafter transmitted to the Honorable George W. \n     Bush, President of the United States;

A resolution adopted by the Legislature of Guam \n     relative to amending the 1950 Organic Act of Guam; to the \n     Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                         Resolution No. 22 (LS)\n\n       Whereas, some of the most vital services provided by the \n     government of Guam are the public health services, including \n     the services of Guam's public hospital, the Guam Memorial \n     Hospital; and\n       Whereas, without an efficient and well-run hospital and \n     public health service, the health and well-being of the \n     people of Guam are in severe danger, and the lives of the \n     people of Guam are in jeopardy; and\n       Whereas, without an efficient and well-run hospital and \n     public health service, many people on Guam are faced with the \n     grim prospect of looking to off-Guam health facilities to \n     provide life-saving treatment; and\n       Whereas, the cost of travel to facilities that provide such \n     life-saving treatment can be prohibitive, especially for many \n     of our people without the means; and in addition, the health \n     of people in severe cases may not withstand the travel; and\n       Whereas, the current language of the Organic Act of Guam in \n     regards to the administration of the public health services \n     is restrictive, preventing creative and sensible solutions to \n     the management problems of the Guam Memorial Hospital and \n     other public health services; and\n       Whereas, amending the Organic Act of Guam to allow the laws \n     of Guam to govern the public health and hospital services, as \n     the United States Congress did with the public education \n     system on Guam, would be a more accountable and less \n     restrictive solution; and\n       Whereas, such a solution has the potential to revitalize \n     and streamline Guam's public health and hospital, and \n     therefore has the potential to improve public health on Guam \n     and save the lives of people who depend on such vital \n     services; and\n       Whereas, the importance of such a life-saving and health-\n     improving solution cannot be overstated, and action should \n     not be delayed any further; now therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That I MinaBente Sais Na Liheslaturan Guahan does \n     hereby, on behalf of the people of Guam, respectfully request \n     the Congress of the United States of America amend Paragraph \n     (a) of Sec. 1421g of Title 48 of the United States Code (1950 \n     Organic Act of Guam) to read as follows:\n       ``(a) Public Health Services. Subject to the laws of Guam, \n     the Government of Guam shall establish, maintain, operate or \n     contract public health services on Guam, including hospitals, \n     dispensaries and quarantine stations, at such places on Guam \n     as may be necessary, and shall promulgate quarantine and \n     sanitary regulations for the protection of Guam against the \n     importation and spread of disease.''; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Speaker certify, and the Legislative \n     Secretary attests to, the adoption hereof and that copies of \n     the same be thereafter transmitted to the Honorable George W. \n     Bush, President of the United States; to the Honorable \n     Richard B.

A bill to establish the Child Care Provider Retention and \nDevelopment Grant Program and the Child Care Provider Scholarship \nProgram; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Focus on \nCommitted and Underpaid Staff for Children's Sake Act. I am pleased \nthat Senator Corzine is joining me as a original cosponsor and that \ncompanion legislation is being introduced in the House today by \nRepresentatives Miller and Gilman.\n  The need for child care has become a daily fact of life for millions \nof parents nationwide. 65 percent of mothers with children under age \nsix and 78 percent of mothers with children ages 6 to 13 are in the \nlabor force. Each day, 13 million preschool children, including 6 \nmillion infants and toddlers, spend some part of their day in child \ncare.\n  The quality of that care has a tremendous impact on the critical \nearly years of children's development. And, the most powerful \ndeterminant of the quality of child care is the training, education, \nand pay of those who spend 8-10 hours a day caring for our children.\n  Yet, what we know about the child care field is alarming. Despite the \nfact that continuity of care is critical for the emotional development \nof children, staff turnover at child care centers averages 30 percent \nper year--four times greater than the turnover rate for elementary \nschool teachers.\n  Despite the fact that we as a society say there is no more important \ntask than helping to raise a child, according to the Bureau of Labor \nStatistics, we pay the average child care worker about $15,400 a year, \nbarely above the poverty level for a family of three. Few child care \nproviders have basic benefits like health coverage or paid leave. Only \na small fraction of child care workers have graduated from college.\n  We pay people millions of dollars a year to throw baseballs, to shoot \nbasketballs, and to swing golf clubs. What does that say about our \npriorities when at the same time we pay those who care for our most \nprecious resource, our children, poverty-level wages?\n  A report released yesterday by the University of California, Berkeley \nand the Center for Child Care Workforce on child care providers' pay, \ntraining and education highlights the current crisis in the child care \nfield. In a survey of child care centers in three California \ncommunities, the study found that three-quarters of all child care \nstaff employed in 1996 were no longer on the job in 2000. Some centers \nreported 100 percent turnover. Additionally, nearly half of the child \ncare providers who had left had a bachelor's degree, compared to only \none-third of the new teachers. Some 49 percent, nearly half, of those \nwho had left their job, left the child care field entirely.\n  It's clear that if we want to attract quality teachers to the child \ncare field, the pay has to better reflect the value we place on their \nwork. We can't attract them and we can't keep them if we don't pay them \na living wage.\n  The legislation I am introducing today will provide states with funds \nto increase child care worker pay based on the level of education, the \ngreater the level of education, the greater the increase in pay. In \naddition, the legislation will provide scholarships of up to $1,500 for \nchild care workers who want to further their early childhood education \ntraining by getting a college degree, an Associate's degree, or a child \ndevelopment associate credential.\n  We will never make significant strides in improving the quality of \nchild care in this nation if we fail to address one of the leading \nproblems, attracting and retaining a quality child care workforce. It \nis time to invest in our children by investing in those who dedicate \ntheir lives to caring for our children.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 814\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Authorization of appropriations.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Research on early brain development and early childhood \n     demonstrates that the experiences children have and the \n     attachments they form early in life have a decisive, long-\n     lasting impact on their later development and learning.\n       (2) High-quality, developmentally appropriate child care \n     beginning in early childhood and continuing through the years \n     that children are in school improves the scholastic success \n     and educational attainments of children that persist into \n     adulthood.\n       (3) According to a growing body of research, the single \n     most important determinant of child care quality is the \n     presence of consistent, sensitive, well-trained, and well-\n     compensated child care providers; however, child care \n     programs nationwide experience high turnover in teaching \n     staff, fueled by poor compensation and few opportunities for \n     advancement.\n       (4) The Department of Labor reports that in 1999 the \n     average wage for a child care provider was $7.42 per hour, or \n     $15,430 annually. For a full-time, full-year work, the wages \n     of a child care provider were not much above the 1999 poverty \n     threshold of $13,423 for a single parent with two children. \n     Family child care providers earned even less. The median wage \n     of a family child care provider in 1999 was $264 weekly, or \n     $13,728 annually.\n       (5) Despite the important role child care providers may \n     play in early child development and learning, child care \n     providers earn less than bus drivers ($26,460), barbers \n     ($20,970), and janitors ($18,220).\n       (6) Employer-sponsored benefits are minimal for most child \n     care staff. Even among child care centers, the availability \n     of health care coverage for staff remains woefully \n     inadequate.\n       (7) To offer compensation that would be sufficient to \n     attract and retain qualified child care staff, child care \n     programs would be required to charge fees that many parents \n     could not afford. In programs that serve low-income children \n     who qualify for Federal and State child care subsidies, the \n     reimbursement rates set by the State strongly influence the \n     level of compensation that staff receive. Current \n     reimbursement rates for center-based child care services and \n     family child care services are insufficient to recruit and \n     retain qualified child care providers and to ensure high-\n     quality services for children.\n       (8) Teachers leaving the profession are replaced by staff \n     with less education and formal training in early child \n     development.\n       (9) As a result of low wages and limited benefits, many \n     child care providers do not stay long in the child care \n     field. Approximately thirty percent of all teaching staff \n     leave their child care centers each year.\n       (10) Child care providers, as well as the children, \n     families, and businesses that depend upon them, suffer the \n     consequences of inadequate compensation. This is true, with \n     few exceptions, for providers in all types of programs: \n     subsidized, nonsubsidized, for-profit, nonprofit, large, and \n     small child care settings.\n       (11) Because of the severe shortage of qualified staff \n     available for employment by child care programs nationwide, \n     several States have recently initiated programs to improve \n     the quality of child care by increasing the training and \n     compensation of child care providers. Such programs encourage \n     the training, education and increased retention of qualified \n     child care providers by offering financial incentives, \n     including scholarships and compensation increases, that range \n     from $350 to $6,500 annually.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to establish \n     the Child Care Provider Retention and Development Grant \n     Program and the Child Care Provider Scholarship Program, to \n     help children receive the high quality child care and early \n     education they need for positive cognitive and social \n     development, by rewarding and promoting retention of \n     committed, qualified child care providers and by providing \n     financial assistance to improve the educational \n     qualifications of child care providers.\n\n     SEC. 3.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated $5,000,000,000 in \n     the aggregate for fiscal years 2002 through 2006 to carry out \n     this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 815. A bill to make improvements to the Arctic Research and Policy \nAct of 1984; to the Committee on Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce legislation \nto improve the operation of the Arctic Research and Policy Act. We have \nabout 17 years of experience with this act, and the time has come to \nmake some modifications to reflect the experience we have gained over \nthat time.\n  The most important feature of this bill is contained in section 4. \nThis section authorizes the Arctic Research Committee, a Presidential \nCommission, to make grants for scientific research. Currently, the \nCommission can make recommendations and set priorities, but it cannot \nmake grants. Our experience with the act and the Commission has shown \nus that research needs that do not fit neatly in a single agency do not \nget funded, even if they are compelling priorities.\n  One example is a proposed Arctic contamination initiative that was \ndeveloped a few years ago after we discovered that pollutants from the \nFormer Soviet Union, including radionuclides, heavy metals and \npersistent organic pollutants, were working their way into the Arctic \nenvironment. It became clear that the job of monitoring and evaluating \nthe threat was too big for any single agency. The Interior Department, \ngiven its vast land management responsibilities in Alaska, was \ninterested. The Commerce Department, given its jurisdiction over \nfisheries issues, was interested. The Department of Health and Human \nServices, given its concern about the health of Alaska's indigenous \npeoples, was interested. The only agency that didn't seem interested in \nthe problem, strangely enough, was the EPA, which at the time was in \nthe process of dismantling its Arctic Contaminants program.\n  Unfortunately, because the job was too big for any single agency, it \nwas difficult to get the level of interagency cooperation necessary for \na coordinated program. Moreover, agencies were unwilling to make a \nsignificant budgetary commitment to a program that wasn't under their \nexclusive control. If the Arctic Research Commission, which recognized \nthe need, had some funding of its own to leverage agency participation \nand help to coordinate the effort, we would know far more about the \nArctic contaminants problem than we do today.\n  Another example is the compelling need to understand the Bering Sea \necosystem. Over the past 20 years we have\n\n[[Page S4181]]\n\nseen significant shifts in some of the populations comprising this \necosystem. King crab populations have declined sharply. Pollock \npopulations have increased sharply. Steller sea lion populations have \ndeclined as have many types of sea birds. Scientists cannot tell us \nwhether these population shifts are due to abiotic factors such as \nclimate change, biotic factors such as predator-prey relationships, or \nsome combination of both. Because the nation depends on this area for a \nsignificant portion of all its seafood, this is not an issue without \nstakeholders. Despite the chorus of interests and federal agencies that \nhave said research is needed, a coordinated effort has not yet \noccurred. If the Arctic Research Commission, which recognized this need \nearly on, had some funding of its own to leverage agency participation \nand help to coordinate the effort, we would know far more about the \nBering Sea ecosystem than we do today.\n  This bill also makes a number of other minor changes in the act:\n  Section 2 allows the chairperson of the Commission to receive \ncompensation for up to 120 days per year rather than the 90 days per \nyear currently allowed by the Act. The chairperson has a major role to \nplay in interacting with the legislative and executive branches of the \ngovernment, representing the Commission to non-governmental \norganizations, in interacting with the State of Alaska, and serving in \ninternational fora. In the past, chairpersons have been unable to fully \ndischarge their responsibilities in the 90 day limit specified in the \nact.\n  Section 3 authorizes the Commission to award an annual award not to \nexceed $1,000 to recognize either outstanding research or outstanding \nefforts in support of research in the Arctic. The ability to give \nmodest awards will bring recognition to outstanding efforts in Arctic \nResearch which, in turn, will help to stimulate research in the Arctic \nregion. This section also specifies that a current or former Commission \nmember is not eligible to receive the award.\n  Section 5 authorizes official representation and reception \nactivities. Because the Commission is not authorized to use funds for \nthese kinds of activities, the Commission has experienced embarrassment \nwhen they were unable to reciprocate after their foreign counterparts \nhosted a reception or lunch on their behalf. Under this provision, the \nCommission may spend not more than two tenths of one percent of its \nbudget for representation and reception activities in each fiscal year.\n  The Arctic Research and Policy Act and the Arctic Research Commission \nhas worked well over the past 17 years. It can work even better with \nthese modest changes. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \nenact this bill as soon as possible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BREAUX:\n  S. 816. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ncertain coins to be acquired by individual retirement accounts and \nother individually directed pension plan accounts; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nallowing certain U.S. legal tender coins to be qualified investments \nfor an individual retirement account, IRA.\n  Congress excluded ``collectibles,'' such as antiques, gold and silver \nbullion, and legal tender coinage, as appropriate for contributions to \nIRAs in 1981. The primary reason was the concern that individuals would \nget a tax break when they bought collectibles for their personal use. \nFor example, a taxpayer might deduct the purchase of an antique rug for \nhis/her living room as an IRA investment. Congress was also concerned \nabout how the many different types of collectibles are valued.\n  Over the years, however, certain coins and precious metals have been \nexcluded from the definition of a collectible because they are \nindependently valued investments that offer investors portfolio \ndiversity and liquidity. For example, Congress excluded gold and silver \nU.S. American Eagles from the definition of collectibles in 1986, and \nthe Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 took the further step of excluding \ncertain precious metals bullion.\n  My legislation would exclude from the definition of collectibles only \nthose U.S. legal tender coins which meet the following three standards: \ncertification by a nationally recognized grading service, traded on a \nnationally recognized network, and held by a qualified trustee as \ndescribed in the Internal Revenue Code. In other words, only investment \nquality coins that are independently valued and not held for personal \nuse may be included in IRAs.\n  There are several nationally recognized, independent certification or \ngrading services. Full-time professional graders, numismatists, examine \neach coin for authenticity and grade them according to established \nstandards. Upon certification, the coin is sonically-sealed, preserved, \nto ensure that it remains in the same condition as when it was graded.\n  Legal tender coins are then traded via two independent electronic \nnetworks--the Certified Coin Exchange and Certified Coin Net. These \nnetworks are independent of each other and have no financial interest \nin the legal tender coinage and precious metals markets. The networks \nfunction in precisely the same manner as the NASDAQ with a series of \npublished ``bid'' and ``ask'' prices and last trades. The buys and \nsells are enforceable prices that must be honored as posted until \nupdated.\n  The liquidity provided through a bona fide national trading network, \ncombined with published prices, make legal tender coinage a practical \ninvestment that offers investors diversification and liquidity. \nInvestment in these tangible assets has become a safe and prudent \ncourse of action for both the small and large investor and should given \nthe same treatment under the law as other financial investments. I urge \nthe Senate to enact this important legislation as soon as possible.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 816\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. CERTAIN COINS NOT TREATED AS COLLECTIBLES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subparagraph (A) of section 408(m)(3) of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to exception for \n     certain coins and bullion) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(A) any coin certified by a recognized grading service \n     and traded on a nationally recognized electronic network, or \n     listed by a recognized wholesale reporting service, and--\n       ``(i) which is or was at any time legal tender in the \n     United States, or\n       ``(ii) issued under the laws of any State, or''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after December 31, \n     2001.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DOMENICI (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 817. A bill to amend the National Trails System Act to designate \nthe Old Spanish Trail as a National Historic Trail; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I stand here before you today to \nintroduce the designation of the Old Spanish Trail as a National \nHistoric Trail. This legislation will amend the National Trails System \nAct and designate the Old Spanish Trail; which originates in Santa Fe, \nNM and continues to Los Angeles, CA as a National Historic Trail.\n  The United Stats of America has a rich history of which, as citizens, \nwe are very proud. Particularly in the west, citizens from all walks of \nlife have deep rooted cultural and historic ties to land throughout the \nwest. The Old Spanish Trail dates back to 1829. The Old Spanish Trail \nhad a variety of uses, from trade caravans to military expeditions. For \ntwenty plus years the Old Spanish Trail was used as a main route of \ntravel between New Mexico and California.\n  Today, more than one hundred and fifty years after the first caravan \non the Old Spanish Trail, the historic character of the trail is tied \nto its routes in the natural environment and the existence of \nlandscapes along the trail. The Old Spanish Trail remains relatively \nunchanged from the trail period. It has also been proven that numerous \nIndian pueblos were situated along the Old Spanish Trail serving as \ntrading centers. The majority of these pueblos are occupied by \ndescendants who contributed to the labor and goods that constituted \ncommerce on the Old Spanish Trail.\n\n[[Page S4182]]\n\n  The National Trails System was established by the National Trails \nSystem Act of 1968 ``to promote the preservation of, public access to, \ntravel within, and enjoyment and appreciation of the open air, outdoor \nareas and historic resources of the Nation.'' Designating the Old \nSpanish Trail as a National Historic Trail would allow for just what \nthe act has intended, preservation, access, enjoyment and appreciation \nof the historic resources of our Nation.\n  By definition under the National Trails System Act of 1968, National \nHistoric Trails are ``extended trails which follow as closely as \npossible and practicable the original route or routes of travel of \nnational historic significance.'' The main route of Old Spanish Trail \ntravels more than 1,160 miles through the states of New Mexico, \nColorado, Utah, Arizona, Nevada and California as well as 33 different \ncounties throughout these states. More than 1,190 miles of Old Spanish \nTrail are currently managed by the Bureau of Land Management, more than \n310 miles are managed by the USDA Forest Service with an additional \napproximate 120 miles controlled by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. \nThe relative lack of development facilitates public access as well as \nminimizing potential conflicts with private land uses.\n  The Old Spanish Trail has been significant in many respects to many \ndifferent people. The rich history of this trail is something that \nshould not be left out of our National Trails System. Designating Old \nSpanish Trail as a national Historic Trail will protect this historic \nroute and its historic remnants and artifacts for public use and \nenjoyment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Torricelli, Mr. Kyl, and Mr. \n        Murkowski):\n  S. 818. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na long-term capital gains exclusion for individuals, and to reduce the \nholding period for long-term capital gain treatment to 6 months, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and Senator Torricelli, \nI rise today to introduce the Capital Gains Relief and Simplification \nAct of 2001. We are joined by Senators Kyle  and Murkowski, each of \nwhom contributed to the development of this bill. This is a strong, \nbipartisan capital gains tax cut package designed to help all \ninvestors, but is aimed directly at small investors first.\n  This bill takes a bottom-up approach to capital gains relief, but \noffers reduced capital gains rates to all taxpayers. But this is not \nall. The bill also offers a great deal of simplification for all \ntaxpayers with capital gains to report on their tax returns. Both of \nthese features are important because investment in capital assets has \nbecome such an important part of the lives of most Americans.\n  In looking at the issue of capital gains in 2001, Mr. President, \nthree things are clear. First capital gains and losses are experienced \nby ordinary Americans and are not just the province of the wealthy. \nSecond, the reporting of capital gains transactions on the tax return \nhas grown very complex and burdensome, and third, capital gains tax \nrates are too high. These all add up to the need for capital gains \nrelief, and this is what our bill is designed to address.\n  Long gone are the days when anyone can credibly say that capital \nassets are only, or even mostly, owned by the rich. A 1992 Treasury \nstudy showed that about three-quarters of all families in the U.S. \nowned capital assets, and this percentage has grown higher since then. \nThat same study showed that 30 percent of the dollar value of all \ncapital assets, excluding personal residences, was held by families \nwith incomes of $50,000 or less in 1992.\n  More recent data confirm that more and more U.S. families own capital \ninvestments. A survey last year by the Federal Reserve showed that \nstock made up nearly 32 percent of U.S. household wealth in 1999, up \nfrom 28 percent the year before. Moreover, another Federal Reserve \nstudy showed that in 1998, almost 49 percent of all families directly \nor indirectly held stock. Among families with annual income of between \n$25,000 and $50,000, the level was almost 53 percent.\n  When looking at data on who pays capital gains taxes, we find that \nmany lower- and middle-income Americans are reporting capital gains. In \nfact, IRS data from the year 1998, the latest available, show that over \n25 million returns filed that year reported capital gains. This is \nabout one in five tax returns filed in 1998. Over 40 percent of those \nreporting capital gains had income of less than $50,000, and 59 percent \nhad income of less than $75,000. Moreover, when looking at the dollar \namount of gains reported, we find that 56 percent of all capital gains \nin 1998 were claimed by taxpayers with incomes of under $75,000.\n  I believe it is very clear, that capital gains relief is not just for \nwealthy Americans. It is very much needed by the average American \nfamily. It is also clear that reporting capital gains is very complex \nfor most taxpayers.\n  Millions of Americans hold investments in mutual funds. In fact, \naccording to the Joint Economic Committee, 44 percent of all U.S. \nhouseholds owned mutual funds in 1998, up from just 6 percent in 1980. \nMost of these mutual funds annually distribute dividends and capital \ngains to their owners, which must be reported as income on Form 1040 \neach year. This can be a rather confusing process for many investors, \nfor several reasons.\n  First, many mutual fund owners routinely reinvest the dividend and \ncapital gains income back into the fund, rather than taking them in \ncash. Because they receive no cash, it comes as a surprise to some that \nthey must pay tax on the gains at all. Many mutual fund investors were \nparticularly dismayed this past tax filing season, because they had to \nreport capital gains from funds that had decreased in value.\n  Second, when mutual fund owners sell their interest in a fund, \ncomputing the capital gain or loss on the sale can be daunting, \nparticularly if the individual had been reinvesting the dividends and \ncapital gains back to the fund.\n  Finally, after figuring out what capital gains have been received and \nhow much should be reported, and any gain or loss from a sale of the \nfund, mutual fund owners, like other investors in capital assets, must \nthen deal with the challenge of reporting capital gains on the \ncomplicated Schedule D of Form 1040. This form is confusing at best and \nexasperating at worst. It consists of 54 lines on two pages, and is \naccompanied by an 8-page set of instructions with two worksheets. The \nestimated time to complete this form, according to IRS estimates, is an \nastounding 6 hours and 48 minutes.\n  Finally, it is clear that capital gains tax rates are too high. In \nfact, a new report by Arthur Andersen LLP shows that the average \nmiddle-income individual investor faces a combined state and federal \ncapital gains tax burden of 25 percent on long-term capital gains. I \nwant to emphasize that this is the average rate across the U.S. In some \nstates, including my home state of Utah where the rate is 27 percent, \nthe burden is even higher.\n  These figures may surprise some of our colleagues. After all, many \nmembers of this body were present in 1997 when we reduced the maximum \ncapital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 20 percent. The fact is, \nhowever, that most states tack a relatively high additional tax on the \nfederal capital gains rate to produce this 25 percent average capital \ngains tax rate.\n  This is particularly important in light of the fact that the United \nStates still taxes capital gains more heavily than do most other \ncountries. In fact, a recent survey of 24 industrial and developing \ncountries taken by the American Council for Capital Formation's Center \nfor Policy Research showed an average capital gains rate of 14.5 \npercent. This is more than 10 percent above the combined average \nfederal-state U.S. rate.\n  The Capital Gains Relief and Simplification Act we are introducing \ntoday is designed to address the problem of too high a tax rate as well \nas the complexity problem, in a way that is directed to all taxpayers, \nbut especially those in the middle- and lower-income groups.\n  Let me briefly describe this bill. First, it provides a 100 percent \nexclusion for the first $1,000 in capital gains for every individual \ntaxpayer. This would be $2,000 for a married couple filing a joint \nreturn. Individuals with capital gains below these thresholds\n\n[[Page S4183]]\n\nwould generally not even have to file the confusing Schedule D. Totally \navoiding a complex tax form is the ultimate in simplification.\n  Second, for individual capital gains above the $1,000 (or $2,000) \nexclusion threshold, the bill provides a 50 percent deduction. The \neffect of this would be to lower an individual's top capital gains tax \nrate to exactly half the ordinary income rate. If for example, under \ncurrent law an investor's marginal tax bracket is 31 percent, the top \ncapital gains rate for that investor would be 15.5 percent.\n  This deduction approach offers both simplicity, and a greater \nreduction in rates for those in the lower tax brackets than for those \nin the highest brackets. For example, compared with current law, a \ntaxpayer in the highest tax bracket of 39.6 percent would find his or \nher top capital gains tax rate cut from the current 20 percent to 19.8 \npercent under this bill. An investor in the 28 percent bracket, \nhowever, would see his or her top capital gains rate drop from the \ncurrent 20 percent to 14 percent.\n  Moreover, under this bill investors would see further capital gains \ntax rate cuts as the ordinary income tax rates are reduced, as under \nPresident Bush's tax plan. For example, those in the proposed 25 \npercent rate bracket would enjoy a top capital gains rate of just 12.5 \npercent, while those in lower brackets would see even lower capital \ngains rates, to the extent their capital gains exceeded the 100 percent \nexclusion thresholds.\n  Furthermore, this 50 percent deduction approach also helps with the \nproblem I mentioned before of high combined federal and state capital \ngains tax rates. Most states use the federal adjusted gross income, \nAGI, as a starting point for determining state income tax liability. \nThus, under current law, all of an investor's capital gains are \ngenerally included in the state tax base. Under this bill's exclusion \napproach, only 50 percent of capital gains over the exclusion would be \nincluded in the federal AGI. This means most states would generally \nonly tax a fraction of the investor's capital gains. Therefore, this \nbill would result in lower federal and state taxes on capital gains.\n  I would like to mention several other features of the bill. First, it \nwould reduce the holding period of long-term capital gains from one \nyear to six months. According to Bruce Bartlett, a well-known economist \nwith the National Center for Policy Analysis, a holding period \nrequirement for favorable capital gains treatment has several economic \ncosts to investors, the consequences of which may reduce the level of \ninvestment. Among these economic costs are a reduction in liquidity and \nthe creation of a lock-in effect that can cause the prices of stock to \nvary from its real value. Reducing the holding period will reduce these \ncosts and may also increase revenue to the Treasury from capital gains.\n  Second, the bill increases the amount of capital loss an individual \nmay deduct against ordinary income. Under current law, an individual's \ncapital gains are taxed from the first dollar to the last dollar. \nHowever, if an individual suffers a capital loss, and has no capital \ngains to use to offset the loss, he or she is allowed to deduct only \n$3,000 of the loss against ordinary income. This is unfair and the \namount is too low. Our legislation helps alleviate this problem by \nincreasing the $3,000 figure to $10,000 and indexing it for future \ninflation.\n  Finally, the Capital Gains Relief and Simplification Act includes two \nprovisions to help taxpayers who sell their homes and want to take \nadvantage of the principal residence exclusion enacted in 1997. The \nfirst one addresses a problem that members of the U.S. uniformed \nservices and Foreign Service sometimes suffer when called away from \ntheir homes for work-related purposes. In many cases, they return from \nthese assignments and want or need to sell their principal residence. \nBecause they do not meet the five-year ownership and use test, however, \nthey are denied the full use of the present law exclusion. This bill \ncorrects this inequity by suspending this test during such absences. \nThe provision would also apply to individuals relocated outside the \nUnited States by their employers.\n  The second provision merely indexes for inflation the $250,000 and \n$500,000 thresholds for purposes of the principal residence exclusion. \nWhile these levels might have seemed adequate in 1997, and perhaps even \nin 2001, inflation will soon cause these thresholds to be worth far \nless than Congress intended when crafting this provision. We should \nadjust them now.\n  This bill represents a win for everybody. All investors win because \nit would significantly lower the capital gains tax rate and simplify \ntheir lives at tax time. Small investors especially win because all or \nmuch of their capital gains would escape taxation altogether and they \nwould avoid much of the complexity they currently face with Schedule D. \nAll Americans win because reducing capital gains would increase \neconomic growth and job creation.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to take a close look \nat this legislation and join us in lowering taxes on millions of \nAmericans and striking an important blow for tax simplicity at the same \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/02/senate-section/article/S4183-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4183-S4184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  STATEMENTS ON SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 80--HONORING THE ``WHIDBEY 24'' FOR THEIR \n                 PROFESSIONALISM, BRAVERY, AND COURAGE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Bond, Mr. McCain, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \nWarner, Mr. Levin, Mr. Kennedy, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Thurmond, Mr. \nAkaka, Ms. Collins, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Dayton) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Armed Services:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, today I introduce a resolution honoring \nthe Whidbey 24, the brave crewmembers of an EP-3 aircraft stationed at \nWhidbey Island Naval Air Station in my home State of Washington.\n  On April 1, 2001, a United States EP-3 surveillance aircraft on \nroutine patrol in international airspace over the South China Sea \ncollided with a Chinese fighter jet. The plane carried a crew of 22 \nNavy personnel, one Air Force officer, and one Marine. Following the \naccident, the U.S. aircraft and crew plunged as much as 8,000 feet \nbefore the crew regained control of the severely damaged aircraft. Navy \nLieutenant Shane Osborne, the pilot, and his entire crew displayed \nextraordinary skill and courage as the aircraft made an emergency \nlanding at the Chinese military airfield on Hainan Island. The 24 crew \nmembers were detained on Hainan Island in the People's Republic of \nChina for 11 days as the United States and China negotiated a \ndiplomatic resolution to the aircraft collision and the emergency \nlanding.\n  When I first heard that an American plane was forced to make an \nemergency landing in China, like all Americans, I was very concerned. \nThen I learned that the crew was based on Whidbey Island, and I \nrealized that these men and women were my neighbors--the people I see \nat the grocery store. The city of Oak Harbor, which is\n\n[[Page S4184]]\n\nhome to the Whidbey Island Naval Air Station, was immensely supportive \nof the airmen and their families during this incident. The community \ncommenced a ``Bring Back VQ-1'' campaign to show their support and deep \nappreciation for the crewmembers and their families. Residents of the \ncity wrapped trees and light poles with yellow ribbons. My Washington \nD.C. office distributed yellow ribbons to visitors and other Senate \noffices in an effort to demonstrate our support in the halls of \nCongress.\n  On April 14, 2001, the crew returned safely to Washington State to an \nemotional ``Welcome Home VQ-1'' celebration at the Ault Field Hangar at \nNaval Air Station Whidbey Island. These brave men and women displayed \nuncommon courage, professionalism, and selfless dedication to duty in \nthe service of our country, from the time of the collision and \nthroughout their 11-day detention. While my resolution seeks to \nrecognize the Whidbey 24, it is equally important to note that \nthousands of Americans serve just as honorably in service to our \ncountry each and every day.\n  I am so proud of the Whidbey Island community for it handled this \nincident with great compassion for the families and NAS Whidbey \npersonnel. But we also know that all across America, military families \nand the American people were standing behind our military personnel. \nThe Whidbey Island community stood tall, proud and patriotic on behalf \nof the families and the country.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in recognizing the bravery and \ndetermination of the Whidbey 24 throughout a delicate and dangerous \nordeal. On behalf of all Americans, I proudly honor them and once again \nwelcome them home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/05/02/senate-section/article/S4184-1", "month": "05", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 35--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n     LEBANON, SYRIA, AND IRAN SHOULD ALLOW REPRESENTATIVES OF THE \n INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS TO VISIT THE FOUR ISRAELIS, \n  ADI AVITAN, BINYAMIN AVRAHAM, OMAR SOUAD, AND ELCHANAN TANNENBAUM, \n             PRESENTLY HELD BY HEZBOLLAH FORCES IN LEBANON\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \nSantorum, Mr. Smith of New Hampshire, Mr. Smith of Oregon, Mr. Durbin, \nMr. Leahy, Mr. Fitzgerald, Mr. Specter, and Mrs. Clinton) submitted the \nfollowing concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                            S.
