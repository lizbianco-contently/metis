Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate is today \nfinally proceeding to consider the Energy Policy Act of 2002. The fact \nthat we are at this point in our deliberations is the result of a \ntremendous amount of work involving several committees in the Senate.\n  I think the committee with the largest stake in the development of \nthis legislation is, of course, the Committee of Energy and Natural \nResources, which I am privileged to chair and of which Senator \nMurkowski is the ranking member at this point.\n  We have held over 50 hearings in the 106th and 107th Congresses that \nare related to today's bill. I express appreciation to Senator \nMurkowski, the ranking member, who chaired many of these hearings.\n  I believe we have a good understanding of the issues that are forming \nthis debate and that are at stake in this debate. Many of the elements \nin\n\n[[Page S1432]]\n\nthis energy bill are not going to shake out along party lines but \nbecause of genuine differences of opinion that particular Senators \nhave.\n  I anticipate we will see all sorts of combinations of sponsorship on \namendments on both a party and on a regional basis, before we are done.\n  Let me speak for a few minutes about the rationale for this energy \nbill. It is important to recall why we have invested so much time on \nthe topic of energy in preparing this legislation. Why is it important \nfor the Senate at this stage in the year 2002 to consider and pass \ncomprehensive legislation?\n  I believe there are two basic answers to that question: First, energy \nis central to our present and our future economic prosperity. Because \nof its importance, improving and strengthening our national energy \nsystem can provide significant economic benefits for each American. \nSimilarly, the vulnerabilities in our national energy system can \npresent major threats to our national economic health. We need to \nanticipate those threats and deal with them, as we try to in this \nlegislation.\n\n  A second basic reason we are considering energy legislation is there \nhave been significant changes in energy markets since the last time \nCongress considered comprehensive energy legislation. The last major \nenergy bill passed in Congress was the Energy Policy Act of 1992, 10 \nyears ago. Since that time, as a nation we have moved further away from \nthe command-and-control regulation of energy toward a system that \nrelies more on market forces to set the price of energy. In the process \nof making that move, energy markets have become more competitive and \ndynamic but not without some significant bumps along the way.\n  Let me recount a few of those bumps of which we are all aware. First, \nconsumers are now more vulnerable to the vagaries of the energy markets \nand to volatile prices for energy that cause repercussions throughout \nour economy. We saw that phenomenon at work in California last winter \nover a year ago and last spring. Also, the structures to regulate these \nemerging market forces, particularly with respect to trading in natural \ngas and electricity, are not fully developed. I think we all saw that \nwith the collapse of Enron.\n  Gasoline supplies nationwide have become increasingly subject to \nlocal crises and price spikes due to the proliferation of inflexible \nlocal fuel specifications and tight capacity for refining and for \npipelines.\n  And, finally, the events of September 11 have caused many of us to \nreflect on the inherent vulnerabilities of the energy transmission \nsystem we have in the country. The time may be right for rethinking how \nwe site energy infrastructure and the balance between central and \ndistributed generation of power in our electricity system.\n  Congress does need to respond to these changes and to these \nchallenges and to these opportunities. If we do so in a balanced and \ncomprehensive and forward-looking way, we can develop an energy policy \nthat will lead to new economic prosperity for the country and, \nhopefully, for the world. But we will not get there simply by \nperpetuating the energy policy approaches of the past. We need new \nideas and new approaches as well as greater investment in order to move \nto the future that we all want. That is what this bill tries to do.\n  The bill has three overarching goals. I have a chart that sets these \nout. Let me briefly go through each of them.\n  The first goal is to ensure a diversity of fuels and technologies for \nadequate and affordable supplies of energy. By this we are talking \nabout renewable sorts of energy, as well as the more traditional \nsources we have depended upon. Natural gas, coal, oil, hydropower, \nnuclear power--all of those issues are dealt with in this legislation, \nand we have provisions intended to encourage adequate supply from this \nentire diversity of sources.\n\n  A second major goal of the legislation is to improve the efficiency \nand productivity of our energy use, including the reliability of our \nelectric transmission system, the efficiency of energy use in industry, \nin vehicles, appliances, and buildings. We will have a great deal of \ndiscussion during the debate about the various provisions in the bill \nintended to encourage more efficient use of energy. We all recognize \nthat we waste a tremendous amount of energy, and new technology can \nhelp us to use energy much more efficiently.\n  The third major overarching goal is to be sure that whatever we do in \nthe energy area is done with an eye toward protecting the environment, \ntoward not worsening the problem of climate change. I believe we have \nachieved that goal. Again, we will get into a serious discussion of the \ndetails as we get into the bill.\n  We can achieve these goals if we both accelerate the development and \nintroduction of new technology--and we try to do that through this \nlegislation--and if we create flexible market conditions that empower \nenergy consumers so they can make the right choices, the choices that \nbenefit them but also that benefit society more generally.\n  This combination of technology and policy innovation in pursuit of a \ndiverse and robust national energy system can be seen in the provisions \nof the bill related to this first major goal--the adequate and \naffordable supply of energy. Let me talk about that goal and what we \nhave in the bill related to it.\n  The first part of energy supply I will discuss is renewable energy. \nWe have put a great emphasis on renewable energy in this legislation. \nThe Senate bill contains numerous provisions to enhance the \ncontribution of renewable forms of energy to our future energy mix. \nUnder what I see as pretty much a business-as-usual approach, which is \nreflected in the House-passed bill, H.R. 4, the contribution of our \nenergy mix from renewables would not markedly grow over the next 20 \nyears. The result would be an energy system, particularly for the \nproduction of electricity, that would go from being 68 percent based on \ncoal and natural gas today, in the year 2002, to being about 80 \npercent, based on those two fuels, by the year 2020.\n  That overdependence on those two fuels would leave our country \nextremely vulnerable to shortfalls in the delivery of either of these \ncommodities and leave consumers exposed to the severe risk of price \nspikes. We need a more diverse way in which to produce electricity, not \na less diverse way.\n  Such an overdependence does not make sense in light of the \ncommitments to renewable energy that we are seeing in other countries, \nparticularly in Europe. I have a chart that makes that point. This \nchart is ``Commitment to Renewable Generation.'' It is the percentage \nof increase in nonhydro renewable generation from 1990 to 1995. That \nwas the first half of the last decade.\n  It shows that Spain, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands, and France \nhave all dramatically increased their percentage of power generated \nfrom renewable sources; the United States is barely on the chart. Even \nFrance, which is often held up as a model for its commitment to nuclear \npower, has outpaced the United States in development of renewable \nsources for electricity.\n  The United States needs to lead the world in renewable technologies. \nWe have abundant domestic renewable resources. The world market for the \ntechnologies we have developed is capable of growing immensely. \nRenewable technology leadership would help U.S. firms achieve a strong \nposition in winning these markets and creating new jobs domestically.\n  If the United States is to lead the world in renewable energy \ntechnologies, though, we need to do a better job of getting those \ntechnologies into our own economy and into our own markets.\n  This bill we are beginning to debate today boosts our future use of \nrenewables in five major ways: First, the bill contains market \nincentives that will triple the amount of electricity produced from \nrenewable energy over the next 20 years. This chart tries to make that \npoint very effectively. The orange band at the bottom represents the \nEnergy Information Agency's projection of nonhydro renewables, assuming \nwe do not pass the legislation. We can see that from the year 2000 to \nthe year 2020, the percentage we are generating from nonhydro \nrenewables would not change at all, absent legislation such as we are \nconsidering today.\n  The green wedge represents the contribution we believe would be made \nif this Senate energy bill becomes law, as we hope very much it will. \nYou can see\n\n[[Page S1433]]\n\nthat we would be essentially tripling, or more than tripling the \npercentage of the electricity generated from renewable sources.\n  Let me talk about the specific incentives. One incentive in the bill \nis what we call the renewable portfolio standard. It creates a market \nfor new renewable sources of energy, whether they are from wind, solar, \nbiomass, or incremental hydroelectric generation in existing dams. This \nis something which many States have already done. We believe it is a \ngood policy and one we should move to as well. One State that has moved \nahead very dramatically is Texas. We commend the Senate to be aware of \nwhat has happened in Texas during the time, in fact, when our current \nPresident was Governor of that State. We believe the rest of the \ncountry should follow suit.\n  A second market incentive is a Federal purchase requirement for \nrenewables. It grows to 7.5 percent for all Federal electricity \npurchases by the year 2010. We believe the Federal Government should \nlead in this area. This is an opportunity for it to do so.\n  The third provision is the renewable energy production incentive. \nThere is an existing program in place to help rural electric co-ops and \nmunicipal utilities to generate renewable energy. In this bill we \npropose to reauthorize that and extend it to include Indian lands which \ncontain prime renewable resources.\n  The next provision is that when the Senate considers the energy tax \nincentive amendment from the Finance Committee--and we believe Senator \nBaucus and Senator Grassley will be offering that amendment at some \nstage during the debate--we will have an important opportunity to boost \nthe future production of renewable energy. Existing renewable tax \nincentives expire January 1 of this year. This package of tax \nprovisions that has come from the Finance Committee will reinstate the \nhighest priority incentives for 5 years. It will expand the coverage of \nthe production tax credit to include open-loop biomass and geothermal \nenergy.\n  In addition to these incentives for renewable production of \nelectricity, the bill greatly expands the contribution of renewable \nfuels such as ethanol and biodiesel. Those fuels, of course, are used \nprimarily to power vehicles of transportation.\n  By the year 2005, 75 percent of the Federal Government's vehicles \nthat can burn alternative fuels will be required to do so. That will \ncreate more market certainty for renewable fuels and for their \nassociated infrastructure.\n  By 2012, 5 million gallons per year of renewable fuels will be \nblended into gasoline, thereby decreasing our import dependence on \nforeign oil.\n  The bill helps renewables contribute more to the energy mix also by \nremoving existing regulatory barriers that affect renewable energy. For \nexample, wind and solar power can be effectively tapped by small \ndistributed generation systems. But current practices and rules in the \nmarketplace often discriminate against distributed generation.\n\n  This bill deals with the problem by requiring electric utilities to \noffer customers net metering in which a customer can offset his or her \nelectric bill by the amount of electricity that is generated and that \nhe or she is able to sell to the local utility. This provision will \nfacilitate the use of a wide variety of distributed generation \ntechnologies by electric customers, including renewable technologies \nsuch as solar and wind power.\n  This bill also requires fair transmission rules for intermittent \ngeneration. By that, I am referring to wind and solar generation in \nparticular. Those types of generations should not be unfairly penalized \nbecause of the natural variability of these resources from day to day \nor hour to hour.\n  Finally, the bill mandates easier interconnection for distributed \nenergy production into the interstate transmission grid. It requires \nStates to examine ways to facilitate interconnection of distributed \nenergy in local electric distribution systems.\n  A fourth way in which the bill promotes the use of renewables is by \ndisseminating information about and facilitating access to areas with \nhigh resource potential. Particularly here, I am talking about public \nlands. There are many places in the Nation--particularly in the West \nand in the State that I represent in the Senate--where we have \nsignificant untapped renewable energy potential. The bill creates a \npilot program in the Department of Interior and in the Forest Service \nfor development of wind and solar energy projects on Federal land. The \nbill authorizes the study of renewable energy development potential on \nIndian tribal lands. The bill requires an annual publication of the \nassessment of available renewable resources by the Department of \nEnergy.\n  A fifth and final area in which the bill helps make renewable energy \na bigger part of the supply picture in the future is through enhanced \nresearch and development programs. Under this bill, these R programs \nat the Department of Energy will grow from an authorized level of $500 \nmillion in fiscal year 2003 to $733 million in fiscal 2006. Renewable \nenergy R was cited by the distinguished Presidential task force in \n1997 as being significantly underfunded relative to its long-term \npromise and the benefits that we can achieve for our economy if we did \nbetter by funding this research and development. Our bill expands the \nresearch and development activity, consistent with the recommendations \nof that task force.\n  These are all measures that I have described, which we believe will \nincrease the contribution of renewables to our energy supply picture. \nThey are balanced in our bill with a very strong commitment to the \nother more traditional energy supply sources. Let me briefly describe \nthose.\n  Natural gas is one that is very much on our minds and very much a \nfuel of the future as well. I want to briefly describe what the bill \nwill do to support continued development in this area. In the area of \nnatural gas, our Nation is at a crossroads. We need to make some major \ndecisions about our energy security. U.S. natural gas demand is \nexpected to increase from 23 trillion cubic feet per year, which is \nwhat it is now, to 35 trillion cubic feet per year by 2020. Much of \nthat demand will be driven by the use of natural gas for electricity \ngeneration.\n  This chart makes the case very strongly. The green line, of course, \nrepresents production; the red line represents consumption. We can see \nvery clearly that consumption is outstripping production by a \nsignificant amount--even in the year 2000, which is where that line is. \nBy the year 2020, the problem becomes much worse. As a result, we are \nat risk of becoming, as a Nation, dependent upon imported natural gas \nthat is brought to us by tanker. Countries on which we would rely for \nsuch gas are, as we all know, prone to political instability. They \nare--as far as we can tell at this point--in the early stages of \nforming an OPEC-like organization for natural gas exporters. There is a \ncover story in the June 2001 issue of the OPEC Bulletin with a headline \nentitled ``Iran Hosts Inaugural Meeting of Gas-Exporting Countries \nForum.'' I don't think any of us wants to put our Nation into a \nposition of having to deal with a natural gas cartel, in addition to \nthe cartel that controls the price of oil now.\n\n  This bill will take several steps to try to come up with a different \npolicy for natural gas in order to avoid that possibility. It increases \nfunding for research to develop domestic natural gas deposits in deep \nwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico and in harder to tap geologic \nformations on shore. It provides research funds to explore the \npotential of methane hydrates trapped on the ocean floor. The bill \nauthorizes more funds to facilitate the permitting and leasing of \nFederal lands for natural gas production in places where it is \nenvironmentally acceptable. It addresses a number of developing \nproblems in natural gas provision--conflicts over coal methane, \nhydraulic fracturing--and tries to bring those conflicts to resolution \nbefore we encounter a real crisis.\n  But even after all these steps--and I believe each one is useful and \nimportant--that will not be enough to close the gap that we indicated \nearlier. The most significant thing the bill tries to do for future \nnatural gas supply is to provide financial incentives to build a \npipeline to bring from Alaska the vast reserves of natural gas that \nhave been discovered and developed in the Prudhoe Bay region. I know my \ncolleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, has championed this for some \ntime. This is a high priority for his\n\n[[Page S1434]]\n\nState. It is a high priority for this Nation, in my view. The existing \nreserves are estimated to be over 30 trillion cubic feet of gas. It is \nestimated that the total natural gas resource in the North Slope is \nenormous--on the order of 100 trillion cubic feet.\n  The natural gas pipeline from Alaska to the lower 48 would provide \ndaily at least 4 billion to 6 billion cubic feet of natural gas before \nthe end of the decade.\n  Once a pipeline is constructed, it would provide gas to American \nconsumers for at least 30 years and would be a stabilizing force on \nnatural gas prices. We all saw the volatility in natural gas prices in \nthe year or 18 months where at one point they were up around $8 per \nMCF, and now it is down around $2 per MCF. Building this pipeline, we \nbelieve, will stabilize the price, and that will benefit consumers \ntremendously.\n  This project makes a great deal of sense for our Nation, but it is \nnot happening because of this uncertainty about the investment risk of \nbuilding such a major pipeline, making such an enormous investment. By \nany measure, the pipeline would be one of the largest construction \nprojects ever undertaken. Construction would take approximately 8 \nyears, from start to finish. It would require $15 billion to $20 \nbillion. The pipeline project would create a massive number of jobs in \nAlaska, Canada, and in the lower 48. It would require the construction \nof the largest gas treatment plants in the world, and the laying of \nabout 3,600 miles of pipe. It would require an enormous amount of steel \nto be produced. The number of jobs that would be created also is \nextremely significant--350,000 to 400,000 jobs, at a time when the \nsteel industry is suffering harm from global overcapacity of steel \nproduction and foreign dumping. A project that would require over 500 \nmillion tons of steel means real jobs for workers in communities and \nStates that produce steel.\n  Since natural gas prices vary, as I indicated before, from $2 to $8 \nand sometimes $10 per million cubic feet, it is hard for the free \nmarket to take this challenge on by itself. At the same time, we want \nto rely on the private sector to the greatest extent possible. There \nare two major groups of potential investors in such a pipeline, and the \nprovisions of the bill are aimed at giving them both a shot at \nproposing a successful project. The provisions include an expedited \nprocess for the permits, rights of way, and certificates needed for the \nU.S. segment of the pipeline.\n  Time is money in any construction project, and in a construction \nproject of this magnitude, uncertainty and delay will kill the project. \nThe Government has an obligation on behalf of U.S. consumers to see \nthat it exercises its role in a responsible way and in an expeditious \nway.\n  The Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Act of 1976 provided a \nframework for construction and operation of a gas pipeline along a \ndesignated route. Our legislation preserves this option. It also \nprovides an alternative expedited procedure in the event the parties \ndecide to pursue a different route.\n  Because of the enormous benefits this long-term supply of energy will \nhave on the economy and the significant uncertainties in natural gas \nprices, I believe the Government has an interest in reducing the \nfinancial risks associated with the project. Accordingly, the bill does \nauthorize in its present form loan guarantees for the project, as long \nas appropriate filings are made within 6 months after the bill becomes \nlaw.\n  I understand there are a number of refinements and modifications that \nmay be sought by my distinguished ranking member on the Energy \nCommittee as we move forward. He is also vitally interested in the \nproject. For example, we are working together to come up with a tax \nprovision that could reduce the financial uncertainty of the economics \nof the project going forward. Both of us are committed to encouraging \nAlaska North Slope producers, the interested pipeline companies, the \nState of Alaska, and other interested parties to begin serious \nnegotiations on a final outline of a commercial agreement.\n  I believe it is important for the Senate to be proactive on this \nproject, not simply to sit back and cross our fingers and hope that \nsomeday it occurs. If we do not act while there is a substantial \nprivate sector interest in building this pipeline, we will lose an \nimportant opportunity to bolster our energy security in natural gas. As \na consequence, we might be hearing speeches 10, 20 years from now about \nour dependence upon foreign sources of natural gas that sound a lot \nlike the speeches we will be hearing today and in the next few days \nabout our dependence on foreign sources of oil.\n  Let me say a few words about oil. That is a central part of our \nenergy mix. Clearly, we want to increase domestic production of oil and \nmaintain domestic production of oil. The volume of rhetoric about \ndrilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge--both from the \nproponents and the opponents--would lead one to think that is the only \nplace in the country where we can look for additional oil. In my view, \nthat is far from true.\n  There are 32 million acres of the Outer Continental Shelf off the \ncoast of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi that have already been \nleased by the Government to oil companies for exploration and \nproduction. This chart shows that. As shown on this map, the yellow \npart of this chart indicates those areas that have been leased and not \nyet developed. The red dots indicate actual producing wells.\n  In addition to production in the Gulf of Mexico, there are \noutstanding prospects for increased production from National Petroleum \nReserve-Alaska, which lies to the west of the Prudhoe Bay region. Under \nthe Clinton administration, leasing was expanded in this area. Industry \nhas made some major finds. There is no law that needs to be passed to \nhave additional parts of this area leased. As I understand it, the \nSecretary of the Interior is proceeding to prepare some of that area \nfor leasing.\n\n  If the problem is not finding areas to lease under current law, why \nis there not more domestic production going on in the areas that have \nalready been leased for exploration and production? In my view, an \nimportant reason might be the difference between our Federal and State \nroyalty and tax policies relative to those in other countries with oil \nand gas resources.\n  Oil exploration and production is a worldwide business. Areas such as \nthe ones on the map and in Alaska compete with other producing regions \naround the world. U.S. companies are making major commitments of \ncapital derived from their earnings in the United States to develop \nenergy resources elsewhere in the world. For example, ExxonMobil is \ninvesting $20 billion to develop natural gas in Saudi Arabia. Other \nU.S. companies are actively looking for oil in the Caspian region.\n  A key initiative in the bill to support increased domestic production \nis to have a top-to-bottom review of Federal and State royalty and tax \npolicies on domestic oil and gas production, and then to have a \ncomparison of that with similar provisions encountered by companies in \nother countries.\n  Our current U.S. policies were put in place when the United States \nhad abundant and easily accessible reserves. We have fewer such \nreserves now. While technology for finding oil has continued to \nimprove, we should consider whether our tax and our fiscal policies \nshould change to policies that enhance the economics for exploration of \noil and gas in more challenging geologic formations.\n  Our fiscal policies should also be changed to take into account the \nboom-and-bust nature of the industry and to provide incentives to \nmaintain domestic production when prices are low. They might also \ninclude disincentives for buying and sitting on leases without \ndeveloping them in a timely way. That is what we have seen off the \ncoast in the gulf.\n  All of that I have described is a tall order. I do not believe \nCongress has the background it needs to revise these laws in a sensible \nway right now. We need to have a distinguished external group \ninvestigate these issues and make reports back. Setting this process in \nmotion might prove to be useful to boost domestic production in the \nlong run.\n  A second proposal to boost domestic production in the near future is \nto provide adequate funding for the Federal programs that actually \nissue new leases and permits for oil and gas production. For all the \nrhetoric we have\n\n[[Page S1435]]\n\nheard from the administration about the need to increase domestic \nproduction, the budget request we received for fiscal year 2002 did not \nask for enough money to do this job properly.\n  The result of inadequate funding for land management agencies is \ndelay and frustration on the part of oil and gas producers. This bill \nprovides increased budget levels for these functions. The Federal \nGovernment can then take the necessary steps to make oil and gas \nleasing faster and more predictable where it is already permitted and \nwhere it is able to be achieved in an environmentally acceptable way.\n  The bill also contains increased R funding to support oil and gas \nproduction by smaller companies and independent producers. These are \nthe entities that account for the majority of onshore U.S. production \nof oil. They do not have the resources to do their own exploration and \nproduction research and development. Improving their ability to use new \ntechnology to find and produce oil and gas is a good policy for \nincreased domestic production.\n  Here, too, there is room for improvement on the part of the \nadministration. The most recent budget request we have seen from them \nhas slashed funding in the Department of Energy for these very \nprograms. My ranking member and I oppose these cuts. It is important \nfor the Senate to take a position in favor of increased authorization \nfor these programs, not cutting funding for these programs, and this \nbill will do that.\n  Let me say a few words about coal. Another very important contributor \nto our current energy supply picture is coal. This chart makes the case \nvery dramatically. We can see this is a chart that depicts where the \nelectricity generation comes from by fuel. We can see that the top line \nis coal. So 59 percent of the electricity generated today in this \ncountry is produced from coal.\n  We have a tremendous coal resource. We have been called by some the \nSaudi Arabia of coal by some. But coal in our energy future needs to be \nclean, and it needs to be emission free. Coal-based generation produces \nmore greenhouse gas emissions per Btu of energy output than does \nnatural-gas-fired generation.\n  Other pollutants from coal-fired plants have been a source of \nregional tensions between the States where coal-fired plants are based \nand States downwind from those particular States.\n  Coal is too important a resource for us to write off. Technology \nholds promise for dramatically lowering, even reducing to zero, the \nemissions from coal-based plants.\n  This bill takes a very forward-looking approach to the issue. It \nauthorizes $200 million per year for research and development and \ndemonstration programs, based on coal gasification, on carbon \nsequestration, and related ultraclean technologies for burning coal. \nThis proposal was a result of a strong bipartisan push in the Energy \nCommittee by Senator Bayh and Senator Thomas, who was present a few \nminutes ago and I am sure will want to speak on this issue.\n  There is one more example of the crucial role research and \ndevelopment is going to have to play in shaping the energy future we \nwant. Let me say a few words about nuclear power because clearly \nresearch and development is also the key to the future of nuclear power \nin the country.\n  Nuclear reactors emit no greenhouse gases. So on that basis one would \nthink they were an option we should be looking to for the future. But \nnuclear plants have other characteristics that are not as attractive. \nThey have very high upfront capital costs compared to other generating \noptions. That puts them at a disadvantage in the marketplace.\n  The nuclear waste problem is still not solved. Nuclear safety is a \ncontinuing concern for the public. Our cadre of nuclear scientists and \nengineers is growing older and is dwindling in size, and we are not \nseeing a large supply of students being trained to help us deal with \nnuclear issues in the future. This bill takes on these problems by \nfocusing on research and development on new nuclear plant designs that \nmight address these problems and on a program to strengthen university \ndepartments of nuclear science and technology.\n  The bill also contains a partial reauthorization of the basic nuclear \nliability statute, the Price-Anderson Act. The part that is in the bill \ndeals with the liability of the Department of Energy nuclear \ncontractors, including our national laboratories that are a significant \nsource of our national nuclear expertise. The other main part of the \nPrice-Anderson Act dealing with the commercial nuclear power industry \nis likely to feature prominently in the debate we have on this bill, \nand I believe we should go ahead with full authorization of that bill \nand will support efforts to do that.\n  Hydropower is another source of energy supply that this bill tries to \naddress in electricity generation. Many hydropower facilities are \nreaching the age at which their original licenses under the Federal \nPower Act are about to expire. The process of relicensing these \nfacilities needs to be protective of the environment, predictable for \nlicensees, and efficient in the way it is administered.\n  We have been working for months with various Senators to try to come \nup with compromise, consensus language that would accomplish all of \nthese objectives. I hope we can do so, and I hope we can include \nlegislation in the final version of this bill by the time it passes the \nSenate. We have legislative language in the bill right now, but there \nare still concerns about it, and I am aware of those concerns.\n  Indian energy, a final way this bill focuses on increasing the supply \nof domestic energy, is through a series of provisions facilitating the \ndevelopment of energy resources on Indian lands. We have a significant \nshare of our untapped domestic energy resources located on Indian \nlands. I will not go into great detail about those provisions but \nsimply say it is very much in our national interest that we \nfacilitate development of those resources. It can be a benefit to the \nIndian tribes that have those lands. It can also be a great benefit to \nour Nation.\n\n  Our second big goal in the bill, on that list of three goals I \nmentioned, is increased efficiency in the use of energy. So far, I have \ndescribed ways in which the bill achieves the goal of increasing \nsupplies of energy, but let me talk a little bit about this efficiency \nissue.\n  As I have mentioned consistently through this past year, we cannot \nhave a sound energy policy based only on production or based only on \nconservation; we need a combination of the two. The energy policy needs \nto make a major push toward increased efficiency.\n  The first major way in which we can use energy supplies more \neffectively and efficiently is by having an electricity transmission \nsystem that is ready for the challenges of the 21st century. \nElectricity is essential to our way of life. It is how we light our \noffices. It is how we light our homes.\n  Our electric system largely operates on a design that is nearly a \ncentury old. The vulnerabilities of the current system by which we \nregulate electricity were illustrated by the electricity problems faced \nby California and the West last year and the year before. Those \nproblems which occurred on the west coast should be a wake-up call to \nthe fact that we need to deal with these electricity markets in a more \nproactive way.\n  In addition to these problems, there are important opportunities \nduring the next few years. Literally billions of dollars of investment \nwill be planned and committed to electricity generation and \ntransmission. Those investments will have 30- to 50-year lifespans, so \nit is important we get it right. Market institutions need to be \ndeveloped that ensure reliable and affordable supplies of electricity, \nand policies need to be adopted that favor future investments in new \ntechnologies and give consumers real choices over the energy they use. \nI believe the provisions contained in this bill do that.\n  First, the bill sorts out the roles and responsibilities between the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission and the States. We give FERC \nclearer direction as to what its role is in ensuring the adequacy and \nreliability of a transmission system. FERC is given, in fact, \nresponsibility for making mandatory adherence to rules to promote the \nreliability of this interstate transmission system in this legislation. \nThe bill also gives FERC tools to make sure competitive markets work \nwell to provide customers with affordable electricity by strengthening \nits authority\n\n[[Page S1436]]\n\nover mergers, clarifying its authority over market-based rates, and \nincreasing the transparency in energy market information.\n  One of the lessons we all learned as we watched the collapse of Enron \nwas that we need more transparency. We need more openness in these \nmarkets so we can see on a real-time basis what is being bought and \nwhat is being sold and at what price.\n  Finally, the bill begins to address the tough issue of siting new \nelectric transmission lines. This is obviously a contentious and \ncontroversial issue. I believe the Federal Government can play a role, \nthrough FERC, in assisting in decisionmaking at the regional level, and \nwe try to put in place a framework for the Federal Government to assist \nStates in more effective regional coordination on all of these energy \nissues, including transmission siting.\n  On energy efficiency, this modernized electricity system is a major \nway to move ahead and position the country for the future. A second is \nto increase the efficiency of the various uses of energy across the \nboard in vehicles, in industry, in appliances, in buildings. I will \ntalk a minute for each of those.\n  The bill contains provisions that directly bear on fuel efficiency of \nvehicles. We will have a great deal of debate on that. One mandates \nhigher fuel efficiency in the vehicles that are purchased by Federal \nagencies for civilian use. We also provide a framework for the \nDepartment of Energy to assist States in expanding voluntary incentive \nprograms. The major initiative in this area is an increase in the \ncorporate average fuel efficiency, or economy, standards. The House-\npassed bill had a very weak provision on this subject. We attempt to do \nbetter.\n  The chart we have shows the problem we have with oil being imported \ninto this country. The top line is total oil demand. Something in the \nrange of 52 to 54 percent of our oil today is imported. Our total \ndemand for oil is represented by that top line, and it is continuing to \nrise as we go from the year 2000 to the year 2020.\n  All projections are it will rise. The reason it is rising, looking at \nthe next line down: The transportation demand line is also \nrising. Unless we can do something to flatten out that transportation \ndemand line by using gasoline more efficiently, we will not do anything \nvery significant to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n\n  We try to do that in this bill. As I indicated, there will be a great \ndeal of debate about whether or not we are doing what we should do \nthere. I believe strongly that we should strengthen or increase \ncorporate average fuel economy standards. We are trying to do that.\n  This chart also reflects our projection as to what would be achieved \nby opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling. The small \nred line on the bottom of the chart shows that there would be increased \nproduction. The green line on the bottom is domestic oil production. It \nwould go up if there were an opening of ANWR to drilling and \ndevelopment, but in our view it does not constitute a substantial \nsolution to the problems we face.\n  These issues, both the CAFE standards and the ANWR issue, are issues \nabout which we will have a great deal of debate.\n  We also have provisions in the bill to improve the energy efficiency \nof Federal buildings and schools and public housing. We have provisions \nto reduce energy use in manufacturing and other industries, provisions \nto increase efficiency for numerous consumer and commercial products, \nand we reauthorize the important Federal grant programs that help low-\nincome families pay their energy bills and reduce their energy costs. \nThat is something which I think all Senators will support.\n  We could go into great detail about each of these, but in the \ninterest of time I will not do so at this point. Let me just point out \nthat there will be an opportunity to debate these issues as we get into \nthe amendments. The Senate bill addresses each of these areas. We have \ntried to work hard with Senators who have an interest in them to come \nup with consensus proposals.\n  Let me also talk about energy efficiency research and development. \nThe research and development emphasis that is in this bill applies to \nincreased supply because much of our ability to increase supply depends \nupon increased research and development activity, but also the \nincreased research and development applies to improved efficiency in \nour use of energy. We have a major push for that in the bill. We \npropose a funding increase--from $810 million in fiscal year 2003 to \nover $1 billion in 2006--that will support efficiency progress across \nthe spectrum. I believe this is one of those areas where we have a \ntremendous amount that can be accomplished. I believe very strongly the \nprovisions in this bill will move us in that direction.\n  One particularly exciting R activity being funded as part of this \nbill is a program called the Next Generation Lighting Initiative. In \ncontrast to a grant program with the same name in the House bill, the \nSenate bill establishes a Government-industry partnership to develop \nthe technology for semiconductor-based lighting that would be \nultraefficient. The model for this partnership is the SEMATECH \nconsortium, established several years ago, which boosted our national \ncompetitiveness in semiconductor manufacturing in the 1980s and 1990s.\n  Current lighting technology wastes an enormous amount of energy going \ninto the bulb in the form of heat. That is one reason it feels so hot \nunder kleig lights. Light-emitting diodes, which have been developed in \nrecent years, create light with very little energy loss. The only \nproblem is that we do not know how to commercially manufacture, at low \ncost, reliable light-emitting diodes producing white light. There are a \nlot of good ideas for how to do that. This Next Generation Lighting \nInitiative will try to develop long-lasting, cost-competitive white \nlights from diodes by the year 2011, and develop those in a way they \ncan be manufactured at a low cost. We are continuing to use the light \nbulb that Thomas Edison developed. After 100 years, I think it is time \nwe move to a new generation of technology. This provision in our bill \ntries to help us do that.\n\n  All the major elements of the U.S. lighting industry are supporting \nthis effort in the Senate energy bill. The rationale for their interest \nand for a Government-industry partnership is clear: Lighting represents \n20 percent to 30 percent of all U.S. electricity use. The best current \nsystems are about 25 percent efficient. That is, for every kilowatt of \npower going in, you get about 25 percent of it back in light. We need \nto change that. The technology is here to do that. We need to find a \nway to manufacture it in a low-cost way.\n  These energy efficiency assistance programs are the Low Income Home \nEnergy Assistance Program, the LIHEAP program, with which we are all \nfamiliar here in the Senate, and also the Weatherization Assistance \nProgram. We propose to authorize those at a higher level and to make \nthose more useful programs for all parts of the country. As I said \nbefore, those are provisions which should get the support of all \nSenators. I certainly hope that is the case.\n  The third and final goal of the bill is reducing the adverse effects \nof energy on the environment. Energy production and use are associated \nwith a host of consequences for the environment. We need to strike the \nright balance among energy and the environment and the economy in order \nto deal with the longstanding concern we have in the Senate and in our \nsociety in this regard. This bill addresses these issues in a number of \nways.\n  There are provisions in the bill dealing with the legacy of past \nproblems posed by energy production and use for the environment. These \ninclude programs to clean up orphaned and abandoned oil and gas wells \nand programs to develop research to remediate groundwater supplies \ndamaged by past energy activities. Another way in which the bill \naddresses the connection is by developing and adopting new energy \ntechnologies with better environmental performance.\n  Probably the most important future problem on which we need to focus \nas part of this bill is the problem of increased concentrations of \ngreenhouse gases in the atmosphere and the impact they are believed to \nbe having on the climate. We have various provisions in this bill that \nensure we integrate climate change strategy with our energy policy. We \nwill have a chance later in the debate to go into those in great \ndetail. Some of those provisions\n\n[[Page S1437]]\n\nare drawn from a bipartisan climate change bill sponsored by Senator \nByrd and Senator Stevens. That had the unanimous support of the \nCommittee on Governmental Affairs when it was reported out of that \ncommittee.\n  We need a strategic plan for climate change that can get buy-in from \nboth the Congress and the administration. Just before our Presidents \nDay recess, President Bush announced a new climate change policy \nframework based on reducing the greenhouse gas emission intensity of \nthe U.S. economy. Emission intensity is defined as the output of \ngreenhouse gases divided by the gross domestic product. The President \nannounced that his plan would decrease emission intensity by 18 \npercent by the year 2012. That sounds impressive until you look at this \nchart we have here entitled ``Greenhouse Gas Emission Intensity; recent \ntrends as compared to the Bush proposal.''\n\n  The black line which leads up to about halfway through the chart, up \nto 2002, shows how greenhouse gas emission intensity has been declining \nin the 1990s. Greenhouse gas intensity has been declining because the \npart of the economy that is growing fastest is the service sector, \nwhich does not produce greenhouse gases in any significant amount.\n  The red line, which is on this chart--you can see it very clearly \nthere--shows what the President claims his proposal would do.\n  The green line, which is harder to see because it is covered up by \nthe red line, shows what would happen if current trends were simply to \ncontinue. The point is, it is hard to see the green line on the chart \nbecause it is almost completely covered up by the red line. Simply put, \nthe President's proposal would not change the trend in greenhouse gas \nintensity over what would likely happen at any rate based on current \ntrends. It is perhaps a good thing. The President has indicated an \ninterest in climate change policy--a policy that does not improve over \nwhat would likely happen anyway, and is certainly not an adequate \nstrategic plan in my view. We will have an opportunity to debate that \nissue as part of this bill as well.\n  I will not go into detail about the various provisions in the Byrd-\nStevens proposal except to say that I believe they set up a good \nframework for addressing this issue in future years.\n  Strengthening our Nation's energy infrastructure security is another \nkey issue as a result of the terrorist attacks we have suffered.\n  This is something that I am sure is of great concern to all Senators. \nWe have various provisions in the bill that attempt to do that. One set \nof relevant provisions has already been described--giving FERC \nauthority to promulgate rules to ensure the reliability of States' \nelectric grids.\n  Another set of provisions in the bill focuses on the Nation's \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. This is a major insurance policy against \ncutoffs of oil from the Middle East.\n  We have a provision to provide for permanent authorization of that \nand fulfilling of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.\n  Let me say a few final words about R, technology transfer, and \neducation as crosscutting themes in this bill.\n  I have described the many provisions of this bill in terms of the \nthree overarching themes of increasing energy supply, increasing the \nefficiency and productivity of energy use, and coordinating energy \npolicy with other societal goals. Throughout these discussions, I have \ndescribed R programs that play a major role in achieving these goals. \nAn aggressive and forward-looking R program on energy is the \npervasive cross-cutting theme of this bill. I believe there is a broad \nconsensus in the Senate that new science and new technology are at the \ncore of any solution to our national energy challenges. Yet, despite \nthe importance of energy R, our recent commitment to it leaves a lot \nto be desired. Federal energy technology R today is equivalent, in \nconstant dollars, to what it was in 1966. Yet, our economy is 3 times \nlarger today than it was in 1966. When you look at trends in Federal \nexpenditures for R over the last 10 years, some startling facts stand \nout.\n  First, while Federal R expenditures for health science at the NIH--\nthe blue line--and basic science at the National Science Foundation--\nthe black line--have grown during the 1990s, R support for energy--\nthe red line--has stagnated or even fallen, in real timers. Today, in \nreal terms, we are still below where we were in 1990 in terms of \nsupport for energy science and technology. For fiscal year 2002 and \nfiscal year 2003, the Bush administration has proposed nothing to \nreverse these trends. Both budget requests proposed cuts in R for \nenergy.\n  It is hard to see how you build a 21st century energy system on \nstagnant, 1960's-level-of-effort R budgets. This bill builds these \nbudgets in a rational way to levels that, by 2006, will give us a \nrobust energy R effort to support the goals of this bill.\n  As we proceed with this debate, there will be areas in which we reach \nbipartisan agreement and areas in which we will differ substantially. \nIn the latter areas, we will have to make a choice between \nalternatives.\n  With respect to the areas of bipartisan agreement, I am pleased with \nthe support that we have received from the administration for our \nposition that electricity is an integral part of any energy bill. They \nhave worked hard on assisting with electricity as a part of this energy \nbill. We may differ on a number of the details, but the President and \nthe Department of Energy have made clear their interest in working on a \nbipartisan basis to get electricity provisions that increase renewable \nsources of electricity, protect consumers, and promote a reliable and \neffective transmission grid.\n  The Administration has also supported our initiative to promote the \nconstruction of the Arctic Natural Gas Pipeline.\n  There are also some important differences between where we are \nstarting in this bill and the administration's positions. Perhaps the \nmost reported-upon difference is on drilling in the Arctic Refuge. We \nwill probably not get to that debate immediately, but when we do, the \ndifferences will be apparent.\n  We support a stronger standard for central air conditioning units, \nrecognizing that their energy use on hot summer days are a key \ncontributor to the threat of brownouts and blackouts. In my view, the \nadministration's position to roll back the standards it found when it \ntook office was a mistake, based on incorrect and outdated data on \ncosts. In hearings in the Energy Committee, this point was explored in \ndetail.\n  We are advocating a much stronger position on CAFE standards in this \nbill than the administration is willing to step up to. We believe that \nthere is no conflict between safety, employment, and higher fuel \nefficiency in cars. They myths that higher standards will lead to less \nsafe cars, or that we will lose domestic employment if we make our cars \nand trucks more fuel efficient are just that--myths. The National \nAcademy of Sciences pretty much exploded them in the report that \nCongress commissioned it to write on the subject.\n  Finally, now that we have seen the President's proposal on climate \nchange, we must recognize some real differences between our approach \nand the President's plan, which is simply business as usual.\n  I hope there are some concrete steps we can take to actually reduce \nthe amount of carbon we are putting into the atmosphere. It is not \nenough to just reduce it relative to our GNP. We need to reduce it in \nabsolute terms at some stage in the foreseeable future.\n  I hope we can have a very good debate. I hope we can come together--\nboth Democrat and Republican Members of the Senate, as well as the \nadministration--and have a thoughtful analysis of our current energy \nchallenges and demonstrate a willingness to take some bold policy steps \nto address those challenges. The country needs no less. Our national \nsecurity, our future economic prosperity, and the jobs of millions of \nAmericans are at stake as we try to shape an energy policy for these \nnext several decades.\n  I look forward to the debate. I know my colleague from Alaska, the \nranking member on the committee, is here to give his opening statement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, under the order, we are likely to go \nout at 12:30 for the luncheon recess.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Senator Bingaman has used how much time?\n\n[[Page S1438]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Approximately 55 minutes.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. So I would have perhaps 30 minutes left. I propose \nthat I be allowed to proceed when we come back. I have probably a \nlittle less than 55 minutes. I am somewhat reluctant to start and be \ninterrupted. I would propose to the leader that we might use the \nremaining time for Senators who want to speak in morning business, and \nI be allowed to introduce my opening statement at 2 o'clock when we \ncome back. We will probably have statements and take amendments as they \ncome up.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could respond to my friend from Alaska, \nwhat the Senator from Alaska proposes is that we go into a period of \nmorning business until 12:30, and at 2:15, when we return, the Senator \nfrom Alaska be recognized for up to 1 hour; at 3:15, the Senator from \nSouth Dakota, the majority leader, or his designee would offer a \nmodification. The Senator has suggested that he proceed at 2:15.\n  For the convenience of everyone, I propose that the majority leader, \nor his designee, at 2:15 lay down the modification, which would take a \nmatter of a few minutes at the most, and then the Senator from Alaska \nwould have 1 hour to present his opening statement.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may respond, I certainly have no objection to the \nprocedure of the majority leader laying down his modification. I don't \nwant to be bound by a time agreement. We didn't discuss a time \nagreement on opening statements. It is not my intention to speak at \nlength, but I would not like to be limited necessarily.\n  Mr. REID. I think that is entirely appropriate. I would like to hear \nthe Senator speak longer than an hour.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am sure the Senator would.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/05/senate-section/article/S1438-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. REID.

It has been long delayed, but it is a most \nimportant debate on whether or not we are going to have an energy \npolicy for this country of ours.\n  At the end of the Vietnam war, as a young naval flight officer, I \nmoved from California to Delaware to enroll in the University of \nDelaware Business School. One of my earliest memories of coming to \nDelaware is sitting in line, waiting to buy gas for my car. We were in \nthe middle of an oil embargo, and at that time you could only buy gas \nevery other day. We did not have an energy policy in the mid 1970s. We \ndo not have one today.\n  Twenty-eight years ago, some 30 percent of the oil we used in our \ncountry was imported. We had a trade balance that was pretty much even. \nThere was not much of a deficit. Greenhouses at the time were something \nin which we grew plants. We did not worry about greenhouse gases and \nwhether or not we would have a hole in the ozone layer of our \natmosphere. That was 28 years ago. Today, almost 60 percent of the oil \nwe consume comes from other places around the globe. A lot of it we buy \nfrom people who don't like us very much and, I am convinced, use some \nof the money we send them to try, in some cases, to hurt us or our \ninterests.\n  Our trade deficit has ballooned to $300 billion, and not all of it \nbut a good chunk of it is attributable to the oil we import. Today, \nwhen people talk about greenhouses, we still grow plants in them, but \nwe also worry about greenhouse gases and what is going on with the hole \nin the ozone layer, what is going on with a rising global temperature, \nand what is going to happen to our sea level in this world over the \nnext 100 years if we do nothing about it.\n  The question we are going to be answering in the next couple weeks \nis, What kind of energy policy should we have in this Nation?\n  Like most of my colleagues, I would argue that the answer to that \nquestion has two parts. One part says we create more energy. And while \nwe work to do that, in a variety of ways, the second part says we need \nto conserve more energy.\n  Let me talk a little bit about both of those issues: First, the \ncreation of more energy and, second, the conservation of energy.\n  I live in a State where, I am told, we actually grow more soybeans in \nSussex County, DE, than any other county in the country. We also have \nmore chickens in Sussex County than any other county in the country, \nincluding those in Arkansas. We can look to those soybeans for a source \nof energy. Frankly, we can look to those chickens as a source of \nenergy, as well, as we go along.\n  We raise soybeans in Delaware to feed chickens. We feed them the hull \nof the soybean. The oil that comes out of the soybean we do all kinds \nof things with in this country. We create soy foods, soy milk. We also \ncan create something called soy diesel fuel: 20 percent soy, the rest \nis diesel. We can burn it in our diesel-consuming machines, and it \nworks just fine. It is energy efficient. It works well in the \nmachines, and the emissions are no worse, for the most part, than any \nregular diesel fuel. In some cases, they are actually better.\n\n  We have too much soybean in this country; we have a glut of that \ncommodity. It is a good alternative to use the soybeans that are in \nexcess on our farms to help lessen our reliance on foreign oil.\n  We have figured out how we can burn animal waste to derive the Btu \nvalue, including chicken litter, in ways that are environmentally \nfriendly.\n  In my State, we have the biggest independent producer of solar energy \npanels in the country. We are proud of the work they do at AstroPower. \nAnd it is not just at AstroPower; there are places all over this \ncountry that are relying more and more on solar energy in developing \nevermore efficient ways to create that solar energy.\n  Windmill farms are becoming more common in this country. Hopefully, \nas we continue to perfect that technology, they will become even more \nefficient.\n  Others have spoken, and will in the weeks ahead, about geothermal \nenergy, how we can take hot air in the summer and run it 300 feet \nunderground to cool it off, and then use it to cool our homes in the \nsummer; and we can take cold air in the winter, run it 300 feet \nunderground to warm it up, and then use it to warm our homes and \nbusinesses in the winter.\n  Those are just some of the ideas of renewable energy that we can use, \nthat we can rely on, that we are more relying on, and need to do more \nso in the future.\n  We also have, as Senator Bingaman said earlier, a lot of coal in this \ncountry. I think he said we are the ``Saudi Arabia of coal.'' I am \nprivileged to represent the State of Delaware in the Senate. I was born \nin West Virginia. I know full well they have a lot of coal there and \nother places around our Nation. We ought to find ways to burn that coal \nwithout doing more harm to our environment. We can do that. Clean coal \ntechnology is very promising. We need to continue those efforts.\n  There has been some discussion already today about natural gas. We \nare starting to rely more on natural gas from other places around the \nworld. We have a lot of it in our country. But consumption is going \nright through the roof because we have such good environmental \nconsequences compared to other fossil fuels we use. There are\n\n[[Page S1439]]\n\nhuge finds of natural gas in the northern parts of Alaska. We ought to \nbring it down here and use it.\n  Similarly, in the Gulf of Mexico there are huge deposits of oil and \nnatural gas that are available to us to be extracted safely and in an \nenvironmentally sound way. Those are sources on which we need to rely.\n  A year or so ago, I reported back to my colleagues about a trip in \nwhich I led a bunch of Boy Scouts from Delaware on down to Norfolk \nNaval Station. The trip was on a weekend a year ago last January. We \nvisited a lot of ships and submarines. It was a lot of fun for the \nadults and for the young Scouts.\n  One of the ships we visited was the Teddy Roosevelt, a nuclear-\npowered carrier. It is about 1,000 feet long. It is about 25 stories \nhigh. It carries a crew of roughly 5,000 men and women. Underway, it \nhas about 70 aircraft or so that it takes with it. It needs to refuel \nabout once every 25 years--once every 25 years.\n  For us to walk away from nuclear power as if it is from a day gone by \nI think is a mistake. I fully acknowledge the security concerns that \nrevolve around nuclear power and terrorism. I acknowledge the \nlegitimate concerns about disposal. But having said that, the potential \nis real, and we have only begun to realize it. I urge us not to walk \naway from that technology while we work to solve the issues regarding \nsecurity, the environment, and disposal.\n  Another very promising area for creating new energy is fuel cells.\n  The idea that we can take hydrogen, which we have in abundance, and \nderive energy from that hydrogen and end up with a waste product that \nis H2O--what a bonanza, what potential.\n  This is 2002. By 2012, we will have cars, trucks and vans traveling \nthe highways of America powered by fuel cells. We will have homes, \nbuildings, and factories that are going to be powered by fuel cells.\n  In Government, if we are smart enough to, one, invest in the research \nand development; two, help commercialize those new technologies, \nincluding fuel cells; and, three, in addition to doing those things, if \nwe will provide tax incentives to encourage producers to produce those \nmore fuel and energy efficient, environmentally efficient, and friendly \nsources of energy, and to encourage consumers to buy them, we will do \nthis country and this planet a real favor.\n  Let me talk about a couple of efforts on the conservation side. We \nwill have a substantial debate on CAFE standards in the next 2 weeks. \nThat deals with the efficiency of the cars, trucks, and vans we drive.\n  I would suggest we consider and keep in mind these principles as we \ngo forward. As we seek to reduce the amount of oil our cars, trucks, \nand vans consume, one, let's work to find meaningful reductions in oil \nconsumption by motor vehicles.\n  Two, let's set measurable objectives so we actually know we are \nmaking progress and we can measure our progress against the objectives.\n  Three, let's provide a reasonable time line for the auto industry to \nmake the changes it needs to make to bring more energy-efficient \nvehicles to the market.\n  Four, let's make sure we don't get rid of, as collateral damage, the \ndomestic auto industry; but when we finish our work in 10, 15 years \nfrom now that we still have a strong and vibrant, even more strong \ndomestic auto industry.\n  Fifth, we ought to set some long-range goals for car makers and truck \nmakers with respect to oil consumption. We should defer to other \nentities, to NHTSA, within the Department of Transportation, to \nactually do the intermediate setting of goals for fuel efficiency.\n  Six, we need to think outside the box with respect to the auto \nindustry so that they have some additional tools to work with to help \nthem get to the target we are going to set.\n  One of those I have already mentioned is fuel cells. Fuel cells is \nwhere we are going to be in 10 or 15 years. Today, we are, for the most \npart, the internal combustion engine. The bridge to the future with \ncars, trucks, and vans is with hybrids. We are starting to see the \nintroduction of gas hybrid vehicles that are getting 50, 60 miles per \ngallon. I continue to be struck by a presentation I received from \nDaimler-Chrysler where they shared with us a model vehicle they could \nproduce which gets 75 miles per gallon. It is a four-door passenger \nvehicle, the SX-3. They cannot sell them in this country. It is a \ndiesel hybrid vehicle. They can sell them in Japan and Europe.\n  We need to work with the auto industry to help them achieve the next \ntier of standards, tier 2 standards, for emissions that include \nnitrogen oxide. We need to be mindful that diesel-powered vehicles, \nwhich now account for about 40 percent of the sales in Europe, can do a \nlot to help us reduce our reliance on foreign oil and reduce carbon \ndioxide emissions which lead to greenhouse gasses and global warming.\n  The last topic I want to address is what the Government can do: One, \nwe can invest our money, our taxpayer money in research and development \nin ways that will help us to create more energy and to conserve more \nenergy.\n\n  We can use the buying power of the Federal Government on both the \ncivilian and military side to help commercialize new technologies. If \ncompanies, particularly in America, are building more fuel-efficient \nvehicles, whether they are gas hybrids, diesel hybrids, and eventually \nfuel cells, we should use our buying power to commercialize those \ntechnologies in the marketplace.\n  Lastly, if manufacturers are going to build hybrid vehicles, fuel-\ncell-powered vehicles, that will enormously reduce our reliance on \nforeign oil and that are good for the environment, we should provide a \ntax incentive for producers to produce them and for us, as consumers, \nto buy them.\n  Two general points with respect to conservation: Air conditioners, we \nhave the technology to build air conditioners that will cut our \nreliance on electricity or reduce our consumption of electricity by 30 \npercent. We can do that. We have the technology. We need to \ncommercialize the technology. We ought to build them, and we as \nconsumers ought to buy them.\n  On transmission lines, we have seen presented in our Energy Committee \ntransmission lines which are able to transmit electricity across the \ncountry and reduce the loss of energy through those transmission lines \nby some 30, 35 percent below what is currently occurring. That is \nanother thing we can do and ought to do in order to conserve energy.\n  Let me close with this: I am troubled, having felt for 28 years that \nwe need a comprehensive energy policy, by the voices I hear inside this \nbody, and outside, who say we are not going to agree on an energy \npolicy.\n  In the wake of September 11, we must develop the political will to \nhammer out an agreement on energy policy that conserves more energy and \nproduces more energy at a time when almost 60 percent of our oil comes \nfrom overseas, comes from some of the people who don't like us and who \nuse the resources we give them to threaten us. How can we not pass an \nenergy policy bill? We are smarter than that; we are better than that. \nThe American people deserve better than that as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Clinton). The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I am so pleased that finally we are \ngoing to address an energy policy for our country. It has been a long \ntime coming.\n  I thought, even since before I came to the Senate, we were not \nlooking forward enough to address the future energy needs of our \ncountry. September 11, 2001, turned an energy policy from a possible \neconomic, far-reaching element that we should put into our policy \nthink-tanks to a national security issue.\n  The fact is, if we do not have energy supplies within our own \ncountry, under the control of our own country, we are not going to be a \ncountry that is economically self-sufficient, strong, and stable. And \nwe most certainly cannot prosecute this war on terrorism if we do not \nhave a strong and stable economy.\n  The fact is, today we import 60 percent of our oil for national \nconsumption. If we had a sudden closing of Middle East oil to our \ncountry, it would have a profound impact on the stability of our \neconomy. What we cannot take, as we are looking at a fragile recovery \nin our economy, is another hit.\n  We have the chance to do what is right, to plan for the future, and \nto stabilize our self-sufficiency. What we need is a balanced energy \npolicy.\n\n[[Page S1440]]\n\n  We need a policy that addresses conservation, that says to Americans: \nYou can do certain things and cut back on your consumption, and that \nwill save millions of barrels of oil that we would need to import or \nmillions of feet of natural gas or electricity or whatever.\n  The bottom line is that we can have incentives for conservation. We \nneed to look at alternative sources of renewable energy. That is \ncertainly something we are just beginning to scratch the surface on, to \nsee what the capabilities are.\n  Nuclear power is certainly a clean energy, and we know we can build \nsafe nuclear powerplants. We have seen other countries that are \npractically totally dependent upon nuclear power, and it is a safe and \nenvironmentally sound way to produce energy. We stopped building \nnuclear powerplants, and, frankly, I think we need to look at ways we \ncan safely build nuclear powerplants today. That would provide a huge \nsource of energy in our country, and it would certainly be a way to \nbecome more independent.\n  Last but not least, we need to have more exploration and drilling in \nour own country. We need to have an energy supply that we can provide \nat home. So if we had a balanced approach, we would be able to become \nmuch closer to energy self-sufficiency. That is the kind of bill we \nneed. It is not the kind of bill that will be laid before us.\n  The bill that will be laid before us does practically nothing for the \nproduction side and relies totally on the other two prongs--\nconservation and renewable energy sources--and it is not a balanced \napproach. We must go full force on all fronts.\n  There are two things that will be very valuable. One is in the bill, \nand that is to encourage production by small businesspeople with \nmarginal well tax credits. They could actually cost nothing because the \nprice of energy is so high right now. If the price falls below break-\neven, which is $15 to $18 a barrel, we need a floor for the small guys, \nthe 15-barrel-a-day well businesses--and to put that into perspective, \n15 barrels a day is barely break-even in the best of times. A normal, \ngood well would produce 1,000 barrels or 10,000 barrels a day. We are \ntalking about 15 barrels a day. A well like that, when the price goes \nto $11 per barrel, has to shut in. It cannot stay in business. It is \ntoo small. The margins are too low, and you have to have a break-even \npoint, which is about $15 to $18 a barrel.\n  So if you have a tax credit for that small driller of 15 barrels a \nday or less, if the price goes below $15 per barrel, you can keep those \npeople in business; whereas, they would shut in the wells, as thousands \ndid when the price of oil, 2 years ago, sank to $11 a barrel. In fact, \nthose little bitty wells have a great capacity. There are 500,000 of \nthose around the country. Many have not been reopened because of the \nfluctuation and the view that if prices went down, they would have to \nshut in again, and they don't want to go to the expense of reopening. \nIf we had those 500,000 wells working and producing 10 to 15 barrels a \nday, that would equal 20 percent of America's needs--the amount we \nimport from Saudi Arabia every day.\n  Think of the stability for that small businessperson just with a tax \ncredit, if the price falls below break-even, which costs the Treasury \nnothing but keeps small business jobs going and creates stability for \nour country for 20 percent of our oil needs. That provision has been \nintroduced and it will be part of our debate.\n  We need to keep that provision, and I don't think we will lose it. \nBut it is a significant part of our energy bill that is very important \nthat we pass, hopefully, within the next few weeks.\n  The second part is opening up ANWR, the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge. There has been a lot said about the environmental concerns \nabout drilling in ANWR, but I think people who make this argument do \nnot understand the new technology for drilling. For example, the \nwildlife refuge is an area the size of South Carolina. It is, \nobviously, a vast area. The amount we would be limited to drilling in \nfrom the House bill that has come to the Senate, and which everybody \nagrees is reasonable, is approximately 2,000 acres of land. That is an \narea the size of Dulles Airport. So the area is the size of South \nCarolina, and the area of drilling is limited to an area the size of \nDulles Airport. That is what we are talking about. It would have all of \nthe environmental restrictions to make sure that land is preserved and \nnot damaged in any way for the wildlife there.\n\n  In fact, the part where you would really do most of the drilling is \nnot an area that has trees or any kind of vegetation. It is frozen a \ngood part of the year, and it is basically barren flat land. Other \nparts of the wildlife refuge do have beautiful trees and wildlife, and \nit would not be encroached on at all. So we are talking about, I think, \na very environmentally safe operation--to go in and drill. If we don't, \nlet's look at what happens to the environment.\n  If we decide not to drill in ANWR, the drilling will be done in \nRussia, right across the channel from Alaska. Will Russia put the same \nenvironmental concerns in place that we have if we do it on American \nsoil? I don't know, but I doubt that the Russian environmental \nrequirements would be as much as we would put on it if it were in \nAlaska. If Russia does this, using the same resources under the ground \nthat would be what we would drill from Alaska, then you will have \nforeign ships coming in and out right through the Alaska channel. Oil \nspills that could happen, if we were not in control of the requirements \nfor those ships, could be very damaging.\n  So I think, environmentally, it would be much safer to drill on our \nshores with our environmental requirements, with our requirements on \nthe ship that would come in and take the oil out, than to have it done \n15 miles away in Russia, where we would have no control. So I think the \nargument is better made to do it where we can control it, where we \nwould have the standards that would make sure it does not encroach on \nany kind of wildlife or wilderness area. That is why Alaskans are for \ndrilling in ANWR. That is why the State that would be most affected \nvery much wants this to happen.\n  I think it will be a huge help for our national defense if we go \nforward and drill in ANWR. Today, we import a million barrels a day \nfrom Iraq. Oddly enough, in September of 2001 we were importing a \nmillion barrels a day from Iraq.\n  Do we really want to depend on the good will of Iraq for almost 20 \npercent of the needs of our country--for jobs, for companies that need \nenergy to continue to operate, for the gasoline we buy at the pump? Do \nwe really want to depend on Iraq for 20 percent of our needs?\n  I do not think that is a prudent position. We can create the same \namount of oil from our shores in an environmentally safe way as we \nimport from Iraq every day.\n  We are going to have to make some sacrifices in our country to become \nenergy self-sufficient. It is part of our effort in the war on \nterrorism. It is part of what we should step up to the plate and do to \nmake sure our country is secure; that we do not depend on the good will \nof Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, or anyone else who produces oil that \nis exported to America. We are friends with Saudi Arabia. We are \nfriends with Venezuela. But do we really want to be dependent on any \ncountry? Do we really want to be dependent on a country that has \nclearly exhibited hostilities to the United States as Iraq certainly \nhas?\n  I hope not. I hope the Senate will pass a bill that will have the \ngoal of creating energy self-sufficiency in our country. Only then will \nwe be truly able to control our own economy. Only then will we not have \nto go begging with a tin cup to other countries to ask them not to cut \nback on their supply to our country.\n  This is not a nation that does well at begging with a tin cup. This \nis a nation that has taken the lead in the war on terrorism; that is \nstanding behind our military and our President in the prosecution of \nthis war; that is standing behind those men and women who are in harm's \nway today. To not go forward with an energy policy that protects those \nin the field and those at home and strengthens our freedom, our \ndemocracy, and our economy will be walking away from one of the most \nimportant responsibilities we have.\n  I hope we will pass an energy policy that does all that needs to be \ndone: That creates incentives for conservation; that asks Americans to \nconserve;\n\n[[Page S1441]]\n\nthat puts in place a program asking Americans to do certain things, not \nforcing them but asking them.\n  I hope we will look at new sources of energy, such as nuclear power, \nwind energy, and solar energy--all the sources that are renewable--and \nproducing in our own country, creating the jobs in our country rather \nthan exporting them overseas, giving good living wages to people in our \ncountry to drill for our own natural resources. That is a balanced \nenergy package. Anything less would be an abdication of the \nresponsibility of the Senate.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/05/senate-section/article/S1441-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON GLOBAL WARMING.\n\n       (a) Findings. The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Evidence continues to build that increases in \n     atmospheric concentrations of man-made greenhouse gases are \n     contributing to global climate change.\n       (2) The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) \n     has concluded that ``there is new and stronger evidence that \n     most of the warming observed over the last 50 years is \n     attributable to human activities'' and that the Earth's \n     average temperature can be expected to rise between 2.5 and \n     10.4 degrees Fahrenheit in this century.\n       (3) The National Academy of Sciences confirmed the findings \n     of the IPCC, stating that ``the IPCC's conclusion that most \n     of the observed warming of the last 50 years is likely to \n     have been due to the increase of greenhouse gas \n     concentrations accurately reflects the current thinking of \n     the scientific community on this issue'' and that ``there is \n     general agreement that the observed warming is real and \n     particularly strong within the past twenty years''.\n       (4) The IPCC has stated that in the last 40 years, the \n     global average sea level has risen, ocean heat content has \n     increased, and snow cover and ice extent have decreased, \n     which threatens to inundate low-lying island nations and \n     coastal regions throughout the world.\n       (5) The Environmental Protection Agency has found that \n     global warming may harm the United States by altering crop \n     yields, accelerating sea level rise, and increasing the \n     spread of tropical infectious diseases.\n       (6) In 1992, the United States ratified the United Nations \n     Framework Convention of Climate Change, done at New York on \n     May 9, 1992, the ultimate objective of which is the \n     ``stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the \n     atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous \n     anthropogenic interference with the climate system'', and \n     which stated in part ``the Parties to the Convention are to \n     implement policies with the aim of returning . . . to their \n     1990 levels anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and \n     other greenhouse gases.''\n       (7) There is a shared international responsibility to \n     address this problem, as industrial nations are the largest \n     historic and current emitters of greenhouse gases and \n     developing nations' emissions will significantly increase in \n     the future.\n       (8) The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \n     Change further states that ``developed country Parties should \n     take the lead in combating climate change and the adverse \n     effects thereof'', as these nations are the largest historic \n     and current emitters of greenhouse gases.\n       (9) Senate Resolution 98 of July 1997, which expressed that \n     developing nations, especially the largest emitters, must \n     also be included in any future, binding climate change treaty \n     and such a treaty must not result in serious harm to the \n     United States economy, should not cause the United States to \n     abandon its shared responsibility to help find a solution to \n     the global climate change dilemma.\n       (10) American businesses need to know how governments \n     worldwide will respond to the threat of global warming.\n       (11) The United States has benefitted and will continue to \n     benefit from investments in the research, development and \n     deployment of a range of clean energy and efficiency \n     technologies that can mitigate global warming and that can \n     make the United States economy more productive, bolster \n     energy security, create jobs, and protect the environment.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the United \n     States Congress that the United States should demonstrate \n     international leadership and responsibility in mitigating the \n     health, environmental, and economic threats posed by global \n     warming by:\n       (1) taking responsible action to ensure significant and \n     meaningful reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases from \n     all sectors;\n\n[[Page S1475]]\n\n       (2) creating flexible international and domestic \n     mechanisms, including joint implementation, technology \n     deployment, emissions trading and carbon sequestration \n     projects that will reduce, avoid, and sequester greenhouse \n     gas emissions; and\n       (3) participating in international negotiations, including \n     putting forth a proposal at the next meeting of the \n     Conference of the Parties, with the objective of securing \n     United States' participation in a revised Kyoto Protocol or \n     other future binding climate change agreements in a manner \n     that is consistent with the environmental objectives of the \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change, that protects the \n     economic interests of the United States, and recognizes the \n     shared international responsibility for addressing climate \n     change, including developing country participation.\n\n                  Subtitle B--Climate Change Strategy\n\n     SEC. 1011.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) evidence continues to build that increases in \n     atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases are \n     contributing to global climate change;\n       (2) in 1992, the Senate ratified the United Nations \n     Framework Convention on Climate Change, done at New York on \n     May 9, 1992, the ultimate objective of which is the \n     ``stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the \n     atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous \n     anthropogenic interference with the climate system'';\n       (3) although science currently cannot determine precisely \n     what atmospheric concentrations are ``dangerous'', the \n     current trajectory of greenhouse gas emissions will lead to a \n     continued rise in greenhouse gas concentrations in the \n     atmosphere, not stabilization;\n       (4) the remaining scientific uncertainties call for \n     temperance of human actions, but not inaction;\n       (5) greenhouse gases are associated with a wide range of \n     human activities, including energy production, \n     transportation, agriculture, forestry, manufacturing, \n     buildings, and other activities;\n       (6) the economic consequences of poorly designed climate \n     change response strategies, or of inaction, may cost the \n     global economy trillions of dollars;\n       (7) a large share of this economic burden would be borne by \n     the United States;\n       (8) stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the \n     atmosphere will require transformational change in the global \n     energy system and other emitting sectors at an almost \n     unimaginable level--a veritable industrial revolution is \n     required;\n       (9) such a revolution can occur only if the revolution is \n     preceded by research and development that leads to bold \n     technological breakthroughs;\n       (10) over the decade preceding the date of enactment of \n     this Act--\n       (A) energy research and development budgets in the public \n     and private sectors have declined precipitously and have not \n     been focused on the climate change response challenge; and\n       (B) the investments that have been made have not been \n     guided by a comprehensive strategy;\n       (11) the negative trends in research and development \n     funding described in paragraph (10) must be reversed with a \n     focus on not only traditional energy research and \n     development, but also bolder, breakthrough research;\n       (12) much more progress could be made on the issue of \n     climate change if the United States were to adopt a new \n     approach for addressing climate change that included, as an \n     ultimate long-term goal--\n       (A) stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the \n     atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous \n     anthropogenic interference with the climate system; and\n       (B) a response strategy with 4 key elements consisting of--\n       (i) definition of interim emission mitigation levels, that, \n     coupled with specific mitigation approaches and after taking \n     into account actions by other nations (if any), would result \n     in stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations;\n       (ii) technology development, including--\n\n       (I) a national commitment to double energy research and \n     development by the United States public and private sectors; \n     and\n       (II) in carrying out such research and development, a \n     national commitment to provide a high degree of emphasis on \n     bold, breakthrough technologies that will make possible a \n     profound transformation of the energy, transportation, \n     industrial, agricultural, and building sectors of the United \n     States;\n\n       (iii) climate adaptation research that--\n\n       (I) focuses on response actions necessary to adapt to \n     climate change that may have already occurred;\n       (II) focuses on response actions necessary to adapt to \n     climate change that may occur under any future climate change \n     scenario;\n\n       (iv) climate science research that--\n\n       (I) builds on the substantial scientific understanding of \n     climate change that exists as of the date of enactment of \n     this Act;\n       (II) focuses on resolving the remaining scientific, \n     technical, and economic uncertainties to aid in the \n     development of sound response strategies; and\n\n       (13) inherent in each of the 4 key elements of the response \n     strategy is consideration of the international nature of the \n     challenge, which will require--\n       (A) establishment of joint climate response strategies and \n     joint research programs;\n       (B) assistance to developing countries and countries in \n     transition for building technical and institutional \n     capacities and incentives for addressing the challenge; and\n       (C) promotion of public awareness of the issue.\n\n     SEC. 1013.

Where there is more than one OCS Production \n     State within 200 miles of a leased tract, the amount of each \n     OCS Production State's payment under paragraph (d)(2) for \n     such leased tract shall be inversely proportional to the \n     distance between the nearest point on the coastline of such \n     State and the geographic center of each leased tract or \n     portion of the leased tract (to the nearest whole mile) that \n     is within 200 miles of that coastline, as determined by the \n     Secretary. A leased tract or portion of a leased tract shall \n     be excluded if the tract or portion is located in a \n     geographic area where a moratorium on new leasing was in \n     effect on January 1, 2001, unless the lease was issued prior \n     to the establishment of the moratorium and was in production \n     on January 1, 2001.\n       (f) Payments to OCS Political Subdivisions.--Thirty-five \n     percent of each OCS Production State's allocable share as \n     determined under subsection (e) shall be paid directly to the \n     OCS political subdivisions by the Secretary based on the \n     following formula:\n       (1) 25 percent shall be allocated based on the ratio of \n     such OCS political subdivision's population to the population \n     of all OCS political subdivisions in the OCS Production \n     State.\n       (2) 25 percent shall be allocated based on the ratio of \n     such OCS political subdivision's coastline miles to the \n     coastline miles of all OCS political subdivisions in the OCS \n     Production State. For purposes of this subsection, those OCS \n     political subdivisions without coastlines shall be considered \n     to have a coastline that is the average length of the \n     coastlines of all political subdivisions in the state.\n       (3) 50 percent shall be allocated based on the relative \n     distance of such OCS political subdivision from any leased \n     tract used to calculate that OCS Production State's \n     allocation using ratios that are inversely proportional to \n     the distance between the point in the coastal political \n     subdivision closest to the geographic center of each leased \n     tract or portion, as determined by the Secretary. For \n     purposes of the calculations under this subparagraph, a \n     leased tract or portion of a leased tract shall be excluded \n     if the leased tract or portion is located in a geographic \n     area where a moratorium on new leasing was in effect on \n     January 1, 2001, unless the lease was issued prior to the \n     establishment of the moratorium and was in production on \n     January 1, 2001.\n       (g) Failure To Have Plan Approved.--Any amount allocated to \n     an OCS Production State or OCS political subdivision but not \n     disbursed because of a failure to have an approved Plan under \n     this section shall be allocated equally by the Secretary \n     among all other OCS Production States in a manner consistent \n     with this subsection except that the Secretary shall hold in \n     escrow such amount until the final resolution of any appeal \n     regarding the disapproval of a plan submitted under this \n     section. The Secretary may waive the provisions of this \n     paragraph and hold an OCS Production State's allocable share \n     in escrow if the Secretary determines that such State is \n     making a good faith effort to develop and submit, or update, \n     a Plan.\n       (h) Use of Amounts Allocated by the Secretary.--\n       (1) In general.--Amounts allocated by the Secretary under \n     subsection (d) may be used only in accordance with a plan \n     approved pursuant to subsection (c) for--\n       (A) activities to secure critical OCS energy infrastructure \n     facilities from human or natural threats; and\n       (B) support of any necessary public service or \n     transportation activities that are needed to maintain the \n     safety and operation of critical OCS energy infrastructure \n     facilities.\n       (2) Restoration of coastal wetland.--For the purpose of \n     subparagraph (1)(A), restoration of any coastal wetland shall \n     be considered to be an activity that secures critical OCS \n     energy infrastructure facilities from a natural threat.\n       (i) Failure To Have Use.--Any amount allocated to an OCS \n     political subdivision but not disbursed because of a failure \n     to have a qualifying use as described in subsection (h) shall \n     be allocated by the Secretary to the OCS Production State in \n     which the OCS political subdivision is located except that \n     the Secretary shall hold in escrow such amount until the \n     final resolution of any appeal regarding the use of the \n     funds.\n       (j) Compliance With Authorized Uses.--If the Secretary \n     determines that any expenditure made by an OCS Production \n     State or an OCS political subdivision is not consistent with \n     the uses authorized in subsection (h), the Secretary shall \n     not disburse any further amounts under this section to that \n     OCS Production State or OCS political subdivision until the \n     amounts used for the inconsistent expenditure have been \n     repaid or obligated for authorized uses.\n       (k) Rulemaking.--The Secretary may promulgate such rules \n     and regulations as may be necessary to carry out the purposes \n     of this section, including rules and regulations setting \n     forth an appropriate process for appeals.\n       (l) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are hereby \n     authorized to be appropriated $450,000,000 for each of the \n     fiscal years 2003 through 2008 to carry out the purposes of \n     this section.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I believe the next order of business \nis to have the opening statement of the Senator from Alaska. Unless my \ncolleague from Nevada has business to transact, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum until the Senator from Alaska arrives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I inquire about the order this \nafternoon. My understanding is the ranking member on the Energy \nCommittee intends to make a presentation. I want to inquire about the \nopportunity to make an opening statement on the bill. I inquire of the \nmajority whip what the circumstances are.\n  Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, the Senator from Alaska is going \nto speak for approximately an hour--it may last a little longer than \nthat--and thereafter the bill will be open for amendment. Or if the \nSenator would\n\n[[Page S1504]]\n\nlike to come back in an hour or so to make his opening statement, that \nwould be entirely appropriate. If the Senator wishes, we could \ncertainly make that in the form of a unanimous consent request that the \nSenator be allowed to speak on the bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I guess I do not understand whether we are going to go \nback and forth. If we are, I ask unanimous consent that I might be \nrecognized following whatever time is taken by Senator Murkowski.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator from North Dakota have some idea as to how \nlong he wishes to speak?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Perhaps 20 minutes or so. I do not know what order has \nbeen established, if any.\n  Mr. REID. There has been no order established.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that I might be recognized \nfollowing the opening presentation by Senator Murkowski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Reserving the right to object.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I do not intend to object. I propose we go back and \nforth on opening statements and, following that, pretty much on \namendments on the basis of Members coming to the floor and being \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from North Dakota still has the floor, but I \nthink it would be very good if we could get the opening statements out \nof the way as soon as we could--not limiting anybody as to how long \nthey speak. If it takes into the evening, fine. We are just getting \nstarted. I am not trying in any way to limit the length of the opening \nstatements on this bill. But I think it would be good if we could get \nthose out of the way now and move to the amendment process as soon as \npossible.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Reserving the right to object, and I shall not, I \nthink that is an appropriate procedure, if Members want to work out \namong themselves a time agreement or discuss it, but I don't think any \nMembers should be limited to a time agreement on an opening statement \nat this time.\n  Mr. REID. I note the Senator from New Mexico is here. It is my \nunderstanding he wished to speak following the Senator from North \nDakota?\n  Mr. DOMENICI. If that is the order we are in, I ask I be added to \nthat consent in that manner.\n  Mr. REID. I withdraw the previous request and ask unanimous consent \nthe Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, be recognized following the \nstatement of the Senator from Alaska, and following the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, Senator Domenici will be recognized to give his opening \nstatement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam. President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, first of all, let me compliment my \ncolleague, Senator Bingaman, for the submission of what has been a \ndifficult and long process, represented by a lot of staff work on \nbehalf of the majority. I very much appreciate his lengthy opening \nstatement because I think it provides us with a detailed explanation of \nwhat is in the bill.\n  As you know, the minority has not had an opportunity to craft this \nparticular bill. I do want to highlight that, indeed, we do want a \nbill. We think, in response to the President's request, that we should \nproceed with an energy bill, a comprehensive bill, and we believe, \nsince the House has met its obligation, it is paramount the Senate meet \nits obligation and produce a comprehensive energy bill.\n  There are a number of amendments before us today; I am estimating \nsomewhere in the area of 100 or more. As a consequence, it is fair to \nsay that many of these are very contentious.\n  ANWR has already been mentioned this morning by Senator Jeff \nBingaman; CAFE is going to require an extended debate; the renewable \nmandates are, in the opinion of some, not a mandate and, in others, a \nclear mandate.\n  The electrical portion of this bill is going to take a great deal of \ntime and explanation for the specific reason that we have not had an \nopportunity in the committee of jurisdiction to address the process \nwith extended debate, the submission of amendments, and the formulation \nof a consensus. So there is going to be a lot of education in this \nChamber. There will be a lot of input from lobbyists as a consequence \nof the unfamiliarity associated with a lot of the terminology. It may \nbe possible for Price-Anderson alone, which represents a necessity for \nthe continued contribution of our nuclear industry, to have a good deal \nof attention based on those who do not want to see the nuclear industry \nin the United States continue.\n\n  There is probably going to be considerable discussion over the issue \nof Yucca Mountain and the question of what to do with our high level \nwaste that is associated with a number of years of accumulation.\n  It is interesting to note on that particular item that the Federal \nGovernment entered into the sanctity of a contractual relationship with \nmany of the States, and certainly the industry, to take this waste in \n1998. So basically the Federal Government is in breach of its \ncontractual relationship. Yet the ratepayers have been paying into a \nfund of the Federal Government, somewhere in the area of $11 billion \nover an extended period of time, and the Federal Government has not \nbeen able to take the waste. As a consequence, the damages associated \nwith suits are estimated to be somewhere in the area of $60 billion to \n$70 billion. This seems to be overlooked in the manner in which we \naddress a resolution of Yucca Mountain and what to do with it.\n  It is fair to say that we have differences of opinion relative to \nthis particular legislation. The chairman of the Energy Committee has \nindicated a terminology that I believe will come up from time to time \nthat suggests renewable performance standards.\n  I think it is fair to say we see that as a clear mandate to achieve a \ncertain percentage. The question that comes to mind is why, for \nexample, hydroelectric is not considered to be a renewable. If it is \nnot a renewable, I don't know what it is. Is it beauty in the eyes of \nthe beholder? Is it charity in the eyes of the beholder? It has to be \nsomething, if it is not renewable. Yet it is 10 percent of our energy \nproduction. I find that rather inconsistent. But we are going to have a \nlot of time on this legislation. So we are going to have other \ninconsistencies.\n  I want to highlight that the United States has not done a bad job in \nenergy production and conservation. We have a chart that I think \nhighlights certainly noteworthy progress because it suggests that 25 \npercent of the world's energy is what we basically use to produce 30 \npercent of the world's economy. What do we do that with? We do that \nwith about 3 percent of the world's population.\n  If you look at this chart, it shows in detail that there has been \nsubstantial growth in efficiency since 1973. If you look at the chart, \nit is roughly 18,400 Btu's per dollar of gross domestic product in \n1973. In the year 2000, it is 10,600 per dollar of gross domestic \nproduct. That is a 42-percent decrease. So we are using 42 percent less \nenergy to produce the same value today.\n  I recognize we are all committed to conservation, we are committed to \ngreater utilization of renewables. But I think it is important to point \nout the direction in which we are going and what we have achieved. We \nhaven't been standing still. We haven't been going the other way. We \nhave been making what amounts to substantive and significant progress. \nAgain, we are using 42 percent less energy to produce the same value \ntoday in this country.\n  To those who suggest that the world is coming down, and to the \ndoomsayers who suggest that somehow we have to abandon our traditional \ndependence on sources of energy, whether it be coal, whether it be \nhydro, whether it be oil and gas or nuclear, for the advancement of \ngreater shares of energy sources such as might be available from wind \nor energy sources that might be available from other alternatives, I \nsuggest to you there are other charts that show an alarming \ninconsistency relative to the footprint.\n\n[[Page S1505]]\n\n  Let us look at wind energy, for example, We have developed several \ncharts. The one I want to show first is a wind farm that is familiar to \nmany people, and certainly to those who reside in California and have \nhad occasion to drive to Palm Springs and go through the Banning area \nin California where the San Gorgonio wind farm is located. For those \nwho have been there, it is not necessarily a very pretty sight. You go \nup through the pass, and you see this huge area of wind farms. Some of \nthe windmills are moving; some of them aren't moving. How you compare \nthis wind farm in proportion to the generation of oil deserves a few \nminutes of examination.\n  This chart actually shows the 1,500-acre wind farm that is in \nevidence in California today. The energy production is about 800 \nmillion kilowatts of electricity, which is equivalent to 1,360 barrels \nof oil and a footprint of 1,500 acres. I offer that in comparison \nbecause one of the lightning rods in this discussion is going to be \nANWR. Let us not kid ourselves. We are talking about footprints, and \n2,000 acres of ANWR equals 1 million barrels of oil a day.\n  We obviously need wind power, but we also have to face the reality \nthat there is a footprint. It is not very pretty. Some people say these \nare nothing more than Cuisinarts for birds because low-flying birds \ndon't do very well going through this particular type of exposure.\n\n  I am not going to spend a lot of time on this at this time because we \nwill have to get into some of the specifics in this legislation.\n  I see the majority leader is on the floor. I want to talk a little \nbit about the process because I take issue with the process. I have \ngreat respect for both the majority leader as well as the chairman of \nthe Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\n  What we have tried to do is recognize that we have an obligation to \nbe responsive to our President. Our President has charged us to help \nhim seek ways to make our Nation more secure. Our Nation's energy \npolicy is a critical first step in this enormous challenge.\n  When we fight for freedom, when we seize the day for democracy, we \nneed energy. These things cannot be done without energy. When we \npioneer new technology, that saves lives. When we turn on the \nconveniences that mark the difference between modern life and life of \nthe past, we turn to energy. It is probably something we take for \ngranted more than anything around us. That is why our work today is so \ncritical. That is partially why the process which has gotten us to this \npoint has been, in my opinion, frustrating, it has been embarrassing, \nand it has not been in the traditions of the Senate.\n  I think the process is severely flawed as a consequence of the \ncommittee of jurisdiction having been ordered by the majority leader to \nno longer take up the process that ordinarily is appropriate around \nhere; that is, the bills are referred to the committees of jurisdiction \nand the committees of jurisdiction proceed in an orderly manner--in a \nmanner where amendments are offered, discussions take place, and we \nproceed through the process.\n  Does the majority leader seek recognition?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I was just going to ask if the Senator \nwould yield at the appropriate time.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would be happy to yield without losing my right to \nthe floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I ask if the distinguished Senator from Alaska is aware \nthat the majority leader, when the Republicans were in charge, utilized \nexactly the same process the last time the energy bill the Senator is \nnow criticizing came to the floor. I am wondering if the Senator could \nclarify the difference between that set of circumstances and this one.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I think there is a significant difference. I think \nwhat the majority leader is referring to is his right to have a \ncontentious bill be introduced by the leadership. I have been around \nhere 21 years. I do not recall one instance where the committee of \njurisdiction has been deprived of the process--not only the committee \nof jurisdiction, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, but to \nsome extent the Environment and Public Works Committee, and to some \nextent I think the Commerce Committee--and, as a consequence, bring a \nbill up and bypass the jurisdiction of the committee. I think it is not \nin the tradition of the Senate. It is certainly not in the tradition of \nthe committee process.\n  Why the majority leader chose to do this on the excuse that somehow \nit was contentious, to me, fails the true test of this body, of being a \ndeliberative body that considers debate as part of the process, and \ncertainly the value of education from the standpoint of Members of the \ncommittee to proceed.\n  The majority leader knows as well as I do that the reason it was \npulled from the committee was that we had the votes to vote out a \ncertain contentious amendment, and that was to open ANWR. The majority \nleader simply pulled it. I think if he would refer to comments made by \nthe chairman of the committee, which I would be happy to quote later on \nin the debate, he would see that the chairman of the committee didn't \nhave anything to do with it. It was simply pulled by the leader. The \nleadership said they were going to take it over, and that is the way it \nwas.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, will the Senator yield for one last \ntime?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I do not mean to interrupt his presentation. I know he \nhas an opening statement. It is not my intention to debate him.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there be printed in the Record the \ndocument showing the sequence of events beginning on May 16, of the \nyear 2000.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        S. 2557--Bill Summary and Status for the 106th Congress\n\n       Sponsor: Senator Lott, Trent (introduced 5/16/2000).\n       Latest Major Action: 10/31/2000 Senate floor actions: \n     Motion to proceed to consideration of measure made in Senate \n     (consideration: CR S11417).\n       Title: A bill to protect the energy security of the United \n     States and decrease America's dependency on foreign oil \n     sources to 50 percent by the Year 2010 by enhancing the use \n     of renewable energy resources, conserving energy resources, \n     improving energy efficiencies, and increasing domestic energy \n     supplies, mitigating the effect of increases in energy prices \n     on the American consumer, including the poor and the elderly, \n     and for other purposes.\n       Titles(s): (italics indicate a title for a portion of a \n     bill).\n       Popular Title(s): Oil Dependency on Foreign Resources bill \n     (identified by CRS); Energy Security Act (identified by CRS).\n       Short Title(s) as Introduced: National Energy Security Act \n     of 2000; Marginal Well Preservation Act of 2000; Frontier \n     Exploration and Development Incentives Act of 2000; Federal \n     Oil and Gas Lease Management Improvement Act of 2000; Arctic \n     Coastal Plain Domestic Energy Security Act of 2000.\n       Official Title as Introduced: A bill to protect the energy \n     security of the United States and decrease America's \n     dependency on foreign oil sources to 50 percent by the Year \n     2010 by enhancing the use of renewable energy resources, \n     conserving energy resources, improving energy efficiencies, \n     and increasing domestic energy supplies, mitigating the \n     effect of increases in energy prices on the American \n     consumer, including the poor and the elderly, and for other \n     purposes.\n       Status: (dates in italics indicate Senate actions).

Madam President, I say for the Record that the majority \nleader at that time, Senator Lott, introduced an energy bill outside of \nthe committee. It was read the first time and was placed on the Senate \nLegislative Calendar under ``Read the First Time'' on May 16. On May \n17, the bill was read the second time. And then on September 22 of the \nyear 2000, the majority leader made a motion to proceed. None of the \nactivity had taken place in committee, except for one hearing. I think \nthe Senator from New Mexico has had multiple hearings on energy and on \nthe bill over the course of the last many months. But this is exactly \nwhat our Republican colleagues did in May and September of the year \n2000.\n  So I find it a little inconsistent for the Senator to criticize our \nefforts to bring a bill to the floor this year when his party and his \nleadership did exactly the same thing in May and September of the year \n2000.\n  Again, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, let me respond to the majority leader \nbecause I think we should pursue this a little bit, because the \ntraditions of Senate procedure are very much in play.\n  While I agree that bills have been brought to the floor in accordance \nwith Senate rules, I completely disagree the Republicans brought bills \nto the floor while violating the Senate rules. As long as I was \ncommittee chairman under Senator Dole and Senator Lott, I can never \nrecall of one instance where the majority leader ordered me--ordered \nme--to stop the process of marking up a bill and shut down the standing \ncommittee of the U.S. Senate.\n  And Senator Daschle, that is exactly what you did on October 9th of \nlast year. You ordered the Senate energy committee to suspend markup of \nthe energy bill. As a result, the committee has not held a legislative \nmarkup since August of last year out of fear that we would want to \nbring up amendments regarding energy, because you knew we had the votes \nto pass them out.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would like to finish my statement. I will be happy \nto yield at the conclusion of my statement.\n  I am sure those on the other side of the aisle recognize that the \nStanding Rules of the Senate require committees to meet regularly to \nconduct business. And I am not aware of any unanimous consent request \nasking the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to be exempt \nfrom the rules of the Senate. So I think the comparison of what \nRepublicans and what Democrats did is completely different.\n  Let me refer the Senator to--before I yield, and I will yield--to a \nrelease that came out of Senator Bingaman's office. This came out \nOctober 9. I quote:\n\n       At the request of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, \n     Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff \n     Bingaman today suspended any further mark-up of energy \n     legislation for this session of Congress. Instead, the \n     Chairman will propose comprehensive and balanced energy \n     legislation that can be added by the Majority Leader to the \n     Senate Calendar for potential action prior to adjournment.\n\n  I am happy to yield to the majority leader, without losing my right \nto the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Madam President, I hope the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska has more documentation than a press release that will allow him \nto make the assertion he has just made. I do not order my chairmen to \ndo anything. I consult with them. I talk with them. But I think the \nSenator from New Mexico, who is on the floor, can attest to that fact.\n\n  There was no ordering here. There was plenty of consultation, just as \nI am sure there was some consultation with the Senator from Alaska when \nSenator Lott chose to bring the energy bill to the floor in May of the \nyear 2000. I doubt very much that he ordered Senator Murkowski or \nanybody else to comply with his wishes. I am sure he consulted. That is \nexactly what we did.\n  So I hope the Senator has some documentation to support his assertion \nbecause that is quite a charge. I will say that there was ample \nconsultation, not only with the Senator from New Mexico but many other \nSenators who also had jurisdiction.\n  Nine different committees have had some jurisdictional role to play \nwith regard to the completion and the progress on this legislation--\nnine committees. To take up this bill, in sequence with each of the \nnine committees, or even simultaneously, for that matter, would be \nquite a legislative undertaking.\n  So we have worked diligently to come up with a working draft that we \nhave shared with our Republican colleagues. But to assert that I \nordered anybody to do something is, I think, not only an error but is a \ndisservice to the process that we have been engaged in.\n  I thank the Senator again for yielding.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, could I also respond to----\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. If I may, before the majority leader leaves, tell him \nthat I very much appreciate that we have had this dialog because I \nthink it truly represents a departure from the committee norm that I \ncertainly have learned to expect around here. And the fact that the \nmajority leader has seen fit to identify that the Republicans have done \nit, therefore, it is all right--or the implication of that--I think is \nnot necessarily applicable to good legislation or a process.\n  I again would demur, because having been on the Energy Committee for \na little over 21 years, somewhere between 21 and 22--I have never, \nnever had a situation where the majority leader has taken, if you will, \nan action, either direct or through the chairman, which would absolve \nthe committee from its function.\n  The fact is, we have not had--and I think the majority leader can ask \nany member of the committee, at least in the minority, as to whether or \nnot we have had any significant input in this legislation. We have not. \nWe have hot had any markups or any opportunity for any amendments. And \nI think the majority leader would have to acknowledge that because that \nis factual.\n  It was rather curious at the time this was done. It was shortly after \nwe lost control of the U.S. Senate. It was shortly after it became \napparent that we had the votes to get out an amendment that would \ninclude opening up ANWR. It was clear that we had the votes to do it.\n  Then the majority leader has left us in this quandary where he stated \nthat even if you do have the votes--and it would be a 60-vote point of \norder on a cloture--why, we cannot win because he will pull the bill \ndown. I think that kind of an approach to the Democratic process around \nhere is a bit inconsistent with tradition.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. If the Senator will yield one last time, I know Senator \nBingaman has been patiently waiting to be able to register his own \ncomments here.\n  Let me just say, it is just not accurate for the Senator from Alaska \nto assert that this is unprecedented. That is the word he used; this \nwas ``unprecedented.'' As I said for the Record--it is now part of the \nRecord--this very action was taken by the majority leader in May and \nSeptember of the year 2000--exactly the same.\n\n  So I would just make sure that our colleagues are aware, this is not \nunprecedented. It has happened on many, many occasions, involving many, \nmany issues and many committees.\n  I think we ought to get on to the substantive issues, and put this \nprocedural issue to rest once and for all. We have a lot of important \nsubstantive debates in store. I look forward to having those. But I do \nhope we can clarify the Record in this regard and move on to more \nsubstantive questions.\n  Again, I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. It is isn't a matter of who is going to have the last \nword. The majority leader should have the last word. But, on the other \nhand, this committee was requested to stop markup, and that is a fact. \nAnd I do not think it can be colored any other way by the majority \nleader.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, may I clarify, since I have been quoted, \nat least?\n\n[[Page S1507]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Johnson). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, since I have been quoted, or a press \nrelease has from my office, the decision to terminate the markup of any \nlegislation on energy was made by me after consultation with the \nmajority leader because it was a joint decision by us that the best way \nto get a bill to the Senate floor, which reflected the policies that we \nagreed made sense for the country, was to pursue that approach.\n  As the majority leader has pointed out, that is exactly the approach \nthat Senator Lott used when he was majority leader.\n  As far as the action we have taken in the Senate Energy Committee, I \nthink the Senator from Alaska will acknowledge that we have had a \nseries of hearings. We have had various confirmation hearings. I have \napproached the Senator from Alaska several times in the last several \nmonths to see whether or not we could proceed to consider legislation \nwithout having controversial energy bill amendments added to that \nlegislation. I was informed we could not.\n\n  We have held off on considering those other nonrelated pieces of \nlegislation. We have worked hard to accommodate the majority and to \naccommodate the administration in getting all of their nominees \napproved. We have worked hard to have hearings that were of interest to \nmembers of the committee. And we intend to continue doing so.\n  Frankly, I am very proud of the product we are bringing to the Senate \nfor consideration today. It is a good bill. It does reflect many \nproposals that came from the Republican side. We worked hard with \nMembers from the Republican side to perfect provisions in this bill. It \nhas not been in an official markup. But just as we have worked with \nDemocratic Members to perfect provisions in the bill, we worked with \nRepublican Members to perfect provisions in the bill, and the same with \nthe administration. This is a combined effort. I feel very good about \nit.\n  I hope we can get on with a discussion of the bill, with \nconsideration of amendments, to the extent that Senators have \namendments. I know there are many. That is exactly what this period on \nthe Senate floor is devoted to.\n  I know the Senator from Alaska has been anxious to get a debate on \nthe Senate floor and anxious to get an opportunity to offer his \namendments. He has that time. He has that opportunity. I hope we will \nuse it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend for his comments. I, too, wish to \nget on with my opening statement.\n  We have to call a spade a spade around here for a change. I hope the \nchairman of the Energy Committee would recognize the reality and \nacknowledge that indeed the reason we could not agree on proceeding \nwithin the committee on various amendments is because we could only \nagree to it if we didn't offer an amendment to put ANWR in the package. \nIf I am wrong on that, I hope Senator Bingaman will correct me. That is \nclearly my understanding. The realization was that the votes were there \nto vote it out of committee, and they didn't want to have a vote in \ncommittee. That is a rationale. I think we should quit kidding \nourselves.\n  I didn't read all of Senator Bingaman's press release, but I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Energy Committee Suspends Mark-Ups; Will Propose Comprehensive and \n             Balanced Energy Legislation to Majority Leader\n\n       At the request of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle, \n     Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee Chairman Jeff \n     Bingaman today suspended any further mark-up of energy \n     legislation for this session of Congress. Instead, the \n     Chairman will propose comprehensive and balanced energy \n     legislation that can be added by the Majority Leader to the \n     Senate Calendar for potential action prior to adjournment.\n       Noted Bingaman, It has became increasingly clear to the \n     Majority Leader and to me that much of what we are doing in \n     our committee is starting to encroach on the jurisdictions of \n     many other committees. Additionally, with the few weeks \n     remaining in this session, it is now obvious to all how \n     difficult it is going to be for these various committees to \n     finish their work on energy-related provisions.\n       Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Bingaman said, the \n     Senate's leadership sincerely wants to avoid quarrelsome, \n     divisive votes in committee. At a time when Americans all \n     over the world are pulling together with a sense of oneness \n     and purpose, Congress has an obligation at the moment to \n     avoid those contentious issues that divide, rather than \n     unite, us.\n       Bingaman will continue to consult and build consensus with \n     members of his committee, with other committee chairs and \n     with other Senators as he finalizes a proposal to present to \n     the Majority Leader.\n\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I have the greatest respect for my friend. But to \nsuggest that somehow what has happened is the everyday order of \nbusiness in the Senate, where legislation that is contentious is pulled \naway from committee, let me quote what came from Senator Bingaman's \npress release, again, on October 9. It says:\n\n       Finally, and perhaps more importantly, Bingaman said, the \n     Senate's leadership sincerely wants to avoid quarrelsome, \n     divisive votes in committee.\n\n  What is wrong with divisive votes in committee? They occur all the \ntime around here. It is a difference of opinion. It is voting out and \nprevailing or not. Here they say they want to avoid quarrelsome, \ndivisive votes in committee.\n  Furthermore:\n\n       At a time when Americans all over the world are pulling \n     together with a sense of oneness and purpose, Congress has an \n     obligation at the moment to avoid those contentious issues \n     that divide, rather than unite us.\n\n  I can tell my colleagues, by taking the authority away from the \ncommittee, it certainly did not unite us.\n  I will have a little more to say about this process because it is \nimportant that the American public understands it. We worked on a bill \nlast year. We worked with at that time the minority. We had a lot of \nhearings. But it was not on this legislation.\n  I am not suggesting there aren't good provisions in this bill. The \npoint is, the Energy Committee has not had a legislative business \nmeeting since August 1 of last year, despite the Senate and committee \nrules requiring a business meeting at least once a month. We are either \nin violation of the rules or we are not. The fact that a bipartisan \nmajority of the Energy Committee would have brought to the floor a \ncomprehensive energy bill with the chairman's report, there is no \nquestion the majority leader was free to incorporate it or ignore it, \nbut at least the Senate would have had the benefit of our views.\n  These are the facts. You cannot whitewash it any other way. The \nterminology the majority leader was critical of that I attributed to \nhim, that he had ``ordered'' or ``directed'' or ``it was agreed to,'' \nnevertheless, it happened. Things don't happen around here in a vacuum. \nWe are all aware of that.\n  The process is flawed. I am glad the majority leader was here so we \ncould have a discussion.\n  This is not a representative bill. Somehow the prevailing majority \nhas forced the Senate to consider this measure, again, without the \nbenefit of committee deliberation and action. As a consequence, he has \nmade the task much harder of moving this bill. It is much more \ncomplicated than it had to be because it has not gone through the \ncommittee process. To say, well, Senator Lott did it that way, I can \ntell my colleagues, again, I know of no instance where the committee of \njurisdiction was removed from its obligation to address the issue \nbefore it.\n  Difficult and divisive issues that could and should have been worked \nout in committee are going to be right here in the Senate Chamber.\n  I am going to work towards a bill. That was the first thing I \nindicated in my opening statement. I mean that. We want a bill. We want \na comprehensive bill. We want a good bill. But we want some input in \nit. So what we will have to do is have our input by amendment. We don't \nthink that should have been necessary but, clearly, that is the only \nchoice we have. As a consequence, we are going to begin a long process.\n  I suppose I will be subject to some examination, but I think the \nmajority leader said, as far as he was concerned, a portion of the bill \nwas dead--ANWR, dead. That hardly represents anything more than a \nguess. He may be right. But if it is dead, Tom Daschle killed it. Make \nno mistake about that.\n  I hope when Members recognize the severity of our dependence on \nimported oil, they will recognize that in 1973 or\n\n[[Page S1508]]\n\nthereabouts, when we had the Arab oil embargo, when we had gas lines \naround the block--and some people are old enough to remember that--the \npublic was outraged and indignant, that was during the Yom Kippur War. \nWe were 37-percent dependent on oil at that time. We were blaming \neverybody. The Government was lashing out: How could this happen?\n  Now we are over 58-percent dependent. When we talk about doing \nsomething about it, we better be specific.\n  We could have had, in the committee process, hundreds of amendments \nthat could and should have been dealt with in the committee. Now they \nare going to take time on the floor away from our deliberations because \nthe excuse I have heard so far is they are contentious. I don't know \nwhat isn't contentious around here. We all respect each other's \nopinions. But we are entitled to express those opinions in a process \nassociated with the committee function.\n  As far as I am concerned, the majority leader took control over the \ncommittee process. He said: We are going to have 60 votes because there \nis going to be a filibuster.\n  I have never heard or seen that kind of an action taken before. Maybe \nsomeone will enlighten me as to when the authorities have been taken \nfrom the committee. Every committee chairman, whether Republican or \nDemocrat, should remember this because it is a milestone in \ninconsistency--a milestone, in my opinion, not in the best tradition of \nthe Senate.\n\n  Now, we have heard our majority leader lay the responsibility around \nhere, but I think the fault rests solely with his judgment. I don't \nthink there is any question about it, and I doubt very much if anyone \nwould disagree with me, Republican or Democrat alike.\n  But even with the additional hurdles now being put before us, I think \nwe can move a bill off the floor. This Nation needs an energy bill, one \nthat is rooted in findings--the finding of new alternative energy \nsources, boosting efficiency, and helping us use less energy. This is \nsomething with which Republicans agree. But efficiency and alternatives \nare simply a two-legged stool, and they are not enough. Alone, they are \nnot going to close the gap between energy supply and demand in this \nNation.\n  We must also seek to safely increase our domestic energy resources, \nand we must do it in a way that protects our environment. How do we do \nthat? We do that through technology. Make no mistake, we are the most \nefficient economy in the world, and we are getting better. I have \nindicated on this chart, again, the recognition of just how well we are \ndoing. As the chart indicates, we are doing pretty well. The fact that \nwe have been able to increase, if you will, our energy efficiency by \n40-some-odd percent I think is evidence of the advancements we have \nmade.\n  Now, it was approximately 42 percent. As I indicated, this chart \nshows growth in efficiency since 1973, and it shows a 42-percent \ndecrease, if you will. That is a decrease in our utilization of energy. \nAgain, if 3 percent of the population of the United States utilizes 25 \npercent of the world's energy and produces 30 percent of the world's \neconomy, that is not a bad start. So we are using 42 percent less \nenergy to produce the same value today. That is what that chart shows.\n  Senator Bingaman and I have a lot of charts here, so we will probably \nbe trading charts before this process is over. What we have done, to a \ndegree--and we can do better--is we have proven we can balance our \nconservation and environmental protection with increased domestic \nenergy production. For that reason, I refuse to take part in the fable \nbeing put forth by those who are running the so-called spin machines \naround here that say the Nation needs to make a choice. Some say we \nneed to make a choice between using the energy technologies of today--\ncoal, oil, gas, hydro, nuclear--or using energy technologies of \ntomorrow.\n  Now, some would discuss this as energy vis-a-vis the environment. I \ndon't think that is the issue. Some say this is about today and \ntomorrow. I don't think that is the issue. Some insist whatever \nsolutions we propose, they can't be done safely today. I don't think \nthat is the issue. The logic sells the American worker and American \ningenuity far too short. We need to strive for new technologies and \ndiversify our energy supply. We need to conserve more and become more \nenergy efficient.\n  If this bill passes today, we will not be driving hydrogen cars \ntomorrow, in spite of the fact that many have suggested, ``Why can't \nwe?'' It is simply a matter that we don't have the technology. We will \nnot be powered by solar or wind energy by morning. We cannot simply \nshut down the economy of this Nation and put our national security on \nhold for a generation or more while we work on new technologies. What \nwe are going to have to do is build a bridge. I think most people would \nagree that we need to build a bridge through technology to assess, if \nyou will, the goals of tomorrow. It is not going to come just by \nsetting a standard and making it become effective in 12 to 15 years. \nMost of us are not going to be around to be held accountable in 12 to \n15 years for a goal set today.\n\n  We have seen what has happened since 1992, when we set certain \nstandards around here on mileage for utilization of nonpetroleum-based \nutilization in Government vehicles. We haven't achieved that, for the \nmost part. We have been in violation of the agreement. Whom do you \nblame? The Federal Government. What is achievable, and at what cost? \nHow much are you willing to spend? These are all legitimate \nconsiderations that I think have to be dealt with in an open debate and \nin a manner in which we can get the best experts to advise us on just \nwhat course of action to take.\n  Our energy comes from many sources today--coal, oil, natural gas, \nhydro, nuclear, and so forth. We must, through the technology, explore \nnew and highly, perhaps, unachievable technologies today, but they \nmight be achievable tomorrow, because they can reduce our consumption \nin the coming years.\n  Recognize, Mr. President, we have 200 million cars on the road. Oil \nis going to continue to be the primary ingredient in surface \ntransportation needs for the foreseeable future--even if they get 30 \nmiles to the gallon. A lot of people reflect on all sources of energy \nthat we have in this country and say: Aren't we fortunate? We have \nhydro and nuclear, and we have plenty of oil and gas, and a good deal \nof it we import. Nevertheless, we have it, and we have technology for \nwind and solar. But make no mistake about it, for transportation, the \nworld is beholden to oil. We don't fly in and out of Washington on hot \nair--although there is a lot of it here. So whether it be on the ships, \ntrains, trucks, cars, or airplanes, it is oil.\n  The world is in the same position. Transportation is dependent on \noil. So we have to reflect on reality and recognize that, as we become \nmore dependent on oil, it is from overseas. We import that oil, and we \nbecome more vulnerable. As I indicated, in 1973 we were 37 percent \ndependent on imported oil; today, that is magnified to 58 percent. What \nabout nuclear? We have over 100 nuclear plants spread across the \ncountry. They provide nearly 20 percent of the energy produced in this \nNation. We see that new electric plants are being built today that run \non natural gas.\n  The United States is the ``Saudi Arabia of coal.'' We have West \nVirginia coal. We have Pennsylvania coal. We have coal in Alaska. We \nhave a supply of coal that would last for centuries. We can use these \ncoal resources in a cleaner, more efficient way, and we have to do \nthat. We can do that. It is just a matter of applying our technology.\n  Now, all this, to a degree, relates to the economy of this country. \nWe are talking about jobs. It is pretty simple. Development of our \ndomestic resources. I am talking about resources in the United States. \nThat is going to mean thousands and thousands of jobs across our \nNation. I am talking about pipe, new software, building new double-\nbottom, double-hull supertankers, which we are currently building in \nCalifornia and in Mississippi. These are U.S. ships--the largest \nconcentration of tonnage under the U.S. flag in our merchant marine \nservice. These are mandated by law because the carriage of goods \nbetween two American ports has to be in a U.S. flag vessel, with a U.S. \ncrew, built in a U.S. yard.\n  So these are big job issues, Mr. President. That oil that moves from \nmy State of Alaska doesn't go to Japan. There hasn't been a drop of oil \nthat has moved outside the United States since a year ago last April. \nWhat did go was\n\n[[Page S1509]]\n\na very small amount that was excess to the west coast. There is no \nexcess oil going from the west coast. We are importing oil from Saudi \nArabia, as well as other areas, and bringing oil down from Alaska. My \npoint is very clear: We are becoming more dependent on imported oil, \nand as we do so, we are exporting our dollars and our jobs. What is the \nlogic of that?\n\n  The development of domestic resources would mean thousands and \nthousands of jobs across the country. These are good paying jobs. These \nare not service jobs flipping hamburgers in a McDonald's. As I \nindicated, ships will be built by high-skilled workers. This will help \nturn around our economy and get us out of this rather soft recession.\n  Somebody put together a figure--and I do not know how correct it is--\nthat we have lost some 700,000 jobs since September 11. Whatever the \ncase, it is time to put American workers back to work. We can do it, \nbecause we have before us some opportunities to produce more energy in \nthe United States.\n  Let's talk about some of the groups that are supporting proposals to \ndevelop more domestic energy in the United States. The Teamsters, the \nSeafarers International Union, the Maritime Laborers Union, the \nOperating Engineers Union, the Plumbers and Pipefitters Union, the \nCarpenters and Joiners, Building Trades, dozens of labor groups \nrepresenting thousands of workers are behind our efforts for a \ncomprehensive energy bill that creates nothing more than jobs in this \ncountry.\n  I suspect every Member of this body is a little concerned about the \ncreation of jobs, the maintenance of jobs, the switch we have seen, as \nwe have seen more jobs in the service industry but less higher paying \nblue collar jobs.\n  Dozens of labor groups representing thousands of workers are behind \nour efforts for a comprehensive energy plan that creates jobs, that \ndevelops energy sources at home. For this reason, I am going to oppose \nany amendment or underlying provision that sacrifices American jobs for \npolitical expediency. I am not interested in political expediency. I \nhave been in this body for over 21 years.\n  I also reject the underlying premise of the majority leader, the \nsenior Senator from Connecticut, and the junior Senator from \nMassachusetts--who I hope will join us in this debate. Those who oppose \ndomestic resource development do not believe that American workers and \nAmerican technology can develop our natural resources while fully \nprotecting the environment. We have that capability, there is no \nquestion about it.\n  Some Members may choose to rely on sources such as Saddam Hussein or \nothers for our supplies, but I will stand with the American workers to \ndevelop these new technologies. Unlike those who oppose nuclear, hydro, \nnatural gas, and oil, I have faith and confidence in this Nation and \nthe men and women who drive it. We need an energy bill that provides \ntoday's resources to move us to tomorrow's promises, not the shallow \nmeasures before us with empty promises that simply export the wealth, \njeopardizes the national security, and shifts U.S. jobs overseas.\n  Obviously, we have some differences of opinion with America's \nenvironmental community. They are opposed to various parts of this \nbill, particularly those parts that suggest we can develop our domestic \nresources at home; more particularly our oil. They have no scientific \nevidence to suggest that we cannot. None whatsoever. We will have an \nopportunity to get into that a little further in the debate.\n  Let's talk a little bit about the bill before us, the bill that was \nintroduced by the majority leader--call it the Daschle bill. As far as \nI am concerned, it is pretty hard to identify new job production \nassociated with that legislation. We have already discussed that we \nhave not had hearings, we have not had input, and the excuse has been: \nSenator Lott did it; therefore, it is all right. I think I have already \nmade that point, and that point is very explicit. We have never had \nresponsibility pulled from the committee simply because the votes in \nthe committee were supportive of an amendment that would increase \ndomestic production.\n\n  Since we have not had the benefit of committee debate and approval, I \nwant to delve into this bill for a closer look. What does this bill do? \nEven though we have only seen it for a very short period of time, the \nlegislation appears to authorize some 60 new Federal programs, many of \nwhich already exist at the Department of Energy or elsewhere. We can go \ninto those.\n  We are told there are some 32 new studies on various impacts of \nenergy policy, but studies are what one calls for when you are not \nready to act. We are ready to act. We need an energy bill now. We need \nto make decisions now. There is nearly $49 billion in new spending \nauthorizations over the next 5 years. In a time of fiscal constraints, \nthe level of spending called for in this bill, if fully funded, is well \nabove the baseline estimates for these programs. This elevated level of \nspending will take precious funds away from other spending priorities, \nsuch as homeland defense, education, and health care.\n  As a matter of energy policy, these authorizations have questionable \nvalue. Unrealistic authorizations, in my opinion, are nothing more than \nempty promises. So we have waited for 6 months for the new energy \nproposal. Yet it is not much different than the one offered nearly a \nyear ago.\n  What is different now is that 700,000 Americans are out of work in \nthis country, a recession, I remind you, that was the direct result of \none thing: Energy price increases that we experienced in 1999 and 2000, \nall for a lack of an energy policy.\n  I will go through the titles very briefly. Title X, XI, and XIII of \nthis bill simply rehash other Senators' proposals to address the risk \nof climate change, and there are so many conflicts among these \nprovisions that will need to be sorted out that is going to take a lot \nof time. Title XII, XIV, XV, energy R and workforce training is the \nwork product of the only markup held before the Energy Committee. What \ndoes that say for the committee process? I know that other committees \nwere affected.\n  In addition, the committee had agreed this provision needed to be \nrevisited before we completed our markup.\n  Title XVI, technology assessment: Like so many other parts of this \nbill, it is a title for which no legislative hearings have been held, \nno scrutiny whatsoever. The scrutiny on it is obviously lacking.\n  Title I through IX are largely the same as in Senator Bingaman's \noriginal bill, I might add.\n  Title XVIII, critical energy infrastructure, was the very same title \nthat prompted the Democratic leader and the Energy Committee chairman \nto suspend committee action in the first place. I ask, what is new, \nwhat is different about this proposal to merit delaying discussion on \nthese important issues for the past several months?\n  On a positive note--I am sure my colleagues wonder if there are any \npositive notes in this bill; I am pleased to say we do. I do not \nsuggest there are no provisions of the pending legislation that have \nredeeming social value. There are several. There are provisions that we \nhave generally agreed on that could have been refined and supported \nalmost unanimously in committee had we been allowed to meet.\n  Among those provisions are title I, regional coordination of energy \npolicies and planning for energy infrastructure; title II, PUCHA and \nPURPA repeal for electricity and possibly changes in other provisions \nin this title with minor changes; title III, hydro relicensing. The \nproposal in this bill reflects part but not all of an emerging \nconsensus on how to balance power needs with environmental concerns. \nAnd title IV, Indian energy programs. I only wish the Committee on \nIndian Affairs had been allowed to hold hearings to consider these \nprograms in some detail.\n  I happen to be a member of that committee. I am a member of the \nFinance Committee. We still have not reported out the tax aspects \nassociated with this bill.\n  So we have title V, the Price-Anderson, both the chairman of the \nEnergy Committee and I proposed full review of Price-Anderson for both \nthe DOE contractors and the NRC licensees. Why NRC licensees are not \nincluded, I am not sure, but hopefully we will find that out in our \ndebate. Title VI, permanent authority for the SPR and a related study \nof SPR capacity are areas of broad agreement.\n  Title VII, higher standards for Federal fleet fuel economy proposed \ncomes\n\n[[Page S1510]]\n\nfrom our bipartisan energy proposal and other alternative fuel \nprovisions that are basically taken from H.R. 4, the House bill, and \nthe renewable motor fuel provisions for ethanol are the same as those \nthat I proposed last year in a draft revision of our bipartisan bill.\n  We agree on much of title IX, energy efficiency, with one large \nexception for the 13 SEER air conditioning standards rejected by the \nadministration last year.\n  There is agreement in principle but not on specific spending levels \nor program structures in title X, onward, with respect to climate \nchange and energy R Many of the subtle differences of opinion \nthroughout this bill could have been easily addressed in a committee \nmarkup and not on the Senate floor, but we are left with that reality \nfor reasons we have already articulated, although we have differences \nof opinion on those, and I respect that. So I regret we were deprived \nof the chance to proceed in committee, for now we will have to deal \nwith these changes on the floor, which will make our task harder and \nlonger.\n  Since I commented on the areas of agreement, let me comment on the \nissues of disagreement because this is where we are going to be \nspending a lot of time.\n  We are talking about issues of agreement, and despite the broad \nagreement on the majority of issues contained in this bill, there are \nsome other provisions which we have great disagreement on. I want to \naddress some of those today. I think we should have been able to \nprovide the Senate with a recommendation and some sense of legislative \nhistory, and we should have been able to better define the debate, but \nbecause of the reality that the committee has not had an opportunity to \nmeet, why we have no other choice but to proceed.\n  I think it is important that particularly the minority that we are in \nnow reflect on what our intention was so we could communicate that to \nthe majority. So we developed some principles on one of the more \ncontentious parts of the bill, and that was the electricity portion.\n  Basically, what Republicans, as a minority, stand for in our caucus \nis an obligation to, first, protect consumers.\n  That would give the Federal Trade Commission precautions and \nprotections without preempting the traditional authority of the States. \nWe feel very strongly about that. We are talking about trying to \nstreamline the regulatory process, eliminate some of the obsolete \nstatutes like PUHCA and PURPA, and limit Federal micromanagement.\n  One has to wonder, if we reflect on the Enron situation, if we had \nwhat is in this bill, could there have been an orderly transition of \nthe market working? Because what happened with Enron clearly was: The \nmarket worked. There were no interruptions of power. There were no \nprice increases. One wonders if we had to get permission if one company \nwhose trading suddenly falls to its knees can have an orderly, \ninnovative market work. Well, maybe we can get to that, but I \npersonally am a little uncomfortable with too much Federal \nmicromanagement.\n  We also stand for enhancing interstate transmission while preserving \nState authority through the interconnection concept. We want to assure \nreliability and allow regional flexibility, the North American Electric \nReliable Council enforceable standards. We want to promote renewable \nenergy, market-driven approaches and consumer choices and not Federal \nmandates. That is kind of where we are coming from.\n  Again, those issues we disagree on because we could not get together \nand resolve our differences in committee. Among those issues we \ndisagree on are the extent to which we should strip States of their \nrights over electricity and give those rights to the Federal Government \nthrough FERC. How much should we manipulate the electric markets and \nforce a higher priced energy resource on to the consumer at a lower \ncost? This is the issue of renewable portfolio standards.\n  How best to protect nuclear plant operators from any exposure on a \ncatastrophic loss and how to keep them afloat, that is the Price-\nAnderson. Some people see this as a way of prolonging the life of the \nnuclear industry, but I take issue with those people because they are \nnot realists and do not recognize that there is a trade-off.\n  There are no emissions with nuclear. There is a problem with waste, \nbut it is emission-free. We look at global warming concepts. We look at \nemission standards. There is certainly room for the nuclear energy \nindustry, and they need Price-Anderson.\n  Where do we explore for energy resources to meet our growing needs? \nWe know about ANWR, but what about the lower 48? How do we make \nautomobiles more efficient without jeopardizing safety, undermining \nconsumer choice, and hurting the American worker? This is very real, if \nyou are working in an automobile plant or in a parts plant.\n  How to make our homes more efficient, again, without hurting the \nAmerican worker? Our energy efficiency standards such as the proposed \n13 SEER air-conditioning and heat pump standard--are those the answer? \nOur disagreements on these provisions are deep and run to the heart of \nwhat we believe the proper role of government to be.\n  Many of these provisions constitute an unacceptable intrusion of the \nFederal Government into the marketplace. Many of these provisions have \nlittle to do with our energy security but represent a growth in Federal \nauthority at the expense of the States and our concept of federalism.\n  Some of these issues impact my State of Alaska. The rationale is very \nclear. We have a chart here that shows Alaska and gives you some idea \nof the geographics of the area, because it has been said the energy \nwealth of North America is in the Arctic. If you look at Canada over in \nthe all-white portion here, and look at Russia over across the Bering \nStraits in the all-white, what you have between them is Alaska. If you \nconcede the energy wealth of North America is coming from the Arctic, \nyou have to concede one thing: The only State with ``Arctic'' in it is \nAlaska, and we have already seen the development of oil from Prudhoe \nBay. That has constituted initially 25 percent of the total crude oil \nproduced in this country but today about 20 percent. It is pretty \nsignificant.\n  A lot of people forget that the same arguments that prevailed in this \nbody in the 1960s are prevailing today on the issue of opening up ANWR.\n  We have another chart I want to show on Alaska that gives a little \ndifferent view because it projects the ANWR issue. We will go into this \nin greater detail. But what I want to show is the realization that the \nPrudhoe Bay oil field has produced that energy for about 27 years. It \nhas produced it by an 800-mile pipeline, so the infrastructure is \nalready there. It is pretty significant because I indicated it is 20 \npercent to 25 percent of our total energy.\n  Let's relate that to real terms because it is appropriate that we \nrelate this to things we can all understand. How big is Prudhoe Bay? It \nwas supposed to have recoverable reserves of 10 billion barrels. We are \nin the process of producing the 13 billionth barrel now.\n  How big, according to the experts in the final USGS study? There was \none made in 3 days to accommodate the former Secretary of the Interior, \nbut the current one, the most credible one, suggests the reserves at \n5.6 billion to 16 billion barrels. If it is an average between the two, \nit is about 10 billion barrels, which would provide the Nation with as \nmuch as Prudhoe Bay is currently providing. So you double that.\n  The question is, Can you do it safely? We will get into it later. The \nfootprint is pretty small. In H.R. 4, the House bill, it was 12,000 \nacres. We are not talking about peanuts here. If the oil isn't there, \nit will not be developed; that is all there is to it. We have to find a \nlot of oil in Alaska because the costs are so high.\n  The chairman of the committee talked a little bit about natural gas \nthat has been found. It is important to note on this chart that this \ngas has been found associated with looking for oil, not gas. It is an \nincidental find. I used to say to the geologists: If you find another \ngas discovery, forget it. We are not even going to buy you a Coke. We \nare looking for oil. But in the process, they accumulated about 36 \ntrillion cubic feet of proven gas, the largest deposit of gas known to \nexist in North America. So it is very important that we look to ways to \nget that out. I\n\n[[Page S1511]]\n\nappreciate working with my colleague, the chairman of the committee, in \nthat regard.\n\n  We need the development of gas from the Arctic. Our country needs it \nfor the simple reason that we are pulling down our gas reserves faster \nthan we are finding new ones. I think we have a chart that shows our \nreserves in decline. The Senate plan that the Democrats propose--the \nSenate Democratic plan that has been presented--initially was to \nprovide, I believe, a $10 billion guarantee. It did not address a route \nselection.\n  One of the amendments I am going to have will be to mandate a \nsouthern highway route that would bring the gas down paralleling the \npipeline to Fairbanks and follow the highway into Canada. That would \nkeep options open for Alaskans. It would keep options to bring gas down \nto the port of Valdez if the market for the liquefied natural gas in \nAsia should develop. It would provide an alternative to bring gas into \nFairbanks and take that gas further on down to Point Mackenzie or take \nthe gas into Anchorage or down the Kenai Peninsula where gas is \nliquefied and exported and urea and ammonia are made. We want to keep \nall our options open. So it is very important a southern high route be \ndesignated in this legislation.\n  Make no mistake about it, I support the development of the resources, \nboth the oil and gas. However, the proposal put forth on the other side \nallows for some untested technology to be used in sensitive areas of \nthe Arctic over the opposition of some of the Native people and \nvirtually every elected official in Alaska.\n  What I am concerned with here is the realization that currently this \nlegislation does not exclude another route, which would be a route over \nthe top, across Canada. Most of those jobs and most of that activity \nwould benefit Canada and not the State of Alaska, nor American labor.\n  I remind my colleagues, the gas in question is owned exclusively by \nthe State of Alaska. This is not Federal gas. This gas is on State \nlands associated with the fields at Prudhoe Bay which are on State \nlands. Unlike discussions about leasing of the so-called 1002 area--\nthat chart is behind this one--the Coastal Plain where the subject of \nFederal lands is the issue, the issue involving gas is strictly on \nState lands and is an issue of the State's ability to develop and \ntransport a resource owned exclusively by the State and not the Federal \nGovernment.\n  As a delegation, Senator Stevens, Representative Young, and I have \nworked with the Governor and Lieutenant Governor and our Native \npopulation and others to ensure that any proposal fully protects the \ninterests of our residents, the environment, and the state of our \neconomy. So it is important to have a proposal that meets, if you will, \nour wishes relative to what is in the best interests of the State as \nwell as our Nation. Our Nation, again, is pulling its gas reserves down \nfaster than we are finding new reserves.\n  Furthermore, the project that has been proposed has some problems \nwith it because the producers of the gas--namely, Exxon, British \nPetroleum, and Phillips--have indicated at the current prices the \nproject is uneconomic at this time. We have a situation where, to make \nit economic, we are going to need some assistance. What I am talking \nabout is how we can work to come up with a methodology to take some of \nthe risk out of the movement and development of this project because \nthis will be the largest and most expensive construction project ever \nundertaken in North America. We have to be careful that it stimulates \nthe United States economy and not the Canadian economy, and that we \nrecognize the contribution of American workers by keeping as much as \npossible of this pipeline in the United States or Alaska.\n  What we have here, of course, among our critics are, for the most \npart, people who have never visited the Arctic. They have never taken \nan opportunity to go up there.\n  I will say Senator Bingaman has accompanied me up on occasion, where \nwe had the Secretary of the Interior. We got a lot of fresh air. It was \ncold. But, nevertheless, I think we were given an opportunity of having \nextended hospitality by the Eskimo people, as well as seeing some of \nthe highest technology in the oil and gas business underway.\n\n  It is my intention to offer significant amendments to this gas \nprovision to make sure that the development of Alaska gas is done in \nthe most environmentally sensitive way as possible. That mandates the \nselection of the southern highway route. I intend to work closely with \nmy colleague, Senator Bingaman, on these amendments. And I certainly \nappreciate his support.\n  There is another area, however, where we have some differences. I \nwould refer to some of the statements that I have heard. I am not going \nto go into ANWR in any detail. But I think it is important that we \nreflect on a few things that are in the minds of some.\n  We have a chart that shows what happened to our imports of oil when \nthe Trans-Alaska pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez was built. We have \nheard critics and environmentalists suggest that the impact of ANWR \nwould not have any significant effect on oil imports into the United \nStates. It shows the barrels of oil per day that the United States \nimports. In the time frame between 1977, 1978, and 1979, imports \nclearly were up. Then the 2 million barrels a day came down from \nAlaska. You see TAPS opens at the top, and imports begin to drop \ndramatically. The reason our imports dropped is the market for oil \ndidn't decline. It was because of the contribution by Alaska's domestic \nproduction.\n  The point of this chart is a very simple one. It simply shows that \nwhen you produce more oil of the magnitude of a million barrels a day, \nit has a decided impact on reducing imports.\n  You see this period from 1982 through about 1987, and then imports \nstart to climb up again.\n  Where would we have been if we didn't have the Prudhoe Bay \ncontribution? That is my point. It would still be going off the chart. \nThe chart in red clearly shows the import vis-a-vis Alaska production. \nThe blue line shows Alaska production coming on line and it beginning \nto decline. It would not decline if ANWR were opened.\n  We also have statements by various individuals that are made from \ntime to time relative to the effects on drilling in Alaska, and the \nimpact that it would have on various areas of concern.\n  I am going to refer to a couple of those because I think we need to \nshed some light on it.\n  I can only defer to those who have indicated some position on the \nissue of opening up the Arctic to oil and gas exploration. I would like \nto, first of all, refer to comments that were made by my good friend \nfrom Massachusetts, the junior Senator, who on MSNBC's ``Hardball with \nChris Matthews'' on February 26 of this year and indicated that:\n\n       The alternative to drilling in Alaska is several things. \n     No. 1, there should be drilling almost anywhere but Alaska. \n     No. 2, you can't drill your way out of the problem of the \n     Persian Gulf.\n\n  I think the last chart we saw indicated that by drilling our way \ndomestically we reduce our imports. I think that question has been \nresolved. I think for the first one--drilling almost anywhere but \nAlaska,--let us look at anywhere but Alaska.\n  Here is the chart of the United States. If you look at the gray \nareas, you see the areas off limits for drilling: The entire east coast \nfrom Maine to Florida, the area off Florida in the gulf, and then in \nthe overthrust belt--those areas which have been closed primarily \nbecause of wilderness mandates. Colorado, Wyoming, and various other \nStates are limited. And clearly the west coast is off limits.\n\n  I wonder where in the world the oil is going to come from if we have \ntaken all of these areas off limits. Some suggest going to the Gulf of \nMexico off Louisiana. That is where a good portion of our exploration \nis occurring. It is occurring there because of the technology. They are \ndrilling in 3,000 feet of water. The industry is doing an extraordinary \njob. We have to go somewhere.\n  Then we have heard from time to time: Who wants to drill where? \nClearly, Alaskans propose drilling and support drilling in our State.\n  The point is, you have to get it somewhere. If you do not get it \ndomestically, you are going to import it.\n  As I have indicated, gas isn't the only resource our State can \ncontribute to America's energy security. The gas\n\n[[Page S1512]]\n\nwill not fill the transportation needs of California, or some of the \nother States as some have suggested. Only the development of a small \nportion of ANWR can do this.\n  We have heard discussions on the issue of safety. We have heard \ndiscussions on the issue of Prudhoe Bay--the amount of oil, the \ntimeframe, the wildlife, and the caribou. We are going to show you some \nof the wildlife associated with the area as a consequence of good \nconservation and the fact that these animals are not subject to \nhunting. As a matter of fact, polar bear cannot be taken by a non-\nNative in my State of Alaska because it is protected by the Marine \nMammal Act. If you want to take a polar bear, you can go to Canada, or \nyou can go to Russia, but you can't go to Alaska. I think that is a \npretty significant conservation of the polar bear.\n  You see pictures of the caribou behind me. You see pictures of bears \nbecause they are not threatened. They are not shot. You can't run in \nthere with a snow machine and run them down.\n  Some would be surprised. I don't believe there is anyone here from \nTexas. So I can make this statement without fear of reprisal. But \ngeologists indicate that ANWR holds more oil than all of the proven oil \nreserves of Texas--all of Texas. I might add that Alaska is about 2\\1/\n2\\ times the size of Texas. That would equate to 30 years worth of \nSaudi Arabian imports. Engineers believe that it can be explored for \nless than a 2,000-acre footprint. The union men and women of this \nNation believe it can create thousands of jobs. It can be flowing in a \nfew years--not 10 years. It is a matter of recognizing that if we want \nto go ahead with it, we can issue the permits. We can do it safely. \nWinter exploration will occur on ice roads.\n  Some suggest that it is a decade away. That is not factual. It is \nunfortunate that some people who have never been there think they can \nmake decisions about the people who live there.\n  Unlike the plan that has been proposed on the other side of the aisle \nabout Alaska's gas, the plan to develop Alaskan oil will use proven and \ntested technology. It will take advantage of existing infrastructure on \nthe North Slope. It will minimize the impact of Arctic environment. It \nwill have the benefit of a 7-year environmental impact statement. It \nwill limit the surface footprint to 2,000 acres, and it will require \nthe use of project labor agreements--labor that will prohibit the \nexport of any energy resource. None will be exported outside the United \nStates.\n  It is overwhelmingly supported by the delegations--Senator Stevens, \nRepresentative Young, myself, our Governor, our Lieutenant Governor, \nthe State legislature, and the people of the area, the Innupiat Eskimo \npeople.\n  In conclusion, I realize that some in this Chamber regard energy as \njust a political issue, pure and simple, with pressure from the \nenvironmental community. It is just another piece of the puzzle that \nhas been laid out for us.\n  I think our last piece is to reach the bipartisan goal of coming \ntogether and recognizing that this country simply cannot proceed with \nits increased dependence on imported oil.\n  As a consequence of that, I think we have to be very careful to not \nsell America's can-do spirit short, the American family, and America's \nfuture. We must address the national security interests that our \nPresident has directed us to do by coming up with a responsible energy \nbill at this time. As a consequence, we have differences. But, \nhopefully, we can work that out through a process of debate. We have \ndifferences that we can undoubtedly address with regard to alternative \nand renewables.\n\n  But make no mistake about it, we are not going to be able to get \nthere from here on any one alone. It is going to take all our resources \nto meet our energy demands until we have significant breakthroughs in \ntechnology that will allow us to lessen our dependence on our \nconventional sources of energy.\n  Energy isn't about politics. It is about families, families across \nthis country wondering if their jobs are going to be there in the \nmorning. It is about preserving the very independence of this Nation \nbecause I believe in a nation that is dependent on no one but God \nalone.\n  I recognize the public policy debate about how best to approach our \nenergy policy. I know it is complex. I know it will involve issues at \nthe very heart of the extreme environmental agenda. Yet, at the same \ntime, I take issue with that environmental agenda because it suggests \nthat we can simply get there on conservation alone, and that is not a \nrealistic assumption.\n  At the same time, I think the issue can be framed rather simply. It \nis better to have strong domestic energy policy--I use the word \n``domestic''--that safeguards our environment and our national security \nthan to rely on the likes of a Saddam Hussein to supply this energy.\n  On September 11, we were importing a million barrels, just a little \nover a million barrels a day, from Saddam Hussein. Today that is about \n870,000 barrels a day. We bombed him twice this year, once just a few \ndays ago. We have put the lives of our young women and men at risk \nenforcing that no-fly zone over Iraq. He attempts to shoot us down. We \ntake out his targets. But we take his oil. It is almost as if we put it \nin our jet fighters and go over and take out his targets. He takes our \nmoney and develops a missile capability. He pays his Republican Guard. \nAs a consequence, he remains a threat to world peace.\n  At whom is he aiming these missiles, this biological capability he \nhas developed? At our ally, Israel. When will we come to grips with the \nlikes of a Saddam Hussein as we continue to rely more and more on that \nsource, when we have a domestic source at home that we can develop \nsafely? The answer, in my mind, is clearly that we should reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  We have a statement from an outstanding American who has indicated--\nwell, we will get it for the later debate. But we have a number of \nstatements of outstanding Americans who have indicated they believe it \nis the worst mistake we could possibly make to continue our dependence \non imported oil.\n  Excuse me. I have a chart with a quote from Richard Holbrooke, \nAmbassador to the United Nations in the second Clinton administration. \nThis was in the Washington Post of February 12. I quote:\n\n       Our greatest single failure over the last 25 years was our \n     failure to reduce our dependence on foreign oil . . . which \n     would have reduced the leverage of Saudi Arabia.\n\n  These are people who know what they are talking about.\n  Furthermore, I have to recognize the responsibility that we have in \nthis body to the President. President Bush has asked, time and time \nagain, for an energy bill. He has asked as recently as in his State of \nthe Union Address because he recognizes the urgent need for a national \nenergy plan. He knows energy is about jobs. He knows energy is about \nsecurity. He wants to protect this Nation from the Axis of Evil. He \nknows that so long as we are dependent on other nations for our energy, \nour very security is threatened and our future at stake.\n\n  So, Mr. President, our challenge is clear: To deliver to this \nPresident an energy plan for our Nation and our Nation's future. That \nis the job of this body. I have indicated, the House has done its job \nby passing H.R. 4.\n  So I pledge my support to improve the legislation before us and get a \nbill to the President as soon as possible. I urge my colleagues to \nrecognize the weight of the task before us, to push aside their \nagendas, and to do what is right for the Nation.\n  Finally, in conclusion, I encourage Members to recognize that we have \ncontentious issues here in ANWR, in CAFE standards, in renewable \nportfolio standards in electricity and perhaps several others. But I \nencourage Members to use accurate information--particularly when they \nare talking about my State, particularly when they are talking about \nAlaska and having never visited there, and particularly when they are \nexpressing the litany of opponents such as some of the national \nenvironmental groups who fail to address the question of whether we can \ndo it safely. The answer is clearly yes, we can do it safely based on \n30 years of experience in the Alaska's Arctic.\n  Is it a significant supply? Some suggest it is 6 months. Obviously, \nit is potentially as much or more than Prudhoe Bay, which has been 25 \npercent of the Nation's total production; particularly when they say it \nis 10 years away, when it is only a matter of\n\n[[Page S1513]]\n\na few years if, indeed, the oil is there; and, finally, to recognize \nthat when we passed legislation that would have opened ANWR in 1995, if \nPresident Clinton had not vetoed it, we would have all this behind us. \nWe would know whether the oil was there. And if it was, it would be \nflowing and reducing our dependence on imported oil.\n  So it is in our national security interests. It is in the interests \nof American labor and American jobs to move forward with ANWR. I \nencourage Members who have been lobbied heavily by America's \nenvironmental community to recognize that they are going to be called \non to vote, to vote on the question of whether to appease and be \nresponsive to the environmental lobbyists, or do what is right for \nAmerica.\n  I will conclude with a reference to a statement made by a former and \nrespected Member of this body, Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, who \nwas, I might add, a pacifist--at least in the minds of many of us, \nalthough we had the deepest respect for him--who said: I will vote for \nopening ANWR any day rather than send a man or woman in our Armed \nServices overseas to fight another war over oil.\n  I think that says a lot.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and look forward to the statements \nof my colleagues who will be forthcoming throughout the day.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, the events of the last year have \nhighlighted what Americans have known since the 1970s, our economic \nsecurity and our national security depend on our energy security. \nAmericans need--and deserve--an energy plan that truly moves us towards \nenergy independence.\n  America's appetite for energy continues to grow each year. Today we \nimport nearly sixty percent of our oil. And the problem is getting \nworse, not better.\n  Over the next 10 years, the United States is expected to consume \nroughly 1.5 trillion gallons of gasoline, most of it refined from \nimported oil.\n  We need to reduce our growing dependence on foreign oil. We need to \nensure the reliability and security of our energy supply. And we need \nto do so in a way that is good for our families, our economy, and our \nenvironment.\n  There is no doubt in my mind that we can do all of these things, if \nwe're willing to invest in new ideas, new technologies, and new \napproaches to old problems.\n  As we begin this energy debate, I think we should keep in mind four \nkey goals. Any energy plan we pass should increase our energy \nindependence, it should be good for consumers, it should create jobs, \nand it should be responsible, both environmentally and fiscally.\n  Nine committees have worked on this bill, and Senator Bingaman has \ndone an amazing job of coordinating input from so many committees and \nso many Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  In the end, he's put together a bill that meets each of these goals.\n  Opponents of this bill have essentially said that we face a choice \nbetween production and conservation. This bill demonstrates that we \ncan, indeed, increase both.\n  First, production.\n  For a long time, we've looked for the ``Made in America'' label on \nour clothes. We need to put that same ``Made in America'' label on our \nenergy, too.\n  That means increasing our domestic production. But it also means \nrecognizing the reality we face. We hold only 3 percent of the known \nworld oil reserves, and we consume 25 percent of the world's supply. \nEven if we drilled in everybody's back yard, we could never meet our \nown demand with our own supply.\n  One might call the assertion that we can drill our way to energy \nindependence, fuzzy math.\n  That's not to say that we shouldn't drill for oil and gas in the \nUnited States; to the contrary, we can and we must.\n  But we cannot simply drill our way out of this problem, and we should \nnot be drilling in environmentally sensitive areas, such as the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge.\n  Here is what we should do: We should look to develop natural gas \ndeposits in deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico, and allow for \nincreased production where it is environmentally acceptable.\n  We should explore for oil and gas in the National Petroleum Reserve \nin Alaska, the area where the three largest onshore oil reserves in the \nlast ten years have been found.\n  And we should construct a pipeline to bring natural gas from Alaska \nto the lower forty-eight states. There are 35 trillion cubic feet of \nknown natural gas reserves on the North Slope of Alaska.\n  Right now, we are literally pumping that gas back into the ground \nbecause we have no way of getting it to people.\n  This 2,000 mile long gas pipeline would create 400,000 jobs, use an \nestimated 5 million tons of US steel, and ensure that we do not become \ndependent on imported liquified natural gas from the middle east. If we \nwant to create jobs, increase our energy security, and help the U.S. \nsteel industry, then building this pipeline is the way to do it.\n  Energy for America, jobs and opportunity for steelworkers, and no \ndamage to sensitive environmental areas, this is the type of pro-\ndevelopment, pro-jobs, energy project we should be encouraging.\n  Others assert that we can dig our way to energy independence. Some \nsee coal as a panacea. Others see it as a dirty and unsafe source of \nenergy. But the choice between simply using more coal or less is a \nfalse choice.\n  This bill says that we can use coal better.\n  It invests in new clean coal technologies, which are good for our \nenvironment. In so doing, it will create jobs in an industry and area \nthat has been losing them, and will help guarantee the future of coal \nin America.\n  Still, we need to recognize that drilling and digging simply won't \nadd up to independence if we don't find other fuel sources here at \nhome.\n  That is why this bill invests heavily in new and renewable fuels, \nincluding biofuels.\n  For example, it will triple our use of ethanol, which is a clean-\nburning, corn-based, renewable fuel.\n  It will help us harness the power of the wind, the sun, and the heat \nof the earth itself with tax incentives to develop these sources of \nenergy, and to keep the energy produced affordable.\n  Recent analysis indicates that investing in these clean and renewable \nenergy technologies will create 1.3 million new jobs for American \nworkers.\n  More importantly, energy from these sources would come from American \nfarmers and producers, pass through American refiners, and fuel \nAmerican energy needs. No soldier would have to fight overseas to \nprotect them. And no international cartel could turn off the spigot on \nus.\n  For all of those reasons--economic, security, and environmental--this \nbill sets a goal of generating 10 percent of our energy from renewable \nsources by 2010.\n  Some states are exceeding this goal already. There's no reason that \nour nation can't meet it.\n  Our bill also invests in common-sense efficiency, and the new \ntechnologies necessary to increase efficiency without making sacrifices \nin performance.\n  Take air conditioners, for example. Two years ago, the Clinton \nAdministration issued a standard that would have increased the \nefficiency of air conditioners by 30 percent.\n  Here is what that means: a 30 percent more efficient air conditioner \nwould save our nation from having to build the equivalent of 50 new \npower plants and save Americans $3 billion in electricity bills.\n  Meeting that standard isn't a pie-in-the sky proposal or a crushing \nnew mandate for business.\n  In fact, Goodman Manufacturing Company, the second largest air \nconditioning manufacturer in the United States supports this standard \nand says that they can meet it with no additional cost to consumers.\n  As John Goodman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the company, \nsaid, ``[the higher standard] is just the right thing, and it's \nsomething our industry can do to help.''\n  The Bush Administration revoked this standard, and the House-passed \nbill doesn't include it. We think it makes sense, and that's why we \nrequire it.\n  This bill will help us make similar efficiency gains with items such \nas vending machines, commercial refrigerators, lights--even our power \nlines.\n  As Senator Kerry has said so well, you just can't tell Americans \nyou're serious about energy security unless\n\n[[Page S1514]]\n\nyou're willing to tackle transportation, where 70 percent of the oil we \npurchase is consumed.\n  During the 1970s, America created a program to increase auto \nefficiency. Those standards now save 3 million barrels of oil every \nday. But because those standards were frozen seven years ago, our \nvehicle fuel efficiency is worse now than it has been in twenty years.\n  So this bill says that automobiles and light trucks should average 35 \nmiles per gallon by the year 2013.\n  This doesn't mean that we are going to take away anyone's SUV or make \nevery American drive a compact car.\n  It means that the car companies will do what they say they can do, \nand increase the efficiency of the vehicles they make.\n  In fact, the National Academy of Sciences found that technology that \nalready exists can be used to improve the fuel economy of automobiles \nand light trucks without affecting safety or performance.\n  When the fuel-efficiency provisions of the Senate energy bill are \nfully implemented, they will not only save American drivers billions of \ndollars--they will save our Nation the same amount of oil we are \ncurrently importing from the Persian Gulf.\n  Finally, when it comes to energy efficiency, this bill says that the \nFederal Government must lead by example.\n  Last year, the Federal Government's utility bill totaled $3.4 \nbillion. This bill mandates that the government use cost effective \ntechnologies that consume less energy.\n  This small step alone--one that is not a part of the House-passed \nbill--will save taxpayers $250 million a year.\n  Doing all of this will be good for consumers and families, good for \nour energy independence, and good for our economy.\n  Finally, this bill demonstrates international leadership on global \nclimate change--leadership that the Administration, sadly, has been \nunwilling to show.\n  This bill links energy policy and climate change by creating a \nnational strategy to track and reduce carbon pollution and other \ngreenhouse gas emissions. It funds research and development on \ninnovative technologies to reduce carbon pollution, opens markets for \nclean energy technologies, and demands high-level coordination and \nleadership from the White House.\n  The science on this issue is clear. Carbon pollution and other \ngreenhouse gas emissions are causing changes in our climate, including \ncoastal flooding, agricultural disruptions and significant damage to \nour ecosystems.\n  As the largest emitter of carbon pollution in the world, I believe \nthe United States has a special responsibility to help address this \nproblem. This bill does.\n  Now, we know what our opponents are going to say about this bill and \nabout our approach.\n  They are going to say that we are going to take away people's SUVs \nand washing machines--we are going to ask you to sweat in the summer \nand freeze in the winter.\n  They will try to tell you that this is a choice between abundance and \nausterity. They couldn't be more wrong.\n  Actually, they are right about one thing--we do face a choice. It is \na choice between the past and the future, between a bill that is good \nfor consumers, or one that serves only the energy companies.\n  The energy bill that passed the House is based entirely on the old \nphilosophy of dig, drill and burn. The centerpiece of that plan is to \nopen the Arctic Refuge.\n  Supporters of drilling in the Arctic Refuge have used almost every \nopportunity to justify their position.\n  When we were experiencing rising oil prices, supporters said it would \nmake oil available quickly and drive prices down in the process.\n  But even if Congress were to authorize drilling in the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge today, we would not see significant quantities \nof oil produced from the refuge for 10 years at the earliest.\n  When our economy began to slow, supporters began billing it as an \neconomic stimulus measure, saying it would create 750,000 jobs.\n  Yet that number comes from an outdated and biased study by the \nAmerican Petroleum Institute. Recent, more credible estimates by the \nCongressional Research Service and others suggest that only 60,000 jobs \nwould actually be created.\n  And now, as we face threats to our nation's security, those same \nsupporters are wrapping their argument in the cloak of patriotism, \nsaying that drilling in ANWR is vital to increasing our energy \nsecurity.\n  But the oil there would only meet America's needs for less than 6 \nmonths.\n  Let me give you an example of how little oil that is: If we all put \nreplacement tires on our cars that were as good as the ones that came \nwith the cars when they were new, the resulting increase in energy \nefficiency would save 5.4 billion gallons of oil--70 percent more than \nthe total amount of oil in the Arctic Refuge.\n  Compare that our proposed Alaska natural gas pipeline we have \nproposed which would provide natural gas to American consumers for at \nleast 30 years.\n  The rest of the House bill is a smorgasbord of tax cuts for oil and \ngas companies. The Republican bill includes $33 billion in tax cuts. \nTwenty-seven billion of that goes to the biggest energy companies.\n  Perhaps even more astonishing is this fact: Because the House bill \nfails to make meaningful reductions in the transportation sector and \nrelies on getting oil from a source that would produce so little and so \nfar in the future, if we enacted it into law today, it would actually \nincrease our dependence on foreign oil.\n  The House plan may indeed be an energy plan for a new century. \nUnfortunately, that century is the 1900s.\n  Our bill takes the better path--for our energy security, for our \neconomy, for our environment, and for our future.\n  Now, there is one other thing we're hearing from the other party, and \nit is the complaint that this bill was not subject to a markup in \ncommittee.\n  I find this complaint to be ironic for two reasons.\n  First, it is not at all unusual to take a bill directly to the floor. \nIn fact, my colleagues might remember that the Republican leadership \ndid the exact same thing with a Republican energy bill--the National \nEnergy Security Act of 2000.\n  Second, now that we're debating an energy bill, some of my colleagues \nseem more intent on debating how we came to debate this bill.\n  I made a promise to bring this bill up for debate. That is exactly \nwhat I have done.\n  No one's right to be heard will be compromised.\n  Anyone is welcome to offer any amendment they choose.\n  I expect to have a full and open debate on this bill. The less time \nwe spend worrying about procedure, the more time we can spend debating \nthe direction and substance of our Nation's energy policy.\n  So, with that, I want to thank Chairman Bingaman and the other \ncommittee chairs who have worked so hard to assemble this bill.\n  And I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle in order to make progress on this vitally important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have had a number of calls in the \ncloakroom from Senators who want to come over and give opening \nstatements. Others want to offer amendments. I am wondering if I could \nask the Republican manager, because I have cleared this with the \nmanager on this side, if we were alternating back and forth on the \nstatements--as I said, there are a couple of more statements at least \nthat people want to give this afternoon. It is going to take us into \nearly evening. It is my understanding there is something some Members \nare interested in doing tonight. I wonder if when we get into the \namendment stage we could have an initial agreement that we alternate \nback and forth on amendments on this very important legislation. That \nis normally the way we do it. Is there any problem with that?\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, it is my understanding we had reached \nagreement on that earlier in our discussion, that we would go back and \nforth as Members appear.\n  Mr. REID. On statements.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. And we would go back and forth on amendments. I ask \nthe Chair if that agreement has not been previously made?\n\n[[Page S1515]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I apologize. I thought it was on statements.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is an agreement on the recognition of \nthe following two Senators: Senators Dorgan and Domenici, in that \norder.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I would not object to what has been propounded by the \nmajority whip.\n  Mr. REID. I would also say to my friend, so there is some order, \nSenators Daschle and Bingaman have decided they will offer the first \namendment and then we will go to the Republican side. We will probably \nnot get to that until first thing in the morning the way the statements \nare going.\n  I ask unanimous consent that in addition to the alternating of \nopening statements on this bill that the amendments also alternate; \nthat Senator Daschle or his designee will offer the first one and then \ngo to Senator Lott or his designee, and so on down the line.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I listened to the comments of my colleague \nfrom Alaska. He obviously feels passionately about this issue. I have \nserved with him on the Energy Committee for a long while. He studies \nthese issues carefully. He uses a prodigious number of charts when he \nmakes his presentations.\n  I noticed that he did say in his presentation that there is much in \nthis bill on which we can find agreement. He indicated there were a \nnumber of areas of agreement. I know he stressed areas of disagreement, \nbut I think he also said there are a number of areas in this \nlegislation where there can be some broad agreement. I think that is \nhelpful.\n  At the start, however, I want to comment on the exchange between my \ncolleague from Alaska and the majority leader.\n  The majority leader brought this bill to the floor of the Senate for \na very important reason. It is not unprecedented. It was brought to the \nfloor of the Senate rather than being moved through the committee \nfirst.\n  We all know the issue of energy security is more than just finding \nadditional supplies of energy. As a result of September 11, and other \nconcerns about the broader area of energy security, the majority leader \ndecided to bring to the floor the product of a number of different \ncommittees of the Senate working on this issue of energy security.\n  This is about protecting America's nuclear power plants against \nattack by terrorists. That is part of this bill. That is part of energy \nsecurity. So there are a series of things that were brought together, \nincluding the work and the efforts by the Finance Committee dealing \nwith tax credits. That, too, is part of this bill.\n  The majority leader decided to bring this bill to the floor as a \nproduct of a number of different committees, to work on all of these \nissues on the floor of the Senate, so all Senators would have the \nopportunity to address these issues.\n  It does not shortchange the Senate to adopt that approach. It has \nbeen done before. It is not unprecedented. And the majority leader did \nnot make a mistake in doing so. I think he advanced the interests of \nthe energy bill and advanced the interests of the debate about energy \nin this country by adopting this strategy, despite the fact that some \nof my colleagues think it was the wrong thing to do. I respect their \nopinion, but they are just flat out wrong.\n  We are here in the Chamber dealing with energy. That is where we \nought to be. This is an important public policy issue for this country. \nThe bill that has now come to the floor has the combined input of many \ncommittees, which is as it should be. We ought not deal with these \nissues incrementally.\n  I say that, because I know the majority leader has been criticized by \nsome for this approach. The majority leader has done exactly the right \nthing and has done it at the right time. He kept his word in bringing \nthis bill to the floor, so we can have an open and full debate on all \nof the issues that affect this country's energy future.\n  This is probably not the most opportune time to debate energy. Timing \nis everything, of course. This morning I stopped for gas on my way to \nthe Capitol Building, and it cost $1.08 per gallon. In high school, \nwhen I was pumping gas at my father's service station, I was pumping \ngas for about the same price--actually slightly more in real dollars \nthan we are paying today for a gallon of gasoline.\n  The current price probably does not promote great urgency among the \nAmerican people that we must have a new energy policy now. Most \nAmericans understand, despite the fact that the price of gasoline is \nvery moderate at this point, that we have a very tenuous existence with \nrespect to our economy and its dependence on a continued long-term \nsource of oil from places such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the Persian \nGulf, and Central Asia.\n  It is foolhardy for us to continue betting our future economic \nprogress on a sustained supply of oil from the Middle East. We need to \ndo better than the increasing reliance year after year that we place on \nthat supply of oil. It doesn't mean perhaps that we can ever--or \ncertainly not in the short or intermediate term--shut off that oil or \nfind replacements. I am not suggesting that. But I am saying that the \nrelentless march to increase our dependence on foreign sources of oil, \nespecially on energy coming from the Persian Gulf, is not a very smart \npolicy.\n  Let us determine how we can, together, Republicans and Democrats, in \ngood public policy, begin to ratchet that back down, so we have less \ndependence on foreign sources of energy.\n  How do we do all of that? We will hear many statements about many \nfacets of this energy policy. There are as many ideas about good energy \npolicy as there are Members serving in the Senate. Emerson once said \nthat common sense is genius dressed in work clothes. Common sense is \nwhat we need in putting together the components of an energy bill that \nwork.\n  Simply, do we need to produce more energy to meet future energy \nneeds? The answer is yes. We need to produce more. Let's do it in an \nenvironmentally sensitive way. So produce more in an environmentally \nsensitive way, No. 1.\n  No. 2, do we need to conserve more? Yes. We waste too much energy. \nLet's do that in a thoughtful way.\n  No. 3, can we achieve greater efficiency with all of the appliances \nwe use every day in every way in this country? Yes, of course. That \nalso is an element of conservation.\n  No. 4, and finally, turning to limitless, renewable sources of \nenergy. That makes sense for this country as well.\n  These policies combined will help wean us from the overdependence on \nforeign sources of energy, help us develop additional sources of energy \nat home, and also help us become more efficient and more conservation-\nminded as we use energy.\n  Now, more than ever, we understand this is not just about energy \nsecurity, but that energy security is about national security. That has \nto be part of this debate. Reducing our dependence on foreign oil and \nbetter protecting our energy infrastructure, that is about national \nsecurity.\n  Financial assistance in this bill would help improve critical energy \ninfrastructure security. That is a part of this legislation that is \nvery important.\n  This legislation will increase domestic oil, gas, and coal \nproduction. It will do that in a thoughtful and environmentally \nsensitive way. It will help remove barriers to production on public \nlands in an environmentally sustainable manner, and it will authorize \nthe construction of a natural gas pipeline from Alaska to the lower 48 \nStates, helping to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and, more \nimportantly, helping us move an estimated 32 trillion cubic feet of \nreserves of natural gas that exist in Canada, reserves that are leased \nand that can come into our inventory, when we are able to build the \npipeline. That pipeline authorization is in this legislation.\n\n  This bill will promote research, development, and deployment of \nadvanced clean coal technologies, something very important, including, \nespecially, opportunities for lignite coal, because coal is going to be \na part of our energy future. Lignite coal is a significant part of that \nopportunity as well.\n  One of the questions for us when we finish this debate will be: are \nwe going to see the future through a rearview mirror? Is our energy \npolicy a policy of yesterday forever? We have some who will come to the \nfloor who will say: I have a new idea. Let's just drill and dig for \nmore oil and coal.\n\n[[Page S1516]]\n\n  What I say is: we support that. We need increased production. But if \nour strategy for tomorrow's energy supply is simply drilling and \ndigging, that is a strategy of yesterday forever.\n  We had someone from the Energy Department testify before the Energy \nCommittee. I asked them a simple question that we similarly ask about a \nlot of programs. On Social Security, we ask the question: What will be \nthe stability and the financial circumstance of Social Security in 25 \nor 50 years? Can you tell us what is going to happen 50 years from now?\n  So we do charts and graphs and create the financial mechanisms to \nevaluate whether we will be on safe ground in 50 years with respect to \nSocial Security.\n  I asked the Energy Department officials: What is your plan for 35 and \n50 years from now with respect to energy? What kind of energy will we \nbe using? What will be the energy mix? How much will we be using?\n  The answer was: We don't have a plan.\n  The reason I asked the question was, I was trying to determine, are \nwe going to wean ourselves from this overly dependent need for foreign \nsources of oil? Are we going to move toward technologies that will \nchange our use of energy, our need for certain kinds of energy? Have we \ndecided as a country, for example, if we want to change to a goal of \ndeciding that in 50 years we want fuel cell cars driving on the streets \nof the Nation's Capital and all across the country using oxygen and \nhydrogen and throwing water vapor out the back end? That sounds like a \npretty good deal to me.\n  The Energy Department's answer was: We don't have a plan. We will get \nback to you.\n  My response was: We need a plan. America needs to decide its energy \nfuture, what it intends to do to with respect to energy supplies in the \nlong term.\n  If we do what some of my colleagues counsel at this point, we will be \nback here 25 years from now, and we will have exactly the same debate. \nPeople will wear the same color shoes and shirts and suits, and they \nwill stand up and use the same tired, worn arguments.\n  The solution 25 years from now? Dig more and drill more. This debate \ndoesn't change. Only the calendar changes. The people change. You could \nhave read this debate 25 years ago. You will be able to read it 25 \nyears from now, unless we decide we are going to do some things \ndifferently.\n  My first car was a model T Ford that I restored as a young boy. It \nwas a 1924 Model T Ford that I bought for $25. It was in an old granary \nand had not been driven for decades. The rats had eaten off the seat \ncovers and all the wiring. It was a tin shell with an engine that \ndidn't work and tires eaten off and rotted off. My father owned a \nservice station, so I pulled it in and put it up on a hoist. I worked \non it for nearly 2 years. I restored that 1924 model T Ford. It was a \ngreat thing to do as a high school boy.\n  Then I got interested in girls and decided a 1924 car was not the \nthing, and so I sold it--much to my regret. I have regretted that sale \never since. I got myself a new two-door car for a couple of hundred \ndollars.\n  My point about the Model T Ford is that you put gasoline in that 1924 \ncar exactly the same way you put gasoline in a 2002 car. Everything \nelse in our lives has changed. Everything has changed around us, except \nyou drove a 1924 Ford up to the gas pump the same way you drive a 2002 \nFord up to the gas pump. You take the cap off, you stick the hose in, \nand you start pumping. Seventy-seven years later, nothing has changed. \nShould it? Will it? The answer is, yes, if we decide as a matter of \npublic policy that we want to put in place energy policies that will \nadvance a different kind of energy future in this country.\n\n  Now, let me talk a bit about some features of this bill that I think \nare very important. This bill contains a series of goals that I think \nalmost everybody would or should agree with: To ensure adequate and \naffordable supplies of energy from renewable sources, as well as oil, \ngas, coal and nuclear; improve the efficiency and productivity of \nenergy use, including energy reliability and productivity of \nelectricity; and to improve energy use in industry vehicles, \nappliances, and buildings.\n  I am particularly interested in renewable energy. Last week, I \nbrought up on the floor of the Senate the 5-year extension of the wind \nenergy production tax credit. That tax credit expired at the end of \nlast year. The result of Congress allowing that to expire means \nprojects are put on the shelf that are ready and funded. They are put \non the shelf. There is a company that has a 150-megawatt project for \nNorth Dakota. They have the money for it--$150 million. The project is \nready to be launched. However, the company shelved the project until \nCongress passes the extension of the wind energy production tax credit. \nThat makes no sense. But taking energy from the wind with highly-\nefficient, new wind turbines and producing electricity, and putting it \non lines and moving it across the country makes great sense to me.\n  On transmission issues, we have new technologies, such as the \ncomposite conductor technology, which can double or triple the \nefficiency of existing transmission lines. Putting up a wind turbine, \nproducing electricity from this turbine, and transmitting that \nelectricity makes great sense. I come from a State that is No. 1 in \nwind. The U.S. Department of Energy says North Dakota is the ``Saudi \nArabia of wind.'' The potential to develop wind energy from my State is \nexceeded by no other State. We are last in trees. North Dakota ranks \n50th in native forest lands. But it ranks first in wind.\n  So, we want to put up some wind towers in North Dakota and be able to \nmove some of this energy around the country. Renewable, limitless \nsources of energy--that makes good sense to me.\n  What we have now is all of these projects that are stalled, because \nCongress has not done its job. This bill contains a five-year extension \nof the wind energy production tax credit. And while I support it in \nthis bill, I would like to get it done apart from this bill because, as \nwe know, when we complete the bill in the Senate, we will be in \nconference with the House. This will take months.\n  My colleague from Wyoming, the other day, said--after I gave this \npresentation on extending the wind energy production tax credit--he \nsaid, yes, but we are taking that up as part of the energy bill. That \nis of little solace to me. It will be months and months before this \nenergy bill is completed. Meanwhile, projects in many States will \nlanguish on the shelf when, instead, those projects should be helping \nto create jobs and energy.\n  With respect to electricity, I have just described the reliability of \nthe transmission grid and the opportunity in this legislation to help \nfacilitate access to and reduce constraints of the grid. This bill will \nhelp create a more seamless and national grid, and it will help States \nlike North Dakota use its vast resources, such as coal and wind, to be \nable to move electricity around the country.\n  We also are going to repeal PUHCA and PURPA in the context of this \ncomprehensive energy bill, while we will still retain sufficient \nconsumer protections and safeguards, which are included in this \nlegislation as well.\n  And, this bill is going to facilitate energy production and \ntransmission on tribal lands.\n  It also includes measures to research and deploy transmission \ntechnologies--which I am very high on--including composite conductor \nwire that can dramatically increase the efficiency of existing wires to \nimprove the efficiencies of existing lines and alleviate transmission \nbottlenecks.\n  We are going to hear a lot about the energy efficiency of appliances, \nsuch as residential air conditioners. We put into this bill what is \ncalled a SEER 13 standard with respect to air conditioners. This bill \ncontains a number of provisions designed to save energy in buildings \nand save energy with more efficient appliances. The SEER 13 air \nconditioner standard would save an amount of energy equivalent to that \nproduced by nearly 70 power plants. This standard also would save $3.6 \nbillion in electric bills for consumers over a 12 SEER standard.\n  The Energy Department received more comments on this standard than on \nany other rulemaking in the agency's history. The vast majority were in \nsupport of this 13 SEER standard, and that is why we have put this \nstandard\n\n[[Page S1517]]\n\nin the bill. This bill contains Federal building performance standards, \ntoo. It requires the Government to purchase energy-efficient products, \namong other provisions, because the Federal Government is the single \nlargest user of energy in the United States.\n  I want to talk for a moment about transportation, which is the sector \nin which we consume the most amount of energy in this country. If you \nlook at the demand for energy, you see that the transportation sector \nis where the largest demand occurs and where that demand is increasing.\n  My colleague, Senator Bingaman, has used this chart on a good many \noccasions. There will be a debate in the Senate on the issue of CAFE \nstandards. I come from a State that uses pickup trucks, SUVs, and four-\nwheel-drive vehicles extensively. It is not a convenience for someone \nin a northern State, which experiences rough weather, to need a four-\nwheel drive. These vehicles also are not a convenience for people that \nare out there operating a ranch, a farm, or living in a small town and \nare 50 miles from a hospital. It is not unusual for these people to \nwant to drive a vehicle with some weight, a vehicle with four-wheel \ndrive. I don't think any of them want someone to tell them they can't \ndo that.\n  We can't address energy without addressing efficiency and without \naddressing the opportunity to make this transportation sector more \nefficient. So, some say, let's go to the old CAFE standard. I happen to \nprefer a pull rather than a push. Some say, let's push to 37 miles per \ngallon or whatever number that is being used today. I think we ought to \nsay to consumers that we are going to empower them when they buy their \nvehicles. We are going to give them a very substantial tax credit to \npurchase more efficient vehicles--a per car credit of $4,000 or $5,000 \ndepending on the value of the car.\n  So, a consumer would be able to go to a car dealership, knowing that \nsuch a credit would only exist if he or she were to buy a car that \nmeets certain efficiency standards. If one manufacturer is not making \nthat type of car, then the person would be able to go to another \nmanufacturer.\n  I want to ``pull'' manufacturers to be making the kind of products \nthat consumers would want to buy, given certain tax credits. But I \ndon't want people, because of where they live, or because of their \nneeds, to be penalized, if they drive a four-wheel-drive pickup truck \nor SUV. We are going to debate that. So, I will have more to say about \nthat in the future.\n\n  We have a difference of opinion on whether we should provide a \nlegislative push or pull. I believe that our future with respect to \nvehicles is to be able to expect that we will see the manufacture of \nmore hybrid vehicles and hydrogen-powered fuel cell cars. I drove a \ndemonstration car on the Capitol grounds, which was running on oxygen \nand hydrogen, and it was emitting water vapor out the back end of the \ncar. That is the future. But we won't get to that future unless as a \nmatter of public policy we pull very hard in that direction. Otherwise, \nwe will be consigned to yesterday forever. We will keep doing what we \nhave done forever. The past is our future. That is not what I want for \nan energy policy.\n  If that is going to be the end of this debate, we should not have it. \nIf this is going to be the same debate we had 25 years ago--the names \nhave changed on the floor of the Senate--but if this is our debate, \nthen it is a thoughtless debate. This country needs to understand it \nhas a world class economy, the strongest economy in the world. It uses \na substantial amount of energy. That use continues to increase.\n  We are overly dependent on foreign sources for that energy, \nespecially from areas of the world that are inherently unstable, and we \nwould do well to remember that--especially now more than ever.\n  There are some who say, well, that is all really interesting. You \nfolks who talk about renewable and limitless sources of energy, that is \nreally great because, they will say, look at this chart. Look at the \nrenewables used in the United States, compared to other countries. We \nare not doing much.\n  It is a very small part of our energy supply. They will say, you are \nfocusing on the mouse in the corner rather than the lion at the door.\n  The fact is, this country has the opportunity right now to describe \nan energy policy that really does turn the corner and move us in a very \nnew direction. If we are moving in the right direction at the end of \nthis debate, then we will have probably passed the kind of bill that \nwas brought to the floor of the Senate and perhaps even have improved \nupon that. Then we will especially be able to say: We are doing \nsomething different.\n  Think about this. I just described that, in over 75 years, nothing \nhas changed with respect to the way we put a gas hose in a 1924 Model T \nFord versus a 2002 Ford Explorer--nothing. Think of this country. We \nhave, as people, written, split the atom, spliced genes, cloned \nanimals, and invented radar, the silicon chip, and plastics. We have \nbuilt airplanes and learned how to fly them. We have built rockets and \nflown to the Moon. We have cured polio and smallpox, and invented the \ntelephone, television, computer and the Internet. And now we are \nhearing from some that perhaps, as a new energy policy, we must just \nadopt the same old energy policy and put it in place for the next 25 \nyears. That is the legacy we want for our country? I do not think so. \nOur country will go much further, if we summon our manufacturers, \nscientists, and geniuses to work on this problem in the context of \nnational security needs.\n  I indicated at the outset that this might not be the best time to \ndebate energy policy, because gasoline only cost $1.08 a gallon this \nmorning. When gas is $1.08 a gallon, there is not a lot of urgency for \nchange. A year and a half ago, we experienced some rolling brownouts \nand blackouts, and price spikes in California. We had a lot of \nproblems. There were a lot of reasons for those problems.\n  At the moment, though, there does not seem to be a sense of national \nurgency. When gas is $1.08 a gallon, there is just not that kind of \nurgency. As I said, I was thinking of this old country western song: \n``When gas was 30 cents a gallon, love was 60 cents away.'' When I was \npumping gas at my father's service station many years ago, it was 30 \ncents a gallon. In constant dollars, gasoline costs about the same now. \nIn fact, it is slightly cheaper now.\n  We must, it seems to me, take the product that Senator Daschle and \nSenator Bingaman have brought before the Senate, and work on this with \nan eye toward dramatically improving this country's energy future.\n  This Earth, according to scientists, was formed somewhere around 4.5 \nbillion years ago. Some say that in the first nearly 4.499 billion \nyears nothing happened, but that in the last million years, man \ninvented use for his arms, legs, and his cave and, in the last 10,000 \nyears, he invented language, tools, the wheel, fire, primitive warfare, \nand agriculture. Five thousand years later, he invented recorded \nhistory and chariots. In the past 500 years printing occurred, the \nsteam engine was invented, and the industrial revolution occurred. But \nnearly everything else has been invented in a very short period of time \nthe last 100 years or so. Yet, we tend to think that our existence on \nEarth is the only existence; that this Earth was placed here for our \nconvenience.\n  If we take the long view of energy policy, we will understand that \nthis is not the case. The long view of energy policy says: Let's change \nwhat we are doing. Yes, let's produce more; but, let's also disconnect \nin the long term and pay more attention to opportunities for limitless \nand renewable sources of energy. Let's have real conservation, real \nefficiency, and let's, as a nation, understand that energy security is \npart of our national security.\n\n  I thank Senator Bingaman. Serving on the Energy Committee has been a \nsource of pleasure for me. These are very interesting and important \nnational issues. Senator Bingaman, Senator Murkowski, and many on the \nCommittee have exhibited great passion about these issues. I chided \nSenator Murkowski for the number of charts he used today. It simply \nshows the depth of his passion, and I respect that.\n  Senator Bingaman has, with quiet, effective leadership for a long \nperiod of time, worked to bring before the Senate a bill of which we \ncan be proud. I say to him how much I appreciate his work.\n\n[[Page S1518]]\n\n  The Energy Committee has been, from time to time, a divided \ncommittee. At other times, we have worked closely together. The men and \nwomen who serve on the Energy Committee are good thinkers. They come \nfrom different parts of the country and combine to bring to the center \na good, interesting, and aggressive debate about these issues.\n  As I indicated, I have great respect for those with whom I may \ndisagree. But there is no more important policy we will debate this \nyear that will have ramifications for decades and decades into the \nfuture than this energy bill. I am pleased we can finish our opening \nstatements and go to amendments. I believe we will start on amendments \ntomorrow.\n  I thank the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Alaska for \ntheir earlier statements. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico. I believe under a \nprevious order the Senator from New Mexico is scheduled to address the \nSenate.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Madam President, are there other Senators waiting to be \nheard? I will not be long; maybe 7 to 10 minutes. I thank the Chair for \nrecognizing me.\n  Madam President, I am pleased we are finally beginning to debate a \nvery serious subject and that we have put together a bill that is \nbefore us that perhaps after a couple of weeks of work will be known as \nthe Senate's comprehensive energy policy for our Nation.\n  As President Bush has repeatedly said, this issue is a vital \ncomponent of our homeland defense and our national security. Our \neconomic and our environmental future is directly tied to our ability \nto produce ample supplies of clean, reliable energy. There can be no \ndoubt that this great Nation, which has achieved the most significant \nheights in terms of material wealth and material well-being, has done \nthat because we have been able, principally with our American private \nsector and competition, to supply the kinds of energy that are needed \nfor this enormous growth that affects each and every family as they go \nabout their daily lives, as they live in their homes which have heat, \nwhich have cool air in the summer, which have kitchens with all kinds \nof appliances to get done what they want for their families and enjoy \nlife.\n  In a very real sense, America's future is tied to whether or not we \nare smart enough to do the right things or, in some instances, to do \nnothing so that we can continue to have this supply of energy that we \nneed for our future.\n  Everyone knows that without an adequate supply of energy, our modern \nstandard of living would plummet. Long-term recession and major job \nlosses would be the norm. In fact, America would not be the America it \nis today in a decade or two if, for some reason, we did not have \nadequate energy supplies.\n  We saw the impact sometime back from oil shocks and their devastation \nto our economy, but remember that the shock in the 1970s occurred when \nwe were little more than one-third dependent upon foreign nations for \nour oil. Yet we had an enormous shock. Now we are nearly 60 percent \ndependent on oil.\n  This underscores the importance, in this Senator's opinion, of moving \nforward with an energy plan that the President will be a partner in and \nthat the President can sign, and with his intervention from time to \ntime that we can altogether say we have produced an energy plan, \nbipartisan in nature, under the leadership of our President.\n  The policy that we have must set forth the principles, should be the \nguideline, for our debate on a comprehensive energy policy. That is the \npolicy the President put before us.\n  Specifically, that policy noted that through conservation, more \nproduction, and renewed infrastructure for distribution, the country \ncan overcome short-term energy shortages. In addition, we can build a \nnew approach to energy that will continue to increase the quality of \nlife in the United States and place us in the leadership role in \nimproving the quality of life around the world.\n  Conservation and efficiency clearly must be part of this \ncomprehensive energy bill. I appreciate the emphasis the President has \nput in his policy proposals on these aspects of energy policy in the \nUnited States, and I compliment Senator Bingaman. While I do not agree \nwith everything in the bill with reference to conservation, with \nreference to saving of energy, the bill has some very good ideas in it \nand I hope some of them will still be in the bill when we finish our 10 \ndays to 2-week debate.\n  Conservation has been absolutely vital to the United States over the \npast decades in controlling our thirst for energy. A lot of people do \nnot know we have done some very significant things in the area of \nconservation--at least the numbers show that--so let me talk about \nthose.\n  Since 1973, our economy has expanded 126 percent while our energy \nincrease has been only 30 percent. That shows, in my opinion, we have \ntaken conservation seriously and we have already done something about \nit. That does not mean we have solved all the problems in conservation, \nthat we have opened all the windows that can be opened to conservation, \nbut clearly we know how to do it.\n  I also appreciate the emphasis in the President's policy on \nenvironmental protection, and that obviously finds itself in this bill \nalso.\n  I think we should remind ourselves and fellow Americans that we have \naccomplished a lot. For example, again, since 1970 our emission of air \npollutants has decreased by 31 percent while our gross domestic product \ngrew by 147 percent and the amount of vehicle miles driven has \nincreased by 140 percent. When one looks at those kinds of numbers, \nthey know the United States has done a reasonably good job to date. \nEven though there are many who are critical, it is obvious to this \nSenator that if we can do again in the next decade or two what we have \ndone in the past decade or two with reference to these two areas, we \nwill indeed have a very good energy policy and a policy that will carry \nus through in good stead.\n  Of course, there is more to environmental protections than just the \nquality of air, which I have mentioned in terms of where we were and \nwhat happened to our clean air. The policy the President proposes \ncarefully notes that modern energy exploration and extraction \ntechnology can be done with minimal environmental impact. I hope those \nwho will listen to the debate and ultimately participate by virtue of \nwhat they think their Senator should do and letting them know about \nit--I hope everybody knows that modern energy exploration and \nextraction technology can be done with minimal environmental impact.\n  I am proud some of these advanced techniques have been pioneered in \nthe State of New Mexico and are now ready to help in the exploration of \nANWR, if that be the will of the Congress and of the President.\n  Returning to our immediate task at hand, I am not at all pleased with \nthe way this bill got to the Senate, but I will not repeat what has \nbeen repeatedly said by the Senator from Alaska. I think the issue that \ndivides us, ANWR, should have been voted on in committee. I think the \nbill should have come with ANWR in or out, with the Senate having \ndebated it in committee and having voted. I believe if that would have \nbeen the case, ANWR would be in the bill.\n  Now, which ANWR? Not the ANWR we talked about a couple of years ago. \nThe ANWR that is spoken of in the House bill, where a very small area, \n2,000 acres, will be used to determine whether or not there is \nsufficient oil to proceed. With the new technologies from that small \nlocation, we will be able to determine tremendous information with \nreference to what surrounds it and where, and we can determine as a \nnation and as a people if we should proceed.\n\n  I believe we should have produced a bill that had all of the major \nissues that are now in this bill discussed and debated in the \ncommittee. On the other hand, I believe Senator Bingaman, who comes \nwith the first major bill I think he has managed--I would ask the \nSenator, is that correct?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Yes.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. He will probably be here for 2 or 3 weeks managing this \nbill. I believe those who know what happened will understand the \nSenator did put in a lot of ideas and a lot of proposals that came from \nour side of the aisle. To mention one, there are a\n\n[[Page S1519]]\n\nlot of proposals in this that are now reduced to statute form that have \nto do with nuclear energy for the future. They were in a bill that I \nintroduced, along with the Senator from Louisiana who is sitting in the \nchair, and some of those were taken--in fact, most of them--and are in \nthis bill that Senator Bingaman has brought.\n  I hope we will take all of the difficult issues that confront us and \nnot dillydally, but get them debated and voted on. ANWR is among those. \nSo is the CAFE standard. Let us get on with it. Let us proceed. Then \nthe entire provision on electricity--there is a very elaborate \nprovision that was put in by the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, \nMr. Bingaman, and we will have to decide whether that is what we want, \nbut at least the issue will be joined on another very important part of \nthis bill. So I hope we will proceed on some areas.\n  It is pretty hard to make the Senate proceed with dispatch when \nSenators know they have an infinite amount of time on a bill. It will \nbe hard to get them to bring amendments, but there will be plenty of \nthem soon, and I look for myself to be participating, particularly on \nthe nuclear part of this bill, during which time I will share a lot \nmore with the Senate and those interested about why we should proceed \nwith nuclear energy, at least its availability, as part of the mix in \nthe United States for our future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. BREAUX. Madam President, I thank the Chair for presiding in such \nan effective fashion.\n  I will take a minute in the general debate time to talk about the \nenergy bill that is before the Senate.\n  No. 1, let me say I think we desperately need an energy bill. It sort \nof goes without saying, if there is anything both sides could probably \nagree with in what is otherwise likely to be a relatively contentious \ndebate, certainly we can all agree on the fact we need an energy bill \nin this country.\n  The reasons are quite obvious. The United States prides itself in \nbeing a very strong and powerful nation, probably the most powerful \nnation on the face of the Earth, and perhaps the most powerful and \nstrongest nation in the history of the world. When it comes to being \nself-sufficient in most aspects important to America, we are there. \nWhen it comes to the food we eat, Americans produce more than we can \neat. In fact, we supply the food for a large number of countries around \nthe world. We do very well. When it comes to medicine, America is the \nenvy of the world. Pharmaceutical companies are the best. Medical \ntechnology and science is the best in this country. People come to \nAmerica when they need very sophisticated, quality health care if they \ncan find a way to get to our country.\n  So in most all of what we do, including education, we are indeed No. \n1 in the world, except when it comes to energy. The facts are the \nopposite when it comes to energy. We are dependent on other countries \nto help run America, whether it is running automobiles on the highways, \nor the tractors in the fields, or launching a space vehicle with \nanother satellite, or running a naval vessel, or running a tank, or \nsupplying the men and women fighting in Afghanistan.\n  So much of the energy we use as a nation does not come from our \ncountry. It comes from foreign nations. I have seen the number as high \nas 58 percent of the energy we use in this country comes from foreign \nsources. Not only does it come from foreign sources, unfortunately it \ncomes from countries on which we really cannot depend.\n  Our energy does not come from Canada. It does not come from people \nwho have been allied with the United States in most difficult battles. \nMuch of the energy supply comes from countries that themselves are not \nparticularly the most stable countries in the world, which means the \noil we get from them is not as dependable as it should be. Not only is \nit coming from countries in a part of the world that is one of the most \ndangerous, with the potential for those supplies being interrupted at a \nmoment's notice because of some additional conflict in the Middle East, \nit comes from those countries through a process that, if it were \nengaged in in this country, people would go to the penitentiary.\n\n  What I mean by that is quite simple. The Organization of Petroleum \nExporting Countries, OPEC, which supplies much of the energy and the \noil we use to run America on a regular basis, has meetings at very nice \nplaces around the world. They bring in all of their oil ministers, they \nsit around the table, and guess what they do. They fix prices. They \ndetermine how much energy is going to cost America by sitting around \nthe table and deciding how much they will produce. If they think the \nprice is too low, they cut back their production, they raise the price \nand sell it to the United States and other countries around the world.\n  Between 55 and 60 percent of our oil comes from parts of the world \nthat fix prices. If business men and women did that in this country, \nthey could go to the penitentiary because it is illegal to fix prices. \nFor years we have been comfortable with getting our energy from an \norganization that, if they operated in America, would go to jail.\n  It is, therefore, abundantly clear we need an energy policy that \nallows us to approach self-sufficiency.\n  I daresay if we imported half the food we ate in this country, people \nwould be marching on the streets in our Nation's Capital saying that is \nunacceptable because food is critically important to this country's \nsurvival. That is, of course, true. But equally true is that critical \nto our Nation's survival and stability is the energy that we use. The \nenergy that we use to engage in commerce is also critical to the \nsecurity and the long-range future of the strongest Nation on Earth.\n  We can do no less than come up with an energy bill that addresses \nthis most serious of problems. For the most part, I think that the \nenergy bill before the committee is a movement in that direction. It \ncan be improved. I hope, through the amendment process, it will be \napproved. We have to have a balanced energy package. We cannot be \nputting all of our eggs in one basket.\n  I remember in the not too distant past when we talked about trying to \ncontrol the supply of drugs in this country. The popular phrase at that \ntime was ``just say no.'' It sounded good, but it only addressed half \nof the equation. It addressed the half of the equation of the demand \nside. If we do not have a demand for drugs, we will solve the drug \nproblem. It never really worked because we did not pay enough attention \nto the supply side. We did not do enough to try to stop the flow of \ndrugs illegally into this country. The answer, obviously, was we had to \ndo both. We had to control the demand in this country and we had to \ncontrol the illegal supply to this country.\n\n  The same thing is true with regard to energy. We cannot just save our \nway out. We cannot just rely only on alternative fuels. I have voted \nfor over $6 billion of assistance for alternative forms of energy. I \nbelieve in it. I think we have to have renewable energy. We have to \nhave alternative kinds of energy. I hope we can develop wind as a \nsource of energy, as well as solar power. We need to also look at the \nalternative of hydrogen cell fuel utilization. We have to look at waste \nmaterial, whether it is chicken waste, swine waste, or whatever have \nyou.\n  I guarantee you that in the foreseeable future we are not going to \nrun the planes of this country and the tractors on the farms with \nchicken waste; it is not enough.\n  We also have to develop our traditional oil and gas resources. I have \nheard some of our colleagues and I have heard some of the environmental \ngroups say we cannot drill our way out of this problem, as if we were \ndrilling everywhere. Just the opposite is true. The chart I have shows \nthe light orange areas where we can not drill. The entire east coast of \nthe United States of America, either through congressional actions or \nmoratoriums by Presidents, both Democrat and Republican Presidents, has \nsaid we are not going to look for oil and gas from the State of Maine \ndown to the State of Florida. It is not quite ``drilling our way out of \nit.'' On the other side of the country, from the Canadian border and \nthe State of Washington down to the country of Mexico, and all of the \nareas between, through moratoriums or acts of Congress, they have said: \nDon't do it here either.\n  All of this area is a potential source of oil and gas but because of \nthe opposition of the locals along the west\n\n[[Page S1520]]\n\ncoast of the United States, we are not looking, we are not searching, \nand we are not producing energy, much of which is consumed in their \nrespective States.\n  The west coast of the United States is off limits, the east coast of \nthe United States is off limits, and the eastern part of the Gulf of \nMexico, where everybody seems to want to send the offshore production, \noff Louisiana or Texas, we will not worry; it is also off limits, as \nwell.\n  This Congress just engaged in a very bitter battle over a proposal by \nPresident Clinton to lease sale 181 in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. \nPresident Clinton made a compromise in the sale by reducing the area. \nThis administration reduced it by two thirds further, and we had a \nknock-down, drag-out battle on the floor of the Senate to eliminate it \ncompletely.\n  All of these areas are restricted: Don't do it here; not in my \nbackyard; do it somewhere else. And we continue to import over 58 \npercent of our country.\n  We need an energy policy. It should be balanced. And balanced does \nnot mean just wind, solar, and hydrogen cell use; it means a \ncombination. There will be efforts by the Senator from Alaska to \naddress some areas of interest in his State. I remember quite well back \nin 1980 when we were engaged in debate on the Alaskan lands bill--1978, \n1980. I was a Member of the House of Representatives, chairman of the \nsubcommittee that handled the Alaskan lands bill over in the House. We \nproduced a bill which said we were going to set aside a very large area \nin the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and we were not going to allow \nany exploration in that Arctic National Wildlife Refuge except for one \nparticular area which was designated as section 1002 of that particular \npart of the Arctic wildlife refuge. We said the Arctic wildlife refuge \nwould have about 19 million acres in it. We were not going to do \nproduction in those 19 million acres, but we were going to reserve 1.5 \nmillion acres in section 1002 of the bill.\n\n  I was there when we wrote it. It was our intent to say at that time, \nthat one section of the 19 million acres we will look at and ask USGS \nto do seismic work and come back to the Congress and recommend whether \nwe should proceed in that area or not. It is interesting. The New York \nTimes and Washington Post are totally opposed to what the Senator from \nAlaska is attempting to do now. But do you know what they were saying \nwhen we did this back in the 1980s? The New York Times said:\n\n       Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge . . . the most \n     promising untapped source of oil in North America.\n       . . . the total acreage affected by development would \n     represent only a fraction of 1 percent of the North Slope \n     wilderness.\n       . . . But it is hard to see why absolutely pristine \n     preservation of this remote wilderness should take precedence \n     over the nation's energy needs.\n\n  That was in the New York Times in 1987 and 1988.\n  The Washington Post had an equally strong comment about what we were \ndoing back in 1987 when we set up this process. They said:\n\n       But that part of the Arctic coast--\n\n  Meaning the coastal plains--\n\n     is one of the bleakest, most remote places on this continent, \n     and there is hardly any other place where drilling would have \n     less impact on the surrounding life. . . .\n       That oil could help ease the country's transition to lower \n     oil supplies and . . . reduce its dependence on uncertain \n     imports. Congress would be right to go ahead and, with all \n     the conditions and environmental precautions that apply to \n     Prudhoe Bay, see what is under the refuge's tundra.\n\n  That was in 1987. We are more dependent on foreign oil today than \nwhen they wrote those comments and remarks back in 1987. They were \nright then. They would be even more right if they said the same thing \ntoday. But all of a sudden, this area has become something that no one \ncan even touch.\n  I understand when people say, ``Not in my backyard.'' I don't agree \nwith it because it is a national program, not just for one State. But \nif you live in the neighborhood, you ought to be listened to more than \nif you don't live in the neighborhood where the activity is going to \noccur.\n  We are talking about activity in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, \nthe small sliver up there of 2,000 acres. The Governor of the State, \nwho is a Democrat, supports this activity, the two Senators who \nrepresent the State support the activity, and the Member of Congress in \nthe House of Representatives who represents that area supports that \nactivity. I would add the Native Alaskans who live in the area also \nsupport the activity.\n  So if you want to look to the people who are there and who are duly \nelected to represent the people, they enthusiastically support the \namendment to be offered by the Senator from Alaska.\n  Maybe there is an environmental group sitting in a fancy office in \nSan Francisco that thinks: If we take this position, by golly, do you \nknow how many more members we can get? This will be our cause celebre \nfor the next 5 years. They love the issue, but I think their position \nis not correct.\n  We just can't do it all in Louisiana. We are going to do our part. We \nare going to do more than our part. We will continue to do so. This has \nto be something that all of us participate in as a nation. We have to \nhave more savings. We have to have more alternative sources of fuel. We \nhave to have more exotic ways of finding energy through wind and solar \npower.\n  But we also have to do what is necessary for a number of years to \ncome in balancing that with traditional oil and gas supplies. You \ncannot say ``not here, not there, and not there,'' and solve the \nproblem.\n  For those who say there is not that much up there, No. 1, no one \nknows how much is up there until we take a look, but the estimates we \nhave from the USGS and the industry say there is a sufficient amount of \nsupply up there to reduce our dependence and eliminate all our imports \nfrom Saudi Arabia for the next 30 years. They are the largest exporter \nof oil to the United States. We can eliminate their imports to this \ncountry for the next 30 years as a result of that activity. That, I \nsuggest, is a very important part of our Nation's energy solution.\n  I hope we will have more time to debate this issue. I look forward \nenthusiastically to doing it. I think the Senator from the State where \nthis would be involved has done an outstanding job of presenting this \nissue to this body, and I hope we listen to his recommendations.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I wonder if the Senator from \nLouisiana would comment briefly on the advancement of offshore drilling \noff the State of Louisiana and the Gulf of Mexico. I understand they \nare drilling in several thousand feet of water, and actually Federal \nleases are being sold in excess of that? That technology in deep water \nhas risks, obviously, but the industry has an extraordinary record of \nsuccess.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I thank the Senator for the question. I will be brief. I \nknow my colleague is waiting to speak.\n  We have been doing offshore production in Louisiana in some of the \nmost fragile areas for over 60 years. I would argue with anyone that \nthis environment and this ecosystem down here is far more fragile than \nthe ecosystem in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on the Coastal \nPlain. They have tundra grass that grows during the winter a couple of \ninches high.\n  We have, down here, an abundant supply of fin fish, of shrimp, of \nfur-bearing animals; it is a very fragile coastal wetland environment \nthat is incredibly productive. Every single wildlife refuge in \nLouisiana has oil and gas production on it.\n  We have learned. We have learned by mistakes. We have benefited from \nscience. Now the activity and the way it is conducted is the state-of-\nthe-art technology. To say we have not learned a sufficient amount of \ninformation to be able to apply that to an ecosystem that is not nearly \nas complicated, not nearly as fragile, with much smaller numbers of \nwildlife in existence, as in this area, I think is to ignore the last \n60 years of balanced development that we have experienced.\n  I think we ought to learn from those mistakes as well as learn from \nour positive accomplishment, and apply it in the area of the State of \nthe Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I wonder if the Senator will yield for another \nquestion. I notice there are some charts behind the Senator from \nLouisiana relative to what is going on in refuges. I think\n\n[[Page S1521]]\n\nthere is a presumption among some that refuges are off limits to oil \nand gas, other exploration. My understanding is that chart shows the \nnumber of activities in various wetlands.\n  Mr. BREAUX. The wildlife refuge law was specifically set up by \nCongress to protect an area that had specific significance. But other \nactivities that were compatible were to be allowed. You have to look at \neach wildlife refuge and determine whether that activity is compatible.\n  Is farming, grazing, or oil and gas development compatible with the \npurposes of the refuge? In my State of Louisiana, 12 wildlife refuges--\nFederal wildlife refuges and State wildlife refuges--have oil and gas \nproduction, in a much more fragile environment than is on the Coastal \nPlain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. In addition, all these \nother States have had the same activity in their wildlife refuges and \nit has been determined that it has been compatible.\n  Do you take special precautions? Absolutely. But the point is, it is \nnot a blanket prohibition. What is being asked today is a blanket \nprohibition, which I think is not justifiable, particularly when we \nhave as strong a need as we do.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I believe the other chart shows all the specific areas \nand refuges that are identified by State. It looks like Texas, \nOklahoma--a number of States.\n  Mr. BREAUX. I think also these are national wildlife refuges. There \nare a number of State wildlife refuges that States have set aside that \nalso have production on them as well.\n  Congress set this up, as the Senator well knows--I helped write \nsection 1002 over in the other body--as an area that was going to be \nlooked to for potential exploration. The remaining 19 million acres in \nthe rest of the wildlife refuges in ANWR was going to be set aside for \nno activity. But Congress specifically made a decision: Look, we are \ngoing to reserve section 1002 for potential exploration and production. \nThat is exactly what the Washington Post and the New York Times were \ncommending Congress for at that time.\n  When President Jimmy Carter signed this bill, they knew that section \nhad been set aside for the purposes of looking at potential oil and gas \nexploration. Now, all of a sudden, we come back and say: No, we just \ncan't touch it. I think that is not being fair or balanced.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I thank my friend from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAIG. Madam President, let me first and foremost associate \nmyself with the words of the Senator from Louisiana. I think he has \nmade such a very clear and profound case that with the technologies of \ntoday, with what we now know and what we have learned in the wetlands \nof Louisiana or Texas and on the northern edge of Alaska, without a \ndoubt we can now explore and develop oil reserves with little to no \nenvironmental damage to the surrounding areas; that when those oil \nreserves have been finalized or produced out, we can close out and \nleave, and Mother Nature begins the healing process in a way that \nwithin a reasonable, if not short, period of time our presence there is \nhardly known.\n\n  I guess I would be remiss today if I didn't say I have looked forward \nto this time in the Senate for a long while. I had hoped that years ago \nwe could have debated and developed a national energy policy. I am \nquite confident that the chairman of the committee, who is here on the \nfloor, feels the same way as the ranking member. The Energy Committee, \non which I have served for 12 years, has literally held hundreds of \nhearings and maybe thousands of hours in the taking of testimony as to \nthe character of the national energy supply of our country--where it \ncomes from, what it means, how it is used--everything from current \nsupplies of hydrocarbons to electrical production, coal-fired, hydro, \nnuclear, on the thermal side of the electrical production, and \ncertainly oil production.\n  We have done really, I believe, a phenomenally thorough job of \nlooking at the overall perspective of energy for this country, both \nunder Republican leadership and Democrat leadership. I think it would \nbe fair to say that the staff of this committee and Members such as \nourselves have developed a level of knowledge and expertise that is \nreally substantial.\n  I say that in this context: That we are capable and should have been \nallowed to let that committee work, under the chairmanship of Senator \nBingaman, to craft an energy bill to bring to the floor. But because of \nthe unique politics of today and the unique politics of the energy \ndebate that was denied, on October 9 the majority leader of the Senate \ncommunicated to the chairman of the Energy Committee, who is now here \nin the Chamber, that that committee was not to send forth an energy \nbill.\n  We can all speculate as to that conversation, but I think it has been \nrelatively open as to what was said. Certainly the Senator from New \nMexico was quoted roundly in the newspapers. I will not in any way \nattempt to interpret what he said or what he meant. But I know the \nSenator well enough to know that prior to October 9, prior to the \nAugust recess of last year, after we came back in September, and after \nSeptember 11, in the conversations I had with the Senator I believed he \nwas sincere and that it was his intent to produce an energy bill.\n  It has certainly been the intent of the ranking member, the Senator \nfrom Alaska, to do so, and to build a comprehensive bill that this \nSenate could look at, debate, and amend, but most importantly that \nwould be assembled inside the expertise of that Energy Committee with \nboth staff, Democrat and Republicans, and Members working on it, fine-\ntuning through the amendment process, and ultimately coming to do the \nfloor for another bite of the energy apple, if you will, by other \ncolleagues who are not on that committee.\n  We now know that didn't happen. I must tell you I believe it is \nhistoric in the fact that it didn't happen.\n  I have here in my hand the bill that was not written in committee and \nthat was not written through the normal process--some 539 pages. As I \ncame to the floor this morning to get a copy, I was told that portions \nof it were still being written or rewritten because somehow they had \nnot quite gotten it right yet, or someone had made a change, or maybe \nit was believed if they made a little change they might pick up another \nvote or two in a given title of the bill. I don't know the reason.\n  But I do know that on the day when we began a historic debate on \nnational energy policy for this Nation, I had not had a chance to read \nthe bill in detail and it was still being written.\n\n  The 539-page bill we have before us S. 517. I am told it will have \nanother 40 or 50 pages added. OK; 579 pages. The Democrat whip is on \nthe floor. If he allows us to debate this for a couple or 3 weeks, we \nmight get it read, understood, and possibly crafted now in the process \nwhich is legitimately a committee of the whole instead of a committee \nof the authorizing to deal with national energy policy.\n  Am I angered by that? Well, I would like to be. I guess I am more \nfrustrated that in a representative republic and a democratic form of \ngovernment in which we craft expertise and talent in the committees of \nauthorization, it is simply and politically wiped away. The stroke of \nthe hand of the majority leader of the Senate says you shall not \nbecause you cannot do it the way I want it done politically.\n  Before the August recess, if we had crafted a bill and worked on it \nand passed it out of the Energy Committee, it would have had ANWR in \nit. The votes were there. It would have been a bipartisan energy bill. \nThe House acted before the August recess. They narrowed what we now \ncall the footprint in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on which \nexploration can take place to meet the political and maybe the \nappropriate exploration needs for that area. They got their work done. \nWe knew we could. I don't think anybody would dispute the fact that \nDemocrats and Republicans were working to do so. The majority leader \nwas phenomenally fearful that his political will could not be \naddressed.\n  Others on the other side of the aisle I think were quite confident \nthat they would have the political opportunity of a lifetime to \nfilibuster a bill with ANWR in it and to strut their environmental \nstuff.\n  But something happened after September 11. A debate that in the minds\n\n[[Page S1522]]\n\nof many Americans on national energy policy was somewhat esoteric, a \nfuture and generational economic exercise, had all of a sudden been \nrefocused. Our Nation was at war, we had been attacked, and the \nAmerican people asked: Are we so dependent upon a very unstable area of \nthe world that overnight those sheiks could turn down their valves and \nup would go energy prices? Oh, my goodness, what would this country do? \nIt was no longer this esoteric and generational economic debate. It was \na debate over national energy policy in relation to national security \nas a policy. Somehow they came together. As the World Trade Center \nfell, energy policy and national security policy got melded together in \nthe minds of most Americans.\n  For those who wanted to filibuster over here on the floor, I am quite \nsure they scurried over to the majority leader's office and said: Don't \nthrow us in that political briar patch, because we have to honor our \ncommitments, and we will somehow look anti-American if we stand up and \ndeny the right to explore and develop an abundant energy supply for our \ncountry that may somehow make us less dependent upon the sheiks of the \nMiddle East.\n  I do not know if that conversation happened. But I will bet it did.\n  As a result, on October 9 the lights went out in this Nation's Senate \nEnergy Committee. No more were we to authorize a bill.\n  The lights went on in the back office of Tom Daschle because he was \nbeing charged. He charged himself and the chairman of the committee to \nsend forth a bill. We have that bill on the floor at this moment. I \nhaven't read it because I haven't had it. It is still being written. I \ncan't read it. We will work to read it as soon as it is available. I \nunderstand a new copy is under print. This is the first book I have \never known of 539 pages in its second print in popularity and nobody \nhas read it. That is strange. The New York Times Best Sellers List \nought to try that one: You go to second print before the first one is \nread. That is the reality of what we are faced with. We are here now on \nthe floor of the Senate, I would trust, in good will, to bring forth a \nnational energy policy for this country, if we can, in a way that we \ncan take to a conference between the House and the Senate, and then \nplace that bill on the President's desk for him to sign and for this \ncountry and its economy to mobilize around.\n\n  One of first opportunities I had to engage with President George Bush \nwas when he was President-elect George Bush, right after the issue in \nFlorida had been solved. He was here on Capitol Hill to visit with all \nof us. We met in then-Majority Leader Trent Lott's office. He talked \nabout his campaign promises: A promise to bring forth a comprehensive \neducation bill for our country; a promise to reform and cut taxes to \nstimulate our economy and to affect all segments of it in a positive \nand beneficial way. He talked about national security and a variety of \nother issues. But he stopped midway through that conversation. He said: \nDo you know what is really important for our country right now? It is a \nnational energy policy. The lights have gone out in California, we are \nbuying oil from a very unstable region of the world, and gas prices are \nhigh. I believe a national energy policy is critical for this country.\n  That was President George Bush speaking, and I paraphrase.\n  He said: I am going to assign the Vice President that responsibility. \nWe will assemble a governmental task force, and we will craft a policy \nand get it to the Hill as quickly as we can, and see if we can't work \nwith you here in the Senate and in the House to develop an overall \ncomprehensive policy.\n  It was one of this President's priorities, and he acted accordingly. \nIt should have been a priority in the Senate. It was a high priority in \nthe House. But here, months later than it should be, after the \nauthorizing committee had been turned away and its lights turned out, \nwe are now debating a bill that was a priority for the President, that \nwas our Nation's high priority, and a bill that many of us have not yet \nread or understand all of the nuances or policy proclamations within \nit. That is the reality of what we are dealing with.\n  I hope that as we debate this issue, and as we amend it over the \ncourse of the next several weeks, we will deal with natural gas \nexploration and development on public lands across this country, and \nthat we open up Federal lands to do that and put more of our own gas \ninto the pipeline as we talk about bringing gas down from Alaska where \nit is currently being turned under, so that as we move toward other \nforms of electrical generation with gas turbines that meet the clean \nair standards of our country, we will have an abundance of natural gas \nto do that at reasonable prices.\n  I hope this legislation will have that. If it does not, there will be \namendments to assure that the pipeline infrastructure that is necessary \nto deliver that resource to the Nation will be there, be available, or \nthe incentives to do so will be allowed.\n  I hope that when we deal with infrastructure issues, we are able to \ntalk about electrical transmission and RTOs and regional ways of \ntransporting electrons from point A to point B, from New Mexico to \nIdaho, if that is the wish of the generator and the user.\n  As the chairman knows, and as the ranking member knows, some months \nago we had a transmission expert before us. I think his words were \nsomething like this: The electrical transmission lines of this country \ntoday are like a bunch of country roads that every so often meet.\n\n  That was part of the problem in California when we, from Idaho, were \nhelping supply California to keep its lights on. You just simply could \nnot get energy there, or if you got it to California, then it plugged \nup along the way as it headed from north to south or south to north. So \npipelines, transmission lines, infrastructure become an important part \nof all of that issue.\n  For a good number of years I have worked on the issue of hydro \nrelicensing. In the Pacific Northwest, we are very fortunate to have a \ndominant amount of our electrical generation by hydroelectric, or \nwater, dams. We know much of that has to be relicensed over the next \nseveral decades, and that licensing process is broken or cumbersome or \nunpredictable and very costly.\n  While we are trying to incorporate all of the concerns and issues of \nmany different groups in retrofitting and modernizing 40- and 50-year-\nold structures, because the world around them and the wishes of that \nworld have changed dramatically, it should not take 5 to 10 years and \nmillions and millions of dollars and a reduction of capacity or \nproductivity of that unit to get it relicensed.\n  We want to answer and adjust to the environmental concerns. At the \nsame time, it ought to be our desire to make that unit more efficient, \nnot less so, with new turbines and retrofits. Yet we struggle under \nthat relicensing.\n  I have worked very closely with the chairman. We are awfully close to \ngetting something, but I am not going to add more problems to the \ncurrent problem. If we cannot get there, and the answer is to make it \nmore difficult or more complicated, I am simply going to step back and \nsay what we have got is what we are going to have to have.\n  If the country wants to keep on down this track of relicensing under \nphenomenally expensive and cumbersome processes, tragically enough, so \nbe it. I hope, though, we can find a way out of this, to streamline it, \nimprove it, make it more predictable, balanced, and hopefully, less \ncostly.\n  Nuclear energy is 20 percent of our current electrical production in \nthis country. If we believe in climate change, if we believe there is \nan environmental problem out there and somehow the gases that are \nproduced by the energy sources today are helping complicate or \nexacerbate that problem of climate change, then we ought to be for the \ncleanest source of energy possible to fill up that energy basket that \nis now in deficit and growing more empty.\n  I believe one way of doing that is through nuclear energy and \ncreating new prototype reactors that by public perception and reality \nare safer, more productive, less costly to build, and less costly to \noperate. We ought to be about doing that. I think we are going to \nreauthorize the Price-Anderson Act that deals with the liability of the \ndevelopment and the operation of those facilities. That is something we \nought to do.\n  We ought to be encouraging all forms because my guess is a pretty \nsafe one:\n\n[[Page S1523]]\n\n That if we want an increasingly cleaner environment, probably over the \nnext decade or two nuclear energy, as a percentage of the total supply, \nshould not be 20 percent, it ought to be 25 or 30 percent. It most \nassuredly ought not drop below where it is. It ought to advance well \nbeyond where it is.\n  I think most realistic thinkers would recognize the importance of \nenergy as it relates to nuclear and the cleanness of that form of \ngeneration. We ought to apply the greatest technology we have to that.\n  I mentioned, in the context of nuclear energy, climate change. \nSenator Hagel and I have worked for the last 4 or 5 years on that. So \nhas the Senator from New Mexico. So has the Senator from Alaska. Many \nhave become involved in that debate. The two Senators from Oklahoma \nhave been involved in it. Why? Because we do not want a hysterical \npolicy that shuts the world down in panic. We want a policy that would \nallow us to grow and produce and prosper while making our world \ncleaner.\n  The legislation the Senator from Nebraska and I have crafted, that \nnow in part has been accepted by the President as some of his forward \nthinking national climate change policy, ought to be incorporated in \nthis bill, ought to be a full part of it. We are working to get there. \nFrankly, it is possible to get there.\n  In conclusion, I began to debate energy issues well over a decade \nago. I have been involved on energy issues in the Senate for 12 years. \nI am embarrassed to say that during that period of time we have not \nbuilt a comprehensive energy policy. I used to select different forms \nof energy and suggest that this one ought not go forward, but maybe \nthis one should. I must say, I am no longer there, not at all. I \nbelieve we ought to be investing in all forms of energy and all forms \nof conservation.\n  We ought to give the public a choice between green power or other \npower. Let them decide in the marketplace if that is the prudent \nselection for their use. Clearly we ought to have as much power as we \ncan produce, recognizing that by definition, hydrocarbon use is on the \ndecline. I do believe, most sincerely, my grandchildren will be driving \nelectric cars. And they will be highly efficient and very capable of \ntraveling long distances. I also know they will have to have a place to \nplug them in to put storage of electricity in the battery, or the \nhydrogen fuel cell that will be built within the car that will drive \nthe electric motors that propel the car. That in itself is a \nhydrocarbon.\n  The cycle is not yet complete because we have not used all of our \nresources to produce those kinds of energies. Yes, I voted for a lot of \nmoney in the last decade for new technology. I will vote for more. I \nwill vote for tax credits and incentives for wind and ethanol and \nbiomass because our energy basket ought to be full and running over \ninstead of sitting here and nit-picking and playing the political game \nof a little of this but not this; we can't do this, but we ought to do \nthis; not in my backyard but in somebody else's backyard. Shame on us \nfor that attitude.\n  It is the consumer, it is the taxpayer, it is the economy itself, it \nis the very jobs that drive the workforce of this country that are at \nstake.\n  We ought not be so selective. We want an abundant energy supply, and \nwe ought to be prudent in the development of the policy that drives it \nand produces it.\n  What I am telling my colleagues is, I am prepared to vote for it all: \nLots of conservation, LIHEAP, lots of new technology, the tax credits \nnecessary to drive it, exploring ANWR in Alaska, exploring other public \nlands in our Nation. I don't want to go home and say that the Congress \ngot bogged down in politics and failed, and your gas bill is going to \ndouble over the decade or triple or quadruple, and your energy costs \nare going to become an ever-increasing part of your household or \nbusiness budget because politically we didn't get the job done.\n  Shame on us if that is the case.\n  Our job is to be responsible in producing a quality, energy policy \nfor the Nation, not the political, environmental nit-picking that is \ngoing on at this moment.\n  I hope the real job that is done here is to offer the amendments to \ncraft a bill that will produce something that is phenomenally clean, \nabundant and allows our technology to lead the rest of the world into a \nclean energy environment that is abundant for all and inexpensive for \neveryone along with it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I did not mean in any way to speed the \nSenator from Idaho up on his statement. I wanted to announce on behalf \nof the majority leader there will be no votes tonight.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that Senator Durbin now be recognized \nand, following that, Senator Burns be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority whip from Nevada for \nhis unanimous consent request. I appreciate the opportunity to be here \nto speak on this issue which is so critical to the future of America.\n  Let me begin by commending the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, \nas well as our majority leader, Senator Daschle, for bringing this bill \nto the floor and keeping a promise that they would. We have been \nchallenged for more than a year by the Bush administration and by \nRepublicans in the Senate to bring an energy bill forward. Senator \nDaschle made it clear he would do that. But for a delay in the previous \nbill on election reform, it might have taken place as early as last \nweek. He certainly kept his word.\n  I thought it was interesting that some of those from the other side \nof the aisle came to the Chamber and actually criticized the process. \nIf I understand their argument, they think we brought it to the floor \ntoo fast. They think it should have gone through committee, should have \nbeen subject to a lot of amendments and changes. Quite honestly, if you \nlook at the precedent of what has happened in the Senate, Senators \nDaschle and Bingaman have brought this bill to the Senate in the same \nmanner the Republican leadership did 2 years ago.\n  They have given ample opportunity for amendments and debate. That is \nthe way it should be. I have always felt that in a legislative body, \nyou give it your best argument and present it to your colleagues and \nhave a vote and move on, ultimately to final passage. I hope that is \nwhat happens with this important bill.\n  This is the fourth time we have debated energy policy in America \nsince 1973. The last time was 10 years ago. When you look at what has \nhappened to us in recent times, you can understand how timely this \ndebate is: We faced spikes in oil prices in the spring of 1999 due to \nan OPEC decision to reduce production; the winter of 1999-2000 home \nheating problems caused by a combination of unexpected weather, \ndepleted supply, and rising costs; gasoline price spikes in the Midwest \nin the summer of 2000; rolling blackouts in California in early 2001 \nmarked the first deliberate energy cutoff since World War II.\n  These events were set against the backdrop of strong economic growth \nin the mid to late 1990s; increases in energy consumption to keep this \neconomy moving forward; deregulation; advances in efficiency; and \nevolving defense and foreign policy.\n  As we debate this issue, our attention is focused to that part of the \nworld again that is the source of a great portion of our energy. We \nhave to understand that this debate is taking place in the context of \nan American dependence on foreign oil. I believe it is naive to think \nthat in the near term we will be completely independent when it comes \nto energy sources. I wish I could say otherwise. Even with our best \nefforts, we are going to have to rely on some imported fuel.\n  I hope we can make progress in this bill in moving us forward toward \nless dependence on foreign energy sources. The way we approach that is \nthe crux of this debate.\n  On the other side, the Bush administration and many Republicans--not \nall but many--in Congress believe that production is the way to answer \nthis. They think if we can just find sources of production that are \nadequate, we can take care of America's future energy needs. I won't \nquarrel with the math, but I will quarrel with the policy.\n\n[[Page S1524]]\n\n  I do have to question whether or not we want to embark on a policy \nthat really focuses on the production of energy as the foundation and \ncornerstone of our energy policy. That, in my point of view, is \nthinking that dates back to the last century and before. We should be \nthinking in smarter terms about ways to not only create energy but to \nconserve energy in a fashion that is not only going to give us energy, \nmove us toward energy independence, but is also kind to our \nenvironment.\n  That is the second half of this equation. It is not just about our \neconomy and energy as the fuel for the economy, but the impact of our \nuse of energy on the environment we live in, the air we breathe, the \nstreams and rivers that may be polluted, as well as the whole question \nof whether or not we are going to for once invade some wilderness areas \nto try to drill for oil and gas.\n  Let me summarize what the bill says, as has been mentioned in the \ncourse of the debate. It tries to address ensuring adequate and \naffordable supplies of energy from renewable sources as well as oil, \ngas, coal, and nuclear. This element of the bill is important to speak \nabout for a moment.\n  This bill creates goals and incentives to increase the amount of U.S. \nelectricity produced from renewable energy sources.\n  This is an area of great potential in the United States. We are \nseeing, for example, alternative and renewable fuels being used to a \ngreater extent in some parts of our country than others. California is \nan example. I am told that 12 to 13 percent of the electricity \ngenerated in California comes from renewable sources. Those include a \nlot of things--geothermal, wind power, and others. We should really \nembark, as part of this bill, on a national policy of encouraging these \nrenewable sources. They not only lessen dependence on foreign energy \nsource, but they are also kind to the environment. Solar, wind, \ngeothermal, and biomass are all mentioned in the bill as avenues for us \nto explore in the use of renewable energy sources. We also need a \nrenewable portfolio standard to increase the amount of renewable energy \nprovided by electricity retailers.\n  Let me show you a chart that talks about renewable sources for \nelectricity consumption. If we do nothing, the lower line here \nrepresents the current renewable sources in America as a per average \ntotal. You see it is slightly more than 2.5 percent. This bill moves us \nforward. By 2020, we are at least over 10 percent. We will debate, in \nthe course of this bill, an amendment by Senator Jeffords which would \neven have us at a higher level as a commitment to renewable energy \nsources. This makes sense, it is an important debate, and it will \nchange our way of approaching energy--but change it in an \nenvironmentally sensible way.\n  We also need to expand the amount of ethanol and biodiesel used in \nmotor vehicles. This bill does it. It triples the amount that is going \nto be used in America during the life of the bill. That is a big issue \nwhere I live because, living in the farm belt and being in an area that \nis considered, I guess, the ``OPEC of ethanol,'' we really have major \nethanol production. But the good news is there are other areas in the \ncountry that are currently opening up ethanol production facilities.\n  Ethanol, of course is an alcohol fuel derived from grain, primarily \nfrom corn. It is a fuel that is kind to the environment. It reduces \npollution and helps our farmers. I do have some bias, representing a \nfarm State such as Illinois, but more demand for ethanol is going to \ncreate higher farm prices for corn and reduce the need for Federal \nexpenditures in the farm program. It is a winning proposition.\n  I am really proud that this bill focuses on ethanol and biodiesel and \nmakes a serious national commitment to expanding it to 5 billion \ngallons by 2012. We expedite the construction of the pipeline to bring \nnatural gas from Alaska to the lower 48. This doesn't involve the \nArctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR). It is a pipeline already in \nareas that have been vetted to be economically acceptable, \nenvironmentally acceptable, and it doesn't go into the wilderness \nareas. We increase funds to speed up the permitting of new domestic oil \nand gas production.\n  I have heard executives from oil companies tell me: You don't need to \ngo to ANWR; there are plenty of places that are environmentally sound \nin the United States to turn to. ANWR is in this debate because a lot \nof companies have invested a lot of money in ANWR. They are being \nprotected by some in this Chamber who want to make sure they capitalize \non that investment. We ought to think twice about that, and I will \naddress that in a moment.\n  The bill extends permanent authority to fill and operate the \nStrategic Petroleum Reserve. This is a reserve of petroleum that is \navailable in emergency circumstances to the United States. I think it \nis important to fill it and have it on hand when needed. You never know \nwhen you are going to face an interruption in supply. The bill also \ninvests in Research and Development in all fuels. That is when we \nexhaust the discussion of ensuring the diversity of energy supplies.\n\n  We now move to the question of improving efficiency and productivity \nof energy transmission and use. I learned, by my experience in my home \narea, in central Illinois, how important the national grid is to \nelectricity. There is a lot that needs to be done to upgrade this grid \nand make certain it is really national in scope, so consumers can know \nthey have reliable sources for energy supplies.\n  This bill--this legislation on the Democratic side--protects \nreliability of the interstate electric grid and removes barriers to \nadding to the electric infrastructure. It will provide consumers with \nmore transparent information and better information on energy choices. \nIt requires higher fuel efficiency in future Federal purchases of \nautomobiles and other vehicles and greater energy efficiency in Federal \nbuildings. It helps State and local governments save energy in public \nschools and public housing. It sets new efficiency standards for \ncommercial and consumer products, including an increase in central air-\nconditioning efficiency by 30 percent, and enhancements to the Energy \nStar Program, to improve product label information. It increases \nfunding for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to \nhelp low-income families make their homes more energy efficient.\n  I have seen the importance of this program firsthand. I just left \nChicago, which I am proud to represent in the Senate, where the weather \nwas cold--zero degrees on Sunday night, with the wind chill bringing it \ndown below zero by about 22 degrees. I thought of all the people who \nare living in homes that are not adequately heated. I have visited some \nof those homes and have seen people struggling to keep their babies \nwarm in a frigid atmosphere. LIHEAP provides the basic necessities of \nhome heating and cooling. It also helps low-income families make homes \nmore energy efficient, and it is particularly important for senior \ncitizens.\n  Other things are part of this bill, but I want to move to one \nparticular element that I think is very important for us to discuss, \nand that is the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standard. I was \nvisited earlier today by one of my close friends in the labor movement, \nwho came to me and urged that I oppose any increase in the fuel \nefficiency standards, fuel economy standards for automobiles and other \nvehicles in America. I really struggled in trying to understand his \npoint of view, but to put it in the context of what I think is an \nimportant element in this debate, the way I see it is this. In 1975, we \nmade a decision in America to basically double the fuel efficiency of \ncars to 27.5 miles per gallon, and to do that by 1985--a 10-year \nproject.\n  At the time it was proposed--and I have seen quotes from the debate--\nautomobile manufacturers said it was physically impossible, it could \nnot be achieved without laying off auto workers across America, and \nthat technologically we were going to sacrifice the safety of cars in \nan effort to try to put this new fuel economy standard in place.\n  Well, we did it. We did it by 1985, and we are better off for it. \nThink of the level of our dependence on energy today had we not \ninitiated that discussion in 1975.\n  But since 1985, we have been absolutely stuck in the mud when it \ncomes to improving these fuel economy standards. If we don't take the \nissue of fuel efficiency seriously as part of this energy debate, \nCongress should not be\n\n[[Page S1525]]\n\ntaken seriously, because if we cannot improve the efficiency of \nvehicles in our country, frankly, all of the technology we have \ndemonstrated throughout our history is for nothing. I think we have the \ncapacity to do it.\n\n  I have to tell you that it is some source of embarrassment to me \nthat, time and again, we are two steps behind automobile manufacturers \noverseas--particularly those in Japan--when it comes to new technology \nfor automobiles and other vehicles, to make them cleaner and safer. \nThere is absolutely no excuse. We have the greatest engineers in the \nworld. We have great minds in Detroit and other places. Why are we \nalways two steps behind? Why would Honda and Toyota be the first \ncompanies to the market with these hybrid automobiles that offer 60 to \n70 miles per gallon, while Detroit is still in a concept car and they \nhope by next year they might be able to offer the first vehicle?\n  During the Clinton administration, President Clinton and Vice \nPresident Gore said: We are prepared to basically look the other way on \nantitrust enforcement to give the Big Three automakers a chance to sit \ndown, work together, and come out with a fuel-efficient car. This was \nthe common complaint: Oh, we could do it, but as soon as we talked to \none another, the Department of Justice would be on our backs. The \nClinton-Gore administration said: Have no fear. Move forward.\n  Nothing happened. We sit here today still looking for that \nbreakthrough in automobile technology. Quite honestly, this bill is \ngoing to move us forward in terms of fuel economy. I am going to \nsupport it. I hope to explain to my friends in labor as well as those \nworking for the Big Three that if we don't include fuel efficiency and \nfuel economy in this bill, this bill is not worth the effort. If we \ndon't do this, we are going to find ourselves continuing to be \ndependent on finding new sources of fossil fuels around the world and \nin the United States.\n  We are conceding the fact we are going to be so hungry for oil to \nfuel these gas guzzler cars on the highways that we are prepared to \ndrill almost anywhere. Already some are saying: Let's go into \nwilderness areas in Alaska; we have no place else to turn. What is \nnext? The Mall? Central Park? Yosemite?\n  Frankly, we have to look at our responsibility in this country as \npart of this debate. It is a mistake to believe we can sit here and \ntell the American people that we can be more fuel efficient and have a \nsensible energy policy that will not involve their commitment and their \nsacrifice.\n  If we look at the highways of America 10 years from now and see cars \nlike today, or even bigger vehicles, we have failed. We have failed \nbecause, frankly, we are conceding that there is absolutely nothing we \ncan do in energy policy that will change the habits and tastes of \nAmericans and move us toward a more responsible course.\n  In this time when we are waging war and Americans are being killed \noverseas because of terrorism, when we are focusing on the Middle East \nand its instability, is it too much to ask the people of this country \nto join us in a collective discussion and debate about what we can do \nas individuals, businesses, and families to come up with more efficient \nvehicles? I do not think it is.\n  Americans are prepared to sacrifice with the right leadership if they \nbelieve the goals are right and honest. I believe these goals are. More \nfuel efficiency for our vehicles means less dependence on foreign \nenergy sources and less pollution.\n  Let me give a comparison about what conservation means as opposed to \nsome of the alternatives that have been suggested. This is a chart \nwhich I think tells an interesting story. Take a look at what this bill \ndoes in terms of saving millions of barrels per day of petroleum. In \nthe industrial and home efficiency savings of this bill, look at the \nsavings from the current debate time, 2002, to the year 2030. There is \na substantial increase in the industrial and home efficiency savings \narea that brings us ultimately to a savings of millions of barrels per \nday. The largest part is in vehicle savings.\n  In other words, taking the basic elements of this bill, these are the \nmillions of barrels we will save per day with the fuel efficiency of \nthe Bingaman-Daschle bill. There are those who say we do not need to do \nthat; what we really need to do is drill in the Arctic National \nWildlife Refuge, a wilderness area.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I wonder if my friend will yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield for a question in a moment.\n  This chart indicates what we can hope to bring out of the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge. The chart may be sitting too low to see \nbecause it is way down on the chart. I want to make sure that those who \nare following this debate with rapt attention notice that on the amount \nwe hope to glean from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, even if we \nvoted today to start it, we will not see the first barrel of oil coming \nout of there until 2009. Look at how little comes out. This larger \namount is what we can achieve with efficiency. This smaller amount is \nwhat we are debating in a wilderness and refuge area. We should make \nthis commitment part of our energy policy. Why do we have to turn to an \narea which we declared, as part of our national policy, would remain a \nwilderness as God created it, bring in the trucks and all of the \npipelines and everything that is necessary, and risk the loss of \nwildlife and changing the face of that area forever, when, in fact, if \nwe take a responsible course on vehicle fuel efficiency, as well as \nindustrial and home efficiency, the savings far outweigh what we could \npossibly glean from this Arctic National Wildlife Refuge?\n\n  I will be happy to yield to my colleague from Alaska.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I noted the reference by the Senator \nfrom Illinois several times to the issue of wilderness. I wonder if he \nunderstands the status of the area under consideration in the amendment \nthat will be offered by various Members relative to opening up ANWR.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I certainly have heard many descriptions. I will let my \ncolleague from Alaska explain it.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Let me refer to the statements that have been made by \nthe Senator from Illinois relative to this being a wilderness, to this \nbeing a refuge. Clearly, there are distinctions. I would stand with the \nSenator from Illinois if there were any effort to open oil and gas \nexploration in wilderness areas of my State.\n  The Senator from Illinois indicated there were proposals to even go \ninto the wilderness in Alaska. I know of no such proposals to drill oil \nand gas in wilderness. As a matter of fact, the 1002 area is a refuge. \nAs the Senator from Illinois knows, we have drilling in numerous \nrefuges. We have about 41 refuges in the United States where we drill \nfor oil and gas. They are in virtually every State. As a matter of \nfact, I think there are one or two in Illinois.\n  I encourage my friend from Illinois to not mix metaphors because \nwilderness is wilderness. We do not drill in wilderness areas. We are \nnot proposing we drill in wilderness areas. The 1002 area is not a \nwilderness. It was set aside by Congress for specific action.\n  I am sure my friend from Illinois knows that ANWR is about the size \nof the State of South Carolina. I am sure he knows there are 8.5 \nmillion acres of the 19 million acres that are designated as \nwilderness, but that is not in the area that is proposed to be opened \nfor competitive leasing. That is 1.5 million acres in the 1002 area.\n  I am sure my friend is also aware that out of the 19 million acres, 9 \nmillion acres have been set aside in a separate refuge that is managed \nas a wilderness which is not included.\n  It is important that we recognize realities and not mix metaphors \nbecause the Arctic Coastal Plain is certainly not the last remaining \nwilderness in Alaska.\n  We have 56 million acres designated wilderness that we defend. So \nplease be careful when you mix these metaphors because if you had been \nup there to look at it, you would have a different appreciation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would like to reclaim my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think I have been generous in allowing the Senator to \ninterrupt this presentation.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. I was not interrupting. I was responding and asking a \nquestion about metaphors. I think we should be very careful not to \nmislead the public.\n\n[[Page S1526]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. It is very gracious of the Senator from Alaska to help me \nwith my metaphors. I thank the Senator from Alaska. I stand corrected. \nThe use of the word ``wilderness'' is inappropriate. It is the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge.\n  I do believe it is somewhat specious to argue it is only the size of \nSouth Carolina. Three Mile Island was only the size of this Capitol \nBuilding, and when you look at some of the oil spills I have seen, when \nI went up to see Prince Edward Sound, the size of that tanker may not \nhave been much longer than half the size of this building, but what it \ndid when it ruptured caused damage far beyond the size of the tanker.\n\n  When the Senator says it is just the size of South Carolina, I think, \nfrankly, that understates the potential damage which could be done to \nthe environment and to the wildlife if we are not careful.\n  Plus, I have to tell my colleagues, I believe it is shortsighted and \nit is not the wisest and most prudent approach to say that if we are \ngoing to have any kind of energy independence, then we have to drill in \na national wildlife refuge in Alaska.\n  There are so many other activities we can do by way of conservation, \nefficiency, and drilling for oil and gas in environmentally sound areas \nthat would absolve us from getting into the controversy of going into \nthis wildlife refuge. I think, frankly, that is a wrongheaded approach. \nI disagree with the Senator from Alaska. I was happy to yield him the \ntime, and he made his point.\n  In concluding this presentation, let me say the following: I hope \nwhen we get into this debate about fuel economy and fuel efficiency \nstandards that we can find a way to deal with some of the more vexing \naspects of the problem. Part of this has to do with credits we created \nyears ago rewarding some automobile manufacturers for the types of \nvehicles they made and not rewarding others.\n  The building up of these credits has created a secondary, but very \nimportant, argument which should be addressed as part of this energy \npolicy debate.\n  What I think we should require of all manufacturers that want to sell \nin the United States, domestic and foreign, is that they demonstrate a \nreal commitment to improved fuel efficiency of their vehicles.\n  Recently, one of the engineers in the city of Chicago at the Illinois \nInstitute of Technology wrote an article for the Chicago Tribune in \nwhich he had a few thoughts about the whole discussion of hydrogen-\nfuel-cell-powered vehicles. It is an interesting concept, he said, but \nat least 10 years away, maybe longer; we should continue to explore, \nbut, frankly, do not hold it out as the Holy Grail; and that just \nbecause of the possibility of hydrogen-fueled cars, we really should \nnot avoid addressing fuel efficiency and economy in today's \nautomobiles.\n  He said at the end of the article: I hope the Senators from Illinois \nread this article and give me a call.\n  So I did. I said to the Professor: What is it you would suggest we \ndo?\n  He said: There are things that can and should be done now to improve \nthe fuel efficiency of vehicles. Why Detroit and other manufacturers \nare holding back on it, I do not understand.\n  He gave us one illustration. A larger battery in a vehicle allows one \nto turn to more electronic equipment in that vehicle as opposed to \nmechanical and hydraulic, which takes weight off the vehicle but still \nperforms the valuable function. That seems sensible to me.\n  He says a heavier battery where there is electronic-powered brakes, \nfor example, could save 2 miles per gallon, and you think, well, that \nis a pretty sensible thing to do.\n  He also said looking to newer materials that are safe materials that \ncan be used in vehicles that do not add to weight but still provide \nprotection, all of these things have to be on the table. They will not \nbe taken seriously by Detroit unless and until we are serious about \nfuel economy standards. We will continue to play the role of second \nbest in this automobile technology race unless and until Congress has \nthe willingness and the political courage to step up and say to Detroit \nand all automobile and truck manufacturers across America: We have to \ndo better.\n  When I asked one of the critics of this bill today what do they think \nwe can achieve, what is realistic when it comes to fuel economy, he \nsaid: I think we can achieve a 10-percent improvement in fuel economy \nby the year 2019.\n  I said: So we could go from 27\\1/2\\ miles per gallon to perhaps 31 \nmiles per gallon by the year 2019?\n  Yes, he said.\n  So I said: From 1985 to 2019 the best we could achieve was 3 miles \nper gallon?\n  I do not buy that. I do not believe that. I really believe we proved \nbetween 1975 and 1985 that given the right incentives, we can do a lot \nbetter than that, and I sincerely hope those who are involved in this \ndebate will not view it as a political and legal struggle but as a \ntechnological challenge, because once challenged, I think our \nscientists and engineers can rise to that occasion.\n  So I commend my colleague from New Mexico, Senator Bingaman, for his \nleadership on this bill, as well as the majority leader, Senator \nDaschle, for joining him in this effort. I look forward to this debate \nbecause I believe it is timely. And I am hoping that as a result of it \nwe will have a reliable, stable supply of energy; we will have \nconservation policies that make sense for our future; we will move \ntoward renewable fuels which have such great potential; we will find \nourselves using alternative fuels that, frankly, have been valuable to \nus and can be used even more. That is part of a balanced debate that \ndoes not have us drilling in wildlife refuges--not wilderness, as \nSenator Murkowski has corrected me--and areas that, frankly, should be \nthe last place, not the first place, we turn to when we are desperate \nfor energy, especially when we have a lot of options we can consider in \nterms of energy efficiency.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I know the next order of business is to \nhear from the Senator from Montana, Mr. Burns. I do not know if he is \navailable to give his statement at this point. I think possibly we \nshould go into a quorum call and try to locate him.\n\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am not going to speak long, but I \nwant to make a point to my colleagues, and particularly their staffs, \nthat there are certain aspects of this legislation that are very \ntechnical and certain aspects reflect on the knowledge that obviously \nwe have in our own States, and I respect that. I want to put my \ncolleagues on notice we are going to follow the statements very closely \nand we will respond in rebuttal to obvious inaccuracies relative to \nstatements that are being made, and that is in the spirit of simply \naccuracy and factual information that I think is necessary to portray \nand project indeed the importance of having factual information before \nthe Members of this body as we deliberate the bill.\n  I see the Senator from Montana. If there is no objection from my \nfriend from New Mexico, I yield to the Senator from Montana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized under \nthe previous order.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Alaska, and I \nthank the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee for \nthe time.\n  This is a great day. I think this is a good day. We have finally \nstarted talking about legislation we hope will facilitate a policy to \nmake us a little more efficient but also increase supply, especially in \ncase of emergency, and to keep this economy rolling. The bill we have \ntoday is 433 pages long, and it is written in legalese that most \npeople, including me, do not easily understand.\n  As complicated as this bill is and as complicated as this process is, \nthe reality is simple: This country needs a comprehensive energy \npolicy.\n  Last fall, this country was shaken to its foundation. That experience \nhas made each of us stand back and make\n\n[[Page S1527]]\n\ndecisions about what is really important in our lives. As I have \ntraveled across this country and in my home State of Montana, I keep \nhearing the same thing over again. Everybody in America wants to \nprotect their family, they want to provide a safe and secure living \nenvironment, they want to protect their loved ones from harm.\n  There is one thing that is undisputable. I represent an energy State. \nWe have been in the production of energy for a long time in Montana so \nwe know a little something about it. There is also something else that \nis indisputable and that is that a comprehensive energy policy is \nabsolutely paramount to American freedom. Let me put it this way: \nEnergy security is economic security is national security.\n  If that magic word that goes across our television screen and across \nour mind is ``security,'' we cannot separate those three. Energy \nsecurity is economic security is national security, so that the \ndecisions we make here in the Senate will affect and direct the lives \nof every single American, without exception. The policy we set here on \nthe Senate floor should ensure that energy is affordable, and that it \nis abundant. Affordable energy means businesses stay open and \nbusinesses prosper and people keep working. It means senior citizens \nwho are on fixed incomes are able to pay their electricity bill at the \nend of the month without having to give up something else. It means \nsomeone can fill up their car with gas and drive their kids to school; \nfill up a truck and deliver goods across the country without breaking \nthe bank; and, yes, to my State, crank up the combines, harvest a crop \nand put another one in, without fearing the repercussions of high fuel \nprices.\n  Every one of us will be affected no matter how basic the level. So we \nhave to answer a lot of questions. How do we get dependable, affordable \nsupplies of energy? That will be the focus of this debate, and the \npolicy that carries us not through my generation but also the next \ngeneration and the next. And that is about the time we will have \nanother policy change because technology and circumstances will change.\n\n  We have heard some of my colleagues claim Americans use too much \nenergy, that we are greedy, that we use more than our fair share of the \nworld's supply of energy. Would those same people stand up and argue \nthat the United States produces more than its fair share of goods and \nservices? Would they say we have an oversupply of American ingenuity?\n  Are we producing more computers, more cars, more agricultural goods \nthan we should? I don't think so. I don't think the hard-working people \nwho produce those goods think so either. We can do that because we are \ngood at it and because we have used our energy with the best \nconservation technology known until this date.\n  Let's go one step beyond the economic security that affordable energy \nprovides. Think about the security it provides this country when we \nimprove our ability to produce different kinds of energy domestically. \nFor example, this country buys 56 percent of its oil from other \ncountries. Think back to the 1970s when we had the lines at the gas \nstations. Then it was around 35 or 36 percent from foreign countries. I \ndon't like that kind of vulnerability. Much of that oil is produced \nfrom countries or producers that have very honest intentions, but, I \nwill remind Americans, not all of them and not all of it.\n  Every drop of oil we produce domestically is one that we do not buy \nfrom Saddam Hussein. Every barrel bought from a rogue nation could mean \na bomb built to hurt this country. I think it is about time we turn off \nthe spigot of terrorist oil.\n  In this debate we will start talking about the Alaska National \nWildlife Refuge. While at times the point may be confused, like in the \ncolloquy that just preceded me--ANWR was a wildlife refuge created by \nlaw and that law gave express permission or grant to drill within parts \nof it. I can think of no other public land that was created with that \nexpress intention and law.\n  I would like to point out that the debate over ANWR will boil down to \nwhether we open up 2,000 acres for exploration in Alaska. It will be \nexamined. It will be turned inside and out, over and over again. We \nwill debate this a long time.\n  I say to my good friend from Oklahoma, whose State is an energy \nproducer like my state of Montana, that since 1997, in my State alone, \nthe Federal Government and the executive branch have managed to shut \noff 727,000 acres from gas and oil development in Montana in two \ndifferent decisions. There was no congressional discussion either time.\n  I agree with open debate and I am glad to be a part of this process, \nbut I wonder why we only get to do it when we want to open Federal \nland, and not when we shut it off. Why is it that a midlevel manager in \nthe Forest Service can make the decision to close 350,000 acres, and we \ndon't hear a whimper or whisper on the Senate Floor.\n  Because of a decision made in a federal bureaucracy or through \nexecutive order, it has been decided we are going to take that land out \nof production. That denies my State the ability to produce energy for a \ncountry that really needs it, and the jobs it provides and the revenue \nit provides to my State to build schools, build roads, provide \ngovernment services.\n  Of course, this debate will extend beyond domestic oil and gas \nproduction, and it should. We are developing excellent technology. We \nare tapping resources to create energy from new sources. I heard \nmention today about renewables. They want to use thermal activity.\n  We live next to an area that has more thermal activity than any place \nin our country: Yellowstone Park. There is thermal potential all the \nway around it. You just try to develop it. It cannot be done because \nyou have to cross federal land to get there, which makes absolutely no \nsense.\n  We will talk about fuel cells. We will talk about biomass. We will \ntalk about ethanol. We will talk about wind. Those are only a few of \nthe opportunities we have to use our resources in new ways.\n  I am proud to support alternative and renewable energy, and will \ncontinue to do so. But we can't shortchange our energy needs today by \nfocusing our efforts on alternative energy alone. Many of the \ntechnologies are promising but are still in the developmental and very \nexpensive stages in comparison to our traditional energy sources. By \ncontinuing to develop and encourage alternative fuels and create \nmarkets for those technologies, we can approach this country's energy \nfuture with optimism.\n  It is time we go to work. It is time we debate those issues one by \none. But keep in mind what I said at the beginning of this speech. I do \nnot know of a military airplane we fly that doesn't burn oil-based \nfuel. And if something really bad happens in this country, I tell you \nsomething: The fire truck that shows up and the emergency vehicle will \nburn gasoline. In order to fight this great battle against terrorism \nand against people who would erode our freedoms, who work in the \nshadows, and who are a faceless enemy, the weapons we need still burn \ngasoline.\n  We have to think about the American people and their safety and their \nsecurity. What we are asking in this is a policy that will develop \nthose new technologies. But we cannot turn our backs on the demand for \nthe energy sources we have used for so long in this country. Let us \nwork to give the American people what they need--a safe, steady energy \nsupply that will ensure economic stability and national security.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/05/senate-section/article/S1527-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1527-S1530]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I wonder if the Senator would yield very \nbriefly so we might propound a quick unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the majority \nleader, following consultation with the Republican leader, may at any \ntime turn to the consideration of H.R. 2356, the campaign finance \nreform legislation; that there be 4 hours of debate equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two leaders or their designees; that no \namendments or motions be in order to the bill; that upon the use or \nyielding back of time the bill be read the third time, the Senate vote \non passage of the bill, with this action occurring with no further \nintervening action or debate.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, and I will object, let \nme\n\n[[Page S1528]]\n\nsay to the distinguished majority leader and to all Members of the \nSenate, since he last propounded this consent agreement, the senior \nSenator from Arizona and I have had an opportunity to sit down three \ntimes in private discussion about some technical changes to the bill \nthat I thought would not do violence to the underlying concept. We have \nreached agreement in principle on 6 of the 13 suggestions I made.\n  Today, he and I both had an opportunity to brief our colleagues in \nthe Republican conference on the 13 suggestions I proposed. They have \nnow been distributed. I would like for the majority leader and the \nDemocrats to look at them as well. I am hoping we can continue to \ndiscuss the changes in the next few days.\n  I remind our colleagues that this bill, which certainly will become \nlaw sometime soon, doesn't take effect until November 6. So I think to \ntake a little more time to look at it very carefully and consider \ntechnical changes that will benefit both sides is a good idea. I \nencourage all Senators to take a look at the suggestions I have made. I \nbelieve virtually all of them are reasonable. I know Senator McCain \nbelieves that at least some of them are reasonable. Therefore, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the majority leader for propounding this \nunanimous consent agreement, and I thank my colleague from Kentucky for \nentering into good-faith discussions on this issue. We have had \nimportant discussions, and I think they have been something that \nSenator McConnell deserves to have had, given the long involvement we \nhave had in this issue.\n  I must tell my colleagues, we are at an impasse. We are at a \nsituation where we need to move the process forward because the seven \nareas of ``disagreement'' that we have are substantive in nature, could \nnever be viewed by me and Senator Feingold, with whom I have consulted \nconstantly during this issue, my partner--could not be construed as \nanything but substantive amendments.\n  That is why I requested that the Senator from Kentucky bring up these \n7 amendments, we vote them up or down, 51 votes carries, and we agree \nto move to final passage on the bill.\n  I cannot continue to discuss the amendments on the bill when we \ncannot agree to process on the bill. My position--and it remains my \nposition, as propounded by the majority leader--is that we move to the \nbill with a consent the amendments the Senator from Kentucky or others \nmay have be voted up or down, with an agreement on those amendments, \nwith final passage.\n\n  As to the technical amendments, many of which are still up for \ndiscussion and would have to also be agreed to by our colleagues on the \nother side of the Capitol, those we would agree to by unanimous consent \nagreement, as far as the Senate is concerned, and if we, the majority \nleader, the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, Senator Dodd, Senator \nMcCain, and Senator Feingold are in agreement, we would take up and \npass those technical amendments to the bill. I think that is a fair \ndisposition of this legislation.\n  As Senator McConnell is going to distribute his proposals, I will \nalso distribute our responses. To any objective observer, a majority of \nthose are not technical in nature, they are controversial. They need to \nbe debated and voted on within a reasonable length of time.\n  Finally, I appreciate the patience of the majority leader. He is \ncommitted to the energy bill. I understand that commitment. But I also \nappreciate the fact that the majority leader wants this issue dispensed \nwith. It was March a year ago that we passed this legislation. It went \nover to the other body with assurance of a fair rule. It was an unfair \nrule. They had to get 218 votes. They passed this legislation with 10 \namendments. We had 3 weeks of debate--3 weeks with amendment after \namendment.\n  This issue has been ventilated. It is time to move forward. I say \nwith great respect and appreciation for this honorable opponent, it is \ntime we move forward. If we have to, the majority leader needs to go \nthrough the cloture motion process. I regret that, but we cannot \ndiscuss further technical amendments that are not technical amendments \nunless there is an agreement on the process, and that process has to be \nconsideration of amendments and agreement of final passage, or \nanticipation of a filibuster, to which one of our colleagues has \nalready committed, no matter what.\n  One of our colleagues is already committed to filibuster, I say to my \ncolleagues, no matter what happens in the discussions that Senator \nMcConnell and I may have. It is time we plan for that and move forward \nwith cloture motions. If the Senate decides not to get 60 votes, then \nwe will wait until the next scandal. We will wait until the next \nscandal, I say to the Senator from Kentucky. I don't know if it is \nBuddhist Temple fundraising, I don't know if it is Enron, I don't know \nwho it is, but this system awash in money creates scandals because it \nmakes good people do bad things. It is time we fixed it.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I am happy to briefly yield to the \nSenator from Wisconsin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I have been quiet the last few days \nabout this because I have a lot of respect for the Senator from \nKentucky, and I admire the patience of my partner, Senator McCain, to \ngo through these proposals with the Senator from Kentucky. But I have \nto say, in my mind, the time has run out.\n  The proposals the Senator from Kentucky is talking about, as he \nindicated, in some cases are technical. In those instances, we can \nsimply deal with these matters in a separate piece of legislation. But \nthe Senator from Arizona is right. The other matters are substantive; \nthey are controversial. But I add, they do not go to the core issues of \nthe McCain-Feingold bill.\n  A broad consensus in both Houses, a bipartisan consensus, has voted \nstrongly to pass those items. That has to happen now. And given the \nfact that one of the Members on the other side of the aisle has \nindicated--not the Senator from Kentucky, but another Member--that \nthere will be a filibuster, in any event, the time has come not to be \nquiet anymore but to support the majority leader, who has come out here \ndiligently and tried to move us forward. Consistent with the other \ncommitments he has made, consistent with all the pressures he has, he \nhas been here and tried again today to get us to the final process.\n  It is regrettable, but I think we have to go now to the final stage: \nto represent the will of this body, the will of the House, and to \nfinally clean up this system. I don't think any more delay is merited.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I have said publicly, and I will say for \npurposes of the Record, it is my intention to back up from the final \nday of this particular work period for whatever length of time may be \nrequired to go through the procedural hurdles to accomplish our goal of \ncompleting our work on this bill prior to the time we go into the \nEaster recess. So we will do that. I just put my colleagues on notice.\n  I also simply note that had we been able to get unanimous consent, I \nwould also have asked unanimous consent on behalf of Senator Hollings \nthat the constitutional amendment regarding campaign finance reform \nalso be considered. But since that agreement could not be reached, I \ndid not propound the other request.\n  I am happy to yield to the Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the Senator will yield for a question, I hope the \nmajority leader might be willing to share the information now with the \nbalance of his colleagues so that others might take a look at whether \nor not these suggestions are reasonable and don't go to the heart of \nthe bill. Even Senator McCain and Senator Feingold have indicated that \nsix of them we can probably reach agreement on in principle.\n  You are the majority leader, not I, but let me suggest on the ones \nthat we can agree with in principle, it might be appropriate to pass a \nseparate technical corrections bill, if it needs to be in a separate \nbill, in order to avoid going back to the House. Pass the technical \ncorrections bill simultaneously; it goes back to the House, the other \nbill goes on down to the President.\n  I am a little worried about there not being much interest in the \ntechnical\n\n[[Page S1529]]\n\ncorrections bill after the main bill leaves the Senate.\n  If we can reach agreement on at least some of these, as appears \npossible, I hope the majority leader might consider taking up the \ntechnical corrections package simultaneously, sending it out of here \nand back over to the House side. It is just a suggestion.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I say to the Senator from Kentucky, I know he has put a \nlot of time and thought into this. I am not averse to considering that \napproach. I think it is certainly worth our while to consider what \nproposals the Senator and others have suggested. We will take a look at \nthat and entertain that possibility at such time as we take up the \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, briefly, I ask unanimous consent the \npackage I just referred to in my remarks be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Senator McConnell's 6 Technical Changes Proposed--Agreement in \n                               Principal\n\n       1. Transfer of Excess Campaign Funds--Shays-Meehan \n     inadvertently eliminated unlimited transfers of excess \n     campaign funds to party committees.\n       Solution: Include ``without limitation'' for transfers of \n     excess funds so transfer will not be a ``personal use'' of \n     campaign funds.\n       2. Not Impact 2002 Run-Offs--Effective date is before run-\n     off elections are held.\n       Solution: Allow parties to operate under the current system \n     for any 2002 run-off elections.\n       3. Defined Soliciation--Federal candidates and \n     officeholders are heavily restricted in fundraising for state \n     candidates and party committees. For example, federal \n     candidates and officeholders could be banned from attending \n     fundraising events for state candidates.\n       Solution: Clearly define what we can and cannot do.\n       4. Time Limit for Special Judicial Review Procedures--\n     Plaintiffs around the country should not be forced to sue \n     only in D.C. District Court forever, with no circuit court \n     review (only option is discretionary appeal to the Supreme \n     Court--practically foreclosing appellate review).\n       Solution: Provide a time limit for exclusive jurisdiction \n     in D.C. District Court and lack of circuit court review.\n       5. Authorize Member Challenges--Shays-Meehan specifically \n     authorizes member intervention in a suit but does not \n     specifically authorize a member to challenge the new law.\n       Solution: Specifically authorize member challenges--parity \n     for challenging and intervening.\n       6. State Party Building Funds--State parties will have to \n     use hard dollars to pay for their buildings.\n       Solution: Clarify that state party building funds are \n     governed exclusively by state law.\n\n    Senator McConnell's 7 Technical Changes Proposed--Not Agreed to\n\n       1. Outside groups/State Party Parity\n       Shays-Meehan Empowers Outside Groups and Weakens State \n     Parties\n       Federal candidates and officeholders can raise soft money \n     for outside groups: unlimited for 501(c)s whose primary \n     purpose is not grassroots voter activities (could be used for \n     issue ads and voter activities) and $20,000 per individual \n     for any entity specifically for grassroots voter activities. \n     (Not in McCain-Feingold.)\n       But state party grassroots voter activities are restricted: \n     no party transfers, no joint fundraising, federal candidates \n     and officeholders can only raise hard money and state parties \n     can't use broadcast media for those activities. (Not in \n     McCain-Feingold.)\n       Solution: Return to McCain-Feingold language and raise soft \n     money limit to state parties from $10,000 to $20,000 to \n     achieve parity with fundraising for outside groups.\n       2. Coordination Prosecution--If a candidate raises money \n     for or meets with an outside group and that group engages in \n     voter registration or simply discusses legislation in the \n     candidate's state, the candidate may be civilly or even \n     criminally prosecuted.\n       Solution: Require a more precise coordination standard.\n       3. Index Contribution Limit To State Party. The limit is \n     increased but not indexed.\n       Solution: Index the hard dollar limit--critical to compete \n     with outside groups.\n       4. Permit Party Coordinated And Independent Expenditures. \n     Shays-Meehan treats all party committees (from national to \n     local parties) as a single committee. Prohibits all \n     committees from doing both coordinated expenditures and \n     independent expenditures after nomination by party (contrary \n     to S. Ct. ruling in Colorado I).\n       Solution: Do not treat all party committees as a single \n     committee and do not prohibit them from doing both \n     independent and coordinated party expenditures.\n       5. Do Not ``Federalize'' State Candidates--State candidates \n     may not mention federal candidates in an advertisement unless \n     they use hard dollars; state candidates doing GOTV activities \n     together must use hard dollars, and federal candidates and \n     officeholders are subject to the hard dollar limits and \n     restrictions in fundraising for state candidates.\n       Solution: Do not ``federalize'' state candidates.\n       6. Index PAC limit--The limit is not increased or indexed.\n       Solution: Index, but do not increase, hard dollar \n     contribution limits to and from PACs.\n       7. National Party Building Fund--Will be eliminated on 11/\n     06.\n       Solution: Allow parties to spend, not raise, building funds \n     until funds are depleted.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent an analysis of \nchanges proposed by Senator McConnell be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Analysis of Changes Proposed by Senator McConnell to Pending Campaign \n                       Finance Reform Legislation\n\n       Twelve specific changes to the McCain-Feingold/Shays-Meehan \n     bill have been proposed to Senator McCain. Incorporation of \n     any of these changes in the bill itself would kill the bill \n     by sending it to conference or back to the House.\n       Many of these changes are unacceptable substantive \n     revisions of the bill. Some of these changes would upset \n     bipartisan compromises made during floor consideration in the \n     Senate or decisions made on the House floor. Still others \n     would undermine central components of the reform effort, \n     particularly the soft money ban.\n       Some of the suggested changes are technical corrections \n     that are not necessary, but that could be addressed in a \n     separate technical corrections bill as long as it does not \n     interfere with the prompt enactment of the pending campaign \n     finance reform legislation.\n       Each of the amendments is discussed below. The headings for \n     the amendments are taken from the proposal given to Senator \n     McCain.\n       1. State Party/Outside Group Parity--This is a proposed \n     substantive change to the pending CFR legislation. It would \n     eliminate the changes made in the House that clarified \n     Senator Levin's amendment in order to prevent the amendment \n     from becoming a major loophole in the soft money ban.\n       Under the Levin amendment, state and local parties could \n     use up to $10,000 per year of a contribution from a \n     corporation, union, or individual, for generic get out the \n     vote activities (GOTV); GOTV for state and local candidates; \n     and voter registration within 120 days of an election \n     involving a federal candidate, so long as these activities do \n     not refer to a clearly identified candidate for federal \n     office. As passed by the Senate, the Levin amendment could \n     have been interpreted to allow federal officeholders to raise \n     these soft money funds, and to allow state parties to use \n     these soft money funds to finance broadcast ads.\n       Senator Levin was very clear on the Senate floor, however, \n     that he did not intend this soft money to be raised by \n     federal candidates or officeholders, and the House bill \n     clarifies this. Senator Levin also intended that the money be \n     used for grassroots activities, and the House bill clarifies \n     this as well. On the Senate floor, Senator Levin explained \n     that his amendment:\n       ``These are dollars not raised through any effort on the \n     part of Federal officeholders, Federal candidates, or \n     national parties. These are non-Federal dollars allowed by \n     state law.\n       Senator Levin further said:\n       ``[This provision] will allow the use of some non-Federal \n     dollars by state parties for voter registration and get out \n     the vote, where the contributions are allowed by state law, \n     where there is no reference to federal candidates, where \n     limited to $10,000 of the contribution which is allowed by \n     state law, and where the allocation between federal and non-\n     Federal dollars is set by the federal election commission.''\n       The proposed revision would eliminate these clarifying \n     provisions.\n       The House bill also added restrictions on joint fund-\n     raising to prevent solicitations of large sums from a single \n     donor, and restrictions on transfers of monies for Levin \n     activities to state and local party committees to help \n     prevent the federal soft money system from being shifted to \n     the state level. The proposed revision would eliminate these \n     protections.\n       The proposed revision would also double the amount of soft \n     money that state parties can use from contributions provided \n     by corporations, unions, or individuals for the authorized \n     GOTV and voter registration activities. This would increase \n     the $10,000 per year limit contained in both the House and \n     Senate-passed bills to $20,000 per year. The $10,000 limit is \n     the same as the limit that applies to hard money donations by \n     individuals to state parties under the bill. Thus, under the \n     bill, an individual donor can already give a total of $20,000 \n     per year to a state party that can be used for voter \n     activities, the same amount that federal candidates can \n     solicit for outside groups for use on these activities.\n       2. Contribution Limit to State Parties--The proposal \n     suggests indexing the amount that individuals can contribute \n     to state parties. The decision not to index this amount was \n     part of difficult bipartisan negotiations during Senate \n     consideration of the bill that led to a package of increases \n     in contribution\n\n[[Page S1530]]\n\n     limits approved by the Senate. The only change in this \n     provision made by the House was to increase the aggregate \n     limits.\n       3. Hard Dollar Candidate Support by Parties--This is a \n     proposed substantive change to the pending CFR legislation. \n     The proposal would allow parties to make both independent and \n     coordinated expenditures in individual races.\n       The requirement that the parties choose between these \n     expenditures was contained in both the Senate and House-\n     passed bills and is not inconsistent with the Colorado I \n     decision. For purposes of this provision only, national and \n     state party committees are treated as a single entity. \n     Otherwise, the provision would not be effective because, for \n     example, a national party could choose to make coordinated \n     expenditures, and then transfer additional funds to a local \n     party to use for independent expenditures.\n       Parties should not be able to claim that they are \n     independent of one of their candidates if, during the general \n     election period, they are making coordinated expenditures \n     with that same candidate under section 441a(d) of the FECA. \n     Permitting both coordinated and independent expenditures by a \n     party makes meaningless the coordinated spending limits \n     recently upheld by the Supreme Court in Colorado II. \n     Furthermore, since the bill provides that the choice between \n     making independent or coordinated expenditures is made by the \n     party only after a candidate is nominated, the national party \n     will be able to control the decision of which kind of \n     spending to undertake. In addition, contrary to the claim \n     made in the proposal, there is no general restriction on \n     transferring hard money between national and state parties.\n       4. Excess Campaign Funds--This is a proposed technical \n     clarification. The proposal seeks to add the words ``without \n     limitation'' to the portion of the personal use provision of \n     the bill that deals with transfers of excess campaign funds \n     by candidates to political parties.\n       There was no intention to change longstanding federal \n     election law that permits candidates to transfer excess \n     campaign funds without limitation to their parties. This can \n     be clarified in a colloquy or in a technical corrections bill \n     if there is one.\n       5. PAC Contribution Limit--This is a proposed substantive \n     change. The proposal would index the limits on how much can \n     be contributed to and from PACs.\n       Increasing or indexing PAC contribution limits was \n     considered and rejected in bipartisan negotiations on \n     contribution limits during Senate consideration of the bill. \n     The decision represents a position that the role of PACs in \n     financing elections should not be increased. The Senate \n     agreement was not changed in the House.\n       6. 2002 Run-off Elections Unfairly Impacted--This is a \n     proposed substantive change to the pending CFR legislation. \n     The proposed revision suggests changing the effective date \n     with respect to runoff elections. This would allow soft money \n     to be raised after November 5, 2002.\n       In deciding to delay the effective date of the bill so that \n     it would not apply to the 2002 elections, a very clear \n     decision was made that no soft money should be raised after \n     election day. With respect to other provisions of the bill, \n     such as the spending of excess soft money and electioneering \n     communications, the suggestion that the bill not apply to \n     runoff elections related to the 2002 elections can be dealt \n     with in a floor colloquy or in a technical corrections bill \n     if there is one.\n       7. Building Fund--The proposal has two parts. One is a \n     substantive change, the other is not. The substantive change \n     would allow the national parties to spend their excess soft \n     money on buildings without any time limitation. The non-\n     substantive portion of the proposal would make clear that \n     state party building funds are governed solely by state law.\n       A provision allowing the national parties to spend their \n     excess soft money on buildings was included in the House bill \n     that went to the floor. It was vigorously attacked by the \n     Republican leadership in the House, which claimed that it was \n     a special advantage for the DNC. The provision was stripped \n     from the bill by an amendment on the House floor that was \n     overwhelmingly supported by Republicans. The Senate bill \n     contained no special exemptions for national party buildings.\n       There is nothing in the House-passed bill that regulates \n     state party building funds. This concern can be addressed in \n     a floor colloquy, or a separate technical corrections bill if \n     there is one.\n       8. Ensure Unintended Litigation Does Not Result--This is a \n     substantive proposal that has two parts. The first part \n     suggests defining ``solicitation.'' Separately, the proposal \n     would eliminate the increase in the statute of limitations \n     from three to five years that was added to the bill by the \n     Thompson-Lieberman amendment.\n       Like many other terms in the bill, ``solicitation'' will be \n     subject to definition by the FEC in regulations. A statutory \n     definition could also be included in a separate technical \n     corrections bill if there is one and if agreement on the \n     definition of the term can be reached.\n       The increase in the statute of limitations from three to \n     five years resulted from Senators Thompson and Lieberman's \n     concern that wrongdoing in the 1996 election was not being \n     effectively pursued by the Justice Department. A five year \n     statute of limitations is common in the federal criminal law. \n     Both the House and Senate bills lengthened the statute of \n     limitations and did not contain a definition of solicitation. \n     No question about either of these issues was raised during \n     floor consideration in either body.\n       9. Coordination--This is a substantive proposal. The \n     proposal claims to offer ``modest changes'', but in fact \n     would make significant changes to coordination language that \n     was passed by the Senate, and included in the House bill.\n       Contrary to the proposal's claim, the bill does not provide \n     a new definition of ``coordination.'' The bill repeals \n     recently adopted FEC regulations on coordination and directs \n     the FEC to issue new regulations. It requires the FEC to \n     address certain topics in the rulemaking, but does not \n     dictate what the FEC should decide. The bill also specifies \n     that ``agreement'' or ``formal collaboration'' are not \n     required for coordination to exist.\n       This direction is given because the current regulations \n     allow blatant coordination to occur between candidates and \n     outside groups in issue ads and other campaign-related \n     activities simply by never entering into an ``agreement'' or \n     ``formal collaboration.''\n       Contrary to the suggestion in the proposal, nothing in the \n     bill even remotely suggests that a candidate's raising money \n     for a group would alone trigger a finding that the group's \n     spending on voter registration activity is coordinated with \n     the candidate.\n       10. Effect on State Candidates--The proposal suggests a \n     non-substantive, but unnecessary change. The proposal seeks \n     to clarify that state candidates may ``align themselves'' \n     with federal candidates in their solicitations and campaign \n     activities, including advertisements.\n       The bill already permits state candidates to publicize \n     endorsements from federal candidates or align themselves with \n     a federal candidate's views. However, the bill prohibits \n     state candidates from spending soft money to promote or \n     attack federal candidates through general public political \n     advertising.\n       11. Time Limit For Expedited Judicial Review--The proposal \n     seeks to limit the expedited judicial review provision of the \n     bill to suits brought shortly after enactment.\n       The expedited review provisions in the Senate and House-\n     passed bills were not limited in this way. The expedited \n     review provisions assure that decisions that could affect \n     ongoing campaigns will be made promptly. These provisions \n     will be useful even years after enactment.\n       By requiring all suits challenging the constitutionality of \n     the bill to be brought in the District of Columbia, the bill \n     avoids the conflicts between the circuit courts that have \n     created uncertainty in current law. The provision also \n     requires these cases to be heard by three-judge panels. Given \n     the importance of the election law to campaigns, there is no \n     reason to force suits to be brought within a specific time \n     period after enactment in order to qualify for expedited \n     treatment. The Supreme Court can summarily affirm the lower \n     court's decision if it chooses, so this provision need not be \n     a burden on the Court's docket.\n       If agreement can be reached on revised judicial review \n     procedures, it can be included in a technical corrections \n     bill if there is one.\n       12. Court Challenges--The proposal would give Members of \n     Congress a statutory right to challenge the campaign finance \n     reform law directly.\n       The existing intervention provisions of the bill give \n     Members of Congress on both sides of the issue the ability to \n     participate equally in litigation concerning the \n     constitutionality of the Act. Members of Congress may already \n     have standing to challenge the Act in court, and Congress \n     cannot grant constitutional standing where it does not \n     already exist. Issues relating to standing by members could \n     be addressed in a separate technical corrections bill if \n     there is one, as long as members on both sides of the issue \n     are treated similarly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/05/senate-section/article/S1530-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1530-S1533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NATIONAL LABORATORIES PARTNERSHIP IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2002--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, when the Senator from Montana referred to \nme as a producer, he was referring to the State of Oklahoma which is a \nproduction State. I don't think inadvertently he also referred to me as \na producer. And I was.\n  I started out at the age of 17 in the oil fields. At that time, I was \na tool dresser. Not many people know what a cable tool rig is. I was a \ntool dresser on a cable tool rig. There is no harder work in the world \nthan being a tool dresser on a cable tool rig. That was before \nrotaries. Mostly, they were marginal wells--shallow wells.\n  Mr. BURNS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Certainly.\n  Mr. BURNS. The Senator must have been pretty good at it. He still has \nall of his fingers and thumbs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest to the Senator that he is one of the few \nSenators who know what I am talking about. When you picked up a cable \ntool--it\n\n[[Page S1531]]\n\nweighed several hundred pounds--if you did not open up your hands in \ntime, it went right down in there. I have a lot of friends who can't \nplay the guitar anymore.\n  Frankly, I almost ended up in this business. It is a very admirable \nbusiness. When we talk about economic development and economic \nstimulus, I think often about the oil fields in Oklahoma. I was a very \nyoung child at that time. We are talking about 50 years ago. I remember \ngoing to get lunch. You had to stand in line and wait to pay your \nticket. That was back in the days when we really had economic stimulus. \nIt came from this energy. That is something we don't talk about very \nmuch, but it is a very real thing, and it is particularly real when you \npersonally experience it.\n  But I have to say that my major concern right now with our energy \ncrisis with which we are faced--and it is a crisis--is how it affects \nour ability to defend America. I spent about 4 years chairing the Armed \nServices Subcommittee on Readiness. I am now ranking member. I see what \nour readiness problems are and what our military problems are as they \nrelate to our dependency on foreign countries for our ability to fight \na war. Several Members mentioned--including the Senator from Montana--\nthat our dependency is directly related to our ability to be \nindependent and to be strong. If we are dependent on Iraq for our \nability to fight a war against Iraq, that is a crisis. That is a \nsituation we are in right now. We are dependent upon foreign countries \nfor our ability to fight a war.\n  But here are the facts. I think it is important that we talk about \nthis from a military perspective.\n  First of all, the military is as dependent on foreign oil as the \ngeneral public is. It takes eight times as much oil to meet the needs \nfor each U.S. soldier as it did during World War II. In addition to \nthat, the Department of Defense accounts for 80 percent of all \nGovernment energy use.\n  For all practical purposes, we are talking about the defense \nramifications of this use. It is not like it was in World War II. Now \nit takes eight times as much oil. It is a very serious problem.\n  Iraq is the fastest growing contributor to our dependency. People do \nnot understand that. They say: Wait a minute. Aren't we at war with \nIraq? I guess by some definition you would have to say we are. They are \nshooting down our UAVs that are flying over some of the zones trying to \nprotect us, as is required by U.N. resolution. Yet Iraq is the fastest \ngrowing source for United States oil imports. Shockingly, in the \nyear 2000, $5 billion of American money went to Iraq to buy oil.\n\n  There is a lot of talk about sanctions. I am a believer in sanctions, \nif sanctions are going to really accomplish something. But how can we \nhave sanctions against a country when we are paying them $5 billion in \nAmerica money to buy the oil, particularly when that is used to defend \nAmerica?\n  America's energy consumption is on the rise, but we are producing \nless domestic oil than at any time since World War II. Our dependency \non foreign oil has dramatically increased since 1973, and it is \nprojected to continue to increase--currently, about 60 percent. You \nhear 57 percent. You can justify some 60 percent, depending on how you \ncalculate it. Sixty percent of U.S. oil needs are met by foreign \nsources.\n  In the mid-1980s, I traveled around the country with Don Hodel. Don \nHodel was Secretary of the Interior. He was also Secretary of Energy. \nThis was back during the Reagan administration. At that time, we were \nabout 38 percent dependent on foreign countries for our oil. Don Hodel \nand I went to States that are consumption States and not production \nStates, and explained to them that our dependency on foreign countries \nfor our ability to fight a war was a national security issue--not an \nenergy issue. In fact, we had a little dog-and-pony show. We would go \nback to, and including, the First World War. And every war since then \nhas been won by the country that had control of the energy supply. You \ncan't name one country that wasn't.\n  There were a lot of people who listened to us. We were in Illinois, \nin New York, in New Jersey, and in different States, trying to tell \nthat story. It didn't sell too well then.\n  After the Persian Gulf war, people started listening and realizing \nthat there is a relationship between our ability to be energy \nsufficient and the danger that we are facing.\n  In both 1995 and 1999, the Secretary of Commerce acknowledged, \npursuant to a law requiring his assessment, that our oil dependency \nposes a threat to our national security. Keep in mind, this is before \nSeptember 11. Additionally, in January of 1998, I elicited virtual \nconsensus from all members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that energy \nsecurity was a too-often overlooked aspect of our national security \nneeds.\n  After September 11, Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz said \nthat U.S. dependency on foreign oil--now, this happened in a public \nhearing where we were; and I asked him the question about how it \nrelates to our national security--he said that U.S. dependency on \nforeign oil ``is a serious strategic issue . . . My sense is that [our] \ndependency is projected to grow, not to decline . . . it's not only \nthat we would, in a sense, be dependent on Iraqi oil, but the oil as a \nweapon. The possibility of taking that oil off the market and doing \nenormous economic damage with it is a serious problem.''\n  That is the Deputy Secretary of Defense, Paul Wolfowitz.\n  The President made energy a top national priority. He said it over \nand over again. Sometimes I wonder if people are listening. In an \noverwhelmingly bipartisan manner, the House of Representatives adopted \na comprehensive energy policy which includes provisions to modernize \nconservation and infrastructure, increase domestic energy supplies, and \naccelerate the protection of the environment.\n  But that is not all that H.R. 4 has. H.R. 4 is a comprehensive \napproach to meet our energy needs. We have nuclear in there; we have \noil and gas production. Let's just take the marginal production I have \nbeen concerned about, because my State happens to be a major producer, \nor they used to be, of marginal wells.\n  A marginal well is a well that produces 15 barrels of oil or less a \nday. If we had all the oil that would have come from margin wells that \nhave been plugged in the last 10 years flowing again today, it would \nproduce more oil than we are currently importing from Saudi Arabia. \nThat is a huge source. That is part of H.R. 4.\n  H.R. 4 also has renewables in it. People are talking about \nrenewables. It has nuclear. Right now, to meet our energy needs to \nlight our lights in America, we are only 20 percent dependent on \nnuclear energy. France is 80 percent dependent. Those very people who \nwere marching and protesting back in the 1970s against nuclear plants \nnow realize, after all the ambient air problems that have been coming \nup, that nuclear energy is among the safest, the cheapest, and the most \nabundant energy available, yet we are not using it.\n  That is why I offered the energy bill as an amendment to last year's \nDefense authorization bill. Here I am on the Armed Services Committee. \nI had chaired the Subcommittee on Readiness. I offered the energy bill \nto the Defense authorization bill so people would somehow reprogram \ntheir thinking and realize we were talking about a defense issue. We \nare talking about a national security issue when we talk about our \nenergy dependence. So I offered it, and I was glad I did.\n  We, of course, are addressing energy legislation today. I am really \nhighly troubled by the bizarre legislative path that this legislation \nhas traveled. I know we have talked about this quite a bit. I hope the \nmajority leader will allow fair up-and-down votes on issues such as \nANWR. We need to vote on it.\n  I wish it were required for everyone who is going to be voting on \nANWR to take a trip up to the north slopes of Alaska to see what we are \nreally talking about. It is not a pristine wilderness. We are only \ntalking about a very small, a minuscule part of that area up there, and \nwe are talking about an environment where the Eskimos, the local \npeople, are begging us to come in and open it up.\n\n  So we do not need just any bill; the Senate owes our country a strong \nenergy bill, which should include hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic \nfracturing is a system where water is forced in, in order to be able to \nproduce the oil.\n\n[[Page S1532]]\n\n Some 80 percent of the wells now use hydraulic fracturing. In the last \n15 years, we have had 100,000 wells that have used that process. There \nhas never been any environmental problem with it.\n  Since 1940, when we started this process, there have been over 1 \nmillion wells that have used hydraulic fracturing. But some court came \nalong and said they were going to have to look at the environmental \nconcerns that go along with hydraulic fracturing. Wait a minute. If we \nhave done a million wells, as we have, using that process, and there \nhas never been a problem, why are we concerned about it?\n  We need to have a strong energy bill that has the tax incentives for \ndomestic oil production. I have talked about that. We have a tremendous \nopportunity there. But, you see, you cannot go after marginal wells \nbecause it costs 10 times as much to lift a barrel of oil that way than \nit does in Saudi Arabia. So you have to have some type of protection in \nthere so that a person who is making an investment in a well today--\nrecognizing they are not going to have any production out of that well \nfor a couple years--how do they know what the price is going to be when \nit escalates from $8 a barrel to $40 a barrel, and then goes back to $8 \na barrel? There is no way they can afford to take that kind of a risk. \nCertainly, the Presiding Officer is someone who has been in the \nbusiness world, and he understands that. You have to have an idea of \nwhat kind of investment return is going to be out there. H.R. 4 has \nthat in it. We need to have that in our bill. It said, if the price \ngoes down, and it starts going below $17 a barrel, as it approaches $14 \na barrel, tax credits set in, so they know it is not going to go below \nthat. It is a way of getting another large block of oil domestically.\n  Corporate average fuel economy, the CAFE standards, while every \nsingle Senator has sworn an oath to uphold a government of the people, \nby the people, and for the people, some in this body seek to thwart the \nwill of the people who drive vehicles and who express their will every \nday when they purchase vehicles at auto dealerships. It is called \nchoice. This is America. We are supposed to have freedom of choice.\n  In greater numbers than ever before, all across this country, and \nparticularly in my State of Oklahoma, Americans are purchasing \nminivans, sport utility vehicles, light trucks, and roomy cars for \ntheir safety, comfort, and utility.\n  I strongly support Americans' safety and ability to select whatever \nvehicle we deem fit for our purposes. We are not ``one size fits all.'' \nWe are different people. I have 4 children and 11 grandchildren. I \nsuggest to the Senator from Ohio, you try putting them in a compact \ncar. They just don't fit. Our needs are different.\n  I think the bill should exclude renewable portfolio standards, RPS. \nThe left again seeks to encroach upon the free market and the business \nof America through attempts to limit the use of coal, oil, natural gas, \nhydroelectric, and nuclear energy in an era when America is trying to \nward off energy crises. We need all of the above. All of those things \nshould be a part of this bill. But by shrinking the allowable \npercentage of power coming from these sources, we hamstring our ability \nto deliver needed energy and we weaken our Nation.\n  Price-Anderson. This is going to be controversial. It should not be \ncontroversial. This is a way that will allow us to get and expand into \nnuclear energy. Currently, 103 U.S. nuclear units supply about 20 \npercent of the electricity produced in the United States. Going forward \ninto the future, nuclear energy must be a key component of any national \nenergy plan. As ranking member of the subcommittee of jurisdiction, I \nbelieve the first step in that direction must be the reauthorization of \nPrice-Anderson.\n  Finally, I would like to address the impact of overly burdensome \nregulations on our energy supply. In a recent report entitled ``U.S. \nDownstream: The EPA Takes Another Bite Out of America's Fuel Supply,'' \nMerrill Lynch concluded that EPA's clean air regulations ``will clearly \nhave the impact of reducing existing U.S. refining capacity.'' In other \nwords, the United States will have a greater dependency on foreign \nrefineries.\n  When the price of gasoline goes through the roof, we all witness the \nincredibly irresponsible accusations that big oil companies ``were \ncolluding.'' Price spikes occurred last summer because of the large \nnumber of poorly implemented environmental regulations. I have sat on \nthat committee for 8 years now. We are at virtually 100 percent \nrefinery capacity in this country. We started having new start reviews. \nWe started having more and more regulations that really have nothing to \ndo with the environment, and then we wonder why the price of fuel goes \nup.\n  It is supply and demand. We should know something about that in this \ncountry. When we are at 100 percent, we have more regulations that cost \nmore money, and then some of the refineries leave and go down to \nMexico. Then we can't even meet the current needs. What is going to \nhappen? The price is going to go up.\n  The solution to high prices is not found in cheap political gimmicks \nsuch as releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Rather, the \nsolution relies on a national energy policy and having a highly \neffective and streamlined environmental regulation.\n  This is not a partisan notion. Going all the way back to the Carter \nadministration, I tried to get them to have a national energy policy. \nThen Reagan came along. I thought we could get it in a Republican \nadministration. I tried to get the Reagan administration to do it. They \nwouldn't do it. I tried along with Don Hodel, who worked in the Reagan \nadministration. Then along came George the 1st from the oil patch. I \nthought, surely we will have a national energy policy at this time. He \ndidn't have one. Of course, we haven't had one since.\n  We have that opportunity now. This President is committed to having a \nnational energy policy.\n  When well thought out and reflecting consensus, environmental \nregulations can certainly provide benefits to the American people. But \nwhen regulations are rushed into effect without adequate thought, they \nare going to do more harm than good.\n  I see the Senator from Ohio in the Chamber. I remember before he was \nin the Senate, I held a hearing in the State of Ohio on new source \nreview. We had testimony from refiners that replacing a 12-inch pipe \ntriggered a new source review which cost millions of dollars in that \ncase.\n  As a Senator and a grandfather, I want to ensure the cleanest \nenvironment in our Nation. However, I am convinced that environmental \nregulations can be harmonized with energy policy. Our current situation \ndemands it.\n  I know that the extremist environmental community opposes any of the \nprovisions and reforms which I have discussed. However, the \nenvironmental community does not have to answer to the American people \nwhen energy prices go through the roof. Nor does the environmental \ncommunity have to worry about the national security implications of \ngreater dependency on foreign oil.\n  My major concern, the reason I put this on H.R. 4 as an amendment to \nthe defense authorization bill, is because I can't think of any single \nthing that plays a greater role in our future national security than \nbecoming energy independent. Again, it is ludicrous that we should have \nto be dependent upon Iraq oil to fight a war against Iraq. It doesn't \nmake sense. It is time we start making some sense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, as we begin debate on comprehensive energy \nlegislation, it is important to remember that a diversity of energy \nconcerns has brought us to this point. Because current energy supplies \nare relatively high and gasoline prices are relatively low, there are \nthose that may want to postpone the difficult decisions required by \ncomprehensive action. I rise today to remind my colleagues of our \nenergy history and that, to avoid repeating the energy crises of the \npast, we need to act now.\n  A quick review of just the last four years reveals the breadth of the \nenergy issues that we must address. At the end of 1998, oil prices were \nso low they threatened the viability of the domestic oil industry; in \nthe spring of 1999, they soared to record levels. Severe weather and \ntransportation problems\n\n[[Page S1533]]\n\ncombined to create a home heating oil crisis in the Northeast the \nfollowing winter. At the start of the summer of 2000, people in the \nMidwest were paying record prices for petroleum products. Later that \nsummer, a decaying gas pipeline in New Mexico exploded, killing an \nentire family.\n  The winter of 2000 brought new challenges. Consumers were paying an \naverage 30 percent more to heat their homes than they had the previous \nyear. The summer of 2001 saw the collapse of the California electricity \nmarket, with blackouts and previously unthinkable electricity prices. \nLast fall, we began a war against terror that may impact our supplies \nof oil from the Middle East.\n  Energy policy is about more than the price of gasoline at the pump \ntoday. A comprehensive energy policy will require thoughtful, and often \ndifficult, choices today to ensure secure, affordable and sustainable \nenergy in the future. The bill before us addresses many of these \nchoices. It aims to secure new, as well as traditional, energy \nsupplies; promote investment in critical infrastructure; expand \ntechnology options; reduce energy use and promote energy markets that \nprotect consumers and the environment.\n  I would like to highlight just a few of the provisions in this bill \nthat I believe advance these objectives. Many of these are items that I \nworked with Chairman Bingaman to have included in this bill and I thank \nhim for his assistance and support.\n  First, among the bill's efforts to increase our short-term energy \nsecurity, is a provision that Senator Landrieu and I developed \ndirecting that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve be filled to capacity. \nIt also requires a review to determine whether the size of the Reserve \nand our capacity for refining and transporting the Reserve oil are \nadequate to respond to a severe supply disruption. The bill also moves \nthe Nation toward greater long-term security by providing incentives \nfor development of Alaska's natural gas resources. Other provisions to \nexpand the use of renewable fuels for transportation will ease both \nshort- and long-term supply uncertainties, while reducing the \nenvironmental costs of petroleum.\n  The energy bill also acknowledges the critical role that innovation \nand technology deployment will play in our long-term energy strategy. \nThe bill expands energy research and development in traditional as well \nas alternative energy. This bill also calls for the Department of \nEnergy to identify ways to accelerate innovation and reduce barriers to \ntechnology development.\n  The tax provisions of the bill, which I understand will be added at a \nlater date, also aim to balance incentives for increasing conventional \nand alternative energy supplies, including credits for marginal oil \nwell production, clean coal technology and renewable energy production. \nIn addition to supply incentives, the package contains provisions to \naddress energy demand, including credits for efficient cars, homes and \nappliances which will help to reduce energy use while promoting \ntechnology development.\n  Another way that I believe that the Federal Government can play a \nsignificant role in promoting efficient technologies is by using its \nown purchasing power. Last year, I introduced a bill, S. 1358, to \nprovide resources and enhance accountability for the Federal \nGovernment's efforts to improve its own efficiency and reduce its \nenergy use. The bill would establish energy reduction goals and \nperformance standards for Federal buildings and fleets; ensure that \nFederal procurement policies promote purchases of the most efficient \nequipment and supplies and create a Federal revolving fund, or ``energy \nbank'' to help agencies finance efficiency improvements. Many of these \ninitiatives have been incorporated into the bill before us; I believe \nthey will reduce the Federal energy bill and build the market for \nefficiency technologies.\n  Another area in which the bill provides assistance for advanced \nenergy technologies is a voluntary demonstration program, which I also \nsupported, to help schools and communities secure newer school buses \nthat use clean diesel and natural gas technology. A growing market will \nhelp to bring down the cost of these new technologies and let \ncommunities reap the air quality benefits in the process.\n  The bill also recognizes the requirements of new energy markets. For \ninstance, S. 517 replaces the archaic Public Utility Holding Company \nAct of 1935 with regulatory and oversight mechanisms that protect the \nconsumer in the modern marketplace and promote investment in the energy \nsector. It also acknowledges that effective energy planning must occur \nacross State lines and provides for regional energy coordination \nwithout undermining States' authority.\n  These are just a few of the important ideas in the bill that deserve \nsupport; there are many more. There are also many difficult issues that \nwill need to be resolved. We will not all be able to agree on every \nprovision in this bill, but it is critical that we work across party \nand regional lines to find compromise where we can and move forward \nwith a comprehensive policy. The alternative is to persist in our \nnational amnesia about our energy problems, ensuring that the spiking \nprices, infrastructure failures and energy insecurity of the past \nbecome part of our future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/05/senate-section/article/S1533-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1533]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, on February 1, 2002, the World Trade \nOrganization adopted a report by its Appellate Body that concluded that \na U.S. law known as Section 211 violates U.S. obligations to protect \nand enforce intellectual property rights under the Agreement on Trade \nRelated Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, TRIPS. The WTO urged \nthe United States to take the necessary steps to bring the United \nStates into compliance with its international obligations. This \ndecision provides Congress with an opportunity--a chance to reaffirm \nour commitment to the protection of intellectual property rights by \nrepealing Section 211 in its entirety.\n  Section 211 is a special interest provision that was added into the \nFY 1999 Omnibus Appropriations Act at the behest of Bacardi, Ltd., a \nBermuda-based corporation, just prior to enactment. It was not \nconsidered in conference, in any committee, or on the floor of either \nHouse of Congress. This ill-conceived provision triggered the WTO \ncomplaint against the United States and has undermined U.S. leadership \nin promoting strong protection for intellectual property rights in the \nglobal marketplace.\n  The Appellate Body concluded that key provisions of Section 211 \nviolate two fundamental principles of WTO rules--national treatment and \nmost-favored-nation treatment--which prohibit WTO members from \ndiscriminating against intellectual property right holders based on \nnationality. For over 100 years, these principles have obligated our \ntrading partners to protect U.S. trademark and trade name holders from \ndiscrimination abroad. The Appellate Body found, however, that Section \n211 violated these longstanding U.S. obligations by imposing obstacles \non foreign intellectual property right holders that do not exist for \nU.S. and other nationals.\n  The United States cannot appeal the Appellate Body's conclusion that \nSection 211 clearly violates WTO rules. Following last week's formal \nadoption of the Appellate Body report by the WTO's Dispute Settlement \nBody, the United States has only a short time to correct its violations \nand come into compliance with WTO rules. If the United States fails to \ndo so, it will have to offer compensation or face possible retaliatory \nmeasures against U.S. intellectual property right holders and other \ntrade interests.\n  Even more troubling than the threat of retaliation, however, is the \nfact that Section 211 and the Appellate Body decision may serve as a \nmodel for other countries that wish to make it more difficult for U.S. \nintellectual property holders to protect and enforce their rights \nabroad. While the Appellate Body concluded that Section 211 violates \nnational treatment and MFN, it let stand other U.S. arguments that \nsuggest that WTO members are free to deny protection to trademark right\n\n[[Page S1534]]\n\nholders on grounds other than those provided in the TRIPS Agreement and \nParis Convention. In other words, in order to defend Section 211 the \nU.S. argued that TRIPS is limited in its scope. These arguments were \nnot only contrary to long-established U.S. international intellectual \nproperty policy objectives; they could ultimately invite arbitrary \ntreatment and abuse of U.S. brand names overseas.\n  The only appropriate response to the WTO decision is to repeal \nSection 211 in its entirety. Repealing Section 211 will underscore that \nthe United States abides by its international commitments. It will \nsafeguard U.S. intellectual property rights in foreign markets, remove \nthe threat of retaliation against U.S. exports, and restore U.S. \nleadership in the fight to secure strong protection and enforcement for \nintellectual property rights worldwide.\n  I call on the administration to work with the Congress to quickly \nrepeal Section 211 in its entirety to restore the U.S. to its rightful \nplace as the world's guardian of intellectual property rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/05/senate-section/article/S1534-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2001\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Oregon.

Mr. President, today marks the one-year anniversary of \nthe tragic shooting at Santana High School in Santee, CA. This shooting \nclaimed the lives of two innocent teenagers: Brian Zuckor and Randy \nGordon, and sent an entire community into mourning.\n  The community of students, faculty, family and friends at Santana \nHigh School is still mourning. The healing process is difficult and \nlong, and I offer my thoughts, condolences, and support to the entire \ncommunity. I look with great respect at the way they have reacted to \nthis senseless act of violence; both immediately, in the aftermath of \nthe shootings, and in the year that has followed. Youth and adults \nalike have shown great compassion, strength and bravery in coping with \nthis tragic event.\n  To commemorate this one-year anniversary, the school held a ``Santana \nSafe School Tribute 5k Run/Walk'' on Saturday morning. Proceeds from \nthe walk will benefit the creation of Santana's Community/Family \nResource Center, a center aimed at providing youths the physical, \nemotional and intellectual support they need. In addition, Santana High \nSchool will have a day of private remembrance today, with a flag \nceremony in the main quad, a moment of silence, and a luncheon for the \nentire school community.\n  On this day, the anniversary of Santana High School's shooting, I \nonce again extend my support for the families and friends affected by \nthe tragedy. I offer special condolences and thoughts to the Zuckor and \nGordon families. I assure them that I continue to hold this incident \nclose to my heart as I fight to pass common sense gun legislation, put \npolice officers in schools, and keep our children and communities safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/05/senate-section/article/S1534-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           GOD BLESS THE USA\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

Mr. President, today I ask my fellow colleagues \nto join me in praising the entrepreneurial spirit of Mike ``Doc'' \nHoward of Lebanon, KY. Mr. Howard was recently named the Outstanding \nBusinessperson of 2001 by the Lebanon/Marion County Chamber of Commerce \nfor his progressive economic vision and innovative genius.\n  Doc Howard received his first lesson in economics from his Uncle \nHoward when he was just 12 years of age. Doc was put to work by his \nuncle at the Arista Theater, Lebanon Drive-In, and\n\n[[Page S1535]]\n\nlocal gas station, where he ran the projector, operated the grill, and \npumped the gas. At a young age, Doc Howard seemed to firmly grasp the \nsimple but often elusive concept of saving money in order to make \nmoney. This economic axiom has stuck with him ever since his days of \nflipping burgers and pumping gas.\n  In the early 1970s, Howard, with the help of several business \npartners, opened a printing business and so began his career as an \nentrepreneur for Marion County. Since then, Doc has been fiscally \ninvolved in all of the following industries: entertainment, carpentry, \nreal-estate, lumber, agriculture, produce, retail and restaurant. He \nhas owned drive-ins, built houses, sold houses, owned grocery stores \nand delis, and even found time to become a farmer. Currently, Doc is \nattempting to build on his previous successes and bring even greater \neconomic opportunities to the residents of Marion County. He recently \nbought the Lincoln Heritage Shopping Center, which now includes Sears, \nDollar General, Central Kentucky Staffing, an Italian restaurant, a \nphysical therapist, and a tobacco store. The people of Marion County \nwill definitely benefit from these quality additions. Since the early \n1970s, Doc Howard has diligently committed his efforts to making \nLebanon/Marion County a more attractive place to do business. He \ndeserves our praise for being a pillar of capitalism.\n  I congratulate Mr. Howard on his award and thank him for investing \nhis time and money into the future of Marion County.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/05/senate-section/article/S1535-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO NEW NATIONAL FARMERS UNION PRESIDENT DAVE FREDERICKSON\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate Dave \nFrederickson as the recently elected National Farmers Union, NFU, \npresident. During the National Farmers Union 100th anniversary \nconvention, delegates chose a true leader for their future in Mr. \nFrederickson. Family farmers and ranchers across America can rest \nassured that Dave will continue his commitment to them in his new role.\n  Dave brings 11 years of experience as the Minnesota Farmers Union, \nMFU, president to his new post. Not only is Dave committed to sustain \nfamily farmers and ranchers, he also holds the education of youth to a \nhigh standard. After graduating from St. Cloud State University with a \ndegree in education, Dave spent 8 years teaching special education \nchildren. The Farmers Union philosophy regards education as one of \ntheir three most important principles. Having a leader with Dave's \nbackground and experience, the national organization is sure to \ncontinue its legacy of teaching our youth.\n  From 1986 to 1992, Dave served as a State senator in the Minnesota \nlegislature. During this period, he served on a number of committees, \nincluding the rural development committee, the education committee, and \nthe governmental operations committee. Because of Dave's commitment to \nrural development and legislation that he supported, the ethanol \nindustry has become a primary rural development tool in Minnesota. Dave \ncontinued his commitment to rebuilding and strengthening rural \ncommunities while president of MFU. The experience that he brings to \nthe table can only ensure that one of the most effective general farm \norganizations in America is in good hands.\n  Dave has made his first priority as president of NFU to see a good \nfarm bill passed out of conference committee. He said, ``Farmers Union \nhas worked hard throughout the House and Senate farm bill process, and \nwe have much more work ahead of us, let's go back to Washington and \nwork for a farm bill so that when you go back into your fields, you \nwill know what kind of support you have behind you.''\n  I look forward to working with Dave on issues that not only affect \nSouth Dakota, but the entire fabric of rural America. The members of \nFarmers Union elected a true public servant, a leader with integrity, \nvision, and commitment. Again, congratulations to Dave Frederickson on \nhis accomplishments of the past, and his commitment to the future of \nrural America in his new role as National Farmers Union \npresident.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/05/senate-section/article/S1535-2", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        THE DEATH OF LT. COL. HENRY ``HANK'' BARROWS, USAF, RET.\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a great \nAmerican patriot, Hank Barrows. Hank passed away unexpectedly on \nMonday, February 11 at his home in Washington, DC. My deepest \nsympathies go out to his wife, Suzanne, and his sons, Geoffrey and \nBrian.\n  Born in Bremerhaven, Germany on September 9, 1946, Hank emigrated \nwith his family to the United States in 1960, settling in Westfield, \nNJ. Following his graduation from Westfields High School, Hank was \naccepted by Rutgers University, where he graduated in 1964 with a \nbachelors of arts degree in German.\n  Trained as a navigator following his graduation from Air Force \nOfficers Candidate School, OCS, in 1969, Hank served two tours in \nVietnam. In his first tour, Hank served as a EWO on a C-130 gunship and \nthe second as a B-52 EWO during the Linebacker II Operations over North \nVietnam. It was on December 19, 1972, during one of the Linebacker \nmissions, that Hank was shot down and taken prisoner by the North \nVietnamese. Hank was held prisoner in the infamous ``Hanoi Hilton'' \nuntil his release on March 29, 1973. After being released by the \nVietnamese, he was assigned to the 343rd Strategic Reconnaissance \nSquadron at Offutt Air Force Base as an Electronic Intelligence \nintercept officer on the RC-135s.\n  His next assignment was to the 7575 Operations Group Operating \nLocation A Support Squadron stationed at Rhein Main Air Force Base, \nFrankfurt, Germany flying in and out of Berlin as part of the freedom \nof the corridors mission. In recognition of his superior performance \nand expertise, Hank was reassigned in 1979 to United States Air Force-\nEurope, USAFE, headquarters in the office that managed airborne \noperations.\n  Hank returned to the U.S. in 1982 working in the Air Staff \nIntelligence Directorate in the Pentagon. He spent the last seven years \nof his distinguished Air Force career in the Defense Support Project \nOffice. He finished that assignment as the Deputy Director for Airborne \nReconnaissance.\n  Upon his retirement in 1992, Hank joined MRJ as a key member of the \nMariner Support team. As a result of his superior performance on that \nteam, he became the program manager for the Defense Airborne \nReconnaissance Office, DARO, support contract. Having successfully \nmanaged that contract, Hank was promoted to the position of Division \nManager. After the reorganization of MRJ, Hank was put in charge of the \nDevelopment Systems Division, which later became the Development \nSystems Group when Veridian acquired MRJ. Hank's group consistently \nexceed their business goals each year.\n  In 2000, Hank received the Veridian Leadership Award. In nominating \nHank for this award, he was cited for ``. . . accepting and tackling \ndifficult and challenging business opportunities, his unique talent, \nhis contagious enthusiasm and a belief that winning is for those \nwilling to give their best.'' He was also cited for his ``. . . knack \nof finding and recruiting the best-qualified people for the planned \ngrowth of his division.'' In addition, he was recognized for ensuring \nthat his team was kept well-informed, equipped with the right tools to \ndo their jobs, and encouraging each individual to inject initiative and \npromote professional growth while increasing customer support.\n  Hank will be remembered in many ways by those who came to know him. \nWe will remember Hank as an exemplary role model with vision, passion, \nand loyalty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/05/senate-section/article/S1535-3", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NOMINATIONS DISCHARGED\n\n  The following nominations were discharged from the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pension pursuant to the order of March 5, \n2002:\n\n\n           national foundation on the arts and the humanities\n\n       Don V.

A bill to allow Federal securities enforcement actions to be \npredicated on State securities enforcement actions, to prevent \nmigration of rogue securities brokers between and among financial \nservices industries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Microcap Fraud \nPrevention Act of 2001. This bill will close loopholes in the \nenforcement of our securities laws and furnish Federal authorities with \nthe tools they need to combat growing fraud in the microcap securities \nmarket. While the Enron debacle has focused attention on the need for \ntougher and fuller financial disclosure standards to protect small \ninvestors, microcap fraud costs investors an estimated $6 billion every \nyear.\n  I first introduced this bill in the 106th Congress after extensive \nexamination by the Senate's Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, \nwhich I chaired. I am pleased that the North American Securities \nAdministrators Association, which is made up of our Nation's State \nsecurities regulators, has once again sent me a letter of strong \nsupport and has made passage of legislation such as this one of its top \nlegislative priorities.\n  Today's securities markets are much different than they were even a \ndecade ago. Many more people own securities than ever before. The rise \nof the Internet has allowed investors greater access to market \ninformation and investment advice. Unfortunately, not all of this \ninformation and advice has been sound, or even honest.\n  These problems are exacerbated in the microcap market. Microcap \nstocks are those of smaller, thinly capitalized companies. Because the \nindividual share prices may be higher than a certain threshold, \nhowever, they may avoid regulation as ``penny stocks.'' Because \ninvestors typically know little of these companies, their share prices \nare easier to manipulate due to the small amount of total capital. They \nare often less regulated than the securities of larger companies and, \ntherefore, they can pose difficult challenges for law enforcement and \nunique opportunities for dishonest brokers.\n  It is this combination of a microcap company's low capitalization, \nmaking its share price more easily manipulable, and obscurity, along \nwith high-pressure sales tactics, that make microcap stocks so \nappealing to the more dishonest elements in our securities markets.\n  Frequently, salesmen will call customers, pitching these \ninvestments with high pressure sales tactics. More sophisticated scams \ninvolve a practice known as the ``pump and dump'' where a securities \nfirm that has purchased a large block of a microcap company's stock \nwill market it aggressively and quickly to investors. As a result of \nthe surge in demand, the share's price will rise sharply but \ntemporarily, despite the unchanged fundamentals underlying the stock's \nprice.\n\n  After a short time, investors will realize that the company's \nperformance does not merit its new share price. The stock's share price \nwill then plummet, but the firm will by then have unloaded its shares, \nleaving investors holding the bag. In other cases, however, dishonest \nbrokers and firms simply fail to execute sales orders or otherwise \ncommit garden variety theft masquerading as securities transactions, \nsuch as churning or making unsuitable recommendations.\n  States prosecute these criminals activities with some success and \noften obtain orders prohibiting further securities activities by bad \nactors within their jurisdiction. Because such an order ends at a \nState's borders, however, the defendants can simply pick up, move to a \nnew State, and begin their schemes anew. In contrast, a Federal order \nwould have effect nationwide. Because Federal law enforcement resources \nare limited, however, there is only so much it can do, and many smaller \ntime criminals can continue to operate below the federal government's \nradar screen. My bill would institute several reforms to address these \nproblems.\n  First, it would allow the SEC to take enforcement actions against \nbrokers and firms on the basis of those already concluded by state \nagencies. Although States may base their actions on Federal actions, \nthe reverse is not true. As a result, the SEC must duplicate the \nState's efforts to provide nationwide protection to investors. By \nallowing the SEC to base disciplinary actions on those concluded by \nstates, the State's disciplinary actions can be given effect \nnationwide, when appropriate, without the SEC's having to commit \nsignificant amounts of additional resources.\n  Second, the bill would allow the SEC to keep those who commit any \ntype of financial fraud from participating in the microcap market. \nCurrently, the SEC can ban those who commit securities violations. But \nthe SEC should have the poser to discipline those who commit other \ntypes of financial services offenses as well.\n  Third, this bill would broaden provisions designed to prevent fraud \nin the penny stock market. Under current law, the SEC can suspend or \nbar those who commit fraud in this market. However, brokers so barred \ncan turn around and commit the same types of offenses in the microcap \nmarket because their individual share prices might exceed $5 per share, \neven though the total capitalization amount is small enough to lend \nitself to easy manipulation. The penny stock market ban needs to be \nexpanded to the microcap market as well.\n  Fourth, the statutory officer and director bar would be expanded to \ncover all publicly traded companies. Currently, this bar only applies \nto companies that report to the SEC, leaving open the possibility that \nthose who have been barred from serving in these companies could serve \nin others that are exempt from reporting. Companies involved in \nmicrocap schemes are frequently traded over the counter and are not \ncovered by the bar. Under my bill, this bar would extend to all \npublicly traded companies.\n  Finally, the bill would allow the SEC to enforce its own orders and \ncourt injunctions against repeat offenders directly rather than waiting \nfor the Justice Department to initiate contempt proceedings. Instead \nthe SEC would be able to seek immediate civil penalties for repeat \nviolations without the delay that can occur from the initiation of \ncontempt proceedings.\n  These are common sense, measured steps that can make a real \ndifference in the level of protection that we provide to investors, \nmany of whom are new to our capital markets. I would urge the Senate to \nconsider and pass the\n\n[[Page S1538]]\n\nMicrocap Fraud Prevention Act quickly. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the letter of support from the NASAA be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                                        NASAA,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 15, 2001.\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the membership of North \n     American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. (NASAA), \n     I commend you for recognizing and confronting the problem of \n     fraud in the microcap securities market. We appreciate your \n     efforts to protect the investing public from frauds in low-\n     priced securities, and for your plans to introduce \n     legislation to enhance enforcement efforts in this area.\n       As you know, several years ago, state securities \n     administrators recognized the problem of fraud in the \n     microcap market. Since then the states have led enforcement \n     efforts and filed numerous actions against microcap firms. \n     There are systematic problems in this area, but they can be \n     addressed effectively if state and federal regulators and \n     policymakers work together on meaningful solutions.\n       NASAA wholeheartedly supports the intent of The Microcap \n     Fraud Prevention Act of 2001. It would be an important step \n     in combating abuses in the microcap market and maintaining \n     continued public confidence in our markets.\n       We applaud your leadership in the fight against microcap \n     fraud, and I pledge the support of NASAA's membership to \n     continue to work with you to secure passage of this important \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               Joseph P. Borg,\n\n                                      Alabama Securities Director,\n                                                  NASAA President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Roberts):\n  S. 1986. A bill to amend the Intermodal Surface Transportation \nEfficiency Act of 1991 to identify a route that passes through the \nStates of Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Kansas as a high priority \ncorridor on the National Highway System; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat will enhance the future economic vitality of communities in Otero, \nLincoln, Torrance, Guadalupe, and Quay Counties. By improving the \ntransportation infrastructure, I believe this legislation will help \nattract good jobs to South, Central, and Eastern New Mexico.\n  The bill we are introducing today designates U.S. Highway 54 from the \nborder with Mexico at El Paso, TX, through New Mexico, and Oklahoma to \nWichita, KS, as the Southwest Passage Initiative for the Regional and \nInterstate Transportation, or the Southwest Passage, corridor. Congress \nhas already included Highway 54 as part of the National Highway System. \nThe bill designates the Southwest Passage as a High Priority Corridor \non the National Highway System.\n  I am honored to have my good friend and colleague, Senator Roberts, \nas a cosponsor of the bill. Our goal with this designation is to \npromote the development of this 700-mile route into a full four-lane \ndivided highway. About half of the SPIRIT corridor is in New Mexico and \nanother 200 miles of it are in Kansas.\n  I continue to believe strongly in the importance of highway \ninfrastructure for economic development in my state. Even in this age \nof the new economy and high-speed digital communications, roads \ncontinue to link our communities together and to carry the commercial \ngoods and products our citizens need. Safe and efficient highways are \nespecially important to citizens in the rural parts of New Mexico.\n  It is well known that regions with four-lane highways more readily \nattract out-of-state visitors and new jobs. Truck drivers and the \ntraveling public prefer the safety of a four-lane divided highway.\n  In New Mexico, US 54 is a fairly level route, bypassing New Mexico's \nmajor mountain ranges. The route also traverses some of New Mexico's \nmost dramatic scenery, including one of the State's popular designated \nScenic Byways. The Mesalands Scenic Byway is located in Guadalupe, San \nMiguel and Quay Counties, incorporating the beautiful tablelands known \nas El Llano Estacado. The SPIRIT corridor also passes through \nAlamogordo, home of the New Mexico Museum of Space History, and gateway \nto the stunning White Sands National Monument.\n  The route of the Southwest Passage starts at Juarez, Chihuahua, \nMexico, home of one the largest concentrations of manufacturing in the \nborder region. As a result of increased trade under NAFTA, commercial \nborder traffic is already increasing at the border crossings in El \nPaso, TX, and Santa Teresa, NM. In New Mexico, truck traffic from the \nborder has risen to over 1000 per day and is expected to triple in the \nnext twenty years. The SPIRIT corridor is perfectly situated to serve \ninternational trade and promote economic development along its entire \nroute. The route provides direct connections to four major Interstate \nHighways: I-10, I-35, I-40, and I-70. SPIRIT is also the shortest route \nbetween Chicago and El Paso, shaving 137 miles off the major \nalternative.\n  Though much of US 54 is currently only two lanes, traffic has been \nrising dramatically along the entire route since NAFTA was implemented. \nIn New Mexico, total daily traffic levels are nearing 10,000 and are \nprojected to rise to 30,000, with trucks making up 35 percent of the \ntotal. In Oklahoma, traffic levels are up to 6,500 per day, 40 percent \nof which are commercial trucks. These traffic statistics clearly \nreflect the SPIRIT corridor's attraction to commercial and passenger \ndrivers.\n  New Mexicans recognize the importance of efficient roads to economic \ndevelopment and safety. I have long supported my State's efforts to \ncomplete the four-lane upgrade of US 54. The State Highway and \nTransportation Department now rates the project a high priority for New \nMexico. The four-lane upgrade of the first 56-mile segment from the \nTexas border to Alamogordo is underway and will be completed in the \nnext year. Two more sections in New Mexico remain to be upgraded: 163 \nmiles from Tularosa, north through Carrizozo, Corona, and Vaughn to \nSanta Rosa and 50 miles from Tucumcari to the Texas border near Nara \nVista in Quay County. The cost to four-lane these two segments is \nestimated at $329 million and $85 million, respectively. I am committed \nto working to help secure the funding required to complete New Mexico's \nfour-lane upgrade as soon as possible. I am pleased the other States \nare also moving quickly to four-lane their portion of the route. I hope \ndesignating SPIRIT as a High Priority Corridor on the National Highway \nSystem will help spur the completion of this project.\n  Once the SPIRIT corridor is designated, New Mexico will have four \nhigh-priority corridors on the National Highway System. The other three \nare the Ports-to-Plains corridor, the Camino Real Corridor, and the \nEast West Transamerica Corridor. These four trade corridors, as well as \nour close proximity to the border, strongly underscore the vital role \nNew Mexico plays in our Nation's international transportation network.\n  The SPIRIT project has broad grassroots support. Most of the cities, \ncounties, and chambers of commerce all the way from Wichita to El Paso \nhave passed resolutions of support for the four-lane upgrade of US 54 \nalong the entire corridor.\n  I do believe the four-lane upgrade of Highway 54 is vital to the \ncontinued economic development for all of the communities along the \nSPIRIT corridor in New Mexico.\n  I again thank Senator Roberts for cosponsoring the bill, and I hope \nall Senators will join us in support of this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1986\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for reform of the Corps of Engineers, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Environmental and Public Works.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire. Mr. President, together with my friend \nfrom Arizona, Mr. McCain, and my friend from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, I \nam introducing the Corps of Engineers Modernization and Improvement Act \nof 2002. ``Corps Reform'', as it is frequently billed, has been the \nsubject of much heated debate over the last two years. In fact, the \nWater Resources Development Act of 2000 included a provision on \nindependent peer review, requested by Senator Feingold.\n  Since that time, it has become clear to me that we need to \naggressively address a broad range of issue endemic in the Corps. That \nis why I am before you today, introducing this bill. The Corps has been \nthe subject of ``the Fleecing of America'' too many times. My primary \ngoal is to ensure that Federal taxpayer dollars are spent wisely, on \nsound investments that are in the national interest. Our bill achieves \nthis goal by addressing the mammoth backlog of projects that plagues \nthe Corps; changing the cost-benefit ratio that a project must meet in \norder to be economically justified; updating of the Principles and \nGuidelines; instituting independent review of certain projects; \namending some of the cost-share requirements; and limiting the waivers \nof non-Federal cost-shares often granted to communities.\n  It has been projected that there is currently a construction backlog \nof well over $40 billion in authorized projects, with annual \nappropriations for the construction account of the civil works mission \naveraging around $1.8 billion. As such, the majority of the projects in \nthe backlog will never see a Federal dime. While a great number of \nthese projects are meritorious and deserve funding, others are not in \nthe Corps mission, are no longer economically justified, or violate \nnon-Federal cost-share requirements.\n  Our bill would require the Corps to provide a list of projects in the \nbacklog, categorizing each project as ``active,'' ``deferred,'' \n``inactive.'' There would be a deauthorization mechanism, more \nstringent than current law, for projects that have never received \nconstruction funds, for projects that have been suspended, and for \nthose that don't pass economic muster.\n  In addition, there are projects ``on the books'' that are more than \n25 years old, which have never received construction funds. These \nprojects should be deauthorized immediately. The Environment and Public \nWorks Committee can authorize a restudy if any of these projects are \nthought to have modern benefits and meet the requisite standards.\n  Currently, projects are only required to meet a 1:1 cost-benefit \nratio. I find this appalling. No one would invest in the stock market \nat such a return. According to the Taxpayers for Common Sense, 36 \npercent of the 310 major projects authorized since 1986 have been \nauthorized with a benefit-to-cost ratio of less than 1.5. Construction \nof these projects would cost more than $7 billion. Especially in these \ntimes of war and deficit spending, taxpayers cannot afford, nor should \nbe asked to fund such projects. My bill would require that projects \nreturn benefits that are one and a half times the project costs, a vast \nimprovement over current practice.\n  My friends, do not fear deauthorization. It is a cleansing process, \ngetting the inactive projects off the books will only serve to better \nthe chances of completed funding for those projects that remain.\n  I would also like to highlight the independent review provision in my \nbill. WRDA 2000 required the National Academy of Sciences to issue a \nreport making recommendations on the effectiveness of independent peer \nreview. Many will ask, why not wait until the Academy's report is \nissued before addressing this issue in legislation. I would like to \nexplain to my colleagues, if the Academy makes recommendations that \ndiffer from what I have included in this bill, I am open to making \nrefinements as this bill moves through the legislative process. But I \nwanted to include a provision on independent review to highlight the \nimportance of the issue, as well as my belief that such review will \nhelp restore integrity to the Corps and its study processes.\n  Let me say a word about cost-shares. I think it is important that a \nnon-Federal sponsor partner with the Federal Government in the \nadvancement of Corps of Engineers projects. The landmark WRDA 1986 \nestablished most of the modern cost-share formulas. But some of these \ncost share arrangements could be stronger. For example, the benefits \nrealized by beach replenishment projects are highly localized. The non-\nFederal interests should thus be responsible for a larger portion of \nthe replenishment costs. I also believe that there should be a \nfinancial incentive, in the form of a better cost share, for non-\nstructural flood damage reduction projects. This only seems logical \nfrom a financial sense, as well as an environmental standpoint. And as \nfor the costs associated with the Inland Waterways system, IWS, there \nshould be a distinction between those segments of the System that carry \nmost of the traffic and those that are underutilized. Approximately 30 \npercent of the Operations and Maintenance funds are devoted to segments \nof the IWS that realize a mere 3 percent of the traffic. My bill \nattempts to address this issue by reformulating how O costs are paid.\n  I say to my friends, my intention here is not to beat up on the Corps \nof Engineers. As the ranking Republican on the Senate Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, I have a great deal of respect for the Chief of \nEngineers and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works. This \nbill should not be interpreted as a statement on their effectiveness. I \nmerely want to implement mechanisms to make the Agency more fiscally \nresponsible. The taxpayers deserve our attention to this matter.\n  I realize that many of my distinguished colleagues will oppose our \nefforts to improve and modernize the Corps of Engineers. I daresay, \npart of the problem is that any meaningful reform of the Corps will \nrequire a reform of the practices of Congress, as well. If your project \nis meritorious, if it has local support and adheres to cost-sharing \nrequirements and cost-benefit ratio, if your project is in the Corps \nmission, you need not worry. This bill is about clearing the way for \nprojects that warrant the taxpayers' investment.\n  As for where we go from here, the Senate Environment and Public Works \nCommittee will hold a hearing on the issue of Corps Reform in the \nupcoming months. I expect this bill to be part of the debate of the \nhearing.\n  Average Americans toil all day long, and some, all night, trying to \nmake meager ends meet. How can I look these Americans in the eye and \nsay, your tax dollars pay to maintain a waterway that sees two barges a \nyear or to replenish the sand on a beach where the median home price is \n$1.5 million? Taxpayers' hard-earned money should not be devoted to \npouring sand on the beaches of the wealthy. Taxpayer dollars should be \nspent more wisely than to maintain deadbeat waterways. Particularly \nduring this time of belt-cinching, we should show more fiscal \nrestraint!\n  I would like to quote another Mr. Smith, that is, Mr. Smith of Maine, \nwho served on the House Committee of Ways and Means in the days before \nthis country was embroiled in Civil War. Mr. Smith, in a Report of the \nWays and Means Committee dated February 10, 1836 wisely counseled: \n``Heedless and useless or unavailable expenditure of the public \ntreasury are alike to be avoided in all legislation.'' He further \nnoted: ``Every Government . . . is susceptible of acquiring habits of \nlavish expenditure and extravagance in its operations.'' Every \nGovernment ``requires constant watching to preserve its own purity.'' \nWell, folks, I am here to say, our government's practices are not pure. \nBut there is something that we can do about it.\n  Corps Reform. It's going to be an uphill battle, but it's a start. I \nchallenge, not just my fiscally conservative friends, but all my \ncolleagues, to put aside their parochial interests for the general good \nof the taxpayers' hard-earned money.\n  As we move forward, please understand that I am open to suggestions \nas to how to improve upon the ideas embodied in this bill. I want to \nwork together with my colleagues to make\n\n[[Page S1540]]\n\nthis bill as meaningful, responsive, and responsible as possible.\n  Please join me in advancing this fiscally responsible legislation.\n  Our bill is supported by taxpayer advocacy groups such as the \nTaxpayers for Common Sense, National Taxpayers Union, Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste, as well as environmental groups, for example, \nNational Wildlife Federation and Environmental Defense. I have some \nletters of support and ask unanimous consent that they be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                        Environmental Defense,\n\n                                                    March 5, 2002.\n     Senator Bob Smith,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Environment and Public \n         Works, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Smith: Environmental Defense strongly supports \n     the Corps of Engineers Modernization and Improvement Act of \n     2002 and applauds your efforts to restore trust in the Corps' \n     planning process and to focus scarce federal funds on \n     economically and environmentally sound civil works projects.\n       The Corps has an important role to play in the management \n     of the nation's water resources, including the restoration of \n     ecosystems like the Everglades, Coastal Louisiana, and the \n     Columbia, Snake, Mississippi and Missouri rivers. \n     Unfortunately, scarce federal funds are frequently wasted on \n     projects with few economic benefits and high environmental \n     costs.\n       We believe the Corps of Engineers Modernization and \n     Improvement Act of 2002 will move to accelerate the \n     construction of nationally critical projects by prioritizing \n     and shrinking the Corps' $52 million backlog, subjecting \n     questionable projects to greater review, and by asking cost-\n     sharing partners to share a larger portion of project costs. \n     Too many Corps projects have failed to generate predicted \n     benefits--including many segments of the inland waterway \n     system--and too many projects with questionable economic \n     benefits continue to be constructed.\n       We are aware that powerful special interests will oppose \n     these changes to bring basic fiscal sense to federal funding \n     for water projects. It takes an exceptional degree of \n     principal and courage to take on these interests. We are \n     confident, however, that your leadership on this issue can \n     make a big difference.\n       We applaud your efforts to restore trust in the Corps' \n     planning process and to focus scarce federal funds on \n     economically and environmentally sound projects.\n           Sincerely,\n     Scott Faber,\n       Water Resources Specialist.\n     Timothy Searchinger,\n       Senior Attorney.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    March 5, 2002.\n     Senator Robert Smith,\n     Ranking Member, Environment and Public Works Committee, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n\n     Senator Russell Feingold,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n     Senator John McCain,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Senators Smith, Feingold, and McCain: Taxpayers for \n     Common Sense commends you for introducing the Corps of \n     Engineers Modernization and Improvement Act of 2002.\n       This legislation could stop more than $15 billion of \n     wasteful spending at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers by \n     deauthorizing wasteful and outdated projects, limiting the \n     Corps to only building projects within its mission, requiring \n     greater accountability in its project planning process, and \n     increasing the non-Federal contributions to project costs. \n     With the return of budget deficits the timing and need for \n     this legislation could not be greater.\n       As early as 1836, Members of Congress started raising \n     questions about cost overruns and mismanagement by the Corps \n     in constructing water projects. Back then, Congressman \n     Francis O. Smith from Maine, Chairman of the House Ways and \n     Means Committee, rebuked the Corps for a host of problems in \n     constructing 25 wasteful projects in the committee report on \n     the Harbors and Rivers Act.\n       More than 160 years later, Taxpayers for Common Sense and \n     National Wildlife Federation published a report criticizing \n     the Corps for pursuing 25 other projects that would waste \n     more than $6 billion of federal taxpayer money.\n       A steady stream of Congressional authorizations of new \n     projects over the last two decades has swelled the Corps' \n     construction backlog to $52 billion. However, despite a 50% \n     increase in the Crops' construction backlog over the last six \n     years, it would still take the agency more than 25 years to \n     construct all of those projects at current funding levels \n     assuming no new projects were authorized.\n       The reluctance of many Members of Congress to criticize \n     wasteful spending has created this enormous backlog, leading \n     to a situation where everyone loses because no projects are \n     getting built. A Taxpayers for Common Sense analysis of the \n     backlog found that the typical Corps project was only 24% \n     completed, based upon the median rate of completion. \n     Legitimate projects, like operation and maintenance of \n     high-volume waterways, are suffering at the hands of \n     ``mission creep'' projects like the $311 million Grand \n     Prairie Irrigation project in east Arkansas, a project \n     that even the farmers who the Corps identified as the \n     beneficiaries oppose.\n       Unfortunately, the Corps has not taken measures to \n     alleviate these problems. Instead, last week at Senate Budget \n     Committee hearings, Assistant Secretary of the Army Mike \n     Parker and Lt. Gen. Robert Flowers half-heartedly defended \n     President Bush's FY03 budget request while testifying that \n     the way to reduce the backlog was to give the Corps a raise \n     this year from $4 billion to $6.4 billion, a 60% increase \n     over the President's request.\n       The Corps has become embroiled in several scandals over the \n     manipulated and shoddy evaluation of project studies. In the \n     most infamous case, the Army Inspector General reprimanded \n     three senior Corps officials for ``cooking the books'' to \n     bias a study of lock expansions on the Upper Mississippi and \n     Illinois Rivers so that the results favored a $1.2 billion \n     project alternative. In the last two years, five other major \n     Corps projects have been found through independent economic \n     analyses to be unjustified: the $360 million Delaware River \n     deepening project, the $188 million Columbia River deepening \n     project, the $127 million Dallas Floodway Extension project, \n     the $108 million Oregon Inlet Jetties project, and the $40 \n     million Chesapeake and Delaware Canal deepening project.\n       Clearly, the Corps is incapable of producing objective \n     analyses of projects. This is why the independent peer review \n     provisions of your bill are so critical. Taxpayers deserve \n     better accountability for how their hard earned tax dollars \n     are being spent.\n       The Corps doesn't need a raise, it just needs a good dose \n     of common sense. Like all taxpayers faced with a tight \n     budget, the Corps must be forced to prioritize and focus on \n     the projects it does best within its mission.\n       With pursuit of the reforms in this bill, you will be \n     building upon a notable legacy left by President Reagan in \n     1986. That year, Congress agreed to his landmark cost sharing \n     rules that required local beneficiaries to pay a share of \n     each project. Not only will you be following in Reagan's \n     footsteps, but you are charting a new course for the further \n     of water resources development in America. On behalf of \n     taxpayers, thank you for your leadership on this important \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Joe Theissen,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I rise today to join the Senator from \nNew Hampshire, Mr. Smith, in introducing the Corps of Engineers \nModernization and Improvement Act of 2002. I am very pleased to be \nworking with him on this issue, and admire his dedication to fiscal \nresponsibility as embodied in this measure.\n  As the Senator from New Hampshire, Mr. Smith, and I introduce this \nbill, we realize that Corps Reform is a work in progress. Reforming the \nCorps of Engineers will be a difficult task for Congress. It involves \nrestoring credibility and accountability to a Federal agency rocked by \nscandals and constrained by endlessly growing authorizations and a \ngloomy Federal fiscal picture, and yet an agency that Wisconsin, and \nmany other States across the country, have come to rely upon. From the \nGreat Lakes to the mighty Mississippi, the Corps is involved in \nproviding aids to navigation, environmental remediation, water control \nand a variety of other services to my state. My office has strong \nworking relationships with the Detroit, Rock Island, and St. Paul \nDistrict Offices that service Wisconsin, and I want the fiscal and \nmanagement cloud over the Corps to dissipate so that the Corps can \ncontinue to contribute to our environment and our economy.\n  This legislation evolved from my experience in seeking to offer an \namendment to the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 to create \nindependent review of Army Corps of Engineers' projects. In response to \nmy initiative, the bill's managers, which included the Senator from New \nHampshire, Mr. Smith, and the then Chairman, the Senator from Montana, \nMr. Baucus, adopted an amendment as part of their Manager's Package \nwhich should help get the Authorizing Committee, the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, the additional information it needs to develop \nand refine legislation on this issue through a study by the National \nAcademy of Sciences, NAS, on peer review.\n  Earlier this Congress, I introduced the Corps of Engineers Reform Act \nof 2001, S. 646. The measure the Senator from New Hampshire and I \nintroduce\n\n[[Page S1541]]\n\ntoday includes many provisions that were included in my original bill, \nand codifies the idea of independent review of the Corps about which we \nagreed in the 2000 Water Resources bill. It also provides a mechanism \nto speed up completion of construction for good Corps projects with \nlarge public benefits by deauthorizing low priority and economically \nwasteful projects. The bill put forward bold concepts. It streamlines \nthe existing automatic deauthorization process. Under the bill a \nproject authorized for construction but never started is deauthorized \nif it is denied appropriations funds towards completion of construction \nfor five straight years. In addition, a project that has begun \nconstruction but denied appropriations funds towards completion for \nthree straight years. The bill also preserves Congressional prerogative \nover setting the Corps' construction priorities by allowing Congress a \nchance to reauthorize any of these projects before they are \nautomatically deauthorized. This process will be transparently to all \ninterests, because the bill requires the Corps to make an annual list \nof projects in the construction backlog available to Congress and the \npublic at large via the Internet. The bill also allows a point of order \nto be raised in the Senate against projects included in legislation for \nwhich the Corps has not completed necessary studies determining that a \nproject is economically justified and in the federal interest.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire and I came to a meeting of the minds \non the issue of independent review of Corps projects. But the bill we \nintroduce today is much more than that. It is a comprehensive revision \nof the project review and authorization procedures at the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers. Our joint goal is to have the Corps to increase \ntransparency and accountability, to ensure fiscal responsibility, and \nto allow greater stakeholder involvement in their projects. We are \ncommitted to that goal, and to seeing Corps Reform enacted as part of \nthis year's Water Resources bill.\n  I also look forward, to the upcoming hearing process, and stand ready \nto work with the Senator from New Hampshire in merging the bill we \nintroduce today with S. 646, my bill from earlier this Congress. My \nbill, S. 646, which is sponsored in the other body by my colleague from \nWisconsin, Representative Kind, includes a number of important concepts \nthat are central to environmental protection and that should be part of \nCorps Reform.\n  The Corps is required to mitigate the environmental impacts of its \nprojects in a variety of ways, including by avoiding damaging wetlands \nin the first place and either holding other lands or constructing \nwetlands elsewhere when it cannot avoid destroying them. The Corps \nrequires private developers to meet this standard when they construct \nprojects as a condition of receiving a federal permit, and I think the \nfederal government should live up to the same standards. Too often, the \nCorps does not complete required mitigation and enhances environmental \nrisks. I feel very strongly that mitigation must be completed, that the \ntrue costs of mitigation should be accounted for in Corps projects, and \nthat the public should be able to track the progress of mitigation \nprojects. In addition, the concurrent mitigation requirements of S. 646 \nwould actually reduce the total mitigation costs by ensuring the \npurchase of mitigation lands as soon as possible. I look forward to \nexploring these ideas with the Senator from New Hampshire as we work to \nproduce a final product.\n  I feel that this bill is an important step down the road to a \nreformed Corps of Engineers. This bill establishes a framework to catch \nmistakes by Corps planners, deter any potential bad behavior by Corps \nofficials to justify questionable projects, end old unjustified \nprojects, and provide planners desperately needed support against the \nnever ending pressure of project boosters. Those boosters, include \nCongressional interests, which is why I believe that this body needs to \nchampion reform--to end the perception that Corps projects are all pork \nand no substance.\n  I wish it were the case, that I could argue that the changes we are \nproposing today were not needed, but unfortunately, I see that there is \nneed for this bill. I want to make sure that future Corps projects no \nlonger fail to produce predicted benefits, stop costing the taxpayers \nmore than the Corps estimated, do not have unanticipated environmental \nimpacts, and are built in an environmentally compatible way. This bill \nwill help the Corps do a better job which is what the taxpayers and the \nenvironment deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU:\n  S. 1988. A bill to authorize the American Battle Monuments Commission \nto establish in the State of Louisiana a memorial to honor the Buffalo \nSoldiers; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, one hundred and thirty five years ago, \nbefore the term Homeland Security was even coined, a group of men \ndevoted themselves to securing the frontiers of this Nation. They \nprotected Americans in their homes; they deterred hostile invaders, and \nthey secured the blessings of liberty to the people of this land. Even \nmore remarkable, they secured these blessings for others, while they \ncould not fully enjoy them themselves.\n  I am referring to the Buffalo Soldiers. These brave men instituted a \ntradition of professional military service for African Americans that \nstretches one hundred and thirty five years to our triumphs occurring \nthis very day. African Americans military service is as old as our \nNation. There were black soldiers during the revolution, a unit of free \nblack men played a pivotal rule in the Battle of New Orleans, and the \nexploits of African Americans during the Civil War have been captured \nin novels and on film. However, it was not until the Army \nReorganization Act of 1866 that soldiering and service to country \nbecame a realistic option for African Americans seeking to improve \ntheir quality of life. In so doing, they raised the bar of freedom, and \nrevealed the injustice of preventing the defenders of democracy from \nfully participating in it.\n  The city of New Orleans, and the State of Louisiana have a rich \nhistory, and have, over the years given more than their fair share of \nsons in service to their Nation. Much of this history is commemorated \naround the city. Yet these great sons of New Orleans remain \nunacknowledged in their home. For in Louisiana's great military \ntradition, surely one of its greatest military contributions were the \n9th Cavalry Regiment and the 25th Infantry Regiment.\n  These two forces, recruited and organized in New Orleans, represent \nhalf of all the units of buffalo soldiers. The 9th Cavalry alone \nconstituted 10 percent of all the American cavalry. Their list of \nadversaries reads like a who's who of the Old West, Geronimo, Sitting \nBull, Poncho Villa. In movies, when settlers encounter Apaches, the \ncavalry always comes to the rescue. Yet how many times were the cavalry \nthat rode over the horizon African Americans? Of course, the reality is \nthat the Buffalo Soldiers comprised some of our Nations most capable \nand loyal troops. Despite suffering the worst deprivations known to any \nAmerican soldiers of the period, their desertion rates were the lowest \nin the Army. The 9th Cavalry was awarded 15 Congressional Medals of \nHonor, including two to native Louisianians First Sergeant Moses \nWilliams and Sergeant Emmanuel Stance.\n  For these reasons, I am offering legislation that would authorize the \ncreation of a suitable memorial in New Orleans for these gallant \nsoldiers. There is an excellent statue to the Buffalo Soldiers at Fort \nLeavenworth Kansas. It commemorates the 10th Cavalry Regiment stationed \nthere. However, I believe that these men deserve to be recognized in \ntheir home city. Furthermore, it should be in a location where \nthousands of visitors will have the opportunity to come to appreciate \nthe legacy of the Buffalo Soldiers. I believe that the city of New \nOrleans is the perfect location.\n  This Nation has sadly found the need to say thank you to its \nservicemen and women after the fact on more than one occasion. \nUnfortunately, this is another. We are fortunate to have living \nmemories of the 9th and 10th Cavalry Regiments today. The regiments \nwere not disbanded until the conclusion of World War Two, where they \nserved with distinction.

STEWART\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate\n\n[[Page S1549]]\n\nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 216 submitted earlier today by \nSenators Kerry and Bond.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 216) to honor Milton D. Stewart for \n     his years of service in the Office of Advocacy of the Small \n     Business Administration.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I speak in support of a sense of the \nSenate Resolution honoring the work and dedication of Milton D. \nStewart, the first Chief Counsel for the Office of Advocacy at the U.S. \nSmall Business Administration. Today, March 5, 2002 Milt turns 80 \nyears-old and it is only fitting that we pass this Resolution in honor \nof his commitment to America's small businesses. I am pleased to say \nthat this bi-partisan Resolution has been sponsored by myself and \nRanking Member Bond, along with a great majority of the members of the \nSenate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. I am also \npleased that this Resolution has been cleared for passage and I thank \nthe floor staff for their quick work in facilitating passage of this \nResolution.\n  One of the most highly successful innovations of the House and Senate \nSmall Business Committees came twenty-six years ago with the creation \nof the Office of Advocacy within the Small Business Administration. \nThis Office was established to represent and advance small business \ninterests before other Federal agencies and even with Congress. \nCongress recognized the importance of small business to the \ncompetitiveness of the American economy and understood that government \nsometimes can get in the way of small businesses doing what they do \nbest--creating jobs.\n  Advocacy has done a commendable job looking out for the interests of \nsmall business. It is, ironically, a government agency that has the \ntask of making sure that other government agencies take into account \nthe special problems and needs of small businesses as those agencies go \nabout their rule-making activities. Over the years, Advocacy has had a \ngreat deal of success and its hand has been strengthened by further \nCongressional action, such as the Regulatory Flexibility Act in 1980 \nand the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act in 1996.\n  This success is due in no small part to the solid beginnings of the \nOffice of Advocacy under the leadership of the very first Chief Counsel \nfor Advocacy, Milton D. Stewart. Milt, in his tenure as Chief Counsel, \nlaid the groundwork for the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the first White \nHouse Conference on Small Business, the Small Business Innovation \nDevelopment Act, and many other programs that are now considered part \nof the core small business policy within this country.\n  He came by his small business roots honestly. He spent his youth in a \nfamily-owned small business begun and managed by his father and mother. \nEarly on, he acquired great respect for the skill and courage of small \nbusiness entrepreneurs. Later in his life, Milt served at one time or \nanother as President of the National Association of Small Business \nInvestment Companies, President of the National Small Business \nAssociation, and as President of the Small Business High Technology \nInstitute.\n  Milt also had significant government service beginning with the \nOffice of War Information during World War II. He was even a staff \nmember of the original Senate Committee on Small Business. He served as \nspecial counsel to Governor Harriman of New York and to the New York \nState Thruway Authority. All of this preceded his tenure as the first \nChief Counsel for Advocacy.\n  While he was Chief Counsel, his charisma and vision inspired many of \nthose who worked with him to catch the ``small business bug'' and to \ndirect their energies toward helping develop sound small business \npolicy for our Nation. They, and we, owe Milt a deep debt of gratitude.\n  The Office of Advocacy is fortunate to have had such a sound \nbeginning. Those of us who care deeply for small business policy \nrecognized how crucial Advocacy has become to sound regulatory debate \nwithin our country. The Office is a sterling example of an experiment \nthat worked and continues to work to this day.\n  Milt, who deserves all the best on his birthday, can certainly take \npride in the legacy that he has left by setting all the precedents that \nmade the Office of Advocacy what it is today--an effective voice \npromoting the best interests of small business within our government.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the resolution and \npreamble be agreed to en bloc, the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable, and any statements relating to the resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we are facing a problem that every \nother nation that we share the planet with hopes it will have some day. \nThat is, our country's economic growth will soon outpace our supply of \navailable energy.\n  The growth of both the high tech and advanced manufacturing sectors \nin America has created jobs and has created enormous opportunity for \nour people, and they have created a new demand for energy. One reason \nthese industries have flourished in America is because we have the fuel \nthey need to succeed. We have the ``people'' fuel, the skilled workers \nwith committed hearts and hands; we have the ``idea'' fuel, the smart \nminds that dream big and can take ideas from the drawing board on to \nthe street; and we have ``good old-fashioned'' fuel, inexpensive, \nreliable sources of energy that literally make everything move and \nconnect and work.\n  Other nations have some of these pieces, but they rarely have all of \nthem. That won't always be the case. The world is shrinking, and our \ncompetitors, strategic and otherwise, are in hot pursuit. What will we \ndo to stay ahead? What will we do to fuel America's continued success?\n  Our future success will require us to produce more energy to keep up \nwith the growing demand for it. How big will that demand be? Big. You \ncan see from this chart that there is a large gap currently in terms of \nthe domestic production of energy and consumption. In other words, this \nopen space on this chart is a gap between what we produce domestically \nand what we consume.\n\n[[Page S1550]]\n\n  According to the Department of Energy, we are going to have to \nincrease by 30 percent the amount of energy produced by 2015 in order \nto meet the demand of this great Nation.\n  In 2000, America used more than 3.8 billion megawatt hours of \nelectricity. The Department of Energy estimates that by 2020, the \ndemand will rise to 5.43 billion megawatts a year, an increase of 1.63 \nbillion. To meet that new demand, the DOE says it will take 1,300 new \npower plants or, quite simply, the lights will begin to dim on the \nAmerican dream for a lot of people.\n  Let's remember, needing more energy is a great problem to have. It \nmeans we are creating jobs and we are creating opportunity. The \nAmerican dream is our country's economic success. It is a gift \nbequeathed to this generation by generations of men and women who \ntoiled before us.\n  We are the stewards of this gift. History will judge us based on what \nthis generation of Americans does right now with this gift. Will we \nkeep America's light of opportunity shining, or will we sleep through \nour watch and let the light flicker out?\n  I am thankful to the Majority Leader for keeping his word and \nbringing this issue to the floor of the Senate. However, I disagree \nwith the way it came to the Senate, since the bill should have been \nconsidered and voted out of the Energy Committee, instead of being \nwritten on the floor of the Senate.\n  Still, the bill presented before us at least starts the process by \nlaying the foundation and beginning the debate. It has many things \nworthy about it and many things that we can build upon.\n  This bill is a good start because, among other things, it encourages \ngreater use of renewable sources of energy, sources which have little \nor no impact on the environment.\n  The bill also encourages the use of ethanol, a renewable gasoline \nadditive that helps reduce auto emissions and makes the air cleaner for \nus and our children to breathe.\n  It starts the needed debate on reauthorizing the Price-Anderson Act, \nwhich is so vital to the future expansion of our nuclear energy \nindustry. But there is much more that we need to do. I have introduced \nlegislation to expand the Price-Anderson reauthorization to include \ncommercial nuclear reactors, as it must, and I hope that we will be \nable to include it in this bill.\n  What concerns me about this bill, however, is it raises false hopes. \nIt creates the expectation that it will solve our future energy crises, \nprotect our energy security, and sustain American opportunities. In \nreality, it doesn't do this. The bill does start in several good \ndirections, but then falls short and is silent on several other key \nissues, such as energy infrastructure and the need to reduce our \ndependency on foreign oil.\n  The majority's bill doesn't fully deliver what America needs, and I \nwould have to oppose it in its current form. I hope that, as we amend \nit, it is something that I can support and a majority of the Senate can \nsupport.\n  Our energy challenge demands from us the enactment of a comprehensive \nenergy policy, the likes of which we have never seen before in this \ncountry. I think the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Inhofe, did a very good \njob in talking about the need for an energy policy. I have wanted one \never since I was mayor of the city of Cleveland in 1979, but in \nadministration after administration, we never got one. Today, we have \nthis golden opportunity to have an energy policy for the United States \nof America. It has to be a policy that harmonizes energy and \nenvironmental policies, acknowledging that the economy and the \nenvironment are vitally intertwined, a policy that broadens our base of \nenergy resources to create stability, guarantee reasonable prices, and \nprotect our national security--a policy that won't cause prices to \nspike, hurting particularly the elderly, disabled, and low-income \nfamilies, and which won't cripple the engines of commerce that fund the \nresearch that will yield future environmental protection technologies--\ntechnologies that can be shared with developing nations who currently \nface severe environmental crises.\n  In terms of energy security, we need to reduce our reliance on \nforeign sources of energy. As I pointed out, the gap between what we \nconsume and what we produce is being met by imports--imported oil, \nimported gas, and other energy sources that we bring into the United \nStates.\n  As we have all learned in ways too horrific for words, the enemies of \nfreedom will go to extreme lengths to attack our country. As we seek to \nprotect our Nation's freedom of opportunity, we should not do it in \nways that make America more vulnerable to these enemies of freedom. We \nmust do everything we can to provide for our energy need from within \nour Nation's borders.\n  We are already far too dependent on foreign energy sources. Oil \nimports have risen from 1973, when we imported 35 percent of our oil, \nto 58 percent last year. Today, we even import oil from Iraq--750,000 \nbarrels a day. Seven percent of our oil comes from Iraq--the same \ncountry over which we fly regular combat missions. Think about that: 7 \npercent of our oil comes from a country that the President has \ndescribed as one of the three countries in the Axis of Evil.\n  The political climate in the Middle East region today is more \nvolatile than at any other time in my memory. For the United States to \nbe so dependent on this part of the world to meet such a large portion \nof our energy needs makes us extremely vulnerable to being held hostage \nfor oil. If the enemies of our country were willing to take out the \nWorld Trade Center and the Pentagon, does anyone doubt that if they had \na chance to cut off, or even just disrupt, our energy supply, they \nwould do it? There is no doubt. They would do it and we know it.\n\n  As we rely on our own strengths for the answers to the coming energy \ncrisis, we see that no single source of domestic energy is sufficient \nto meet all of our Nation's needs. Though we are blessed with large \nreserves of coal, oil, natural gas, renewables, and nuclear fuel, no \nsingle energy source can single-handedly solve our problem. That means \nwe have to broaden our base of energy sources. We simply cannot put all \nof our eggs in one basket. If we were some other nation, diversifying \nour energy supply might be a great challenge. But we have been blessed. \nGod has blessed us with the resources to solve this problem.\n  One of our great untapped resources is nuclear energy. Over the past \n40 years, we have seen how safe and reliable nuclear energy can be. We \ncurrently get 20 percent of our electricity from nuclear energy plants. \nBut this is far below what some countries do. France derives 70 percent \nof its electricity from nuclear power; Sweden gets 39 percent; South \nKorea gets 41 percent; and Japan gets 34 percent.\n  What nuclear energy brings to the table, which is so positive is that \nit produces zero harmful air emissions. In fact, 40 years of solid \nwaste from all of our Nation's 103 nuclear facilities would fit on a \nfootball field to a height of only 10 feet.\n  Since 1973, the use of nuclear energy has prevented 62 million tons \nof sulfur dioxide, a key component of acid rain, and 32 million tons of \nnitrogen oxide, a precursor to ozone, from being released in the \natmosphere.\n  Reauthorizing the Price-Anderson program, which provides needed \nliability protection for the public's benefit, updating an outdated, \nduplicative licensing process and creating a permanent repository for \nnuclear waste, will make it possible for us to take full advantage of \nthe incredible potential this clean energy source provides us. I am \ngoing to offer an amendment to help improve the licensing process to \nfacilitate the construction of new nuclear facilities and also address \nthe human capital crisis that is impacting the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission. I will be joined by the Senator from Louisiana, Senator \nLandrieu, in this effort.\n  The other energy source we should turn to more is coal. It is by far \nour most abundant and cheapest energy resource. Right now, we have \nenough coal to meet our country's energy needs for the next 250 years. \nBecause coal is so inexpensive, we can provide our vital manufacturing \nsector with the electricity it needs at prices low enough so that after \nbusinesses pay their energy bills, they will still have something left \nover for other important needs like innovation and research. Just as \nnuclear energy's challenge is waste storage--and I am glad\n\n[[Page S1551]]\n\nwe are going to debate the issue of nuclear waste storage at Yucca \nMountain--coal's challenge is air emissions. Coal today is cleaner than \never before, but we need to make it even cleaner. We have the \ntechnologies available to do so. Coal's low cost makes research and \ninstallation of clean coal technology a viable investment. In addition, \nthese technologies can be shared with emerging nations that are largely \ndependent on coal for electricity. We can help them learn from our \nexperience and spare them future environmental challenges. With clean \ncoal technology, and the incentives to guarantee it will be used, we \ncan ensure that the more than two centuries worth of coal that we have \navailable today can be used as an energy source.\n  Let's talk about natural gas. It is a key component in meeting our \ncurrent and future energy needs as some 60 million American homes now \nuse natural gas for heat. Natural gas also provides 15 percent of this \nNation's electric power and nearly one-quarter of our total energy \nsupply. These percentages are increasing because natural gas burns \ncleanly and because it is easier to achieve permits from the EPA for \nnatural gas-powered electric generation facilities. In fact, it is \nestimated that nearly 95 percent of all new power plants are going to \nbe using natural gas.\n  Even with this increased usage, production of natural gas has \nremained fairly stable, and to accommodate the growing demand, imports \nof natural gas have risen from 4.3 percent of consumption in 1981, to \naround 16 percent today.\n  To reduce our reliance on imports, we need to tap the estimated 40 \npercent of undiscovered natural gas that is located on lands owned by \nthe Federal and State governments. Without this, we face steep price \nincreases in natural gas at a time when we are becoming increasingly \ndependent upon it.\n  We saw what can happen with natural gas during last winter's \nespecially cold temperatures. A sudden high demand caught us unprepared \nwhen supplies were low and prices shot through the roof, devastating \nthe poor and the elderly. I will never forget holding a meeting in \nCleveland with Catholic Charities, Lutheran Housing, and the Salvation \nArmy where they presented the dramatic impact that high natural gas \nprices were having on the poor, the elderly, and the disabled.\n  We also need to be mindful that changes we make on energy policy that \naffect demand for natural gas directly impact on our competitive \nposition in the world marketplace for plastics and fertilizer. In fact, \nthe Ohio Corn Growers Association told me that the high cost of natural \ngas was impacting the cost of their fertilizer. They said that many of \ntheir farmers did not plant as much corn last year because of the high \ncost of fertilizer.\n  Right now in America, oil remains the primary source of energy. From \nheating people's homes to firing energy plants to running our \nautomobiles, it makes up the largest portion of our energy portfolio \nwhich keeps our economy humming.\n  Demand for oil is expected to grow at a constant rate of 1.5 percent \nper year through the year 2020. To meet that demand, we need to \nmaximize the use of the more than 22 billion barrels of proven oil \nreserves the United States possesses. We also need to make oil \nextraction from mature oilfields more economical. The Senator from \nOklahoma spoke very eloquently a few minutes ago about the oil that is \navailable if we could only find an economical way to get at it.\n  Of course, during the consideration of this bill, we will debate an \namendment to allow oil exploration in ANWR. We have the technology \ntoday to both use our Alaskan oil and protect the region's environment. \nThe potential for new job creation is great, up to 735,000 jobs in a \nvariety of fields, and the added production will help strengthen our \nenergy self-reliance.\n  Let's turn to conservation. Conservation has proven very successful \nin reducing energy demand. By incorporating technological breakthroughs \ninto the production of energy-efficient automobiles, high-efficiency \nhomes, and more efficient appliances and machinery, conservation has \nsucceeded in saving us tremendous amounts of money.\n  I get a little concerned when I hear people say we have not done \nenough in the area of conservation.\n  This chart shows that through energy conservation, we have had \nenormous savings of some $2.5 trillion from 1972 to 1991. This is \naccording to a 1995 Department of Energy report, which is the most up-\nto-date data we have available. One can see that we have committed this \ncountry to conservation, and it is making a big difference.\n  Legislation that I am working on with Senator Levin would encourage \ncontinued fuel conservation efforts in automobiles without the \ndevastating blow to our automobile manufacturing jobs that a competing \nbill would cause. Our proposal would let the technical work of \nestablishing new fuel conservation standards be completed by \nresearchers at the National Highway Transportation and Safety \nAdministration. These new standards would be established only after \nscientific analysis of the safety, environmental, economic, and \nefficiency factors involved, which is a more responsible approach than \npicking an arbitrary number out of thin air.\n\n  In the end, we can expect to see greater fuel efficiency without \nsacrificing safety or a devastating loss of auto worker jobs upon which \nthe economies of many States depend. I can tell my colleagues that the \neconomy in my State depends on it given the amount of auto \nmanufacturing that goes on in Ohio.\n  I have heard from the United Auto Workers and from the major \nautomobile manufacturers that the language in the majority's bill could \nactually cause disruption in the economy of that industry. There is \nanother way to put in place standards that will still get the job done \nin terms of conservation.\n  Another avenue to focus on is renewable energy sources. We currently \nrely very little on renewable sources of energy. In fact, wind and \nsolar together make up less than one-tenth of 1 percent of our current \nenergy production, but they are expensive and they are heavily \nsubsidized.\n  Nevertheless, we need to continue to invest in these forms of energy \nbecause they are so environmentally friendly and they contribute to \nmeeting the requirement of national self-reliance.\n  On the other hand, we must also be realistic about our challenge. \nWhile a savings through conservation has reached more than $2.5 \ntrillion over 30 years, the inherent problems of renewable sources make \nit impossible for them to realize similar savings or fill the growing \ngap between demand and supply.\n  In addition, because renewables make up such a small piece of our \noverall energy picture today, we do not have the capacity to meet our \nneeds in the timeframe we are facing. Right now, as this chart shows, \nthey will not get the job done. However, their growth will come, and \nshould continue to be supported with research funding.\n  The point I am making is renewables currently make up only about 8 \npercent of our consumption. Even if we protect them for 20 years, they \nby themselves will not get the job done in meeting our energy needs. \nWhen I am talking about renewables, I am talking about solar, wind, \nhydropower, biomass, waste, and wood.\n  In a recent meeting I had with General Motors in Detroit, I was told \nthe company sees fuel cell technology becoming a viable source in the \nnext 10 to 15 years. It is not science fiction to think that our \nchildren and grandchildren--it will probably be our grandchildren--will \nsee a time when the roads are traveled by cars run on hydrogen and give \noff only water.\n  The majority's bill mandates minimum consumption requirements for \nrenewables and civil penalties if those minimums are not met. We should \nnot be clubbing people for noncompliance. We should be doing everything \nwe can to encourage the adoption of new energy technologies.\n  Renewables and conservation need to be a bigger part of our new \nenergy policy, but we must also be realistic about our challenge. These \ntwo strategies do not have the capacity to meet our growing energy \nneeds in the timeframe we are facing. Anyone who says otherwise either \ndoes not know what they are talking about or they are being \nintellectually dishonest.\n  Too often I hear people say: All we need to do is use more solar and \nwind power and it will take care of the problem. Here are the facts. \nHere is solar\n\n[[Page S1552]]\n\nand wind--less than one-tenth of one percent currently. If we project \nit, solar and wind alone will not get the job done. We are going to \nneed coal, oil, natural gas, nuclear and other sources of energy to \nmeet the demands of the United States of America.\n  Another important issue we must address is infrastructure. As we \ndevelop these new energy sources, we must make sure we can get them to \nwhere the people need them. We saw this firsthand 2 years ago when \nprices for gasoline in the Midwest spiked. The freak combination of a \nshuttered refinery and a temporarily downed pipeline created a \nbottleneck that midwesterners paid for all summer long. Low-income \nAmericans were hit especially hard at the pump, and trucking companies \nand airlines took a big beating.\n  That is why I introduced legislation last year to help streamline the \npermitting process for new energy facilities. I hope my legislation, S. \n1590, can be added to this bill because I think it would enhance it and \nmake it better.\n  The problem of distribution is especially critical to the \nnortheastern States as they try to get additional natural gas supplies \ninto their homes and businesses to meet a growing demand.\n  I encourage my colleagues from that part of the country to take a \nclose look at my provision because I think it is something they should \nget behind.\n  The same technology which is helping to drive the demand for more \nenergy has also equipped us with tools to provide that energy. Advanced \nslant drilling, super-efficient power plants, hyper-accurate seismic \nresearch, we have all of these because of our innovative high-tech \nresearch.\n  Technology has also given us new tools to protect our environment and \npublic health, and we must take full advantage of these opportunities \nbecause we must be good stewards of what we have been given. I reject \nthe arguments from those on either side of the debate who say we have \nto choose between the environment and the economy. We now know the \nsuccess of each is linked. As I have said before, we have to harmonize \nour energy needs and our environmental needs if we are going to have an \nenergy policy. Only with a thriving economy can we fund the research \nthat will find new ways to protect the environment--the cradle for \nevery living thing on this planet--and the world's ecosystems cannot \nsustain us if we do not have clean air and clean water.\n  A growing American economic capability is the only way we can do such \nthings as fight our war on terrorism, provide a prescription drug \nbenefit for seniors, save Social Security from bankruptcy, eliminate \nour national debt, and meet other financial challenges facing our \ncountry. We need to have a growing economy. We know the challenge. We \nmust provide more energy to keep America going. We know we cannot keep \nrelying on unstable foreign sources to do this. We know we have the \nresources domestically to meet our needs. We also know that doing this \nin an environmentally responsible way is critical. We know we have the \ntechnological know-how to meet these challenges.\n  The question that remains is whether or not Congress is going to \nstand in the way of this country's future success or whether we are we \ngoing to be part of the solution. As we seek to provide our country the \npower to succeed, does this body have the power to resist the \ntemptation of partisanship and prove wrong those who say this debate \nwill not end in the successful passage of a good bill? Do we have the \ncourage to work together and do something good for our country and \nleave the partisan jabs and the hollow victories on the table?\n  I do not think it is going to be easy, but I think we can do that. I \nask my colleagues to join in the constructive work of this body. Let us \nmake it happen. I pray that the Holy Spirit inspires us to do it, for \nourselves, for our children, our grandchildren and, yes, the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2002/03/05/senate-section/article/S1552-1", "month": "03", "year": "2002", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1552]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
