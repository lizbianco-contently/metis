Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an important piece \nof legislation that I believe we should be working on today, certainly \ntomorrow. This legislation, the bipartisan brownfields bill, S. 350, \nwas reported from the Environment and Public Works Committee on \nFebruary 27 by a vote of 15-3. This legislation now has 66 cosponsors. \nIt is ready for floor action and has been for more than a month. \nThere were a couple of people in committee who voiced concerns about \nspecific bill language, particularly Senator Voinovich. I indicated at \nthat time that we would work with him prior to the bill being ready for \nfloor action to satisfy any problems he might have, and we did that. We \nworked with him, and I think Senator Voinovich is satisfied. Actually \nwe worked day and night to reconcile these differences.\n\n  The bill is very important. The bill would produce almost 600,000 \njobs around our country. It would increase annual tax revenues up to \n$2.4 billion. This is important environmental legislation. We need to \nmove forward immediately. There has been a lot of controversy over what \nPresident Bush has done and what he has not done, but the one thing \nthat he campaigned on was this legislation. He campaigned on the \nimportance of this legislation. This is a\n\n[[Page S3774]]\n\nbill the administration endorses. This is a bill the Clinton \nadministration endorsed. This is legislation that we should move \nforward. I see no reason we cannot. We are ready on this side to move \nforward. We hope that our friends on the other side of the aisle are \nready to move forward. We have worked on this legislation for years. It \nis just not in the best interests of this country not to move forward. \nWe have to move forward. This bill is truly a compromise. It is a \nconsensus. I think its passage would indicate the true nature of this \nSenate. We are split 50-50, and this legislation, certainly with 66 \ncosponsors, indicates our ability to reach across the aisle both ways. \nWhen we entered into this historic power sharing agreement this year, \nwe indicated that we had a thoughtful, bipartisan Senate. I think it \nindicates the bipartisan nature of this bill. There is no need to wait \nany longer. We have a half million contaminated abandoned sites in the \nUnited States that are waiting to be cleaned up to become thriving \nparts of our communities. Some of these sites would take only a few \ndollars to clean up.\n  For example, Mr. President, in Las Vegas, where we have the old \nNational Guard armory, $50,000 in brownfields money cleaned that up and \nproduced a site that is now really a thriving economic entity within \nthe State of Nevada. It is creating jobs. There is now a tax base that \nwill help support the people of Las Vegas and the State of Nevada.\n  I do not want to be partisan today and I will not be partisan today, \nbut as the days go on I am going to have to be more direct as to what \nthe problem is in holding up this legislation. As I said, we are clear \non this side. It is not right to hold up this bill. And I also say that \nthis legislation has the support of the Senate. If we do not move this \nbill forward--and I think we could finish in just a few hours--in the \nregular course, I am going to be obligated to attach this bill to other \nlegislation that moves through this body.\n  I repeat, with 600,000 jobs, 500,000 abandoned sites, increasing \nannual tax revenues up to $2.4 billion, this is a bill that is good for \nthe environment. It is good for jobs. We should not delay its \nconsideration any longer. It is supported by the last administration, \nsupposedly by this administration, and I hope the leadership in the \nSenate, the majority leader, will allow this matter to be brought \nbefore the Senate.\n  This legislation has been worked on very closely by Senators \nVoinovich, Inhofe, Bond, and Crapo, as well as Senators Clinton, Boxer, \nCorzine, and Graham to accommodate all their interests. Senator Smith \nand I have worked hard to have this bill reported out of committee. I \nhope we can have action on the Senate floor at an early date--maybe \nthis afternoon, maybe tomorrow. But I think we should move forward \nquickly.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Feinstein). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to speak in morning business on \nthe issue of education, which the Senate will take up over the next few \nweeks. There has been a considerable amount of discussion on this issue \nwithin the Senate membership but even more discussion within the \npopulace in general. The President ran for election on the issue of \neducation and how he intended to address that issue. In fact, he \nconsidered this to be the primary issue before us as a nation--the fact \nthat he wants an educational system which leaves no child behind.\n  This is a goal that is laudable and which all of us should pursue. So \nthe matter is now coming to the Senate. We have in the committee on \nwhich I serve--the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee--\nbeen able to produce a bill which came out of committee 20-0, a \nbipartisan bill, to try to move the issue of education along in a \npositive way--the Federal policy on education.\n  There is still much to do and, therefore, as we in this body take up \nthe debate on the education policy during this week, there will be a \nconsiderable discussion of points that were left out of the bill as it \ncame out of committee. I think it is important to note, as we address \nthe issue of education, that the Federal role in education is narrow. \nMost elementary and secondary education issues are addressed at the \nlocal level.\n  Madam President, the Duke University basketball team is a group of \nyoung men who reflect the type of athletes, sportsmen, and good \ncitizens to which citizens of this Nation should strive. I congratulate \nthe leadership of Duke University for producing a basketball program \nthat excels not only in athletic ability but as a role model for our \nyouth and our Nation.\n  It is very appropriate that before an education speech we should have \nthe opportunity to meet these fine young men who set such a good \nexample for kids across America.\n  The majority of funds that are spent on education are controlled at \nthe local level. Approximately 93 percent of the funding for elementary \nand secondary school education comes from the local school districts or \nthe States.\n  The Federal role in elementary and secondary school education is \nreally quite narrow and is focused on two basic themes: One, making \nsure, for kids with special needs, special ed programs are funded; and \ntwo, making sure that children who come from low-income families have \nan equal opportunity to succeed as children who come from families who \nare better off.\n  For the last 25 years, we have pursued both these goals: special \neducation and the education of low-income children. Unfortunately, both \nof these Federal programs have fairly significant flaws.\n  In the special education area, the Federal Government has failed to \nlive up to the obligation of funding the full share of special \neducation. Originally, the Federal Government said it would pick up 40 \npercent of the cost of special education. Unfortunately, as of 4 years \nago, the Federal Government was only picking up 6 percent of the cost.\n  Due to a concerted effort by myself, quite honestly, and a number of \nothers on our side of the aisle, the majority leader, chairman of the \nAppropriations subcommittee, Chairman Specter, and chairman of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, Chairman Jeffords, we \ntook on the issue of funding special education. We have dramatically \nincreased funding--2\\1/2\\ times. We are now up to funding, if we accept \nthe President's budget, almost 20 percent of the needs of special \neducation. In fact, President Bush has proposed the single largest \nincrease in special education funding ever proposed by a President in \nthe history of this country. At least we are trying to address that \nissue.\n\n  The bill that will come to the floor later this week addresses the \nneeds of kids from lower income families. In this area, regrettably, \nalthough the Federal Government has chosen to step on the ground in its \nresponsibility, it has done a poor job of pursuing this responsibility.\n\n[[Page S3775]]\n\n  This program was begun 35 years ago. It is called title I. It helps \nkids with lower incomes get the same education as their peers. We have \nspent $120 billion on this program over its life. The vast majority of \nthe spending has occurred since 1990. What have been the results? The \nresults have been that the educational achievement of low-income kids \nhas actually gone down or, at best, has remained stagnant. The average \nfourth grader today from a low-income family reads at two grade levels \nlower than his or her peers in that same classroom. The graduation \nrate, the dropout rate, and the level of academic ability of kids from \nlow-income families in each grade level have been falling back. We have \nleft a lot of children behind even though we spent $120 billion.\n  We have proved unalterably that money cannot solve the problem. If it \ncould solve the problem, it would have significantly improved or we \ncould have at least seen a marginal improvement in academic \nachievement.\n  The President of the United States, President Bush, came into office \nsaying he would change this. He has put forward a series of proposals, \nthe purpose of which is to fundamentally adjust the Federal role as we \npursue the improvement of education of low-income kids. It has four \nbasic themes:\n  First, we will change the Federal role so we don't focus on the \nbureaucracy; we don't focus on the structure; we don't focus on the \nadministration; rather, we focus on the child. That may seem logical. \nOne may ask, aren't we already doing that? No, the money today does not \nflow to the child. The money flows to the school system and the \nbureaucracy. The President said let's look at the child and make our \nprogram child centered.\n  The second thing stressed by this administration and by those on this \nside of the aisle is, let's give the local school districts, the \nparents, the teachers, and the principals, flexibility when they get \nFederal funds.\n  Today and, unfortunately, for a number of years, the Federal \nGovernment, especially the Congress, has believed it knows best how to \neducate the child in Epping, NH, or Tuscaloosa, AL, or in Cheyenne, WY. \nEven though we have never met the children--at least I haven't met the \nones in Cheyenne or Tuscaloosa--we know best how to educate them, so we \nhave attached innumerable strings to the dollars we have sent out for \nthe purpose of helping the low-income children get better educated. We \nhave had program after program that has been categorical; it \nspecifically says what the money should be spent for, who gets it, when \nthey get it, and where they get it.\n  The amount of bureaucracy behind the Federal dollars is absolutely \nstaggering. Some States spend almost two-thirds of their time complying \nwith Federal regulations, which represents 7 percent of their actual \nspending. As a result, we have created a bureaucratic maze of \ndisproportionate complexity. We have strings running out from the desks \nthat intertwine, and we are pulling the strings as they attach to the \npeople who try to teach the kids in the local school districts. The \nPresident has said: Let's cut the strings. We have said on this side: \nLet's cut those strings. Send the money back to the local school \ndistricts. Acknowledge the fact that parents, teachers, and principals \nhave as much or more knowledge of how to educate the local child in \ntheir school system than we do. Let's give them credibility for being \nconcerned about their kids--something this Congress over the years has \nnot been willing to acknowledge. The money will come back in a flexible \nform. That is a proposal the President has suggested.\n\n  The first proposal is that it be child centered. The second proposal \nis that the money be flexible.\n  The third proposal is, in exchange for this new flexibility, in \nexchange for getting the money with very few strings attached, we are \ngoing to ask for one thing. We are going to ask that the children \nlearn, that they have academic achievement levels which reach and \nexceed, hopefully, their peers, that low-income kids are not left \nbehind in the academic world. That is what we will ask. Instead of \ncontrolling all the input and instead of controlling the way the money \ngoes in and how it is spent, we will say, you can take the money, but \nin exchange for taking the money, you have to make sure the children \nlearn; you have to make them academically capable of competing in the \nworld so they have a prosperous life. Academic achievement is what we \nare going to request.\n  The fourth item is an accountability system so we can be assured that \nthere is academic achievement. We are no longer going to allow a system \nto take the low-income child, and especially the minority child, merge \nthem with a peer group of children in the classroom, have the group \nachieve an average score that is acceptable, and say everybody in that \nclassroom is learning. We know that by not doing it that way you end up \nwith a lot of problems being masked by the majority. So we are going to \nrequire disaggregation. We are going to say for different ethnic \ngroups, different racial groups, different income groups, explain \nwhether or not those kids are learning, along with the whole group in \nthe classroom.\n  We are going to put in place a testing regime developed at the local \nlevel, designed at the local level, which simply says, OK, local school \nsystem, decide what a third grader should know, what a fifth grader \nshould know, what a sixth grader should know. Once you decide what that \nthird, fifth, or sixth grader should know in math or English, then make \nsure the kids actually know that. We are not going to tell them what \nthey should know; we are not going to tell them what the standard \nshould be. We are going to say, after you set the standards, we will \nexpect all the kids in that classroom to achieve at the level that \nmeets that standard.\n  That is the system being proposed--four new proposals, four new \nconcepts which merge together to, hopefully, create a system where no \nchild will be left behind: One, that it is child centered; two, that \nthere is flexibility; three, that there is academic achievement; and \nfour, that there is accountability.\n  As we move forward with the debate on this bill, there are going to \nbe a lot of major issues as to how we accomplish those goals. The jury \nis still out. There are ways this bill could be amended on this floor \nwhich would make it hard for me to support, although it came out of the \ncommittee 20-0. But there is good intention, I believe. There is a \ndesire to reach a bipartisan agreement and move it forward. That is \nreflected not only in the committee bill but in the fact that over the \nlast month we have been negotiating, in a very conscientious effort, to \nreach agreement on some of the more difficult issues of policy and the \nmost difficult issue of money.\n  As we go forward in this debate, I hope we understand that we are not \ngoing to be able to change the educational system for everyone in this \ncountry. That is not our role. It is the local school district and the \nStates that control local education, primarily. We do have an \nobligation to do a much better job for low-income kids. We have \nextended into this issue. We have spent $120 billion of American \ntaxpayers' hard-earned income, and we have produced very weak results.\n  It is time for a change. It is time to recognize that we need to take \na different approach to help ensure that the low-income child is not \nleft behind. So we have come up with some creative ideas, and we are \ngoing to try to pass them. We are going to try to pass them in a \nbipartisan way. Then we are going to hope they will be used in the \nsystem to produce a much better result for a large percentage of our \nstudents who, up until now, have been left behind.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nWyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire. Certainly no one in the Senate is more \nknowledgeable than he about the bill, about the funding, and about the \nopportunities we have to strengthen education in this country.\n  This week, as was mentioned, we are going to take up, hopefully, \ncommonsense reform. It means increasing accountability for student \nperformance. It means supporting programs that work, reducing \nbureaucracy, increasing flexibility, and empowering parents. I think \nthese are the goals we seek to attain. Certainly all of us have to \nestablish goals, to establish where we want\n\n[[Page S3776]]\n\nto be, and then, as the details come forth, see if indeed what we are \nproposing to do leads us towards the accomplishment of those goals. I \nthink that is where we are.\n  When we talk to people about the issues in Washington, certainly \neducation is always at the top of the list. In general terms, I want to \nshare a little bit of my view of what we ought to be talking about. It \nseems to me that America stands at the dawn of a new century, a shining \nmoment of opportunity certainly for all of us, a moment of hope that \nour families can, more fully than in the past, achieve the American \ndream. We dream of peace and continued prosperity in a world where \nevery nation looks to America for leadership. We are challenged to \ndevelop new technologies that will improve our lives and find medical \nbreakthroughs to cure cancer and AIDS and Alzheimer's.\n  If America is to fulfill its dreams in a new century, we cannot \nforget that tomorrow's leaders, tomorrow's Nobel prize winners, are \nsitting in the classroom today. We must ask ourselves, do we have a \nfirst-class public education system that teaches our children how to \nthink and how to succeed in this century?\n  Average is not good enough. That is why I am committed to helping \nparents, teachers, and local leaders build a foundation of excellence \nand opportunity for every child. That means making sure all children \nhave the best teachers, can learn in safe schools, and they can learn \nright from wrong in addition to the ABCs.\n  Fifty years ago, the principal obstacles to learning in schools were \ntalking out of turn or chewing gum in class. Today--just turn on the \nnews--it is violence; it is drug abuse; it is teenage pregnancy. Our \ntest scores, as compared to those of children in other countries, are \nstill too low. The achievement gap between poor and middle-income \nstudents is still too wide. Too many students do not read at their own \ngrade level or meet minimum standards in math or science. Too many are \nunfairly promoted and fall further and further behind. Too many enter \ncollege unprepared and have to take remedial courses to improve their \nbasic skills. That is wrong.\n  It does not have to be that way. Republicans at every level--\nCongress, governors, local officials--are committed to help children \nlearn and to build better, safer schools for a new century.\n\n  Education is first, last, and always, of course, about children. \nSuccess is defined by how much our children learn. We must make sure \nparents, teachers, and local leaders have the power to use Federal \ndollars as they are needed to meet our children's most important needs. \nThose closest to the classroom, of course, know better than bureaucrats \nin Washington what the students need, be it more teachers, math and \nreading tutors, better textbooks, or new classrooms and computers.\n  I just returned from Wyoming and have been again reminded of the \ndifference in the needs from Sundance, WY, to Pittsburgh, PA. We ought \nto have the flexibility to do what needs to be done in that community \nto make education the most effective. Who cares more about children's \nfuture, parents or bureaucrats? Our children's future should not be \nlimited by what seems right in Washington, DC but what is wrong with \nthe schools they attend.\n  We are spending more money. Republicans are for spending more money \non education than the President has requested. The issue, as pointed \nout by my friend from New Hampshire, is who sets the priorities. We are \nfor more construction, putting more teachers in schools, putting more \ncomputers into schools, but we believe State and local administrators, \nworking with parents, ought to decide on how to prioritize those issues \nbased on their needs.\n  The Senate will begin debate, probably tomorrow, on the Education \nOpportunities Act, a bill which returns more money, more power, and \nmore flexibility to States and local officials so they can set the \neducational priorities that are right for their students.\n  As you know, the vast majority of money for our schools comes from \nthe State and local governments. The Federal Government provides only \nabout 6 percent of all elementary and secondary education funds. Yet \nthese Federal dollars require more paperwork and carry the most red \ntape.\n  I hear about this often. My wife is a special education teacher in a \npublic high school. Special ed teachers spend more time on forms than \nthey really should have to, almost as much as they do dealing with \nkids. That is wrong. That ought to be changed.\n  Washington has created a system that wastes about 35 cents out of \nevery dollar in bureaucracy. That is money that never reaches the \nclassroom. Recently in the newspapers we read about hundreds of \nmillions of dollars that were unaccounted for, that didn't reach the \nclassroom to help kids. Congress needs to work to make sure the Federal \ndollars actually get where they can be spent and where they can be \neffective, with the fewest possible strings attached.\n  We need more innovators and fewer bureaucrats. Stop and think back to \nyour own education. Each of us can remember at least one teacher who \nmade a positive difference in our lives, a positive impact. Why should \nsuch great teachers be rare?\n  Our children deserve the best teachers, teachers who are qualified, \nteachers who are experts in the subjects they teach. Local officials \nshould be able to set high teacher standards and reward the best \nteachers with more pay.\n  I want not only the best teachers but also the best schools. I am \nsure you do as well. To achieve that goal we must hold schools and \nschool districts accountable. Unfortunately, reports show the schools \nin the District are not what we would like them to be. Madam President, \n75 percent of fourth graders can barely read. Only 5 percent of eighth \ngraders do eighth grade work in math and science. Forty percent of all \nhigh school students drop out before they graduate. That is not good. \nThat is not good at all.\n\n  Just this year, the superintendent announced there were 70,762 \nstudents in the District--the first time, apparently, they have known \nthe total. We need to change that.\n  No child should be trapped in an education system that is unworkable. \nParents have the right to choose the best public school for their \nchild. Students should have the opportunity for scholarships that allow \nthem to escape failing schools. Schools that fail year after year and \nrefuse to change must be overhauled from top to bottom. Administrators \nshould be changed and new teachers should be hired. It is wrong to do \nanything less.\n  We must, of course, do more to make sure our schools do not fail a \ndifferent kind of test--providing for a safe learning environment. We \nshould empower teachers and principals to remove dangerous students \nfrom the classroom. They cannot be allowed to keep other children from \nlearning. Local officials must have the power to put troubled students \nin special classrooms where they can get the attention they need when \nthey need it. None of us want any child to fall through the cracks.\n  We must demand that our schools be safe and drug free. For those \nyoung people who refuse to change or endanger the lives of their \nclassmates or teachers, we need to get tough. If they refuse to change, \nthey must be punished. If they can only learn one lesson, it must be \nthat society's laws mean something.\n  It is a Federal crime to bring a gun to school. In 1998, more than \n6,000 students were expelled for bringing firearms to school, but the \nClinton-Gore administration only prosecuted 8 students--8. What kind of \nsignal does that send?\n  We should not tolerate one more school shooting. When our society \ngets used to it, our society is finished. We all had an exposure to \nthis just last week with the anniversary of Columbine, and it affected \nall our schools and affected the kids who were there.\n  Certainly there is one more thing that ought to be mentioned--it is \nprobably the most important factor in determining a child's success in \nschool--and that is parents. We are the child's first and most \nimportant teachers. The most difficult truth is that the reason our \nschools are failing, sometimes, is because a lot of families are \nfailing to do their part. Teachers are there to teach. They are not \nthere to raise our children. We cannot expect them to be the best \nteachers they can be unless they have the support of mom and dad.\n\n  Nothing is more important to us than education. It is hard to \ndetermine\n\n[[Page S3777]]\n\nsometimes--and we will argue about it at great length--the role of the \nFederal Government vis-a-vis State and local. We will talk about where \nmoney ought to go and what ought to be required in terms of \naccountability. Indeed, we should. But to really know, we should pause \nfor a while and ask: What do we want the outcome to be? What is it that \nwe visualize for ourselves and our family and our community? What do we \nthink education ought to be?\n  We have a responsibility as parents particularly in terms of \ndetermining how that can be accomplished. The role I think for the \nFederal Government is to help provide some additional funding--be it a \nrelatively small percentage. I think it is important we have some kind \nof testing that is common throughout the country as most of our kids \nmove around when they graduate from college or high school. We need to \nensure our schools in Casper, WY, are preparing students as well as \nthey are in Denver or Los Angeles. That is part of today's world.\n  I think we have a great opportunity now for better education, and one \nof which I hope we will certainly take full advantage. As I mentioned \nbefore, the Republican plan puts more money in education than the \nPresident asked for. But money alone does not provide a good education. \nI don't think you can have good education without it, but there are \nother requirements as well.\n  You have to have some accountability and much more.\n  I am delighted and excited about the opportunity to deal with this \nbill, S. 1. Why? Because it was considered to be the most important \nissue before the Congress. This was the issue that the President talked \nmore about than any other and it is the issue that has more to do with \nthe future of this country. The people run the Government. The people \nmust be prepared to do that as well as being successful in a free \ncountry and a free market.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, it is good to be back in the Chamber. I \ndon't think we are going to take all of the 4 hours, from what I \nunderstand, unless somebody wants to join us. I have two unanimous \nconsent requests, both of which the Senator from North Dakota is aware, \nand then I will proceed with a few remarks. It won't be much. Then I \nwill yield, unless he prompts me to give a 2-hour speech, and we will \nbe out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/23/senate-section/article/S3777-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3777-S3782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCONGRESSIONAL BUDGET FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEARS \n                          2001--2011--Resumed\n\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nof April 6 with respect to conferees to the budget resolution be \nmodified to add Senator Bond and Senator Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, pursuant to the agreement of April 6, I \nnow move that with respect to H. Con. Res. 83, the budget resolution, \nthe Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House \non the disagreeing votes thereon, and the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees on the part of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are now 4 hours of debate on that \nmotion.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I don't know why we need 4 hours. If any \nSenator wants to speak to the issue, the appointment of conferees and \nsending the completed package which we voted on, 65 Senators voted aye \non, to the House and seeking a conference agreement with them, that is \nwhy we are here.\n  I understand that under the previous order, we are going to take up \nH. Con. Res. 83 and that either this Senator or the majority leader \nwill be recognized to make a motion that we insist on an amendment--we \nhave just done that--request a conference, which we have done, on the \ndisagreeing votes and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on \nthe part of the Senate. We have done that.\n  We now have 4 hours, which have been agreed to, to debate this issue. \nI don't intend to even come close to spending 2 hours on this matter. \nTo anyone on my side of the aisle, if they want to speak, I will be \nhere for a while, as long as my ranking member wants me to be here by \nvirtue of his speaking. If any Republican wants time, I will give it to \nthem. If we run out of time, I will give some of his people some of my \ntime.\n  Any time I may have, I will reserve at this time. Essentially, I \ndon't need very much of it.\n  Now we are in the process of proceeding to conference on two budget \nresolutions. We begin that process with the appointment of conferees in \nthe Senate. The House has not done that yet. They will appoint their \nconferees tomorrow. It is my hope that the conference can meet as soon \nas the House has appointed its conferees, maybe as early as Wednesday.\n  Over the recess the two staffs of the Budget Committee on the \nmajority side have been meeting to organize the materials for \nconference, to lay out any technical differences that can be resolved \nquickly by the conferees, and to highlight the major differences \nbetween the two resolutions. I am sure that information will be shared, \nand wherever the minority thinks there should be matters changed, added \nto, or in any way described differently, obviously, we will take that \ninto consideration.\n  I don't think there are very many big secrets about the differences \nin the two resolutions. The House budget resolution sticks fairly \nclosely to President Bush's budget submission that was submitted in \nsome detail over the recess period. Everyone knows that over the \nrecess, April 15 came and went, with the American public paying their \ntaxes, with the few exceptions being those who get extensions. Taxes \nare at an all-time high in terms of the totality of collections by the \nU.S. Government. The House budget resolution assumes a tax cut over the \nnext 11 years of over $1.6 trillion.\n  The Senate-passed budget resolution assumes a tax cut of nearly $1.3 \ntrillion over the next 11 years, including this year's $85 billion \nsurplus rebate, or, in some way, a refunding of 85.2, which should be \nimplemented quickly to provide both a stimulus to the economy as well \nas longer term marginal tax rate reductions and whatever else can be \naccomplished by the Finance Committee within the agreed-upon tax \nnumber.\n  It is fair to say that the Senate-passed budget resolution provided \nfor more spending than the House-passed resolution, both in the \nannually appropriated and in the accounts sometimes referred to as \nmandatory spending, or sometimes referred to as entitlement spending.\n  In the area of appropriated accounts, the Senate-passed budget \nresolution provided nearly $688 billion in budget authority, or an 8.3-\npercent increase over current year funding. The House-passed budget \nresolution was at the President's request of about $661 billion.\n  When I use these two numbers, 688 and 661, the 661 is the President's \n4-percent increase. That increase is in the totality of Defense \nappropriations and nondefense appropriations. And so is the $688 \nbillion, in which the Senate approved the 8.3 percent. That includes \nDefense and nondefense.\n  While the increase or changes in the annually appropriated accounts \nhave received the bulk of the attention in this debate so far, I need \nto highlight the fact that the Senate-passed budget resolution \nsignificantly increased spending for programs we refer to as mandatory \nspending, compared to the resolution which I introduced and upon which \nwe commenced our debate, and that is before it was amended. We have \nadded nearly $400 billion in so-called mandatory spending, almost all \nof this in the area of some kind of educational funding, principally \nfunding for special education.\n  Again, almost every dollar we added back for mandatory spending we \ntook away from the President's proposed tax cuts. It should be obvious \nthat the major challenge before the conference will be to find a \ncompromise in both the areas of tax cuts and spending.\n\n[[Page S3778]]\n\n  I don't think it requires a great deal of budget or political skill \nto figure out that an obvious compromise for the House is to reduce its \ntax cuts and increase its spending assumptions, and the Senate to \nincrease its tax cuts and reduce its spending assumptions.\n  Finding that balance will indeed be a challenge, but I am confident \nthat within a week or so we will reach an agreement that meets the \nchallenges of drafting a budget blueprint that will allow us to get on \nwith putting together and implementing legislation to provide a tax \ncut. There will be plenty of time to argue and debate what kind of tax \ncut and what will be affected and how soon.\n  Obviously, we need to consider the reduction of debt held by the \npublic and fund national priorities such as health care, Medicare \nprescription drugs, energy security needs, defense, and environmental \nprograms.\n  Mr. President, at the appropriate time, as I said before, I will \nyield back the remainder of my time. I yield the floor at this point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the chairman of the \nSenate Budget Committee. I think neither of us believes we need 4 hours \nfor this discussion. In fact, we need a relatively brief period of time \non our side. I just want to go through the decisions that were made in \nthe Senate in contrast to what President Bush proposed and in contrast \nto what we proposed on our side, just to put in some perspective where \nwe are going as we go into the conference.\n  I have prepared this chart in order to help me do that in as \nefficient a way as I can. In this column, we have what President Bush \nproposed. The second column is what we proposed in the Democratic \nalternative. The third column is what the Senate passed.\n  If we look at the top, this is the projected surplus over the next 10 \nyears, and we are all in agreement. The agencies that make these \nforecasts have told us we can anticipate $5.6 trillion over the next 10 \nyears. I am quick to point out that I would not bet the farm on any 10-\nyear forecast or any 10-year projection. The agency that made this \nforecast themselves warned us of its uncertainty. They have said very \nclearly there is only a 10-percent chance that number is going to come \ntrue. There is a 45-percent chance that there will be more money, \naccording to them. There is a 45-percent chance there will be less \nmoney.\n  After the performance of the economy over the last 8 weeks, since the \nforecast has been made, I would be willing to bet a lot more money that \nthere is going to be less than what is forecast. With that said, that \nis the official forecast. Then we go to the various elements of the \nproposals by the President, and by us on our side, and what passed the \nSenate.\n  The next major item is the Social Security trust fund. The President \nforecasts $2.6 trillion of Social Security surplus over this next 10 \nyears. He allocates $2 trillion of it to paying down national debt. We \nallocated $2.5 trillion to paying down the debt.\n  By the way, we had a somewhat different estimate by the Congressional \nBudget Office as to the amount of the Social Security trust fund \nsurplus. The President's people said $2.6 trillion. The Congressional \nBudget Office said $2.5 trillion. We are compelled to use the \nCongressional Budget Office numbers. So we have reserved all of the \nSocial Security trust fund money for the Social Security trust fund \nbecause those moneys are not needed immediately. They go to pay down \ndebt. The Senate passed $2.5 trillion.\n  In the Medicare trust fund, the President reserved none of it for the \npurpose of paying down the debt. In fact, he moved all of it--in his \nforecast, it is $526 billion. He moved it to an unallocated category. \nThat is something with which we strenuously disagree. We don't believe \nthat money is unallocated, uncommitted. We believe it is fully \ncommitted to the Medicare trust fund. Unless you use it for that \npurpose, you hasten the insolvency of the Medicare trust fund. So we \ndon't believe it is available for other spending. We don't believe it \ncan be used for any other purpose, nor should it be.\n  So in our alternative--again, there is somewhat of a different \nestimate from the President's, who estimates there is over $500 billion \nin that category, and the CBO estimates $400 billion--we reserve it all \nfor the Medicare trust fund. That is what the final Senate result did \nas well.\n  I should make very clear that while, in total, they reserve the full \namount for the Medicare trust fund, in 4 of the years they have raided \nthe Medicare trust fund. In 2002, 2005, 2006, and 2007, they go into \nthe Medicare trust fund to fund other priorities. We don't support \nthat; we don't believe in it. We don't believe any private sector \ncompany could do such a thing. We don't believe we should be doing it \neither. That left, under the President's proposal $3.6 trillion and \nunder both the Democratic alternative and what passed the Senate, $2.7 \ntrillion available for other uses.\n\n  The President proposed, of the $3.6 trillion in his plan that was \navailable, using $1.6 trillion for a tax cut. We proposed $745 billion. \nThe Senate passed $1.2 trillion--roughly halfway in between the two \nproposals.\n  Then we go to the question of high-priority domestic needs. The \nPresident proposed $212 billion of spending for high-priority areas. We \nproposed on our side $744 billion. The Senate actually passed $849 \nbillion. The Senate actually passed spending of $105 billion over and \nabove what we on the Democratic side proposed. If you look at the \nconstituent elements, you can see the President proposed on education \nover the next 10 years $13 billion--a very modest sum of new money in \nthe President's plan. We don't believe that is sufficient. We proposed \n$139 billion to strengthen education in the country. The Senate \nactually passed $308 billion, which is far more than we proposed and \nobviously dramatically more than the President proposed.\n  On prescription drugs, the President proposed $153 billion over 10 \nyears. We proposed $311 billion, and the Senate actually passed $300 \nbillion, very close to what we suggested.\n  On defense, the President proposed $62 billion above the baseline. We \nproposed $100 billion above the baseline. The Senate actually passed \n$69 billion more than is in the baseline assumption.\n  On agriculture, the President actually proposed a cut of $1 billion. \nWe proposed in our Democratic alternative some $88 billion to match \nwhat our major competitors are doing for their producers or match it as \nclosely as we can under current trade law. One can see the Senate \nactually passed an increase of $58 billion, again somewhere in between \nour proposal and the President's proposal.\n  On health care coverage, the President proposed no new money. We \nproposed $80 billion to expand health care coverage, to begin to cover \nadditional people who now do not have the benefit of health care \ncoverage. The Senate actually passed $36 billion, again somewhere in \nbetween.\n  On environment, the President proposed very substantial cuts, $48 \nbillion in cuts on environmental protection. We proposed an $18 billion \nincrease. The Senate actually passed cuts of $41 billion. We believe \nthat goes too far. We believe that is not wise given the environmental \nthreats we face--clean air, clean water--and this is an area that \nshould be addressed in the conference.\n  In a category we call ``other,'' the President proposed some $33 \nbillion in spending priorities. We proposed $8 billion. The Senate \nactually passed $119 billion, most of that for our Nation's veterans. \nSome $68 billion of what passed in the Senate was for our Nation's \nveterans, $14 billion in home health care, and the rest in other items.\n  Next is the category of strengthening Social Security. This is where \nwe have a very significant difference. The President proposed using \n$600 billion from the Social Security trust fund itself to strengthen \nSocial Security for the long term. We believe that is double counting. \nWe do not believe we can take money from the trust fund itself and use \nit to fund private accounts or anything else. We believe that is double \ncounting, that it hastens the insolvency of the Social Security trust \nfund itself, and that we ought to reserve every penny of the Social \nSecurity trust fund for Social Security, and any additional money to \nstrengthen Social Security should come from outside the trust fund \nitself.\n  That to us is the more conservative approach and one that has more \nprospect of working given the demographic\n\n[[Page S3779]]\n\ntidal wave we face when the baby boomers start to retire. One can see \nunder our alternative and what passed the Senate, neither of us agreed \nto take money from the Social Security trust fund for that purpose.\n  We proposed using non-Social Security, non-Medicare trust fund money \nto strengthen Social Security in the amount of $750 billion. This is \nthe area in which what finally passed is, frankly, most deficient. \nThere is not a dime in what passed in the Senate to strengthen Social \nSecurity for the long term other than reserving the Social Security \ntrust fund surpluses for Social Security. That is important. It is \nnecessary. It is not sufficient. We simply must do more.\n  All of the testimony before the Senate Budget Committee made very \nclear that we face a demographic tidal wave just beyond the 10-year \nwindow of this budget resolution. That is when the chickens are going \nto come home to roost. That is when we see these massive surpluses now \nturning to dramatic deficits. That is why we believe not only should we \nreserve every penny of the Social Security surplus for Social Security, \nbut in addition to that, we ought to take money out of this general \nfund surplus to strengthen Social Security for the long term as well. \nWe believe that is just common sense.\n\n  We hope very much before this conference is done that not only will \nwe reserve the trust fund moneys for the trust funds but that we will \nmake an additional commitment in a contribution from general fund \nsurpluses that are projected.\n  Remember, these are projections. This is not money in the bank. This \n$5.6 trillion is not money in the bank. This is money that is forecast. \nThat is why we think the President's proposal is especially unwise \nbecause he is taking virtually all of the non-trust-fund money and \ncommitting it to a tax cut. We just do not think that is wise. We do \nnot think that is prudent.\n  We do not think any institution, if they were faced with a similar \nset of facts, would make this kind of decision. We do not think they \nwould say we are going to take virtually all of our non-trust-fund \nmoney and put it out in a tax cut or, if you were a private sector \nenterprise, if you were a company promising a shareholder dividend, \nlock it in now for the next 10 years, virtually every penny outside the \ntrust funds for the retirement funds of your employees and the health \ncare trust funds of your employees. That is what the President has \nproposed.\n  Is that really what people would do if they were running a company? \nIs that what they would do? I do not think so. I believe they would pay \ndown their debts to the full extent possible. They would invest in the \nfuture. Yes, they would have a dividend for the shareholders, but they \ncertainly would not commit all of their non-trust-fund money for that \npurpose based on a 10-year forecast that the people who made the \nforecast themselves say is highly uncertain.\n  Then we have the final differences in the interest costs. The \nPresident's interest cost is $461 billion. Ours is $490 billion. The \nSenate-passed package will cost $572 billion.\n  People say to me: Gee, what are you talking about, interest cost? \nWhat is that about?\n  Simply, to the extent we provide a tax cut or we spend money, that \nrequires additional interest costs because to the extent we have a tax \ncut, to the extent we have additional spending, that reduces the amount \nthat is going to pay down the debt. That means we have more debt than \nwe would otherwise have. That means higher interest costs.\n  Most of the President's additional interest cost is generated by his \ntax cut. In fact, his tax cut that is advertised to cost $1.6 trillion \ndoes not cost $1.6 trillion. It costs, just with the interest cost \nassociated with it, at least $2 trillion.\n  Then, of course, there are other things that have not been factored \ninto the President's proposal because we now know that because of his \nproposal we are going to have to reform the alternative minimum tax.\n  The alternative minimum tax currently affects 2 million American \ntaxpayers. Under the President's proposal, 35 million people are going \nto be affected, and it costs over $300 billion to fix it. It is nowhere \nin the President's budget, but we know that cost is there. We know this \nCongress is never going to allow one in every four taxpayers in America \nto be caught up in the alternative minimum tax. It makes no sense. It \nwill not happen, and it should not happen. It costs money to fix it. It \nis not in the President's budget, but it should be because it is a \nhidden cost.\n  In addition to that, there are a whole series of other things the \nPresident has not included that also cost money. We know that certain \ntax breaks currently provided in law are going to be extended. Research \nand development is going to be extended. We certainly are not going to \nchange the energy tax credits that are in current law in the middle of \nan energy crisis, and we should not.\n  That costs money, but it is not in the President's proposal. Oh, it \nis there, it is just not funded, and that is another part of the \nproblem of the President's plan.\n  He imposes a lot of costs, but he doesn't fund them. You can stick \nyour head in the sand and say we will not fund them, but we know the \nreality is different.\n  Finally, on the unallocated category, the President has $845 billion; \nwe propose nothing in the unallocated category. What actually passed \nthe Senate was $129 billion. On the President's side of his $845 \nbillion, I hasten to point out that $526 billion of that is from the \nMedicare trust fund. His unallocated category is really much less than \nis advertised. About two-thirds of that money is Medicare trust fund \nmoney. All of a sudden he uncommits that money. I don't know from where \nthat idea came. You cannot unallocate it. You cannot uncommit it. It is \nfully committed. Doing such a thing as the President proposes moves up \nthe insolvency of the Medicare trust fund by 16 years. By 16 years \nsooner the Medicare trust fund goes broke--sooner than if the money is \nleft where it is supposed to be in the Medicare trust fund.\n  These are the fundamental differences between what President Bush \nproposed, what we proposed on our side, the Democratic alternative, and \nwhat actually passed the Senate. The major differences are in the areas \nwhere the President proposed a tax cut, twice as big as what we \nproposed. On the other hand, we proposed $900 billion more in debt \nreduction than the President proposed. That is the biggest set of \ndifferences between the President and the Democrats. He has a tax cut \nthat is about $800 billion more than ours. We have about $900 billion \nmore in debt reduction than the President. There is the fundamental \ndifference between the two sides.\n  In addition to that, there are also differences in high-riority \nareas. Let's review them. In education, we propose far more in new \nresources for education than does the President. The Senate agreed with \nus. In fact, it went well beyond our proposal.\n  On prescription drugs, we proposed twice as much as the President. \nAnd the Senate adopted a number very close to what we proposed. There \nis no magic to this. There is no secret in it. What the President \nproposed is totally inadequate. Only 25 percent of people who are \nMedicare eligible get any help under the President's plan; 25 percent \nof the people would be helped and 75 percent would not be helped. It is \nno wonder the Senate adopted a number very close to what the Democrats \nproposed. Most objective observers say that is what is necessary to \nprovide a meaningful prescription drug benefit.\n  On defense, we proposed more than the President and more than what \npassed the Senate.\n  On agriculture, the final result was somewhere in between. The \nPresident proposed a cut--a cut when we are in the midst of an \nagricultural crisis. It is the worst we have seen in 50 years. The \nPresident is proposing less resources. He is proposing the Congress not \nbe able to respond as we have in each of the last 3 years to pass an \neconomic disaster bill for our Nation's farmers. It makes no sense. We \npropose to be able to fund what we have been doing the last 3 years, \nand the Senate came somewhere in between.\n  On health coverage, another major difference, the President proposed \nno new resources. We proposed $80 billion. The Senate, again, was \nsomewhere in between.\n  As I see it, those are major differences. Those are the issues that \nwill\n\n[[Page S3780]]\n\nhave to be resolved in a conference committee. The House plan is close \nto what the President proposed.\n  I say to the conferees, you will have to come pretty close to what \nthe Senate passed or the conference report simply will not pass in this \nbody. That tells me we will have to make adjustments. The President's \ntax cut plan will have to be reduced. There will have to be more \nresources for education, prescription drug benefits, our Nation's \ndefense, and agriculture than what the President has proposed and what \nthe House has adopted.\n\n  Also, I hope we come out with a result that is better than what \npassed the Senate or the House with respect to strengthening Social \nSecurity for the long term. Nothing has been done--nothing in the House \nor Senate versions--to strengthen Social Security for the long term. It \nhas gotten almost no attention. It is going to receive attention. It \nwill receive attention at the end of this 10-year period when the baby \nboomers start to retire and the surpluses today turn into massive \ndeficits. That is why we ought to take this opportunity with our \nsurpluses to strengthen Social Security for the future. That is our \nresponsibility. That is our obligation. We ought to take it seriously. \nI hope the conferees will.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, obviously I have on numerous occasions \nin the Senate Chamber discussed these issues, and on many of them I \ndisagree with my friend. On some I agree. I certainly appreciate his \nthoughts as to what kind of conference report we will have to have in \norder for it to pass. He suggests it will have to be close to the \nSenate version. I don't know how anyone expects the House to accept \nsomething like the version passed in the Senate. Nonetheless, we will \nproceed. We will work carefully to make sure we have enough people in \nthe Senate willing to vote on final passage.\n  I certainly don't go there operating on the premise discussed with \nthe ranking member on how to get that done. We have to be careful and \naccept some of the Senate wishes. We certainly don't have to accept \nthem all.\n  I will go back in history for a moment. The Presiding Officer is a \nmember of the committee and will probably recall on January 23 Dr. Alan \nGreenspan appeared before the committee. That was the first testimony \nbefore a committee by Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, \nduring this post-December era, where some serious changes in the \nAmerican economy became very public and notorious. I have confidence \nthat Alan Greenspan is correct in suggesting the ``new'' economy is \nhere to stay and the comeback will be in the new economy along with the \nold economy. The future is built on the new economy which took us \nthrough these years of prosperity and which he assumes will come back \nin due course and lead us to prosperity for a very significant period \nto come.\n  In this budget, we have to decide how we can be helpful. The Federal \nReserve Board seems, to this Senator, to be doing everything it can to \nreduce short-term high interest rates. That is very important. It is \nimportant because it is also affecting long-term rates. Money is being \nmade available. What is thought to be the biggest problem is \ninvestment, capital investments by business--both the new economy \nbusinesses and the old economy businesses. It is thought by some that \nperhaps the new economy has too much inventory around to invest in new \ncapital and new production. We will see. We keep abreast of it as best \nwe can.\n\n  Now, what should we do? The Senate had a vote on a Hollings \namendment. I am not sure we can come out of the House with $85 billion \nfrom this year's surplus because I am not sure they can figure out a \nway to get that to the people. I submit we ought to get this conference \ncompleted; we ought to direct the Finance Committee to start with a tax \ncut plan. Obviously, I don't know from where that will come.\n  We are, under our numbers, the way we figure it, at a tax level of \n1.28. I round that to say 1.3. Every time I say 1.3, I hope everyone \nknows the exact number is 1.28.\n  The House is a little higher than 1.6 in total taxes for a 10-year \nperiod. They don't have very much allowed for this year, the year we \nare in, in which we have a very large surplus for the rest of \nGovernment. It does not take anything out of Social Security or \nMedicare.\n  What ought to happen is we ought to get out of this conference \nquickly, resolve that tax issue, resolve some of the other issues where \nclearly we disagree, and then we ought to prove to the American people \nthat we can get something done. I think getting something done means a \ntax bill that will come out of the Finance Committee under our \nreconciliation instructions, which we debated thoroughly and the Senate \ndecided to do that by a 51-49 vote. We decided our committee would work \nunder the expedited process and get us a tax bill.\n\n  I am very hopeful they will find a way to allocate back to the \nAmerican people as much of the surplus that exists for the year 2001--\nwhich we said in our Senate resolution was up to $85 billion, which \nactually in the resolution I introduced we said up to $60 billion--but \nsomewhere in that area. I hope they will find a way. I hope they will \napply their wills to finding a way to get back in circulation somewhere \nbetween $60 billion and $85 billion, meaning this year Americans will \nget some tax money back in their hands.\n  I do not hear anybody who thinks that is anything but the right thing \nto do. We ought to show the American people we are working in harmony \nwith the Federal Reserve Board to affect the current short-term \nproblems in the economy, hoping if we right them, and if there is a \nway, that will bring into play a long-term growth all of us very much \ndesire for our people.\n  In addition, with that same bill under the expedited process--kind of \nthe hurry-up-and-get-it-done process to show Americans you can do it in \na timely manner, the part which is called reconciliation--I hope we \nwill produce a tax bill for the remainder of whatever we agree upon.\n  In the House they say $1.6 trillion over 11 years. We say $1.3 \ntrillion over 11 years. Whatever the number, I hope they do the early \nstimulus as I have described and then proceed to give us some marginal \nrate reductions.\n  Why did I start with Dr. Alan Greenspan? Because I want to close with \nhim. This year, on January 23, and previously to this on two occasions, \naddressing the issue of surplus and what we should do with it, he said: \nYou should pay the debt down as much as possible, No. 1; No. 2, he did \nnot just say cut taxes, he said reduce or cut marginal tax rates. We \nasked him, How do we help the economy? That was the precursor question \nto the answer I just gave. First, pay down the debt as much as \npossible. Second, reduce or cut marginal tax rates.\n\n  I know a lot of people say: Let's help the economy. But then they \nsay: I don't know about this marginal rate business. We would like to \ndo other things.\n  It would be nice to do other things, but the truth of the matter is \nwe are hearing from the very best that if you do have a surplus that \nyou are going to give back to the people, and you are not in a mode of \ndoing right-now stimulus because we already addressed that issue, do \nthat as much as you can, the answer has been: To help the economy, \nreduce marginal rates.\n  I regret to say what was not said was reduce marginal rates for \nhalfway up the tax structure and not the other half. What has been said \nis reduce the marginal rates. We hope when we are finished under this \nexpedited feature we will get an early stimulus and we will get a bill \nthat helps with the long-term economy in the mode and manner discussed \nby Dr. Greenspan every year for the last three when we addressed \nsurpluses.\n  I do not choose today to get into an argument about how much debt \nreduction is the right amount. My good friend thinks we should have \nmore than we voted in in the Senate, we should have more than I \nprovided in the underlying proposal, and more than the President \nsuggested. But we think we have a very good debt reduction proposal and \nstill can have a good number for tax cuts. We believe when you start \nwith debts--the U.S. Government has debts taking about 17 percent of \nthe budget--and we can say to the public at the end of this time it \nwill be down to between 5 percent and 7 percent, we think we are making \na giant stride in reducing the public debt.\n\n[[Page S3781]]\n\n  I have in my mind showing a pie graph of where the Government money \ngoes. People always say: Why so much to the debt? Because we have a lot \nof debt. How much are you going to reduce it? We are going to reduce it \ndown to where that sliver, that piece, is going to be between 5 percent \nand 7 percent; that is going to be the cost remaining. In my opinion \nthat is exactly what we ought to do.\n  I want to close with one thought. Frankly, I hear the ranking member \nfrom the other side, whom I admire and respect, I hear him talking \nabout whether we want to agree and believe that we have the surplus of \n$5.6 trillion over a decade. I want to remind everybody, when the chips \nare down and you have sitting before you in the committee those who \nhave figured the numbers and the variables on what might be the case, \nwhen you finally ask them which is it going to be, the $11 trillion \nthat it might be or the $1.6 trillion that it might be or the $5.6 \ntrillion--that 50 percent or 75 percent, I think, where the lines end \nup when you do a model and ask them--if you have to decide which one is \nright the answer is, use $5.6 trillion.\n  We can do anything we would like. We could use $2 trillion as the \nstarting point and say that is all we can expect. Some might say, \ninstead of $5.6 trillion, you ought to use $7.5 trillion or $8 trillion \nbecause it could be much higher. I think the number that has been \nchosen, $5.6 trillion, from which you will pay Medicare for sure, from \nwhich you will pay for all the Social Security indebtedness that we \nhave--every penny that belongs in that trust fund is used to pay that \ndebt down--when you end up doing that, I think you have a very balanced \npackage and that leaves open the issue of how much do we spend.\n  Those who are interested have seen the divergence of how we spend, \nhow we spend under what I will call the Democratic proposal, how we \nwould do it under the Domenici proposal, and how we would do that under \nthe proposal that passed the Senate. Clearly, in the Senate, many \namendments were accepted on the side of either entitlements or \nappropriation expectations--the amount we can use in appropriations. \nMany were accepted on the floor and nobody should believe we are going \nto take all of those and accept them all in a conference with the House \nwhich has started with the President's number. There has to be some \ngive and some take. I think that will happen.\n  I look forward to chairing the conference in a spirit of getting it \ndone as quickly as we can so we can get on with passing the bills that \nwill carry it out and stopping as quickly as we can the debate of what \nwe ought to do and get into a mode of what we are going to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, there is clearly an area of major \nagreement between the two sides. That is the need for fiscal stimulus \nnow. We had in our budget resolution $60 billion in budget stimulus \nthis year, in the year 2001. Maybe it will be helpful for people to \nunderstand the differences between what I was talking about and the \nbudget for the years 2002 through 2011. But we are in the year 2001 \nright now. So when we compare the tax cut under the Bush budget and our \nproposal and what passed the Senate, we are talking about the 10 years \nfrom 2002 through 2011. The President proposed $1.6 trillion. For that \nperiod we proposed $745 billion. The Senate passed something roughly in \nbetween. But this does not cover the year 2001, the year we are in \nright now.\n  Both Senator Domenici in his budget proposal, and me in ours, \nproposed $60 billion of budget stimulus this year, financial stimulus \nthis year, fiscal stimulus now to give a lift to this economy. What \nactually passed the Senate was even more generous, $85 billion of \nfiscal stimulus for the year 2001.\n  What Senator Domenici is saying is perhaps we cannot do quite that \nmuch in conference, and perhaps we cannot. But we do have $96 billion \navailable outside of the trust funds of Medicare and Social Security, \nso we know we have budgeted already enough money to accommodate a \nfiscal stimulus of up to $85 billion without invading the trust funds \nof Medicare and Social Security, and we are obviously in very close \nagreement on this question. I think the American people should take \nheart from that, that we are going to be working together, fighting \ntogether, trying to put together a fiscal stimulus package for this \nyear, the year we are in right now, 2001, to get out to the American \npeople to give some lift to this economy. And that would be a good \nthing to do.\n\n  The chairman made mention of a number of other issues that we have \ntalked about in the past--how much debt reduction can you do? We have a \ndisagreement on this question. We believe we can do more debt reduction \nthan they have proposed, certainly than the President has proposed.\n  I note that the Senate agreed with our position. The Senate provided \na good deal more debt reduction than the President has said that he \nbelieves is possible. That was a good outcome. I hope we do not shrink \nfrom that.\n  But the place we really did not do as well is in strengthening Social \nSecurity for the long term above and beyond the trust funds themselves. \nAll of us know just saving the trust fund money for the purposes \nintended is important, but it is not enough.\n  That is why on our side we believe not only should we reserve all of \nthe trust fund money for the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, \nbut then, in addition to that, we ought to take some of the general \nfund money and use that to strengthen Social Security for the long term \nbecause that is what it is going to take to do the job and to prevent a \nmassive buildup of debt from occurring.\n  I think one thing that often gets lost in the debate is the current \nindebtedness of our country. The gross debt is $5.6 trillion. Under the \nPresident's plan, the gross debt of the United States is going to grow \nto $7.1 trillion. The gross debt, under his plan, is not going to be \nreduced; it is going to grow. Under our plan, we are able to keep it \nabout where it is because we are putting more money into debt \nreduction--both short-term and long-term--than is in the President's \nplan. We believe that is a wiser course.\n  We are reserving about 70 percent of this projected surplus for debt \nreduction. He reserves about 35 percent of the projected surplus for \ndebt reduction. So that is the major difference. That is where we \nreally have a difference of opinion.\n  We think we ought to put more emphasis on debt reduction because, \nfrankly, given the uncertainty of the forecast--and that is another \narea where we have a disagreement. Senator Domenici says $5.6 trillion \nis the number. Well, he is right in the sense that is the number that \nhas been given to us by the Congressional Budget Office and the Office \nof Management and Budget. That is a very professional forecast. I will \nnot argue with that for a minute. It is well done. But it is a 10-year \nprojection--10 years. The people who made the forecast said there is \nonly a 10-percent chance that number is going to come true.\n  Let's not cast that in concrete. Goodness, that should inform us; it \nshould not lock us into decisions to use every penny of that money. I \nthink what it should tell us is that we should be cautious. That is why \nwe put a greater emphasis on debt reduction because, then, if the \nforecast does not come true, the worst that has happened is you have \nreduced the debt less than you anticipated. That is the worst that \nhappens.\n  Under their plan--because they are using all the money, between their \ntax cut and other priorities--what happens if that isn't true? It risks \nputting us back into deficit. It risks us raiding the trust funds of \nSocial Security and Medicare all over again. Goodness knows, we have \nbeen down that road. Do we have to repeat the 1980s all over again? I \nhope not. Can't we learn from the 1980s--the time we had a rosy \nforecast like this one, had a big tax cut, big defense buildup, and \nwondered why the deficits and debts of the country multiplied \ngeometrically? I do not want to repeat that exercise. That put our \ncountry in a deep hole. It took us 15 years to dig out. I do not want \nto be digging out for the next 15 years.\n\n  The difference between the 1980s and now is that in the 1980s you had \ntime to dig out. If we make a mistake now, there is no time to dig out \nbecause in 11 years the baby boom generation starts to retire, and then \nthese surpluses turn into big deficits as the number of people eligible \nfor Medicare\n\n[[Page S3782]]\n\nand Social Security double. That is what is going to happen. We know \nit. It is not a projection. The people are alive. They have been born. \nThey are living today. They are going to retire, and they are going to \nbe eligible. And it is going to cost the Government a lot of money, \nmuch more than we are currently having to pay out.\n  So let's be cautious. Yes, let's be conservative. The conservative \nthing to do is emphasize more debt reduction and to curtail our \nappetite to spend and curtail our appetite to have tax cuts, which are \nboth living for the moment. It is fun to live for the moment; \nespecially if you are a politician, there is nothing better than to \nhave tax cuts and spending. That is the best of all worlds. The problem \nwith that is that we have a need to be responsible to future \ngenerations. Our generation ran up this debt. We have the obligation to \npay it down and to do it before we start to retire. Goodness, the last \nthing we ought to be doing is shoving this debt on to our kids. We ran \nit up. We ought to retire it.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. Mr. President, I have nothing further to say. I do not \nthink there is anyone on our side who wishes to speak. If the Senator \nis ready, we can yield back our time.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes. We are prepared to yield back our time on our side.\n  Mr. DOMENICI. I yield back any time we have reserved under the \nprevious order.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I do as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as chairman of the Senate Caucus on \nInternational Narcotics Control, I rise to highlight some of the recent \ninterdiction and investigative successes by the men and women of the \nDrug Enforcement Administration, DEA, the United States Customs \nService, the United States Coast Guard, and the National Guard.\n  These men and women, and their agencies, are dedicated professionals \ncommitted to protecting our great nation from the devastating affects \nof the illegal drug trade. They are frequently called to place their \nlies in harm's way in an effort to keep our national secure.\n  As announced by the Attorney General in January 2001, DEA \nsuccessfully concluded a 10-month narcotics trafficking investigation \nnamed Operation White Horse, that involved the movement of heroin by \n``swallowers'' from Colombia to the United States via the cities of \nPhiladelphia and New York. Sixty-five members of the organization, from \nthe Colombia headquarters of the street-level dealers, were arrested in \nwhat was described as a ``wholesale dismantling'' of the smuggling \norganization.\n  The United States Customs Service also had an impressive spring 2001, \nincluding a recent week on the Southwest border that netted 61 drug \nseizures, yielding 5,449 pounds of marijuana and 82 pounds of cocaine, \nas well as 16 export violations, 6 seizures of prohibited medications, \nand additional seizures of undeclared merchandise, stolen vehicles, \ncounterfeit credit cards, and illegal fireworks. The Customs Service is \nrapidly distinguishing itself with the front-line use of X-ray, Gamma-\nray, and other non-intrusive technologies at their inspection stations \nand ports of entry. Customs also completed major domestic and \ninternational child pornography cases involving Germany and Russia, as \nwell as continued interdiction of large amounts of the drug Ecstasy.\n  Coast Guard successes, supported by the Department of Defense, \ninclude a 6-day period in February 2001 when it seized 28,845 pounds of \ncocaine and arrested 24 smugglers, on numerous vessels in both the \nCaribbean and Eastern Pacific. To date, the Coast Guard has seized \n60,636 pounds of cocaine, 20,194 pounds of marijuana, as well as \ninterdicted 1,681 illegal migrants at sea, all in a period of 10-\npercent operational reductions due to budget constraints.\n  Finally, I appreciate the superb job the National Guard does in \noperating the four domestic counterdrug training schools, and hopefully \nsoon a fifth one in Iowa, throughout the country that provide much \nneeded training of Federal, State, local, and community personnel in \nvarious counterdrug topics.\n  I am extremely proud of these successes and the personnel involved. \nAs we consider the budgets for these agencies in the weeks ahead, we \nneed to remind ourselves from time to time that it is real, flesh-and-\nblood individuals out there on the front lines and not bland numbers on \nspreadsheets and in our briefing books. Their commitment does us all \nproud.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/23/senate-section/article/S3782-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3782-S3783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NURSING SERVICES QUALITY IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on April 6 my colleagues and I introduced \nthe Medicare and Medicaid Nursing Services Quality Improvement Act of \n2001. This legislation is intended to help address a problem currently \nfacing nursing homes in North Dakota and Wisconsin and potentially \nother nursing homes across the country.\n  We all know that nursing homes nationwide are facing a looming \nstaffing crisis that is expected to worsen as the baby boomers reach \nretirement. An American Health Care Association report, entitled \n``Staffing of Nursing Services in Long Term Care,'' estimates that the \nneed for registered nurses will grow 66 percent between 1991 and 2020 \nand the number of licensed practical nurses needed will grow by nearly \n72 percent over the same time. Likewise, the number of nurse aides who \nwill be necessary is projected to grow by 69 percent.\n  In my State, nursing home administrators have a thousand open nurse \naide positions that they have been unable to fill. A number of nursing \nhome administrators in North Dakota have told me that they have had to \nrefuse patients because they do not have adequate staff to care for \nthem.\n  Unfortunately, a problem has arisen in my State that will exacerbate \nthis staffing shortage. By way of background, North Dakota nursing \nhomes have been using trained resident assistants --called feeding \nassistants in North Dakota,--to help feed nursing home patients. This \nhas been the practice for the last decade with positive results. The \ndata in North Dakota indicates that our nursing home patients \nexperience less weight loss and dehydration than patients nationally, \nand nursing home officials in North Dakota attribute this to the use of \nresident assistants.\n  The problem, however, is that the Health Care Financing \nAdministration has told North Dakota and other nursing homes that they \ncan no longer continue to use these trained resident assistants because \nthey lack certification. In North Dakota, this means that hundreds of \nresident assistants may need to be laid off later this year, even while \nmy State's nursing homes are experiencing difficulty finding certified \nstaff.\n  The bill that I introduced along with Senators Kohl and Conrad would \nallow\n\n[[Page S3783]]\n\nNorth Dakota and Wisconsin to continue using resident assistants for \nfeeding and hydration, while a demonstration project is conducted in \nour states and others to evaluate what kind of impact the use of these \nstaff has on the quality of feeding and hydration services provided to \nnursing home patients and on the recruitment and retention of nursing \nstaff. If after the three-year demonstration project, the Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services determines that the use of resident \nassistants does not result in a reduction in the quality of feeding and \nhydrating of nursing home residents or in a decrease in the recruitment \nand retention of nursing staff, other nursing homes around the country \nwould be allowed to use resident assistants to help with feeding and \nhydration tasks.\n  This legislation includes a number of safeguards designed to protect \nnursing home patients. For instance, nursing homes are prohibited from \nusing resident assistants to replace existing nursing staff or to count \nthese assistants toward minimum nursing staffing requirements. In \naddition, resident assistants would have to complete a state-approved \ntraining program related to the feeding and hydration tasks they would \nbe performing. Of course, nursing homes would not be able to use \nresident assistants to administer medication, provide direct medical \ncare, or perform other nursing tasks.\n  I recognize that this bill is not the only answer or the whole answer \nfor addressing the staffing crisis in nursing homes. I want to work \nwith my colleagues in Congress, nursing homes, and advocates for \nnursing home residents to address this larger issue of the staffing \nshortage.\n  The staffing shortage in nursing homes is not the only reason for \nmalnutrition and dehydration of patients, but it certainly contributes \nto the problem. A June, 2000 Commonwealth Fund study estimated that 35 \nto 85 percent of nursing home patients are malnourished, in part \nbecause they do not receive enough assistance from aides while eating \nbecause the aides must assist as many as 15 to 20 patients at mealtime. \nAccording to a Los Angeles Times article earlier this week, a \nUniversity of California-San Francisco professor who observed 100 \nnursing home residents with eating problems found that nursing home \nworkers were often so rushed that they ``shoveled'' food into their \npatients' mouths, causing choking and coughing.\n  The resident assistants in North Dakota provide compassionate care \nand often have more time to coax their patients into eating, something \nthat overworked certified nurse aides generally don't have time for. I \nam convinced that if we reduce the number of staff in North Dakota \nnursing homes, which is what will happen if long-term care facilities \ncan no longer use resident assistants, then patients in North Dakota \nwill suffer.\n  One resident assistant in North Dakota told me about a patient she \nfeeds who has difficulty holding her head up when she eats. The \nresident assistant said that when she was on vacation, her patient lost \nseven pounds.

Mr President, I rise today as the Chairman of the \nSubcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee to speak to S. Res. 66.\n  As we are all now aware, at 9:15 a.m. local time on April 1, 2001, a \ncollision occurred between a United States military EP-3E Aries II \nreconnaissance aircraft flying off the coast of the People's Republic \nof China, PRC and one of two F-8 jet fighters from the People's \nLiberation Army-Air Force sent to intercept it. Both countries agree \nthat the collision occurred in international airspace over the South \nChina Sea near the Chinese island province of Hainan. Due to the damage \nincurred in the accidental collision, the F-8 and its pilot were lost \nat sea and the EP-3E was required to make a ``Mayday'' distress call on \nthe internationally recognized emergency radio frequency.\n  In fact, the damage to our plane was so bad that it effectuated an \nemergency landing at a military airbase at Lingshui, Hainan. Upon \nlanding, the twenty-four United States military personnel aboard the \nEP-3E were removed from the aircraft by Chinese military personnel and \ndetained in an undisclosed location, notwithstanding the fact that the \ncrew of an aircraft forced to land on foreign soil in an emergency is \nconsidered under international norms to have sovereign immunity.\n  Chinese authorities then unnecessarily prevented United States \nmilitary and consular officials from meeting with the crew members \nuntil April 3, 2001, and even then permitted only a short, supervised \nvisit. There is absolutely no reason why we should not have been \nallowed at the very least telephone access to our military people. \nChina is not a technologically backward country without phone service; \nour people are not being held in some isolated mountain village in the \nmiddle of a jungle. China's behavior in this case in purposefully \nkeeping us from contacting the aircrew is, to me, disturbing.\n  In addition, I am also concerned that in contravention of \ninternational norms, Chinese officials have boarded the aircraft and \nhave apparently removed portions of the equipment from it. \nInternational law recognizes both the right of the crew of an aircraft \nin distress to land safely on foreign soil and the inviolable \nsovereignty of an aircraft in distress that has landed on foreign soil; \nit also recognizes the right of a nation which has had an aircraft land \nin distress on foreign soil to have its citizens and aircraft returned \nsafely and without undue delay.\n  China's flaunting of these conventions disturbs me not just because \nof the ramifications in this particular case, but also because it has \nthe capability of wrecking greater havoc on the overall bilateral US-\nPRC relationship, a relationship I believe to be our most important in \nAsia along with Japan and South Korea. The Chinese government needs to \nrealize that this issue is bigger than just this crew and this plane. \nThis is about trust, about whether the PRC can be trusted to live up to \nits word, to live up to international agreements which it has signed, \nand to be a part of the world community of nations. So far, they have \nturned their backs on those agreements, and on their obligations. They \nhave shown me, and other Members of Congress, that whether they can be \ntrusted is presently open to question.\n  If this matter is not resolved immediately and satisfactorily, then \nthe Congress needs to rethink whether Beijing can be trusted to fulfill \nits obligations as a member of the WTO. And while I have previously \nstated that I believe it would be a mistake to include such materiel as \nAegis-equipped destroyers in this year's weapons sales to Taiwan, if \nBeijing remains intransigent and continues to violate norms of decent \ninternational behavior in this case, then I--for one--will begin to \nreassess whether Taiwan is not justified in its mistrust of the PRC and \nwhether such sales might not now be justified. It would truly be a \nshame if, at the beginning of a new Administration, an Administration \nthat has not even had a chance yet to formulate or articulate its China \npolicy, this situation poisoned the well.\n  The resolution is simple. It expresses our regret over the damage to \nthe aircraft and the loss of life resulting from the collision. It \ncalls on the Chinese government to release the crew, who are, of \ncourse, utmost in our thoughts and concern; the aircraft, and the \nequipment from the aircraft. Finally, it supports President Bush in his \nefforts. I am pleased that the resolution has a bipartisan list of \nseventy-five cosponsors, including the ranking member of the East Asia \nSubcommittee [Mr. Kerry]; the very distinguished\n\n[[Page S3784]]\n\nPresident pro tempore [Mr. Thurmond]; the distinguished chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee [Mr. Warner]; the Chairman of the Energy \nCommittee [Mr. Murkowski]; three members and the ranking minority \nmember of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee: the distinguished \nSenator from Indiana [Mr. Lugar], Mr. Smith of Oregon and Mr. \nBrownback, and Senator Biden; two Senators who I consider among the \nmost knowledgeable on China in the Senate, Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Baucus; and one of our newest members, Senator Clinton.\n  I hope that we will act to put the Senate on record on this issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/23/senate-section/article/S3784-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       THE VERY BAD DEBT BOXSCORE\n\n  Mr. HELMS.

Mr. President, 25 years ago the National Medical \nAssociation and other prominent organizations endorsed the development \nof the Medical School at Morehouse College in Atlanta, GA. This came in \nlight of studies that revealed first, a severe shortage of African \nAmerican and other minority physicians in the United States, \nparticularly in Georgia and second, that African Americans suffered \ndisproportionately from major diseases. Since its inception, Morehouse \nSchool of Medicine has worked to help solve our nation's health care \ncrisis by graduating top-quality physicians who dedicate themselves to \nserving the more than 32 million people in this country who live in \nmedically neglected communities. More than 80 percent of Morehouse \nSchool of Medicine graduates practice in underserved communities. Each \nyear, the School graduates five times the national average of African \nAmericans completing their studies at accredited medical schools in \nthis country.\n  Since 1975, Morehouse School of Medicine has grown from an entry \nclass of 25 students to a current 40 students per class. Each year, \nover 20,000 Georgians who are disadvantaged are served by approximately \n50 community health promotion projects sponsored by Morehouse School of \nMedicine. These projects include prevention initiatives associated with \nsubstance abuse, teen pregnancy, geriatric services, cancer, lead \npoisoning and violence prevention. In addition to the Medical School's \nactivities in community health promotion, Morehouse School of Medicine \nprovides about 25,000 patient encounters for approximately 10,000 \npeople per year in community clinics throughout metropolitan Atlanta \narea. The student body of Morehouse School of Medicine continues to \nexcel and 100 percent of the institution's family medicine and surgery \nresidents passed their board exams in their first sitting for 2 years \nin a row.\n  These accomplishments stem in part from the strong leadership of \nMorehouse School of Medicine's founding dean and president, Louis W. \nSullivan, M.D., who has been with the Medical School since its \ninception. Aside from his years in Washington as U.S. Secretary of \nHealth and Human Services, Dr. Sullivan has dedicated his life's work \nto producing top-quality physicians. During his tenure, Morehouse \nSchool of Medicine established several programs. These include a 4-year \nundergraduate medical education program, seven residency programs and \nseveral centers of excellence including the National Center for Primary \nCare, the Neuroscience Institute, the Cardiovascular Institute and the \nNASA/Space Medicine and Life Science Research Center, the first of its \nkind at a minority medical institution.\n  Dr. Sullivan has worked tirelessly to provide vision and direction \nfor the institution's future, while continuing to preserve the very \nbest traditions of its past. Morehouse School of Medicine, the State of \nGeorgia and our Nation are truly blessed to have his \nleadership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/23/senate-section/article/S3784-3", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   TRIBUTE TO THE POSTAL EMPLOYEES OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PERFORMANCE \n                                CLUSTER\n\n Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire.

A resolution adopted by the House of the Legislature \n     of the State of Kansas relative to the assistance with Gulf \n     War Illness; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                       House Resolution No. 6008\n\n       Whereas, Nearly 700,000 members of the United States armed \n     forces, including 7,500 Kansans, deployed to the Persian Gulf \n     region during 1990 and 1991 to participate in Operation \n     Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm to liberate Kuwait; \n     and\n       Whereas, These Gulf War veterans have been, and continue to \n     be, afflicted by an abnormally high rate of unexplained \n     health problems. To date federal research efforts have not \n     identified the prevalence, patterns, causes or treatments for \n     illnesses suffered by Gulf War veterans. Yet thousands of our \n     veterans continue to suffer from a variety of chronic \n     symptoms; and\n       Whereas, The Kansas Persian Gulf War Veterans Health \n     Initiative, a project of the Kansas Commission on Veterans \n     Affairs, primarily through the efforts of Dr. Lea Stelle, has \n     completed a scientific study of 2,000 Kansas Gulf War \n     veterans with the results being published in the American \n     Journal of Epidemiology. Major findings of this study \n     include:\n       Kansas Gulf War veterans have significantly more health \n     problems than veterans who served in other areas. The study \n     results indicate these conditions may have been caused by \n     multiple factors.\n       A pattern of chronic symptoms, Gulf War illness, was \n     identified. Thirty-four percent of Kansas Gulf War veterans \n     report a pattern of chronic symptoms that include joint pain, \n     respiratory problems, neuropsychologic difficulties, \n     diarrhea, skin rashes, and fatigue. Veterans with Gulf War \n     illness experience a pattern of multiple types of symptoms \n     that can persist for years, problems that can be severe and \n     disabling for some veterans.\n       The rates of Gulf War illness can be linked to where and \n     when veterans served in the Persian Gulf region. Veterans who \n     served on board ship had the lowest rates (21%), with higher \n     rates in veterans who had been stationed in support areas of \n     Saudi Arabia (31%), and highest rates in veterans who were in \n     Iraq or Kuwait (42%). In addition, veterans who served only \n     during Desert Shield have a low rate of illness (9%), while \n     those who were in the Persian Gulf region several months \n     after the war ended have higher rates (36-43%).\n       Veterans who did not deploy to the Persian Gulf, but \n     reported getting vaccines during the war, may have some of \n     the same health problems as Gulf War veterans; and\n       Whereas, While it has been established that Gulf War \n     veterans suffer from an abnormally high rate of unexplained \n     health problems, the cause, or causes of these varied \n     conditions have not been determined, and the system for \n     providing care and treatment of these veterans has been \n     inadequate or nonresponsive to the conditions presented; and\n       Whereas, Gulf War illness has had a severe negative impact \n     on the physical and emotional well-being of Gulf War \n     veterans, and has affected their ability to work, yet \n     adequate compensation for these conditions has not been \n     received by these veterans; and\n       Whereas, Service connected illnesses have not be addressed \n     adequately for veterans of past wars and conflicts: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of \n     Kansas, That we memorialize the President and the Congress of \n     the United States to provide funding for Gulf War illness \n     research independent of that administered by the United \n     States Departments of Defense and Veterans Affairs; and to \n     establish a process of independent review of federal policies \n     and programs associated with Gulf War illness research, \n     benefits, and health care; and be it further\n       Resolved, That we urge further assistance to veterans \n     afflicted with Gulf War illness, whether by the Department of \n     Defense, Department of Veterans Affairs or another designated \n     organization, to provide badly needed health care, vocational \n     assistance and disability compensation; and that there be \n     public service announcements informing veterans across the \n     nation of the findings of this research and informing the \n     veterans of the programs that are available to help them; and \n     be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the House of \n     Representatives be directed to provide an enrolled copy of \n     this resolution to the President of the United States, the \n     Vice-President of the United States, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the Secretary of \n     Defense, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, and to each \n     member of the Kansas Congressional delegation; to the \n     Governor of the State of Kansas, the Secretary of Health and \n     Environment, the Secretary of Human Resources, and the \n     Chairman of the Kansas Commission on Veterans Affairs; and to \n     the National and State Commanders of the American Legion, the \n     Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Disabled American Veterans, \n     National Retired Officers Association, National Retired \n     Enlisted Association and the National Order of the Purple \n     Heart.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-10.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Kansas relative to life time health care \n     benefits for military retirees and their families; to the \n     Committee on Armed Services.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 5011\n\n       Whereas, Insomuch as many of our citizens have risen to the \n     defense and safeguard of our state and nation, this \n     Concurrent Resolution of support and honor recognizes those \n     individuals who unselfishly served our state and nation as \n     they defended our democratic way of life and the freedoms set \n     down by the founding fathers of this nation; and\n       Whereas, The state of Kansas through its Legislature \n     acknowledges and recognizes the contribution these veterans \n     of military service have made to the estate of all our \n     citizens, and we ask the Congress of the United States to \n     acknowledge these retired veterans by continuing to support \n     and improve their quality of life through extended health \n     care; and\n       Whereas, This population of retired veterans served during \n     foreign and domestic crises of the 20th century, where their \n     involvement with names such as Ardennes, Wake, Guadalcanal, \n     Normandy, Bastogne and Iwo Jima earned our nation's highest \n     respect and accolades; while other names not so common to \n     America were added during the Korean conflict, like Inchon \n     and Choson; later came other Asian names like DaNang, Khe \n     Sanh, Hue and Quang Tri; places these retired veterans know \n     all too well as a battleground which tested their will to \n     survive and return; and\n       Whereas, These retired veterans now constitute a \n     significant portion of the aging population in this country \n     and, in particular, our state; and\n       Whereas, These retired veterans were guaranteed through \n     contract, both stated and implied, lifetime access to medical \n     benefits for themselves and their immediate family members \n     upon retirement for serving their nation unselfishly and \n     honorably for 20 years or more; and\n       Whereas, Prior to retirement at age 65 years, this \n     population of our citizenry were provided health care service \n     through the military health care system or through other U.S. \n     Department of Defense programs; however, upon reaching the \n     age of 65 years and through recent Federal regulatory changes \n     in entitlements for military health care benefits, these \n     individuals that served and their family members, lost \n     significant portions of their health care support system; and\n       Whereas, The medical benefits which were lost through \n     changes to Federal legislation forced these retired veterans \n     to pay out-of-pocket for medical coverage from alternative \n     sources; and those changes forced these citizens into omnibus \n     national health care programs, such as Medicare; and\n       Whereas, Many retired veterans and their immediate family \n     members live on fixed incomes where the loss of medical \n     benefits significantly impacts their quality of life, \n     disrupts their needed levels of care and puts out of reach \n     certain health care capabilities and pharmaceutical support \n     to which they had been previously entitled; and\n       Whereas, Many of these retired veterans suffering from \n     service connected injuries, serious illnesses, or medically-\n     related quality of life developments have found that their \n     access to medical treatment facilities is now limited due to \n     significant downsizing or in many rural areas has become \n     nonexistent; and\n       Whereas, These honorable men and women of Kansas and of \n     this nation who have sacrificed in the uniformed service of \n     our country are deserving of the health care programs to \n     sustain their quality of life that they were guaranteed for \n     20 or more years of unselfish service; and\n       Whereas, The Legislature of the state of Kansas has a \n     special charge to safeguard and maintain the quality of life \n     for its citizens that have served and earned a retirement \n     from military service: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the State of \n     Kansas, the Senate concurring therein, That the Kansas \n     Legislature respectfully requests and petitions its \n     Congressional representatives of the United States to \n     address, for rectification, the aforementioned concerns \n     regarding the health care coverage of our retired military \n     veterans and their immediate families; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Secretary of State is hereby directed to \n     send enrolled copies of this resolution to the President of \n     the United States, the president pro tempore of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives \n     and to each member of the Kansas Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-14. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Wyoming relative to using Wyoming Powder River \n     Basin super compliant coal, to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                            Joint Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the United States, generally and the western \n     states specially are experiencing severe energy shortages, \n     particularly a shortage of electrical energy; and\n       Whereas, new energy generation facilities are urgently \n     needed to prevent these shortages and the damaging \n     consequence of these shortages as they permeate the economy; \n     and\n       Whereas, in recent years the timely construction of these \n     necessary facilities has been obstructed through endless \n     litigation and other delaying tactics; and\n       Whereas, the majority of people of the State of Wyoming \n     desire to pursue sound energy and economic development; and\n       Whereas, Wyoming is richly endowed with natural resources, \n     including Powder River Basin super compliant coal and Wyoming \n     gas and oil that could solve the pending electrical energy \n     supply crisis: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved By The Members of the legislature of the State of \n     Wyoming:\n       1. That the President, the Vice-President, the Congress and \n     the Executive Branch of the federal government are urged to \n     immediately secure the construction of critically needed new \n     electric generation facilities, oil, and gas pipeline and \n     transmission facilities using Wyoming Powder River Basin \n     super compliant coal, Wyoming gas and other available Wyoming \n     natural resources.\n       2. That the United States Congress is urged to enact any \n     legislation that will support the construction of energy and \n     electric generation facilities, transmission facilities and \n     gas pipelines.\n       3. That the Secretary of State send copies of this \n     resolution to the President of the United States, the Vice-\n     President of the United States, the President of the United \n     States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of \n     Representatives, the United States Secretary of Energy and \n     the Wyoming Congressional Delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-15.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania relative to \n     the metal industry; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                              A Resolution\n\n       Whereas, Metal manufacturing is integral to the economy of \n     the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, employing over 72,900 \n     workers in the primary metal industry and 86,200 workers in \n     the fabricated metal products industry; and\n       Whereas, The American steel industry holds an important \n     place in the history of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for \n     its contribution to business and industry; and\n       Whereas, The American steel industry plays a vital role in \n     our national security, which depends on a strong domestic \n     steel economy, and in our national defense, which relies on a \n     strong steel manufacturing base, and is of paramount concern \n     for America and our allies; and\n       Whereas, The specialty steel industry, which includes \n     stainless steel, tool steel and other alloyed metal steel, \n     holds an important position in the economic and industrial \n     history of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the United \n     States and has made significant improvements to restructure, \n     modernize and become a world leader in productivity and \n     competitiveness; and\n       Whereas, The current economic and financial crises in \n     Russia, Asia and other foreign nations have involved severe \n     devaluation of the currencies of several primary steel-\n     producing and steel-consuming countries along with a collapse \n     in the domestic demand for steel and specialty steel in these \n     countries; and\n       Whereas, The crises have generated and will continue to \n     generate surges of steel imports into the United States, \n     flooding the American market with foreign steel and foreign \n     steel products at prices severely below production cost, \n     thereby disadvantaging the American steel industry and its \n     workers and families in the marketplace while the United \n     States, through the International Monetary Fund, continues to \n     participate in a massive financial bailout of these countries \n     in a manner that encourages exports; and\n       Whereas, Imports of specialty steel from foreign producers \n     are being dumped into this country in large quantities at \n     unfair, below-market prices, contributing significantly to \n     reduced earnings and reductions in employment for American \n     workers; and\n       Whereas, The dumping of stainless steel plate in coils and \n     other specialty steel products is prevalent in the United \n     States market, causing an adverse impact on domestic steel \n     production and the thousands of jobs in this Commonwealth and \n     the United States associated with the regular and specialty \n     steel industry; and\n       Whereas, Recent reports confirm that this country is headed \n     for a downturn in the\n\n[[Page S3788]]\n\n     economy, thereby requiring prompt Federal action and \n     initiatives; and\n       Whereas, Recent reports confirm that 14 steel companies \n     have filed for bankruptcy protection, and the impact of this \n     problem goes well beyond one industry; and\n       Whereas, Statistics over the last three years have proven \n     that the dumping of foreign steel into the American \n     marketplace has had a devastating economic effect on American \n     jobs; and\n       Whereas, There is a serious need for improvements in the \n     enforcement of United States trade laws to provide an \n     effective response to this situation; therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Commonwealth of \n     Pennsylvania call on the President of the United States and \n     the Federal Government to take all necessary action to:\n       (1) pursue enhanced enforcement of United States trade laws \n     with respect to the surge of steel imports into the United \n     States, using all remedies available under those laws, \n     including duties relating to stainless steel plate in coils;\n       (2) continue to impose antidumping duties on imports of \n     specialty steel from these foreign nations;\n       (3) work to establish a more equitable distribution of the \n     burden of accepting imports of specialty steel from foreign \n     nations;\n       (4) establish the appropriate forum or mechanism for \n     executive branch interagency cooperation to closely monitor \n     imports of steel, including specialty and stainless steel \n     plate in coils;

and be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to \n     the President of the United States, the Vice President of the \n     United States, the United States Trade Representative and to \n     each member of Congress from Pennsylvania.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-17. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the Commonwealth of Virginia relative to Interstate Route 81 \n     corridor; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                    Senate Joint Resolution No. 423\n\n       Whereas, the Virginia portion of Interstate Route 81 is \n     among the most heavily traveled highway corridors in the \n     United States; and\n       Whereas, Interstate Route 81 was originally designed to \n     accommodate ten percent truck traffic, but, over time, the \n     percentage of truck traffic has continued to grow, until the \n     highway's traffic today is composed of approximately forty \n     percent trucks; and\n       Whereas, this large number of heavy vehicles not only \n     contributes to traffic congestion and exacerbates the \n     severity of highway crashes, but also increases the frequency \n     and the cost of highway maintenance and reconstruction on \n     Interstate Route 81 and other highways in the corridor; and\n       Whereas, transferring freight from highway trucks to rail \n     saves fuel, reduces congestion, minimizes air and water \n     pollution, reduces highway maintenance and construction \n     costs, and promotes safety; and\n       Whereas, Interstate Route 81 is paralleled for its entire \n     length through Virginia by a railroad, much of which was \n     initially engineered and constructed more than 100 years ago, \n     and which does not currently provide a competitive \n     alternative to the use of Interstate Route 81 by heavy \n     trucks; and\n       Whereas, the Virginia Department of Rail and Public \n     Transportation has studied whether improvements to the \n     parallel rail infrastructure are likely to result in the \n     diversion of some of the interstate heavy truck traffic from \n     Interstate Route 81 to the railroad, and whether investing \n     public funds in improving the railroad infrastructure would \n     result in measurable benefit to the public; and\n       Whereas, the Virginia Department of Rail and Public \n     Transportation study concluded that specified improvements to \n     the rail infrastructure in the Interstate Route 81 corridor \n     could divert to the railroad as much as 10 to 25 percent of \n     the interstate truck traffic now moving and projected to move \n     on Interstate 81, with a potential public benefit of as much \n     as $300 million to $2 billion; and\n       Whereas, diversion to rail of such a substantial number of \n     heavy trucks would reduce congestion, reduce maintenance and \n     construction costs, reduce fuel consumption, reduce air and \n     water pollution, reduce accidents, and is clearly in the \n     public interest; and\n       Whereas, public funding of improvements to the railroad \n     infrastructure, together with completion of the scheduled \n     improvements to Interstate Route 81, would provide an example \n     to the nation of the significant public benefits resulting \n     from the use of public funds in providing a viable rail \n     alternative for the transportation of interstate freight; \n     now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate, the House of Delegates concurring, \n     That the United States Congress be urged to appropriate funds \n     for improvement of rail infrastructure in the Interstate \n     Route 81 corridor. Such improvement shall ensure that the \n     railroad that parallels Interstate Route 81 in Virginia \n     provides a viable alternative to the use of Interstate Route \n     81 for the movement of interstate freight traffic; and, be it\n       Resolved further, That the General Assembly of Virginia \n     support the conclusions of the study conducted by the \n     Virginia Department of Rail and Public Transportation and \n     commend it to the United States Congress for consideration; \n     and, be it\n       Resolved finally, That the Clerk of the Senate transmit \n     copies of this resolution to the Speaker of the United States \n     House of Representatives, the President of the United States \n     Senate, the Secretary of the United States Department of \n     Transportation, and the members of the Virginia Congressional \n     Delegation in order that they may be apprised of the Sense of \n     the General Assembly in this matter.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-18. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Washington relative to the 1946 Rescission Act; \n     to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n\n                       House Joint Memorial 4002\n\n       Whereas, The Philippine Islands was a territory of the \n     United States until July 4, 1946, and the United States had \n     control over Philippine nationals and its internal affairs. \n     The Philippines Commonwealth had no function in matters of \n     foreign affairs and could not declare war nor surrender its \n     forces; and\n       Whereas, On July 26, 1941, U.S. President Roosevelt issued \n     a Military Order and invoked his powers under Section \n     2(a)(12) of the Philippine Independence Act (P.L. No. 77-127 \n     Section 10(a)) to ``call and order into the service of the \n     Armed Forces of the United States . . . all of the organized \n     military forces of the government of the Commonwealth of the \n     Philippines''; and\n       Whereas, World War II is remembered as The Good War that \n     President Roosevelt claimed to have defended the great human \n     freedoms against the encroachment and attack of the dark \n     forces of despotism; and\n       Whereas, Filipino soldiers fought during World War II under \n     the American flag and under the direction and control of \n     United States military leaders pursuant to President \n     Roosevelt's July 1941 Military Order; and\n       Whereas, Shortly after the war in 1946, the U.S. Congress \n     passed the Rescission Act which specifically mandates that \n     services rendered by Filipino World War II veterans ``. . . \n     shall not be deemed to have been active military, naval, or \n     air service for the purposes of any law of the United States \n     conferring rights, privileges or benefits . . .''; and\n       Whereas, The legislative rider appended to the 1946 \n     Rescission Act denies U.S. military status and benefits to \n     those veterans who fought under the command of officers of \n     the U.S. Armed Forces in the Philippines; and\n       Whereas, The significant and adverse impact of the 1946 \n     Rescission Act is its unjust discrimination against Filipino \n     soldiers of World War II by denying them eligibility for \n     equal benefits administered by the department of veterans \n     affairs; and\n       Whereas, Filipinos are the only national group singled out \n     for denial of full U.S. veterans status while the soldiers of \n     more than sixty-six other U.S. allied countries, who were \n     similarly inducted into the service of the armed forces of \n     the United States during World War II, were granted full U.S. \n     veterans status; and\n       Whereas, The United States government has yet to fully \n     restore the rights, privileges, and benefits guaranteed, then \n     taken away from Filipino soldiers of WWII; and\n       Whereas, The gallantry, loyalty, and sacrifices of Filipino \n     veterans of WWII, who fought for freedom and democracy in the \n     Armed Forces of the United States, deserve recognition and \n     their honor and dignity restored; and\n       Whereas, There is no pending legislation in the U.S. \n     Congress that will restore full United States veterans status \n     to Filipino WWII veterans: Now, therefore\n       Your Memorialists respectfully pray that the President and \n     Congress of the United States during the First Session of the \n     106th Congress take action necessary to amend the 1946 \n     Rescission Act and honor our country's moral obligation to \n     restore these Filipino veterans full United States veterans \n     status with the military benefits that they deserve; be it\n       Resolved, That copies of this Memorial be immediately \n     transmitted to the Honorable George W. Bush, President of the \n     United States, the President of the United States Senate, the \n     Speaker of the House of Representatives, and each member of \n     Congress from the State of Washington.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/23/senate-section/article/S3788-1", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. GRASSLEY:\n       S. 756.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend \nand modify the credit for electricity produced from biomass, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce important tax \nlegislation to help address the current energy shortage in our country. \nThe legislation, entitled the ``Growing Renewable Energy for Emerging \nNeeds [GREEN] Act,'' will extend and expand the tax credit for \nhomegrown, clean-burning, renewable biomass.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I authorized the section 45 credit in \nthe Senate and it was included in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. \nHowever, the tax credit for the production of energy from biomass is \nset to expire on January 1, 2002. For this reason, I am introducing \nlegislation to extend and expand the credit to help sustain the many \nbenefits derived from biomass.\n  Last month, I introduced S. 530 to extend the wind energy portion of \nsection 45, which has been extremely successful. The purpose of today's \nbill is to extend and expand the biomass portion of section 45 to \ninclude technologies such as biomass combustion and cofiring biomass \nwith coal-fired facilities. Formerly, section 45 only allowed the use \nof closed-loop biomass.\n  The clean, controlled combustion of biomass, which consists of \nsawdust, tree trimmings, agricultural byproducts, and untreated \nconstruction debris, is another proven, effective technology that \ncurrently generates numerous pollution avoidance and waste management \npublic benefits across the nation.\n  In addition, biomass energy displaces more polluting forms of energy \ngeneration while decreasing our dependence on foreign oil. Our national \nsecurity is currently threatened by a heavy reliance on foreign oil.\n  Biomass can also produce enormous economic benefits for rural \nAmerica. Rural economies will grow because of the development of a \nlocal industry to convert biomass to electricity. Moreover, studies \nshow that biomass crops could produce between $2 to $5 billion in \nadditional farm income.\n  In order to retain the environmental, waste management, and the rural \nemployment benefits that we could receive from the existing ``open-\nloop'' biomass facilities, my bill rewrites section 45 to allow tax \ncredits for clean combustion of wood waste and similar residues in \nthese unique facilities.\n  Importantly, we have also ensured that the definition of qualifying \nbiomass materials is limited to organic, nonhazardous materials that \nare clearly proven to burn cleanly without any pollution risk. Also, to \nallay any concern that biomass plants might burn paper and thus \npossibly jeopardize the amount of paper that is available to be \nrecycled, I have specifically excluded paper that is commonly recycled \nfrom the list of materials that would qualify for the credit.\n  I believe this bill provides a common sense combination of current \nand new technologies to help maintain the economic, environmental and \nwaste management benefits derived from biomass power. The current \nelectricity shortage in California and the soaring prices of home \nheating fuel and natural gas this winter are reasons enough to support \nand accelerate this renewable energy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3792]]\n\n                                 S. 756\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate the Federal building and United States \ncourthouse located at 504 West Hamilton Street in Allentown, \nPennsylvania, as the ``Edward N. Cahn Federal Building and United \nStates Courthouse''; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nname the Federal building and courthouse in Allentown, Pennsylvania for \nretired Judge Edward N. Cahn. Judge Cahn, a native Pennsylvanian and \nresident of the Lehigh Valley, served with distinction on the Federal \nbench for 23 years, including 5 years as chief judge.\n  Judge Cahn attended school at Lehigh University and graduated magna \ncum laude in 1955. He went on to receive a law degree from Yale \nUniversity in 1958 and began practicing law in Allentown in 1959. His \naccomplishments on the basketball court as a 1,000 point scorer for \nLehigh University translated into his later success in another court, \nwhen President Ford nominated him to be a federal judge in 1974.\n  Judge Cahn was instrumental in helping build Allentown's new \ncourthouse, which opened in 1995. This beautiful structure is a symbol \nfor the resurgence of the Lehigh Valley, and it is only fitting that \nthe courthouse should bear the name of an individual who did so much to \nhelp his community. His dedication to his work and fairness were well \nrecognized throughout Pennsylvania and it is my hope that future \njurists who serve in this courthouse will uphold those same ideals.\n  On February 28, 2001, the House unanimously passed an identical \nmeasure, H.R. 558, introduced by my colleagues, Congressmen Patrick \nToomey and Tim Holden. I am hopeful that the Senate will also see fit \nto pass my bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in honoring Judge \nEdward N. Cahn.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 757\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF EDWARD N. CAHN FEDERAL BUILDING AND \n                   UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE.\n\n       The Federal building and United States courthouse located \n     at 504 West Hamilton Street in Allentown, Pennsylvania, shall \n     be known and designated as the ``Edward N. Cahn Federal \n     Building and United States Courthouse''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REFERENCES.\n\n       Any reference in a law, map, regulation, document, paper, \n     or other record of the United States to the Federal building \n     and United States courthouse referred to in section 1 shall \n     be deemed to be a reference to the ``Edward N.

Mr. President, I rise to discuss a matter of \ncritical importance to the State of Florida; that is, the prospect that \nsoon, under the new administration, we might have the sale-for-lease \ntracts for offshore oil drilling off the coast of the State of Florida.\n  There has been in place presently a moratorium in one form or another \nsince 1989 regarding drilling off the coast of the State of Florida. \nAnd there is presently offered, through this new administration, \nthrough the Department of the Interior, a proposed lease sale called \n``lease sale 181,'' which comes within 30 miles of Perdido Key, which \nis in northwest Florida. It is explained by the new administration that \nmost of the tract for lease is 100 miles off the coast. But there is \nindeed a part that comes to within a few miles of the coast of Alabama \nand close to the State of Florida-Alabama line. This lease tract would \ncome within some 20 to 30 miles of the pristine white beaches of the \nState of Florida.\n  I can tell you that 16 million Americans residing in the State of \nFlorida do not want drilling off the coast of our State and have spoken \nvigorously against it, which is why we have had a moratorium off the \nState of Florida. Yet the administration continues to persist.\n  Now let me read for you a statement that was made by candidate George \nW. Bush in the past campaign. He made this statement at West Port \nRichey, north of Tampa, FL. He said at the time in the campaign, when \nasked about offshore oil drilling in Florida:\n\n       I'm going to work with your Governor about offshore \n     drilling here in Florida. We are both against it. We are both \n     against it.\n\n  Twice he said he was against it. But it is now his position to offer \nit. Just last week the Tampa Tribune, a very conservative editorial \nnewspaper--in an editorial last Thursday, said:\n\n       Had George W. Bush openly supported the sale of these \n     leases before the election, he would have lost Florida and \n     the Presidency.\n\n  Now that is the truth. And promises are being broken. The fact is \nthat they don't need to be because we could address our energy problem \nif we would be wise by increasing our R on alternative fuels, on \nincreased conservation. You don't have to produce your way out of the \nenergy crisis. You can be a lot wiser with using alternative methods.\n  In the discussion of the budget, we saw some dramatic testimony \nshowing that the consumption of energy in the United States, in large \npart, is allocated to transportation. Why should we not use research \nand development to build a new automobile that in fact can get 60 to 80 \nmiles per gallon? That would cause a tremendous conservation of energy \nin this country. That is just one alternative, but it is an alternative \nwe ought to explore and keep the promises that were made in the \nelection.\n  This whole matter of offshore oil drilling suddenly caught my \nattention back in the early 1980s, when, as a junior Congressman \nrepresenting a congressional district off the east coast of Florida, \nsuddenly I was confronted with the Reagan administration, through the \nperson of the former Secretary of the Interior, James Watt, offering \nleases for oil drilling off the east coast of the United States, from \nas far north as Cape Hatteras, all the way as far south as off Fort \nPierce, FL. As a junior Congressman, I went to work with the \nAppropriations Committee in the House to get them to insert language \nthat would say in the Department of the Interior appropriations bill: \nNo money may be used under this appropriations act for the purpose of \noffering oil and gas leases in tracts such-and-such--and then we \ndescribed all of the tracts that were being offered.\n  We won in that year in the Appropriations Committee because of \nbringing to that committee dramatic testimony from Florida about what \nwould be the environmental and economic damage to our State if waves of \noil were lapping up onto the beaches of Florida--not only environmental \ndamage, but economic damage as well, particularly considering Florida's \ntremendous tourism industry.\n\n  Well, I thought my fight was over. But sure enough, after a year's \nlapse, the Reagan administration came back under a new Secretary of the \nInterior and proposed those oil leases again. So we had to go to work \neven harder. This time it escalated all the way up to not just the \nappropriations subcommittee on the Department of the Interior, but to \nthe full Appropriations Committee, where we finally won the vote by \npointing to NASA and the Department of Defense to the fact that you \ncan't be dropping solid rocket boosters from the space shuttle and the \nfirst stages from expendable booster rockets being launched from the \nKennedy Space Center and the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station if you \nhave oil rigs down below. So we won that vote after a hard fight.\n  I thought our fight was over on being able to protect Florida's \nshores from the threat of environmental and economic damage as a result \nof oil drilling. But my hope back there in the early 1980s was for \nnaught because in the year 2001, despite a promise that was made last \nfall, in the year 2000, by candidate for President George W. Bush, one \nof the first acts of the new Bush administration is to offer for sale \nlease tract 181 off the coast of the State of Florida for oil and gas \ndrilling.\n  Well, 16 million Floridians will not stand for this. Senator Bob \nGraham and I will not stand for this. Statewide elected officials \nexpressed many times over, including this Senator who used to be an \nelected member of the State Cabinet of Florida, will not stand for \nit. The legislature of the State of Florida will not stand for it. Most \nof the congressional delegation from the State of Florida will not \nstand for it. Yet the administration persists.\n\n  It looks as if we are in for a donnybrook where we will clash our \nswords and see if the will, the desire of 16 million Floridians will \nprevail.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/04/23/senate-section/article/S3793-2", "month": "04", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3793]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 9:30 A.M.
