I understand S. 1564 is at the desk and is due for its \nsecond reading.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will read the bill for the \nsecond time.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1564) to convey lands to the University of \n     Nevada at Las Vegas Research Foundation for a research park \n     and technology center.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I object to further proceedings. I \nunderstand it has been read a second time.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection to further proceedings having \nbeen made, the bill will go on the calendar of general orders.\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are going to vote at 10 o'clock this \nmorning on cloture on the motion to proceed to foreign operations \nappropriations. The Senate will recess from 12:30 to 2:15 today for the \nweekly party conferences.\n  Because of Senators not being able to come to their offices today, I \nwant to make an announcement that tomorrow morning we are going to have \nour weekly prayer breakfast in S-115. The breakfast will be led by Imam \nYusuf Saleem, who is the resident Imam of Mas Jid Muhummad and the \nNational Education Director for the Muslim American Society. Also, he \nis going to offer the prayer here tomorrow morning to open our Senate.\n  Mr. President, as I indicated, we are going to vote at 10 o'clock on \na motion to proceed to this most important piece of legislation. This \nis now the third week the legislation has been held up. The filibusters \nfor this bill alone have been more than 2 weeks. It is very important \nlegislation dealing with issues about which the country must be \nconcerned, especially with all that is going on in the world.\n  I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle who think they \nwill get some advantage as a result of this filibuster in relation to \njudges, we are going to go ahead and process these. Senator Leahy is \nfully aware of the need to approve judges. For example, at 2:15 today, \nif the minority has no objection, we will vote on four district court \njudges, Federal district court judges.\n  We are moving along as quickly as possible. I don't think it takes a \nrocket scientist, for lack of a better description, to understand that \nSenator Leahy and the Judiciary Committee have been working under some \ntremendous constraints. First of all, after September 11 several weeks \nwere spent coming up with legislation dealing with antiterrorism. It \ngoes without saying that last week, in spite of all the difficulties \ninvolved, Senator Leahy held, back here, an emergency markup in the \nPresident's Room. Then later in the day he held a meeting to have a \nhearing on various judges. It was held in S-128.\n  If Senator Leahy were in some way trying to avoid having judges \napproved and holding hearings, he has every excuse in the world, I \nthink. But instead of doing that, he prevailed upon the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, the Presiding Officer today, to use the \nappropriations room to do these hearings.\n\n[[Page S10854]]\n\n  So I think there may be more to this--this is my personal belief--\nthan simply judges. It seems to me perhaps there is some effort to not \nhave any more appropriations bills; that there may be some effort to \nhave a big bill, an omnibus bill that the President would try to work \non with the leadership--whatever that means--on occasion.\n  I hope the Presiding Officer--I know I will--will keep a close eye on \nthis. We should be very careful. We have had experiences in the past \nwhere these large bills were not good for the country. They are not \ngood for my State. They are not good for the country.\n  As I say, I think there may by more to this than simply judges \nbecause Senator Leahy is moving judges as quickly as we can, more \nquickly than the times really allow. So I hope the people on the other \nside allow us to go forward on this bill. We have other important \nappropriations bills we should be doing--Agriculture, to mention just \none.\n  Is there going to be an effort by the minority to hold up the Defense \nappropriations bill, or do they want a big lump of appropriations \nmatters sent to the President in one form?\n  I hope we will be allowed to take up this bill. This is an extremely \nimportant measure to assist our war-related efforts. The President just \nreturned from China where he met with leaders of 21 different nations \nwhere he talked to them about things that are needed to help them.\n  I traveled with Senator Simon and others to Uzbekistan a number of \nyears ago. We were taken to the Aral Sea--a sea that dried up as a \nresult of very bad practices by the former Soviet Union. It is the \nfourth largest sea in the world. The shoreline is now 80 miles from \nwhere it used to be. Weather patterns have changed in that part of the \nworld.\n  On the second page of the Post: One of the islands in that great sea \nwas used for development of biological weapons.\n  We are going to help Uzbekistan rid that island of anthrax. That is \ngoing to take money. That money is in this bill. I do not know how they \nproposed to do that without the specific appropriations to allow it to \nhappen.\n  The full Senate, with the permission of the minority, is going to \nvote on four judicial nominations this afternoon. I hope everyone will \nunderstand there is a time and place for everything. This certainly \ndoes not appear to be the time to continue a filibuster on this most \nimportant legislation.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there will now \nbe 30 minutes for debate equally divided between the chairman and \nranking member, or their designees.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time I used \nbe counted as time against the majority's time on the 30 minutes.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. THOMAS. Mr. President, before I yield to my friend from Kentucky, \nI wanted to say that I think all of us join with the Senator from \nNevada in suggesting that we need to move forward. The fact is, we have \na reason for not moving. We need a commitment to move more quickly. In \nspite of all the excuses and all the reasons, we haven't moved quickly. \nWe are very much behind. We have a good many vacancies that need to be \nfilled. I just have to say that there is a way to solve it--by \ncommitting ourselves to doing this very quickly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to hear the Senator from \nNevada indicate that we might be able to confirm four district judges \nthis afternoon. I can't speak for the minority leader, but I assume he \nwould think that would be a wonderful idea and would be a step in the \nright direction.\n  I am in a curious position of being the ranking member on the \nSubcommittee on Foreign Operations supporting the underlying bill and \nthinking it is necessary that it be passed sometime soon. At the same \ntime, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, I am terribly concerned \nabout the slow pace of the confirmation of judges. This is a serious \nsituation.\n  Just last week we lost another judge. Charles Wolle of the Southern \nDistrict of Iowa announced he was taking a senior status. The vacancy \nsituation has now risen to 109, which is 13 percent of the Federal \nbench. That means more than 1 of every 10 seats is unfilled.\n  As we all know, justice delayed is justice denied. If there isn't a \njudge on the bench, there isn't a way to get justice. Unfortunately, we \nstill don't have any specific commitments from our friends on the other \nside of the aisle to move ahead. As of this moment, only eight judges \nhave been confirmed this entire year. Therefore, I urge my colleagues \non this side of the aisle to vote exactly as they did 1 week and 1 day \nago on this issue until we can get some resolution of where we are \nheaded to deal with the issue of justice being denied by substantial \nvacancies in the Federal judiciary.\n  There have been a number of different fallacies that have been put \nforward by my friends on the other side of the aisle related to this \nwhole situation.\n  Fallacy No. 1: That we shouldn't oppose cloture because this bill \ncontains money for embassy security.\n  There is no embassy security money in this bill. That is in the \nCommerce-Justice-State appropriations bill.\n  Fallacy No. 2: That somehow it is actually President Bush's fault \nthat there are not more than eight judges confirmed.\n  That is not only incorrect but it is decidedly unfair. President Bush \nsubmitted to the Senate more nominees at a faster pace than any \nPresident in recent memory. He submitted his first batch of nominees in \nMay--3 months earlier than President Clinton. By the August recess, the \nPresident had submitted 44 judicial nominees, which is a historic \nhigh--more nominees before August than any President ever. Fallacy No. \n3 is another attempt to shift blame to the President.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle assert that the paperwork \non the President's nominees isn't complete. That is also incorrect.\n  As of last week, the paperwork was done on at least 14 circuit court \nnominees and on at least 15 district court nominees. That is 29 \nnominees who are right now ready to go.\n  Fallacy No. 4: That our lack of progress on judges is due to the \nchange in control of the Senate and the time it took to get a new \norganizing resolution.\n  That, too, is false. After the change of Senate control and before \nthe organizing resolution was finally adopted, nine different Senate \ncommittees held 16 different nomination hearings for 44 different \nnominees before reorganization was completed. And one of those \ncommittees even held a markup during the reorganization period.\n  By contrast, during the same period, the Judiciary Committee did not \nhold a single confirmation hearing for any of the 39 judicial and \nexecutive branch nominees who were then pending.\n\n  Let's go over that one more time.\n  During the period of reorganization, nine different Senate committees \nheld 16 different nomination hearings for 44 different nominees before \nthe reorganization was completed. One of those committees even held a \nmarkup during the reorganization period.\n  By contrast, during the same period, the Judiciary Committee did not \nhold a single confirmation hearing for any of the 39 judicial and \nexecutive branch nominees who were then pending.\n  My colleagues, it is clear that none of these reasons that have been \nput forth have any merit. We have to look elsewhere. I submit that one \nreason we haven't made better progress is inefficiency. As I have said, \nwhile we have had some hearings, we have not come close to getting the \nmost out of the hearings. In fact, it seems as if we have gotten the \nleast out of the most.\n  From 1999 to 2000, the Judiciary Committee averaged 4.2 judicial \nnominees per hearing. This year, by contrast, we were averaging only \n1.4 judicial nominees per hearing.\n  We had a hearing but we didn't have people there to testify. That is \na pace that is three times as slow as in the past.\n  I was glad to hear that the chairman put four judges in last week's \nconfirmation hearings. I am pleased to hear the assistant majority \nleader say that we will confirm four of those nominees today. I hope we \nwill do that. But that sort of effort which we have made to date leaves \nus way behind.\n\n[[Page S10855]]\n\n  I think it is clear that we can do a lot better on judges. It is not \ntoo late for us to act on the remaining 36 pre-August nominees.\n  In the last three administrations in the first year all but one of \nthe nominees submitted prior to the August recess were confirmed before \nthe end of the year. In the last three administrations, looking at the \nfirst year, all of the nominees submitted before the August recess but \none were confirmed before the end of the year. Admittedly, many of \nthose nominees were confirmed in the latter part of the year.\n  It is not too late for us to achieve the same standard that was \nachieved in each of the last three Presidential administrations.\n  I see my friend from Arizona is here who has really been our leader \nin an effort to get judges confirmed. I want to make sure he has \nadequate time.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Four minutes twenty-two seconds.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nArizona.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for \n4 minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you, Mr. President. I will not take the entire time.\n  I marvel at how directly the rule of law in the United States is \nconnected to this attack on the United States and how the judges play a \ncrucial role in that, which simply brings home to me again the urgency \nof getting these judicial nominations confirmed so these judges can \ntake their place on the bench.\n  I just finished a meeting with a group of victims' advocates who are \npreparing to deal with the problems that have resulted or will result \nfrom the terrible tragedy of September 11 and its aftermath. There will \nundoubtedly be a lot of trials. There will undoubtedly be a lot of \npeople prosecuted, even if the primary perpetrators are not brought to \njustice in American courts but brought to justice in other ways. But \nthere are cases pending right now all over this country against people \nwho peripherally were involved, and questions about who the victims are \nand how those victims will be treated in court by judges are now \nbeginning to bubble up, as they did at the time of the Oklahoma City \nbombing case and other tragedies.\n  It reminds me again of what distinguishes the United States from \nthese other people. In the West generally, and in the United States \nspecifically, the rule of law is everything to us. Ultimately, the \njudges are the arbiters of that law. We have an obligation, as the \nSenate, to act upon these nominations of the President, either to \nconfirm them or to reject them, but to give the President our advice \nand consent. That is our constitutional responsibility. We abdicate \nthat responsibility if we put it off either because we are too busy \ndoing other things or because, for political reasons, we do not want to \nconfirm more of Bush's nominees than were confirmed in the Clinton \nadministration, or some similar kind of political consideration. That \nwould be wrong.\n  I hope my colleagues will help us bring these nominees to the floor \nand get them confirmed. At the conclusion of today, if I understand the \ncomments of my colleague correctly, we will have reached a sum total of \n12 confirmations for the entire year. That is woefully inadequate. \nThere are 36 nominees pending whose nominations were made prior to the \nAugust recess. Surely we can act upon all of them.\n  The final point I will make is there has been some suggestion that in \nsome cases paperwork is not done. Do not be deceived by this, my \ncolleagues. We have a moving goalpost problem here. After all of the \npaperwork has been completed for weeks, new questions are submitted by \ncolleagues, thereby creating the situation in which they can say: Well, \nnot all the paperwork is in. There has to be an end to that at some \npoint. The new questions have to be terminated, and it is time to have \na vote.\n  So I urge my colleagues to help us get these nominations to the \nfloor, find a time to vote on them, and get the votes done so we can \nfill the vacant court positions with these important judges.\n  Remember, there are 42 judges identified as emergency nominations. \nThey have been emergencies from the beginning of the year. So we have \nto fulfill our responsibilities as the Senate and take action on these \nnominations. Until we are able to do that, it is our view that we \nshould call a timeout on other certain portions of the Senate business \nso we have the ability to take up those nominations and bring them to \nthe floor.\n  I hope my colleagues will permit us to take up those nominations and \nwill defeat the motion to proceed on the appropriations bill. The \nranking member of that committee, Senator McConnell, has made the point \nthat we can afford, at this point, to lay that aside temporarily to \ntake up these judges and then return to that business.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nevada, Mr. Reid.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last Thursday I went into some detail \noutlining what has happened since we have taken control of the Senate. \nWe have moved judges expeditiously. The average time for an appellate \njudge during the short time we have been in control of the Senate has \nbeen 100 days. Theirs was 345 days. It seems to me the questions they \nhave raised are fallacy one, two, and, three, things they are making \nup.\n  The fact is, some Republicans seem to be in utter fear that Democrats \nwill treat Republican nominees as unfairly as they treated Democratic \nnominees. The fact is, since July, when the Senate control shifted, the \nDemocratic Senate has treated and will treat Republican nominees \nfairly. It is not payback time.\n  Democrats have no intention of perpetuating the shameful ways the \nRepublican Senate treated President Clinton's nominees. We will \nconsider nominations thoroughly and in a timely way. Maybe some \nRepublican Senators believe the public will not know or care that they \nhave taken the bill to fund U.S. foreign interests as their hostage.\n  The American people deserve to know what is at stake when the Senate \nis kept from acting on a foreign operations appropriations bill, \nespecially when it is clearer than ever that our security is linked to \nevents outside our borders.\n  This bill contains $5 billion in aid to Israel, Egypt, and Jordan, \nallies that are crucial to short-term and long-term stability in the \nMiddle East. There is $175 million in this bill to strengthen \nsurveillance and response to outbreaks of infectious disease overseas. \nThese are the same programs that help give us early warning of some of \nthe world's deadliest infections, now just an air flight or postal \nstamp away, including anthrax and other agents using bioterrorism. It \nis foolish and absurd to hold these funds hostage.\n  There is $327 million in this bill for nonproliferation and \nantiterrorism efforts to help other nations strengthen the security of \ntheir borders and their nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons \nfacilities, as well as programs to get rid of landmines, a serious \nproblem, for example, in Afghanistan where there are believed to be as \nmany as 100 million landmines. There is $450 million for steps to \ncombat HIV/AIDS, the worst global health crisis in half a millennium. \nEach day this bill is being held up, another 17,000 people are infected \nwith AIDS.\n  There is $3.9 billion in this bill for military assistance aid to \nNATO allies and to countries of eastern Europe and central Asia. We are \nasking these nations for overflight and refueling rights for aircraft \nand other support for Air Force personnel who are risking their lives \nin the war on terrorism.\n  There are hundreds of millions of dollars to be used to help fight \npoverty, help provide basic education, health care, jobs, sanitation, \nhousing, and other efforts in the poorest countries, steps that help \neradicate the breeding grounds for terrorists.\n  For them to tell us we can do it later is pure poppycock. I think it \nis very clear that the whole effort is to make sure we have no further \nappropriations bills. I think the judges thing is only a diversion. \nOther things in the bill include $856 million in export assistance to \nhelp U.S. firms claim markets for products abroad. Certainly that is \nneeded now.\n  We need to move this legislation. I think it is as clear as the light \nof day what is happening here; that is, there\n\n[[Page S10856]]\n\nis an effort, using judges as an excuse, not to move forward on \nappropriations bills. I think it is bad. It is bad policy. It is bad \nfor the country, and I think it is shameful.\n  Mr. President, I end by saying global leadership means acting as a \nleader. We have tried to support the President's priorities in every \nfacet of his campaign against terrorism. We have maintained a steady \nschedule of hearings and have confirmed twice as many judges as in the \nsame period of time during the previous two administrations, even \nthough we have been in control only 4 months.\n  Alongside the added imperative of passing the antiterrorism bill, we \nhave continued to hold hearings on judicial nominations and bring them \nto the Senate floor. At a time when we have tried to support the \nPresident's priorities in every way, it is unfortunate that so soon \nafter September 11 the Republican leadership seems to care more, in \nthis case, about its partisan political priorities.\n  That is what is happening, plain and simple. Of all times to be \nholding up the business of the Senate and this country, when our office \nbuildings are closed because of anthrax and the U.S. military is \nfighting half a world away, it is more obvious than ever that the U.S. \ninfluence is needed around the world. It is petty, shortsighted, and \ndangerous. We can have the best foreign policies, but without the funds \nto implement them, what good are they?\n  I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will take a \ndifferent approach today. It appears, though, they are not going to \nvote to proceed to this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Carper). Who seeks time?\n  The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, is there time remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired on your side. There is 1 \nminute 15 seconds on the Democratic side, the majority side.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield back that time and ask that the vote \nproceed.\n\n\n                             Cloture motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the motion to \n     proceed to H.R. 2506, the Foreign Operations Appropriations \n     bill:\n         Pat Leahy, Harry Reid, Tom Daschle, Ben Nelson of \n           Nebraska, Kent Conrad, Zell Miller, Byron L.

Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 50, nays 47, as follows:\n\n                     1[Rollcall Vote No. 306 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--50\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Biden\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Breaux\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Carnahan\n     Carper\n     Cleland\n     Clinton\n     Conrad\n     Corzine\n     Dayton\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Edwards\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Graham\n     Harkin\n     Hollings\n     Inouye\n     Jeffords\n     Johnson\n     Kennedy\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Mikulski\n     Miller\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sarbanes\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Torricelli\n     Wellstone\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--47\n\n     Allard\n     Allen\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burns\n     Campbell\n     Chafee\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Craig\n     Crapo\n     Daschle\n     DeWine\n     Domenici\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Fitzgerald\n     Frist\n     Gramm\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagel\n     Hatch\n     Helms\n     Hutchinson\n     Hutchison\n     Kyl\n     Lott\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nickles\n     Roberts\n     Santorum\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Smith (NH)\n     Smith (OR)\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thomas\n     Thompson\n     Thurmond\n     Warner\n\n                        ANSWERED ``PRESENT''--1\n\n       \n     Stevens\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Inhofe\n     Voinovich\n       \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Three-fifths of the Senators \nduly chosen and sworn not having voted in the affirmative, the motion \nis rejected.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I enter a motion to reconsider the vote \nby which cloture was not invoked on the motion to proceed to H.R. 2506, \nthe foreign operations appropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion is entered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am increasingly concerned about the \nsituation. We have sent two appropriations bills to the President for \nhis signature, which leaves us with 11 appropriations bills to go. \nSeveral of these appropriations bills are in conference between the two \nHouses. Of course, the situation affecting the conferences is one that \nis well known, but I would hope that we could find a way to break this \nlogjam in the Senate and get these appropriations bills moving.\n  We are well into our third CR. It is now October 23. Thanksgiving is \nfast approaching, and what do the American people see in this Senate? \nWe appear to be dallying. We have work to do. We have a very emergent \nsituation in this country. People look to us for leadership.\n  Why can we not get on with our Appropriations Committee work? I would \nlike for someone to tell me. I am waiting for an answer. We have \nappropriations bills that are ready to go, and I beg my colleagues to \nlet us get on with the appropriations bills. If we cannot move forward \non the foreign ops bill, let us try to move forward on some other \nappropriations bill. There are others awaiting action.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, I voted ``present'' because, as a partner \nof my good friend from West Virginia in Appropriations, we do not have \ntime for any further delay. The Agriculture bill would be acceptable, \nas far as I am concerned. I have not checked with our leader, but I do \nthink the Senate should move forward on another bill as soon as \npossible. We are very constrained because of the loss of our physical \nfacilities in Dirksen. There are some bills that could move forward in \nthe interim.\n  I have said before that in my judgment we have to get these bills to \nthe President by November 6 if we are going to be able to leave by \nNovember 16 for Thanksgiving because the President must have his 10 \ndays to review the bill. Hopefully, there will not be any vetoes, but \nit is possible.\n  I join the Senator from West Virginia in urging the joint leadership \nto find a way to allow us to take up another bill. I do believe the \nAgriculture bill is ready, and it is possible we could move on it very \nrapidly. I am hopeful we will find a spirit of comity and find a way to \nlimit amendments on these bills and let us catch up.\n  The problem with the conferences is the House facilities are still \ntied up by the investigations concerning anthrax, but I hope we can \nfind some way to handle that, too.\n  I do not believe these are crime scene investigations that are \nnecessary to determine whether anthrax is present and might threaten \nour people, which is one thing, but to deter us from going about our \nbusiness because someone might call our facilities crime scenes, I \nthink is wrong. I thank the President of the Senate for yielding to me.\n\n[[Page S10857]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator from West Virginia yield?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, first, I thank the Senator from West \nVirginia. Last week, when it seemed as if everybody, except the Senator \nfrom West Virginia, the Senator from South Dakota, the Senator from \nMississippi, and the Senator from Alaska were bailing out of this \nplace, the Senator from West Virginia was very kind to let me use his \noffice for a hearing. I say this for the benefit of the Senator from \nAlaska, who is present, that we can find space for these things. We \nhad, I believe, five judges for whom we held hearings. While everybody \nelse was leaving, the Senator from West Virginia made his office \navailable so we could hold those hearings.\n  I do want to thank the one Republican who came for part of those \nhearings to help us out with the hearings. Of course, I thank the \ndistinguished Senators from New York and Massachusetts and others on \nthe Democratic side who stayed during the hearings.\n  As the Senator from West Virginia knows--and he knows these \nappropriations bills better than anybody else, but for those who might \nnot know--this foreign operations bill has, of course, $5 million for \nour Middle East Camp David partners: Israel, Egypt, and Jordan. It also \nhas one item that people may not be aware of: $175 million to \nstrengthen surveillance and response to outbreaks of infectious \ndiseases overseas, a very interesting part because the Ebola plague or \nanything else is only an airplane flight away from our shores, and we \nhave this money to alert us about anything that is coming from \noverseas, including anthrax and other matters that might be an airplane \nride or a postage stamp away from our shores. We have $175 million that \nwe put in before these attacks, but we cannot get it to the President \nfor signature.\n  We also have $327 million for antiterrorism efforts helping other \nnations strengthen the security of their borders and their nuclear and \nbiological and chemical weapons programs. I know the President has been \ntelling these other nations we will get the money to them, but it is \nstuck in this bill. And the $450 million for steps to combat HIV and \nAIDS--each day this bill is being held up, another 17,000 people are \ninfected with AIDS.\n  We have $3.9 billion in military assistance included for a number of \nthose countries in eastern Europe and central Asia that we are asking \nto help us in overflight and refueling. We have a whole lot of money \nsaying the check is in the mail but, of course, we cannot send it. We \nhave a billion dollars in refugee and disaster aid to deal with the \nhumanitarian crisis around the world from Afghanistan to Sudan, also \nmoney the President wants to use but we cannot move forward with it.\n  We have hundreds of millions of dollars to reduce poverty and disease \nin countries where the Osama bin Ladens of the world tried to foment \nresentment against the United States. We have money to help those \ncountries but, of course, it is held up.\n  I mention that not because the Senator from West Virginia does not \nknow. I daresay there is nobody in the administration, the Congress, or \nanywhere else who knows every jot and tittle of these bills the way the \nSenator from West Virginia does, but I thought I would let some of the \nother Members know and the White House know all the various things the \nPresident has promised and we are holding up by not going forward with \nthis bill.\n  I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for his help \nbecause he has been like the granite quarries of Vermont. He stands \nrock solid, as he always has.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, will the Senator from West Virginia \nyield?\n  Mr. BYRD. I will be happy to yield.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I wish to congratulate our leaders, both our majority \nleader and minority leader, for the excellent way they have handled the \nquite difficult situation we are in. As a Chair of a committee that has \na finished bill which has passed in committee and is ready for floor \naction, I thank the Senator from West Virginia for urging us to move \nour bills.\n  I also assure him that the District of Columbia appropriations bill \nis ready to come to the floor, and I would be willing to work with him \nand with the leader to limit amendments so we could have votes on some \nof the items where there is disagreement, but there are not many items, \nand to remind everyone that Senator DeWine and I have worked very \nclosely, particularly on a provision to reform and strengthen the court \nsystem in D.C. to protect children who are in foster care, to \nstrengthen the District's school system which is so important.\n  Most importantly, today there is money in this bill for security \nmeasures for the District of Columbia. That is very important as we \nwork on our emergency plans regionally as well as coordinate what is \nhappening in the postal situation today, and the Capitol complex.\n  I thank the Senator from West Virginia for bringing this to our \nattention and, as one of the Chairs on our side, I am most certainly \nwilling to work with him as to any suggestions he might have to move \nour bill, have limited debate, limited time and move this support bill \nthrough the process in an expedited fashion.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank the distinguished Senator from Louisiana for her \ncomments.\n  Mr. President, I have been increasingly concerned we are moving \ntoward an omnibus appropriations bill. I am afraid if we continue on \nthis path we are going to end up with an omnibus CR in which a good \nmany or most of the agencies of this Government will be operating \nprobably on the same level of appropriations they received for fiscal \nyear 2001.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Mr. President, in time of war to have the administration \nbe tied to a CR, to have interpretations by lawyers throughout the \nGovernment as to what they can and cannot do, I think is putting the \ncountry in a straitjacket. I happened to have been chief counsel of a \ndepartment in the Eisenhower days, and it is impossible for \nadministrators to proceed during a period of emergency under what we \ncall a continuing resolution. We must have individual bills and we must \nhave them cleared, particularly in the areas where there is great \nconcern in the country.\n  I think agriculture is one, defense is another, but clearly we should \nnot be operating under a CR, in my judgment. It is impossible to \nproceed under the concept of having to have every single dollar checked \nagainst a question of whether it was involved in the last year. A CR is \nreally continuing the problems of the past fiscal year into the next \nfiscal year. At a time of war we should not have that happen.\n\n  So I urge we move separately on the bills and get them done as \nquickly as possible, I say to the Senator. I think we should get our \ncaucuses today at noon to make a pledge to the leader that we are ready \nto proceed as rapidly as we can to get these bills done.\n  Mr. BYRD. I thank my friend on the Appropriations Committee.\n  Mr. President, I do not intend to hold the floor much longer. But I \nappeal to all Senators to work together to get these appropriations \nbills up before the Senate, and let's act upon them. We should not go \nhome with an omnibus bill, an omnibus CR.\n  I don't know what the problem is, but I do know we need to get on \nwith the appropriations bills. I don't see why appropriations should be \nheld up because of nominations. I don't have any dog in that fight. I \nam ready to vote for nominations. I am ready to go on to the \nappropriations. But we simply can't hold up the appropriations bills \nlike we are doing. It would seem to me Senators ought to get together \non both sides of the aisle and work out this problem. For those who are \nconcerned about nominations, I don't think appropriations should be \nheld up because of nominations. What does the one have to do with the \nother? Many of these appropriations bills have been on the calendar now \nfor more than 3 months, and they are just sitting there.\n  So I appeal to our Members on both sides of the aisle to try to work \ntogether and let's get on with the appropriations bills. We are just \nmarking time. We are not doing any good. The people out there, they are \nnot concerned about our little problems--nominations versus \nappropriations. What does the one have to do with the other?\n  We are going to be held responsible for the fact that we are not \nworking; we are not acting; we are not getting things done. What about \nour Rangers\n\n[[Page S10858]]\n\nwho are facing great odds and great problems in Afghanistan; what would \nthey think of the way we are operating and acting?\n  What do the people back home expect us to do? They expect us to get \nthings done. These agencies are operating without any knowledge of \nwhether or not they are going to have funding above this year's level. \nThey don't know. They can't plan for programs and projects that are \nvery important to the American people, very important to this cause in \nwhich we find ourselves engaged.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Will the Senator from West Virginia be so kind as to \nyield for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. BYRD. Yes, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from West Virginia. Again, as \nSenator Leahy and others have done, I applaud him and thank him for the \nadmonition he has shared with all of us this morning. The importance of \ngetting these bills cannot be overemphasized. The importance of \nrecognizing this particular bill could not be overemphasized.\n  We are fighting a war. This is helping fund that war. The longer we \ndelay the funding of that war, the more complicated our circumstances \nand, frankly, the more problematic, it would seem to me, the message to \nthose on the front lines.\n  So I applaud the Senator from West Virginia and the Senator from \nAlaska. I hope we can clarify this matter. I, frankly, do not see the \nlinkage either, and I am not going to be susceptible to that linkage.\n  The administration has to make its decision about whether it wants \nthese bills completed or not. If they are not prepared to weigh in, \nthere is only so much I can do as well.\n\n  We will do the best we can. I thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee for his work on nominations. He had hearings last week. We \nare going to have four Judiciary Committee votes on nominations on \njudges this afternoon--I was prepared to have them this morning--and \nthat would not have happened were it not for the leadership of the \nSenator from Vermont, who has worked on these matters and I thank him \nfor that.\n  It is in that regard that I want to propound a unanimous consent \nrequest. He is in the Chamber, but I will make sure our colleagues are \naware the Republican leader and I have discussed this matter. I would \nmake the request at this time.\n\n\n            Unanimous Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that at 2:15 today the Senate proceed to executive session and \nconsider the following nominations: Calendar Nos. 472 through 475; that \nthe Senate immediately vote on each nominee with the first vote being \nfor the usual time, and subsequent votes being 10 minutes in length; \nthat upon the disposition of these nominations the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action, that any statements \nthereon be printed in the Record, and the Senate then return to \nlegislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. LOTT. Mr. President, I had thought there would be five judges in \nthis group. These are, I believe, four district judges. There was a \nhearing and I thought there was a plan to report out a circuit judge, \nbut I notice she is not on this list. I inquire about the nominee--I \nbelieve a woman for whom a hearing had been held, for the fifth \ncircuit. What happened on that nomination?\n  Mr. DASCHLE. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Vermont to \nanswer that question.\n  Mr. LEAHY. To answer that question, there are some--this is a nominee \nI have a feeling will go through all right but some questions have been \nasked. The answers are not back. For all we know, they may have been \nmailed in to the Judiciary Committee office. We don't know.\n  As the Republican leader knows, we have been somewhat stymied moving \npapers around here. But this is one where a Senator had asked a \nquestion. I notified Senator Hatch. I thought it would be a lot easier \nto get the questions answered than to bring the name up. Once they are \nanswered, I expect the nominee to go through easily. That follows the \ntradition our committee has followed for 25 years under both \nRepublicans and Democrats. If they have a question, we put them on the \ndocket, I hope the question would be answered, and she would be on the \nnext Exec.\n  I hope we will get back into our offices so we can find out if that \nmaterial is there.\n  Mr. LOTT. I withdraw my objection, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I now ask unanimous consent it be in order to ask for \nthe yeas and nays on each of the nominees with one show of seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  Mr. DASCHLE. As in executive session, I now ask for the yeas and nays \non the nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. If the Senator will yield for a moment, I also point out \nthe U.S. attorney of North Carolina, U.S. attorney of Michigan, other \nU.S. attorneys--of North Carolina, one of Arkansas, one of Mississippi, \none of Missouri, one of Nevada, one of Maryland, one of West Virginia, \none of Louisiana, one of Illinois, one of Washington, one of West \nVirginia--are also cleared. That could be done, I assume, on a voice \nvote. They are all nominated by President Bush. The vast majority of \nthem were recommended by Republican Senators. They have all been \ncleared, and they are ready to go.\n  Mr. DASCHLE. I thank the Senator from Vermont. We will attempt to \nschedule votes on those nominees as well. As you say, it may not \nrequire a rollcall. If that is the case, perhaps we could do those as \nwell today.\n  For the interest and information of all Senators, beginning at 2:15 \nthen, this afternoon we will have four rollcall votes. The first will \nbe 15 minutes, followed by a subsequent 10-minute vote on the three \nremaining judicial nominees.\n  So Senators ought to be here, stay on the floor, and vote so we can \nexpedite these votes at that time.\n  I also say it is my desire to move to proceed to the foreign \noperations appropriations bill unless there is a colleague on the \nSenate floor. This will not be a matter that will be taken lightly. If \nfor whatever reason Senators choose to leave the floor, and there is an \nopportunity for me to make that motion, it will be made.\n  I warn Senators about that possibility between now and the hour of \n2:15 this afternoon. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, before the Senator from Vermont leaves, I \nnoted there are two nominations on the calendar: Thomas E. Johnston of \nWest Virginia to be United States Attorney for the Northern District of \nWest Virginia, and Karl K. Warner, II, to be United States Attorney for \nthe Southern District of West Virginia. Have these been cleared?\n  Mr. LEAHY. I have just checked this morning. I am hoping they are \ngoing to be cleared by the end of the day, I tell the distinguished \nsenior Senator from West Virginia.\n  Again, as he knows, he having let us use his office as temporary \nquarters for hearings, we have been operating under some difficulty. A \nlot of our paperwork is in the Judiciary Committee rooms in Dirksen or \nin my office in the Russell Building. Normally, I could answer his \nquestion immediately.\n  I asked this morning that we make sure they are cleared. I know they \nwant to get them in West Virginia. I know they have been approved by \nthe distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia and by his \ncolleague. I am hoping that we can have them cleared quickly.\n  Incidentally, nominations were reported last Thursday after most of \nthe Capitol closed down. We were still able to get a quorum because of \nthe Members who stayed in town so we could report them, even though we \nhad recommendations from the other side to get out of here. I \nappreciate those Senators who stayed so we could get that quorum and \nget them out.\n\n[[Page S10859]]\n\n  Again, I appreciate the Senator from West Virginia in allowing us the \nuse of his office. We had a number of judicial nominations that came \nup. Virtually all Republican Senators took the time to come to \nintroduce their judicial nominees. I appreciate that, too.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I see the distinguished chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. We had some hearings last week and some movement \ntoward judicial confirmations, for which I am happy. I am glad one \njudicial nominee from Alabama was one of those which was moved. Of \ncourse, there was no controversy, I believe, about any of those \nnominees. Traditionally, it has not been necessary to have a big \nhearing if everybody is happy and respectful of the nominees. That is \nthe way it has always been. If people have questions and concerns, they \ncome.\n  I think it is a good thing that we are seeing some movement. But I \nwould like to see more. That is why we have not been able to have an \nagreement on the foreign ops bill. I think that bill could move at any \ntime we could get a fairly reasonable consensus on processing nominees.\n  I know there is a nominee from Alabama who is unanimously rated as \nwell qualified by the ABA in a district which has had two of the three \njudges vacant for over 2 years. It is probably the No. 1 critical \ndistrict in the country. We critically need a hearing on that judge.\n  We have others who are pending. In fact, President Bush nominated 11 \nindividuals on May 11, a highly qualified group. But only three of \nthose have received a hearing, and only two have been confirmed out of \nthat group.\n  We have a growing backlog. We confirmed some judges. We went down \nfrom 110 vacancies to 108, I believe.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield? I don't want to \ninterrupt him.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Please.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I can actually speak about those better than he can \nbecause I have heard his speech enough times.\n  I believe the Senator mentioned a judgeship from Alabama that was \nqualified last week. I am sorry the Senator from Alabama was unable to \nbe there. I do appreciate him being there for the markup earlier. I \nthank our colleague, Senator Shelby, for his fine words about the \nnominee. We are trying to move that nominee from Alabama very quickly. \nWe are doing that to try to help the other Senator from Alabama, Mr. \nSessions. We will keep on the pace, and someday we can go past, if we \never get our offices back.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the chairman. I remember so vividly how \naggressive he was to make sure President Clinton's nominees were moved \npromptly. I can give his speech because I have heard it many times. \nBasically, his complaint was that the Republican majority, under \nChairman Hatch at that time, was not moving Federal judges effectively \nenough. At that time, when we finished this last Congress and President \nClinton was in his last days, there were 67 vacancies in the Federal \ncourts. He said that was unacceptable, and he thought it should have \nbeen lower than that, although there were only 41 nominees.\n  President Clinton submitted only 41 nominees for the 67 vacancies, \nwhich was what was left. There were 41 nominees unconfirmed when \nPresident Clinton left office. Now we are pushing probably 60 nominees. \nAnd the vacancies have gone from 67 to 108. It may now be back up to \n109, even though we confirmed 2.\n  You can constantly have judges out of the 800 or so taking \nretirement. As you do, if you do not have a constant flow of nominees \nbeing confirmed, the vacancy rate grows. Senator Leahy declared that \nthe 67 vacancies we had last year was a crisis in the judiciary, and \nthere was something awful about that. I thought we were moving pretty \nfast. Frankly, 60 or so vacancies is about the standard. It is hard to \nget it below that because when a judge retires, then the President has \nto decide who he would like to consider for nomination. There have to \nbe background checks on them and ABA reports. It takes some time to \nmove forward.\n\n  But when the number gets up to nearly twice that to 108 or 109, 110 \nvacancies, then we have a bigger problem. I think we ought to be able \nto keep that number close to the 60.\n  We are not moving fast enough. I think all of us agree. I know former \nChairman Hatch feels strongly about this, as do others. We need to see \nwhat we can do to reach an accord.\n  There is some suggestion--I am not one who necessarily thinks we will \ndo so--that we will be finishing up a little earlier this year than \nnormal. That means we may not have more than 4 weeks or so left. If we \nare going to do just a couple of judges a week, we are going to end up \nwith well over 100 or so vacancies when we leave this time. That is too \nmany. We could do a better job of moving the nominees for which there \nis no objection to nominees that have bipartisan support--nominees that \nreceived ``qualified'' and ``well-qualified'' ratings.\n  We believe that is the way we ought to go. I also say in addition to \nthe foreign operations appropriations bill, there are a lot of \nimportant pieces of legislation that come before this Senate. There are \na lot of things that need to be moved. There are a lot of \nappropriations bills that we could be debating and discussing.\n  I suggest we keep working with the majority leader and the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee. Let's see if we can't get some sort of \ncommitment to give an extra effort to reduce somewhat the number of \njudges who are pending but have not been confirmed and get that number \ndown, or else I think those of us on this side have to conclude that we \nhave some sort of slowdown going on. I think it is the right thing for \nus to ask. It is a just thing to ask.\n  If it is a vacancy rate that far exceeds that which occurred under \nPresident Clinton's time in office, the very same people who were \ncritical of this Congress moving President Clinton's nominees for \njudges are now creating a much larger vacancy rate.\n  I believe we can do better. I know we can. I know we can move the \nnoncontroversial judges better than we are doing.\n  I urge us to spend some extra time on that. If so, we will be able to \neliminate this hurdle that is creating a problem with the foreign \noperations appropriations bill. Hopefully, we will have a good bill \nthat we can all support. Hopefully, we will have an agreement that is \nfair and just and reasonable which would allow more nominees to be \nmoved.\n  I am sure we are not going to be able to get our vacancy rate down to \nthe level of the 1960s, which is where it ought to be. But we ought to \nbe able to get it moving down well under 100 in some sort of agreement \nthat could be reached.\n  That is my observation and my concern at this time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Corzine). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have a number of nominations that are on \nthe Executive Calendar. This evening we are going to try to move a \nnumber of these nominations, beginning on page 3. We ask every Senator \nand every staff member to make sure they review these. If there are \nproblems that a Senator has, they should make contact with leadership \noffices and/or the cloakroom and indicate that they have some problem \nwith some of these nominees. Otherwise, we are going to try to approve \na number of them this evening. We have on the Executive Calendar a \nnumber of names we would normally send out with a hot line.\n  There is nobody in the office to listen to the hotline, so we would \nask everyone to specifically look at the Executive Calendar and \ndetermine if there are any people they do not wish to clear, or if they \nhave any questions, whatever the question might be.\n  We have heard, on a number of occasions the last several days during \nthis filibuster, they hope something can be done to arrive at some \nagreement so as to move judges.\n  I think the good faith of the majority has been shown by our \nliterally voting on every judge that has come through the committee and \nhas been marked up and reported to the floor. It would have been easy \nfor us the past several weeks, during these extended filibusters on \nseveral bills, to just hold all these\n\n[[Page S10860]]\n\njudges and vote on them at one time later on, as was done to us when we \nwere in the minority; but we have decided not to do that. As soon as \nthey are ready, we are moving them forward. The record is replete with \nthe case we have made, indicating that we are doing the very best we \ncan under very difficult circumstances.\n  There is no need to belabor the point, other than to say we took \ncontrol of the Senate in June. During the first 6 months of this \nsession, there was not a single confirmation hearing held, not a single \none, which is in keeping with what has gone on in the past.\n  In the past, for example, in the 6\\1/2\\ years the Republicans chaired \nthe Judiciary Committee, from 1995 to 2001--34 months; that is almost 3 \nyears--during that period of time, they held no confirmation hearings \nfor judicial nominations and for 30 months they held a single \nconfirmation hearing.\n  So we are moving forward. We have six office buildings--three in the \nHouse, three in the Senate--closed down. Staff is having a very \ndifficult time working, as has been laid out in this Chamber on a \nnumber of occasions.\n  Senator Leahy, in spite of that, held an emergency meeting in the \nPresident's Room in the Capitol. They went to the Appropriations \nmeeting room and held a hearing there on judges. He reported out of the \nPresident's Room these four judges we are going to vote on today.\n  I have to say, if this case were being tried by a jury, the jury \nwould be out 5 minutes and we would win. This is a case where if this \nwere given to a jury, we would win easily. The jury is the American \npeople. We are going to win this. We are doing the right thing. We are \nmoving the judges as quickly as we can. In spite of the September 11 \nterrorism attack and the anthrax attack, we are still moving the judges \nas quickly as we can.\n  What is being done by the minority is they are holding up \nappropriations bills. We are going to vote again on a motion to proceed \nto this foreign operations appropriations bill.\n  Just 8 days ago, the entire Republican side voted to block \nconsideration of the foreign operations appropriations bill, which \nfunds U.S. foreign policy. It was not because they disagree with what \nis in the bill supposedly, since it was written by Senator Leahy and \nSenator McConnell. These two Senators worked on this bill. Supposedly, \nit is a bipartisan bill which responds to the concerns and interests of \nboth Democrats and Republicans, as well as the President's foreign \npolicy priorities.\n  No, the Republican leadership did not oppose the bill itself. \nInstead, they said it was because of the Judiciary Committee which \nSenator Leahy chairs. They say they have not acted quickly enough on \njudicial nominations. That is a very serious accusation.\n  I have been a prosecutor, and I have defended lots of people charged \nwith crimes--not so serious crimes and really serious crimes, such as \nmurder. So I take seriously our responsibility of the Federal \njudiciary. In fact, after reporting out four more judges last Thursday, \nwe have acted three times as fast in approving nominees as was done \nduring the first 9\\1/2\\ months of the first Bush administration or the \nClinton administration.\n  Today we are going with the unanimous consent agreement that has been \nentered. We are going to confirm four more judges. For the minority to \nsuggest we are moving too slowly is a bit, I guess, like the orphan \naccused of killing his parents and who then begs for the court's mercy \nbecause he is an orphan.\n  When the Republicans controlled the Senate during the Clinton \nadministration, they created many of the judicial vacancies they are \ncomplaining about today, as has been indicated by the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  Some of President Clinton's nominees languished for years. Many \nqualified nominees, because of the impact this had on their ability to \nlead normal lives, withdrew. They withdrew from their law practices, \nwaiting for a hearing, waiting to be confirmed. They withdrew their \nnames after waiting years. Some of them said: We cannot wait any \nlonger. They did not want to subject their families to further \nunfairness.\n  We know about all this. We know that. We are not going to be unfair. \nWe have a record that indicates maybe it should be payback time, but it \nis not. We are not going to treat the Republicans as they treated us. \nThat is already evidenced by what has been done.\n  Some on the other side might fear that they are going to be treated \nas we were treated, but that is not the case. The fact is, since July \nwhen the Senate control shifted, the Democratic Senate has treated and \nwill treat Republican nominees fairly. I repeat, we have no intention \nof perpetuating the shameful ways the Republicans treated President \nClinton's nominees. We have and we will consider these nominees fairly \nand act on them in a timely way.\n  Maybe some Republican Senators believe the public will not know or \ncare that they have taken the bill that funds U.S. foreign interests as \nhostage. That is their hostage this week--and last week.\n  I was happy to see the senior Senator from Alaska--the former \nchairman of the committee, now the ranking member of the committee--\nvote ``present.'' It appears quite clearly that he does not like what \nis going on, as indicated in his statements he made afterwards.\n  We are in a time of war, and we are going to have a continuing \nresolution--meaning that every line in that continuing resolution will \nhave to be reviewed by some lawyer to find out if it is more than was \ndone the preceding year. It does not sound as though that is the right \nway to go.\n  The American people deserve to know what is at stake when the Senate \nis kept from acting on this bill, especially when it is clearer than \never that our security is linked to events outside our borders--and \nthen for people on the other side to stand and say, let them go a \nlittle more quickly than they did and we will work something out.\n  As of next week, there will be 3 weeks left until Thanksgiving. We \nare running out of time to do things. This foreign operations \nappropriations bill, as bipartisan as it is, will have amendments \noffered on it. We cannot whip through this bill in a matter of a couple \nhours. Agriculture appropriations--the same thing. They are holding up \nthe work of the country.\n  What does this bill contain? We have talked in generalities, and I \ntalked a little bit specifically earlier today, but let's talk about \nwhat is in this bill.\n  We have three countries that have really been good to America in \nrecent years--Egypt, Jordan, and Israel--but they need our help. These \nare countries that depend on our assistance. And these are not gifts. \nWe do not write them out a check and throw them money and say, spend it \nany way you want. Most of the money goes for them to purchase American \nproducts. That is what foreign aid is about in modern-day America.\n  So not only does it hurt those countries that are not getting this \nmoney, these vouchers, these opportunities to buy American products; it \nis hurting American companies. Who are these countries? Israel, Egypt, \nand Jordan, allies that are crucial to the stability of the Middle \nEast.\n  I read an interview last night of President Mubarak. It was very \nimpressive. It was in Newsweek magazine--a question--and then his \nanswer. I was so impressed, among other things, when they asked him \nabout Arafat.\n  He specifically said: Arafat has bad people around him. He mentioned \na person's name. This is a gutsy guy. I was impressed. We know he has \ncriticized Israel. He did in this same Newsweek article, when \nquestioned. He said that President Sharon has made promises to him and \nhe hasn't kept them. But Mubarak has been good for America. We are \nholding up money going to Egypt.\n  A couple weeks ago I had the pleasure of meeting just a few feet from \nhere with the King of Jordan, King Abdallah. I, of course, cared a lot \nabout his father. I liked his father a great deal. This young man has \nassumed the leadership of his country in very tough times. The majority \nof the people in Jordan are Palestinians. He is an American ally. His \ncountry is favorably disposed to America. It is a country that has made \ngreat progress but still has a long way to go. They are dependent upon \nour helping them. This bill is being held up.\n  Sure, we can, as Chairman Byrd said, write an omnibus bill and lump \nit all in and maybe they will get some of what they need. This bill was \nworked on for\n\n[[Page S10861]]\n\nmonths, making sure that Egypt and Jordan get what they need, not what \nwas in last year's bill.\n  That is what is being held up here--not today, not yesterday, but all \nlast week and part of the week before.\n  There is specifically in this bill, as a result of what has been \ngoing on since September 11, $175 million to strengthen surveillance \nand response to outbreaks of infectious diseases overseas. These are \nthe programs that help give us early warning against some of the \nworld's deadliest infections, now just an air flight or a postage stamp \naway, including anthrax and other agents used in bioterrorism. It is \nespecially foolish and absurd to hold these funds hostage when our own \ncitizens are now the targets of such attacks.\n  Two postal workers died with anthrax poisoning. What we are asking is \nthat $175 million be set aside to strengthen surveillance and response \nto outbreaks of infectious disease overseas. That is in this bill. If \nthey have some big omnibus bill, is that money going to get where it is \nsupposed to? Of course not.\n  This bill should not be held up. It is being held up, and that is \nwrong. We have almost $330 million in this bill for nonproliferation \nand antiterrorism efforts to help other nations strengthen the security \nof their borders against nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons \nfacilities as well as programs to get rid of landmines. Landmines are a \nserious problem all over the world. They are a problem in Afghanistan.\n  I traveled a number of years ago, just to give an example, to Angola. \nAngola in Africa had the potential of South Africa. It had natural \nresources such as oil and diamonds. It was part of the jungle we \nstudied as kids where these African animals roamed. It was good for \nagriculture, potentially a strong country. But it has been involved in \na civil war.\n  There are 10 million people in Angola. There are 20 million \nlandmines. There are two landmines for every person in Angola. If there \nwas a bustling business when Senator Simon and I and a number of other \nSenators traveled there a number of years ago, the business was \nartificial limbs, mostly of women and children. That is where this \nmoney is going.\n  We are held up over Senator Leahy not moving judges fast enough. No \none criticizes the fact that he is moving them. Our three office \nbuildings are closed. On the floor there was a question asked by the \nminority leader, Senator Lott: Where is the appellate judge, the \ncircuit judge? Senator Leahy said: One of the Senators--I know the \nSenator's name--on the committee asked a question and wanted it \nanswered. The question may be answered. It may be in the mail. But we \nhave not gotten the mail. I haven't gotten mail since they found the \nstuff in Senator Daschle's office. No one else has. The answer might be \nout there someplace. Maybe we could get the woman--it is a female \njudge--to fax the answer, call, if she knew where to call or where to \nfax. No one is criticizing Senator Leahy for not moving. They are \nsaying he is not moving fast enough.\n\n  As I mentioned earlier today, the second page of the Washington Post \nnewspaper talks about the United States going to help Uzbekistan. \nUzbekistan was one of the first countries to step forward. They have a \nrelatively small border with Afghanistan. They stepped forward and \nsaid: Yes, you can use our airbases. We have now, I understand, over \n1,000 soldiers on the ground there--not just airmen but soldiers. They \nsaid: Yes, you can use our land.\n  One of the things I am so glad we are going to help them with is, \naccording to the newspaper, there is an island loaded with anthrax. The \nSoviet Union used this island for testing biological agents. They \ndumped lots and lots of anthrax on this island. The island at one time \nwas safe. It was in the middle of the Aral Sea, the third or fourth \nlargest sea in the whole world. But the Soviet Union diverted water \nfrom that area to grow cotton and therefore dried up this sea.\n  I went to where the shore used to be and where it now is. You can \ndrive 80 to 90 miles on the dirt and see hulls of ships along the way. \nThe sea has receded that far. The place that used to be an island is no \nlonger an island. You can drive to the anthrax.\n  One of the things in this legislation is money to allow this \nGovernment, the United States, to help Uzbekistan, as indicated we want \nto do on page 2 of the Washington Post newspaper today.\n  We are not dealing with that. We are concerned about Senator Leahy \nmoving judges quickly. We could go through the statistical analysis \nagain. I am sure no one wants to be bored, but it is all in the \nCongressional Record of Thursday where we established that we have done \na good job in the short time we have had control of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  This bill has $450 million for steps to combat HIV/AIDS. In Africa \ntoday, about 7,000 people will die of AIDS. Tomorrow 7,000 more will \ndie. Thursday, 7,000 more will die. Friday, 7,000 more will die. Seven \ndays a week--weekends are not taken off--they continue to die in Africa \nbecause of AIDS. This number is going up, not down.\n  In 15 years that figure will be up over 10,000 people a day dying in \nAfrica of AIDS. Talk about a plague. This legislation has $450 million \nfor steps to combat HIV/AIDS, maybe the worst global health crisis the \nworld has ever seen. Maybe the bubonic plague, proportionately, was \nworse. Each day this bill is being held up another 17,000 people are \ninfected with this virus. This money seems to be a lot, but considering \nthe disaster I told you about, it may not be a lot of money. So $450 \nmillion is in this bill to combat HIV/AIDS.\n  What are we doing? We are concerned and are holding up legislation \nfor 3 weeks because Senator Leahy isn't moving judges fast enough. So \n17,000 people a day are infected with AIDS. There are programs--\neducational and medical--that we have that are fairly cheap now that we \ncan use to stop these infections from running across that continent the \nway they are.\n  In this legislation, we have about $4 billion in military assistance, \nincluding aid to NATO allies and countries in eastern Europe and \ncentral Asia. We are asking some of these countries, as we speak, to \nhelp America. We are asking them for overflight and refueling rights \nfor our aircraft and for other support for military personnel. They are \nrisking their lives on the war on terrorism.\n  We have money--millions of dollars, actually hundreds of millions of \ndollars--in this bill for programs for poverty which could provide \nbasic education regarding health care, job creation, sanitation, \nhousing, and other efforts in the poorest countries in the world.\n  We are the only superpower in the world. Don't we have an obligation \nto spend a tiny bit of the largess of this country to help those who \nare not as fortunate as we are. In this legislation, there are funds to \nhelp eradicate conditions that create breeding grounds for terrorists. \nPoverty breeds some of the things that we are fighting now. This \nlegislation to help that situation is being held up. Why? Because the \nJudiciary Committee is not moving judges fast enough. They are moving \nthem but not fast enough.\n  Next week it will be 3 weeks until Thanksgiving and they want us to \ndo, during that period of time, all these appropriations bills. It \ncan't be done. We need to get to work right now. I would think--but I \nhaven't heard a peep--that the President would be embarrassed. These \nare his appropriations bills, his programs.\n  There is a very close breakdown of the numbers of Democrats and \nRepublicans, so these appropriations bills that come to the floor are \nreally bipartisan in nature. So the administration has tremendous input \nin what we have in our appropriations bills--in this one specifically \nbecause it deals with foreign aid.\n  This bill has a billion dollars in refugee and disaster aid to deal \nwith humanitarian crises around the world. We all know what is \nhappening in Afghanistan. People are trying to get out of there. They \ndon't like the conditions there. They are afraid. They don't like the \noppressive conditions, or the war conditions, which existed prior to \nthe United States taking this action. They need help. All these \nagencies around the world need help. There is a billion dollars for \nrefugee and disaster aid to deal with humanitarian crises around the \nworld. They are not just in Afghanistan. We have millions of human \nbeings around the world on the brink of dying from starvation. That is \nwhat this bill is all about. Try to tell one of\n\n[[Page S10862]]\n\nthose people, most of whom are illiterate, that the Judiciary Committee \nis moving judges but not quite enough; therefore, we are going to hold \nup any money that goes to these refugees, all this disaster aid. \nMillions are at risk of starvation.\n\n  In this bill is $856 million in export assistance to help U.S. firms \nfind markets for American products abroad. What does that do? It \ngenerates jobs here in America. For that money that we spend, it will \ncome back to us tenfold--or what we would like to spend. But, remember, \nwe can't do that because Senator Leahy is not moving the judges--fast \nenough.\n  It would seem to me if there were ever a time in the history of this \ncountry where there is a need for leadership by this country, the \nUnited States, now is the time for urgency--here and abroad. Yet at the \nvery time when the President of the United States and his Secretary of \nState have been traveling--the President just returned from China, \nwhere he met with 21 other world leaders, and Secretary of State Powell \nhas been all over, including Pakistan, India, and China, and various \ncapitals around the world, to shore up an international coalition \nagainst terrorism--some Republican Senators suggest we should take a \ntimeout because we are not moving judges fast enough.\n  Should we tell those nations that want our help in combating \nterrorism that, well, we would like to help everyone, but we are taking \na timeout because we need some more judges? I understand the importance \nof judges. I have already talked about that. Judges are important.\n  One of the people we are going to vote on this afternoon is a judge \nfrom Nevada. We have the most rapidly growing State in the Union and we \nneed judges. We have another vacancy, but the ABA hasn't approved his \npaperwork. We want his paperwork to be completed. That is the right \nway. I know Judge Mahan, and I am sure the paperwork is going to come \nback perfect. I am from Nevada and I know him. Other Senators, other \nthan Senator Ensign, do not know him, and we should go through the \nnormal process. That is what Senator Leahy is doing--going through the \nordinary, normal process, which is quite difficult now. Our three \noffice buildings are closed. I am fortunate enough to have an office \nright off the floor. I had some of my Senate friends drop by yesterday. \nThere is no mail coming into my office or their offices. They needed \nsomeplace to go. They dropped in my office. We, I guess, will tell the \ncountries that as for combating terrorism, we have taken a timeout \nbecause of the judges.\n  I understand the importance of judges and all this talk about justice \ndelayed is justice denied. That is talk. These Federal judges work real \nhard. They are not denying anyone justice.\n  It is interesting to note that the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt is not going around the country lecturing about why the Senate is \nnot moving judges more quickly. No one can question Chief Justice \nRehnquist's political leanings. He was appointed by a Republican and \neveryone knows how Republican he is. But he, knowing it was the right \nthing to do, criticized the Republican majority in the Senate for not \nmoving judges and for holding them up. He is not doing that now.\n\n  We are doing the very best we can for these judges under very \ndifficult circumstances. I said this morning, there may be a different \nagenda here than just judges. Maybe they do not want to move these \nappropriations bills. Maybe they want the appropriations in one lump \nsum. Maybe that is what they want. That is what they are going to get. \nIt is a terrible mistake for the country.\n  Shall we tell our NATO allies or those suffering from AIDS, \ntuberculosis, or other deadly or preventable diseases that we are going \nto take a timeout because judges are not moving fast enough? That is \nthe only thing we can tell them. Should we tell the American workers \nhurt by this slowing economy that we have taken a timeout because \nSenator Leahy is not moving judges fast enough--he is moving them but \nnot fast enough?\n  If he was trying to delay the appointment of judges, would he have \nheld a meeting last Thursday in the President's room to report out \njudges? Of course not. If he is trying to delay, did he have an excuse \nnot to hold hearings on these judges? He had to prevail upon the \nAppropriations Committee to get room S-128. As I said, what a \ndisappointment it would have been for my friend, Larry Hicks, who is \ngoing to be a Federal judge from the State of Nevada, if Senator Leahy \nhad canceled that hearing. He had every reason to do so: the anthrax \nscare, the office buildings closed. But he did not. Larry Hicks was \njammed into that hearing room with everybody else.\n  It was also interesting at that hearing, which I attended because of \nLarry Hicks, the judge from Nevada, the only people at the hearing were \nDemocratic Senators. We had a few Republican Senators introducing \nnominees, but I am talking about members of the committee. I did not \nstay for the whole hearing. Maybe they showed up later.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask my friend from Nevada if he can \nexplain what happened with the vote this morning on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to explain to my friend.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This was a vote for cloture to bring a bill before the \nSenate to be debated; is that correct?\n  Mr. REID. That is all it is.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And the bill was the foreign operations appropriations \nbill.\n  Mr. REID. That is right.\n  Mr. DURBIN. It has the request of the Bush administration for foreign \noperations, and we--at least on the Democratic side--have been trying \nto bring this bill to the floor for the administration and for the \nPresident.\n  Mr. REID. For weeks.\n  Mr. DURBIN. For weeks. Included in that bill, is it correct, there is \n$175 million for infectious disease surveillance programs?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And $255 million for sheltering of Afghan refugees, the \nones we see on the television?\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I say to my friend, I talked about the $175 million. I \ndid not talk today about the $255 million for Afghan refugees. I say to \nmy friend from Illinois, all one has to do is turn on the news by \nmistake and in an instant one will find out the problems of these \nrefugees. They are trying to escape the Taliban. They are trying to get \nout of that country. They want to get anyplace they can to escape \nthe Taliban. They are starving. Their families are spread out all over. \nSometimes they are together; sometimes they are not. Some have walked \nover the passes, such as the Khyber pass and other passes that are \nalmost impassible. They have done it.\n\n  The Senator from Illinois is right, that money is being held up.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is it not true President Bush has said our war is not \nagainst the Afghan people; it is against the Taliban, the terrorists, \nal-Qaida, and Osama bin Laden? It is not against the Afghan people, is \nthat not correct? Is that not what the President has said?\n  Mr. REID. The only reason I am pausing before answering--the answer \nis absolutely yes--I say to my friend from Illinois, the legislation is \nbeing held up because Senator Leahy--if I am not mistaken, my friend is \na member of that Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, I am.\n  Mr. REID. Nobody is criticizing Senator Leahy for not doing anything. \nThey say he is not doing it well enough, fast enough, and, as a result, \nwe have been in a 3-week filibuster.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I have not looked closely at this morning's rollcall \nvote, but is it a party breakdown, Democrats and Republicans?\n  Mr. REID. One courageous man, Ted Stevens, voted ``present,'' and \nthen he gave a speech from his assigned seat in the Senate Chamber \nsaying, in effect: What in the world is going on here? He said if we \nhave a continuing resolution, and that is what this is all leading up \nto--I am paraphrasing what he said--but the $255 million the Senator \nfrom Illinois suggested for these Afghan refugees will not be there \nbecause that is an add-on. A continuing resolution takes into \nconsideration what took place last year.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So this morning in the Senate Chamber----\n  Mr. REID. Senator Stevens said: What is going on here?\n  Mr. DURBIN. This morning in the Senate Chamber, we had a motion to \nbring up a bill, which President Bush is\n\n[[Page S10863]]\n\nasking for, on foreign operations, part of which is to deal with \ninfectious disease surveillance, $175 million, and $255 million to feed \nthese Afghan refugees who are literally dying on our TV screens every \nnight, and we had a party-line vote: The Democrats saying go along with \nthe President, move the bill, give him the money and the resources, do \nwhat is important for America, and the Republicans, with the exception \nof one Senator, Mr. Stevens who voted ``present,'' all voted not to go \nto the President's bill on foreign operations appropriations. The \nreason they have decided to hold back the money for this emergency aid \nto feed, clothe, and shelter the Afghan refugees is because the number \nof judges coming out of the Judiciary Committee is not coming out fast \nenough; is that the argument?\n  Mr. REID. I am embarrassed for my minority friends to say that is \nright, they are not moving fast enough.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask, if I may, the Senator from Nevada, is it not also \ntrue that more than, I guess, 2 weeks ago we passed an aviation \nsecurity bill in the Senate 100-0, a bill that was brought to the floor \nby Senator Fritz Hollings, a Democrat from South Carolina, and Senator \nJohn McCain, a Republican from Arizona? They brought this bipartisan \naviation security bill before the Senate to finally have a Federal \nresponse to the problem of security at our airports. We passed it \nunanimously and sent it to the House of Representatives where it has \nnot been called for a vote in almost 2 weeks; is that a fact?\n  Mr. REID. I respond to my friend in answer to his question, he is \nabsolutely right. It is being held up and it is very clear why: Because \nthe majority whip in the House has said he does not want these \nemployees to be federalized. He wants them to be let out to the lowest \nbidder, as we have now. The majority whip said, from what I read in the \nnewspaper, that he cannot allow the bill to come up because he does not \nhave enough votes to have his position prevail, so he is just stopping \nit from coming to the floor.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Has the Senator from Nevada had the same experience I \nhave since September 11 where he has gone back to his home State and, \nmore often than not, people come up to him and say: Thank you for \naddressing this problem threatening America in a bipartisan fashion, in \nworking together, standing with the President to fight these battles? \nHas the Senator heard that in Nevada as often as I have heard it in \nIllinois?\n  Mr. REID. I went to a breakfast this morning in Washington, and they \nsay the same thing in Washington that people say in Nevada: What in the \nworld is wrong? Why can't you get this done; why can we not make these \npeople who check our bags, who put food on the airplane, who put fuel \nin the airplanes, Federal employees so we can make sure they are paid a \nlivable wage?\n  Mr. DURBIN. And with a background check, with training, with \nsupervision.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. As the people said this morning and people say in \nNevada, and as the Senator said they say in Illinois, that does not \nsound like too much of a wild concept.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Nevada, is it not a curious \nsituation that the Democrats are now backing the President and wanting \nto move these things forward and the Republicans are stopping the \nPresident's agenda? It is the Republicans stopping the President's \nrequest for foreign operations funds to feed the Afghan refugees, $255 \nmillion to feed and clothe these helpless innocent people who are \nliterally dying in these terrible conditions. It is the Republican \nParty of the President that stopped our consideration of this bill this \nmorning, with the exception of one Senator, Mr. Stevens. And when we \nare asked time and again, Will you please stand behind the President, \nmaybe we should say to our friends across America who follow this \ndebate: We are standing behind the President; please ask the \nPresident's party to stand behind the President. It appears that is \nwhere it has broken down.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend in response to his question, we have not \nseen the pain and suffering and despair in Afghanistan that is going to \noccur in about 2 or 3 weeks when winter hits.\n  Afghan winters are known for their brutality. These people know that, \nand the reason they are trying to get out of there is because of the \nbrutal winters they have in Afghanistan.\n  The Senator is absolutely right. And I also respond to his question \nin this manner: The President has received bipartisan support on his \nissues, whether it was the $40 billion for New York, whether it was the \nairline bailout, whether it was the work we have done in \ncounterterrorism. Name whatever it is he felt was important, we stood \nshoulder to shoulder by him.\n  I say to my friend from Illinois, the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Illinois, I am a little bit disappointed in President Bush. I \nthink he should be trying to help us on this issue and tell his party \nto back off. He should work with Senator Daschle, try to maybe speed \nthings up a little bit, or let him talk to Senator Leahy or Senator \nHatch, but he should be helping us move this bill. This is his bill.\n  So I say to my friend, in spite of the weeks of bipartisanship, 6 \nweeks as of today, we have shown this President, the administration has \nbeen silent on this 3-week roving filibuster.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Nevada, in this bill, the foreign \noperations appropriations bill which the Republicans stopped this \nmorning from coming up for consideration, in the committee report on \nthe bill, this bipartisan committee report, it refers to the situation \nin Afghanistan as, and I quote, ``the most urgent massive humanitarian \ncrisis anywhere.''\n  We are having this bill held up, but we are turning on our \ntelevisions at night, as I saw last night, to see this gripping scene \nthat no father or mother could stand to watch for more than a few \nseconds of a child lying on the dirt in one of these refugee camps, \nthis Afghan family that fled their country because of their fear of the \nTaliban and fear of the war. This little child was literally lying \nthere, swathed in blankets and rags, listless and clearly sick, with \nflies all over her face, and her father trying to swat them away \nsaying: I have nothing to give her. I have no money to buy medicine, \nnothing.\n  We see these scenes at night and it tears at our hearts because our \nwar is not against the Afghan people. It is against the terrorists and \nthe Taliban that harbors them. Yet when the President brings us a bill \nto do something to help those people, the Democrats stand with him and \nwant to call the bill, while the Republicans, his own party, turn their \nbacks on him in what has been described as the most massive \nhumanitarian crisis anywhere.\n  To say that is a battle worth fighting for, these poor, defenseless, \ndying people, so the Judiciary Committee could turn out a few more \njudges to the satisfaction of some of the Senate Republicans, I do not \nthink can be defended.\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the then-majority leader, Senator \nLott--and this is not a direct quote, but it is pretty close--when \nthere was a question which came up last year or the year before about \njudges, said when he went home he did not have anybody ask him about \njudges.\n  Well, that is about right. But I do have people ask about anthrax. I \ndo have them ask about threats of smallpox, threats of influenza virus, \nthreats of terrorists generally.\n  Also, I say to my friend, I spoke very briefly this morning about \nanother crisis we tend not to focus on, but in this bill there is $475 \nmillion to help people with AIDS. I say to my friend, as I said \nearlier, 7,000 people are dying every day in Africa because of AIDS. We \nhave money in this bill to help that plague.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Yes, we do.\n  Mr. REID. And that is what it is; it is a plague. The Senator not \nonly is a member of the Judiciary Committee, the Senator is a member of \nthe Appropriations Committee. We work very hard recognizing that AIDS \nis not an African problem; it is our problem, too.\n  The money for AIDS education and treatment will be held up. Now they \ncan say all they want, they meaning the minority: We will pass a bill \nas soon as you give us more judges.\n  It is not that easy, I say to my friend from Illinois. Thanksgiving \nis 3 weeks away as of next week. We have conference reports. We have \nterrorism issues we have to work on, bioterrorism, counterterrorism, \nand these appropriations bills do not go that quickly. People have the \nright to offer amendments.\n  Do they think some magic is going to happen and we are going to do a \nforeign\n\n[[Page S10864]]\n\noperations bill in an hour? People want to offer amendments. They want \nto do things a little differently. That is the American way. That is \nthe way we have been doing things for more than 200 years, but we are \nin a 3-week fun and games with a filibuster.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will give the Senator from Nevada an illustration and \nthen ask him a question. Last Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nwhen we were operating out of the Capitol, had a hearing for five \njudges who were brought before us. Of those five judges, it is my \nunderstanding four of them will be voted on this afternoon. As to the \nfifth judge, who is a circuit court judge who has been suggested and \nwas brought before us, we came to learn this circuit court judge has \nperhaps a thousand unpublished opinions. We have asked this judge to \ncome back once we have seen his unpublished opinions so that before we \ngive him the circuit judge position for life we understand who he is \nand whether he is the man for the job.\n  There were some objections raised at the hearing about asking for a \nsecond hearing for this judicial candidate. We checked the record, and \non at least six occasions during the Clinton administration, a second \nhearing was requested. Then we asked for the timeframe between the \nfirst and second hearing on Clinton judges, when the Republicans were \nin control. In one case, the nominee waited 2\\1/2\\ years for the second \nhearing, and in several other cases more than a year for the second \nhearing.\n  Now we have the Republicans coming to the floor saying we are not \nmoving this process fast enough. Second hearings are being called for \nand it could take weeks, when they took the lives of individuals and \nlet them languish for a year or 2 years in this situation.\n  I say to the Senator from Nevada, Senator Patrick Leahy has moved \nwith dispatch with hearings on these judicial candidates. He has held \nhearings during the recess. He held a hearing last Thursday when the \nSenate was in a very peculiar situation because of the security \nconcerns on Capitol Hill. He has moved them forward. He has asked that \nbefore we approve a person we know their background. I ask the Senator \nfrom Nevada, who was in the Senate during the Clinton administration \nand saw the way Senator Hatch and the Republicans in control of the \ncommittee dealt with the nominees, are the Republicans today asking for \nthe same treatment of their nominees as they gave to President \nClinton's nominees?\n  Mr. REID. I say to my friend, one of the biggest fears they have in \nthe world is that we will treat them as they treated us.\n  Mr. KYL. Will the Senator yield? That was a question directed to my \nparty.\n  Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from Illinois, I believe in the Golden \nRule which says you should treat people the way you want to be treated, \nand we are not going to treat the Republicans the way they treated us.\n  I say to my friend from Illinois, he is right. Senator Leahy has been \nmoving these things very quickly--maybe not quickly enough for some, \nbut he has been moving them.\n  Since September 11, the Senator from Illinois, as a member of the \nJudiciary Committee, has been involved in a number of other things. I \nsay to my friend that in addition, we have had in Senator Daschle's \noffice this evil person or people send this envelope full of anthrax \nwhich has shut down the office buildings in the Senate. Senator Leahy \nand the Judiciary Committee and all committees have been working under \ntremendous hardship, and Senator Leahy, if we could give him some kind \nof a medal, he deserves it.\n  In the President's Room last Thursday, when the House had already \ngone home and we were in the process of going home, Senator Leahy held \na hearing to report out these four judges. Anyway, he held a hearing \nback there, a markup back there, and then he held a hearing later in \nthe day down in S-128 on some judges. If he ever had an excuse or ever \nwanted to slow up these nominations, he certainly would not have \nproceeded in that manner.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I add to the Senator from Nevada, I believe there were \nsome 12 U.S. attorneys who were moved in that hearing in the back room, \nunder extraordinary circumstances.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, is he aware of the fact the Judiciary \nCommittee, under Senator Leahy's leadership, has held seven nomination \nhearings thus far this year?\n  In 1989 and 1993, when the Republicans were in control of the same \ncommittee, it was November before they held their fifth hearing. So \nSenator Leahy has held more hearings, even though we have not been in \ncontrol for the full calendar year, than Republicans did when they had \ncontrol of the same committee under a Democrat President, and after \nthat seventh hearing the committee will have held multiple hearings in \nthe same month on three separate occasions, something the Republicans \nin the Judiciary Committee managed to do only 12 times in 6\\1/2\\ years \nof leadership.\n  For those who are complaining about Senator Leahy's dispatch in \ndealing with those nominees, I might also say this: The Judiciary \nCommittee has already confirmed eight judges, four for the Federal \ncourts of appeals with several more in the pipeline. This afternoon we \nwill have some district judges considered. That is more appellate \njudges confirmed in the last 4 months than the Senate confirmed during \nthe entire first year of President Clinton's administration.\n  Senator Leahy has brought more Republican nominees for Federal \njudgeships to the floor in the first 4 months than the Republicans did \nin an entire calendar year. And they are stopping legislation to \nprovide humanitarian assistance to the Afghan refugees because it is \nnot fast enough? Is that what I understand?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is absolutely correct. I would say also that \nnot only has Senator Leahy and the committee moved the number the \nSenator has indicated, but he has done it in a short period of time.\n  Remember, the Democrats only took control of the Senate in June. \nDuring the first 6 months of this year, the Republicans did not hold a \nsingle confirmation hearing or confirm one.\n  I will be happy to yield for a question to my friend from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I guess I will ask a question. I thought \nthere was a question posed to the minority by the distinguished Senator \nwho said, would Republicans like it if he treated them as they treated \nus? And I thought, as a Republican, I might be in a better position to \nanswer that than a Democratic Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Does the Senator have a question?\n  Mr. KYL. The Senator had an interesting question. I guess I will ask \nthe question to you this way.\n  Since the distinguished Senator from Nevada has said on more than one \noccasion that this is not about payback--I think that is a direct \nquotation, on several occasions--I wonder why, if the withholding of \nconfirmations on judicial nominations is not about payback, that most \nof the argument that the Senator from Illinois and the Senator from \nNevada keep making is how poorly they believe that President Clinton's \nnominees were treated by Republicans. What relevance would that have, \nif their action today isn't about payback?\n  Mr. REID. I will be happy to respond to that question. The purpose of \ngoing into what has taken place in the past is, by comparison, to show \nwhat was done to President Clinton and was not done for him, compared \nto what we are doing now.\n  I spent a lot of time here in the Chamber. The few judges that we \ngot, those were usually held in bundles until we had acted \nappropriately by virtue of how the majority then thought we should act \nand then we would get a whole bunch at one time.\n  We are moving these judges as quickly as we can. We are not holding \nanybody who is ready for approval. We are holding these hearings as \nquickly as we can. We hope there will even be a hearing this week, \nalthough we don't know where it will be.\n\n  I say to my friend, for whom I have the greatest respect, the junior \nSenator from Arizona--I know he feels strongly about the number of \njudges. But I think the Senator is not doing the right thing for the \ncountry. I think it is very important we move forward on these \nappropriations bills. I think the situation on judges--whatever number \nis going to come, we are going\n\n[[Page S10865]]\n\nto do it regardless of this filibuster. We are going to move the same \nnumber of judges that we could and should.\n  As far as it being payback time, we are not going to have payback \ntime. As I told the Senator from Illinois, the way I feel about this, I \nbelieve we should set an example.\n  You know, you just want people to treat you the way you treat them. \nWe are going to try to do our very best to show the country we are not \ngoing to treat the minority, the Republicans, during the time we are in \nthe majority, the way we were treated. We are not going to have people \nwait around for years for a hearing. We are not, in effect, going to \nhave people wait until they withdraw their nomination.\n  With all that is going on in the country today--office buildings \nbeing closed--I think it is a terrible mistake. We are going to move as \nquickly, as expeditiously as we can.\n  As I was saying when the Senator from Illinois stepped on the floor, \nwe have $3.9 billion in this bill for military assistance, including \naid to NATO allies, countries in eastern Europe and central Asia. We \nare asking some of these same countries to really do good things for \nus. Should we tell our NATO allies that we have taken a timeout? Should \nwe tell American workers hurt by the slowing economy that we have taken \na timeout?\n  I believe global leadership means acting as a leader. We are the only \nsuperpower left in the world and we have an obligation to support those \nwho are less fortunate than us. We simply have not done that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Nevada if he will yield for a \nquestion.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I understand what the President has told us \nrepeatedly, our war is not against Islam or the Afghan people. It is \nagainst terrorism and the countries that harbor terrorists. In this \nbill the Republicans have stopped on the Senate floor this morning, the \nforeign assistance and operations bill which President Bush asked us to \npass, which Secretary of State Colin Powell said is important for his \noperation, the State Department, as he builds this coalition, is it not \ntrue we also include in this bill nutrition and health programs for the \nless fortunate around the world? Is it not also true that many of these \nprograms will be the evidence that many of these people have that the \nUnited States is not at war with Islamic people, not at war with a \ncertain religion, that we are, in fact, prepared to help them and help \ntheir children?\n  The fact that this Senate refuses to take up the bill the President \nhas asked for is really hurting the administration's effort. What they \nare trying to do is send a message around the world. That is how I see \nit. I ask the Senator from Nevada if he reaches the same conclusion?\n  Mr. REID. I reach the same conclusion, I say to my friend from \nIllinois. I studied a map yesterday of Afghanistan and the countries \nthat surround Afghanistan and tried to learn a little more about \nAfghanistan, as we all are trying to do.\n  The life expectancy in Afghanistan today is 48 years for a man, 47 \nyears for a woman. That is the life expectancy. In the United States, \nit is about 80 for both men and women.\n  Having been in Congress for a number of years, I have had the good \nfortune, for a number of reasons, to travel to other countries. I can \nremember going to a number of those refugee camps where food comes from \nthe United States, money comes from the United States, to feed these \norphans. A lot of them are orphans. When you go there, they know you \nare from America and they come, little kids, hanging on to you--some of \nthem with very bloated stomachs, meaning they are malnourished. It is \nvery sad that children who have done nothing to hurt anybody are \nvictims of all this terrorism that is going on. They are victims of all \nthe maldistribution of things around the world.\n  This bill is an effort by the United States, the way I see it in my \neyes, to give just a little bit of the plenty that we have to help some \nof the less fortunate around the world.\n  This foreign aid bill is just a small amount of money of the \ntrillions of dollars that we deal with here in Washington. But it is \nimportant to those countries. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely \nright. This money goes to people, mainly children around the world, who \nneed help.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask the Senator from Nevada, I had the same experience \nhe did in India and Bangladesh, India, a Hindu country and Bangladesh, \nlargely Muslim. What I found was the poorest of God's creatures on \nEarth, people, literally mothers trying to raise children with \nnothing--nothing--who worried day to day whether they could feed them, \nand the United States, in its compassion, its understanding of its \nobligation to those less fortunate, provides financial assistance to \nthe charitable organizations. In one case, in India it was Mother \nTeresa who was taking the money and feeding the poorest people. In \nBangladesh, it was other organizations.\n  To make certain the record is clear, the money that these \norganizations would receive would come through this bill, this foreign \noperations appropriations bill which has been stopped on the floor of \nthe Senate--according to the Senator from Nevada for almost 3 weeks or \nmore--because some, in fact all Republican Senators but one--believe \nthey want to stop the President's bill that would provide this food and \nmedical care for the poorest children on Earth because they are not \ngetting judges through the Senate Judiciary Committee at a fast enough \npace.\n  Is that their argument?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator is absolutely right.\n  I want to stress this again. They acknowledge that they are getting \njudges, but they are not getting them fast enough, in spite of the \nSeptember 11 terrorist acts and in spite of the anthrax terrorism. They \nshould join with us to move this as quickly as possible.\n  The Judiciary Committee has maintained a steady schedule of hearings \non judicial nominees of President Bush. We have confirmed twice as many \njudges as were confirmed in the same period of time during the two \nprevious administrations. Remember that in one of those administrations \nthere was a Democratic President and a Democratic Senate. Alongside the \npassing of an antiterrorism bill, we have continued to hold hearings on \njudicial nominees and to bring them to the Senate floor.\n  I don't know what more we can say. We have brought them to the floor \nfor confirmation.\n  At a time when we have tried in every way to support the President's \npriorities, it is unfortunate that so soon after September 11 the \nRepublican leadership seems to care more about its partisan political \npriorities than it does moving these nominees.\n  I think this deals with more than just judicial nominees. I think \nsome people do not like foreign aid and the foreign aid bill. This is \ntheir way to kill something they really do not like. They are afraid to \ncome on the floor and vote against this bill and offer amendments to \nthis bill. They are going to do indirectly what they cannot do \ndirectly. They are saying this is about judges. I think what they want \nis a foreign aid bill such as we had last year with no new items in it: \nThe Afghans--they will survive for centuries. A few will die. Let them \ndie. So we cause a few problems. They deserve it.\n  I don't know what is going on here. But I think there is a different \nagenda. I think it is more than judges. I think they don't want this \nbill to go forward.\n  We have all been to townhall meetings. It is hard to defend foreign \naid. Why are we giving money to those countries when we have people in \nAmerica who are hungry?\n  I always supported foreign aid in the International Relations \nCommittee in the House. I have always supported foreign aid bills. I \nhave never voted against a foreign aid bill, and I don't intend to, \nbecause this superpower, of which I am a proud citizen, has the \nobligation to dispense a tiny bit of its largess on those who are less \nfortunate.\n  I think there is a different agenda here. I think people do not want \nto come forward and vote against a foreign aid bill. I think they want \nto be able to go home and say, we passed a foreign aid bill that is no \nbigger than it was last year.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I thank the Senator from Nevada.\n\n[[Page S10866]]\n\n  Our friends are talking about the consequences for this particular \npiece of legislation. I guess I see other consequences as well. I would \nlike to ask the assistant majority leader and the distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois a question.\n  We have been through this process before. The clock is ticking. As \nthe Senator from Nevada said earlier, there are only 3 weeks until \nThanksgiving, and I assume we want to go home for Thanksgiving. Then \nthere are a few more weeks until Christmas and New Year's. I assume \npeople want to go.\n\n  I look at the agenda in terms of the prescription drug coverage for \nsenior citizens, which is something about which I have been concerned \nand I know the seniors in Minnesota are desperately concerned.\n  I want to ask the Senators who have been here longer than I: When we \ngo home for the holidays or adjourn for the year, and we are out of \ntime to deal with some of these other important issues as well, should \nI tell the senior citizens from Minnesota that the reason we couldn't \nget prescription drug coverage is that we were sitting here week after \nweek getting delayed on these votes and not even getting to the bills, \nso we did not have time to go on to anything else?\n  It looks as if that is another one of the consequences of what is \ngoing on. Is that the case?\n  Mr. REID. It appears very clear that we don't have time to do all the \nthings that need to be done. Those issues about which we felt so \nstrongly prior to September 11 are issues that are still important to \nthe American people: Senior citizens, and the cost of medicine. The \ncost of health care is going up. Prescription drug costs are going up.\n  People are literally having to make decisions whether they are going \nto eat or get drugs. I have talked to them. People are supposed to take \none pill a day. They break the pill in half. They take one-half of a \npill each day. That isn't good for them. But it is better than nothing. \nWe have people simply making the choice of whether they are going to \neat this week or whether they are going to buy their medicine.\n  We know there are important issues dealing with education that we \nhaven't talked about for weeks. We know there are things we need to do \nabout people who are working. We have a lot of minimum-wage jobs around \nthe country. These are not people who are working at McDonald's \nflipping hamburgers. Sixty percent of the people who draw minimum wage \nare women. That is the only money they get for them and their families.\n  Do we need a minimum wage adjustment? You bet we do. Things such as \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights--that is just as important today as it was \nprior to September 11.\n  What about campaign finance reform? That is important. But these are \nissues we have pushed way back on the calendar.\n  I am willing to recognize that we have had many important things to \ndo. But wouldn't it be nice if we were not in a filibuster, to have \nfinished our appropriations bills by now and spent a little time on \neducation? President Bush said that is his No. 1 priority. All he has \nto do is tell his friends over here to let us move on some of these \nappropriations bills.\n  I also say to my friend from Minnesota that not only do we have these \nthings that are important which we need to deal with, but we also have \ncounterterrorism legislation which is not yet completed.\n  The Senator from Illinois and I talked a little on the floor today \nabout airline security legislation which is hung up over in the House \nbecause of the evil of federalism.\n  We have a lot to do with very little time to do it. Certain things we \ncan adjust but time we can't. Time moves on. We cannot stop the \nmovement of time. We can only do certain things for a certain period of \ntime. Time runs out. Time is running out. The fiscal year ended a long \ntime ago. We are having a series of short-term funding resolutions, \nwhich in the long term hurts the country. We should have the \nappropriations bills finished and not be doing them at last year's \nlevel. We have different problems than we had last year. That is an \nunderstatement.\n  I hope there will be some serious discussion about whether or not we \nare going to continue this filibuster for another few weeks. It is \nobvious to me that they are together on it. We had one person vote \n``present.'' Everybody else voted like lemmings going over the cliff.\n  I have the good fortune of being a lawyer. I am proud that I am a \nlawyer. I am proud that I was a trial lawyer. I tried lots of cases \nbefore juries. As I said earlier today, I wish I could try this case to \na jury. We would win it so easily. They have no case. Hopefully, with \nthe discussion today, maybe there is a jury out there; it is a jury \nthat I can't see. There are not 12 people in the jury box here to whom \nI am speaking, but maybe this is the unseen jury of the American \npeople. Maybe they can see through this facade. Maybe they can see. \nThey know what it is. It is a political trip that is not good for the \nAmerican people. It is holding up judges when we have people who need \nprograms that this bill will fund.\n  Other bills are being held up. Agriculture appropriations and other \nbills are being held up. My friend is certainly on the right track.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  I have been asked by the people in Minnesota as to our agenda--for \nexample, why we have not taken up agriculture. We have sugar beet \nfarmers in Minnesota who are literally going bankrupt and are waiting \nfor that appropriations bill to see if there is funding included that \nwill rescue their operations from bankruptcy. We have seniors in \nMinnesota who are asking why we have not taken up prescription drug \ncoverage.\n  Why are we meeting here? As the Senator said, when we have education \nmatters, which the President has said are a priority, when we have an \neconomic stimulus package that the President has asked us to act on, \nwhen all these matters are not addressed, as I read the calendar, they \ncould be left undone this year.\n  When I go back to Minnesota and am asked why we have not gotten them \nany of this broad agenda that affects people not just in Minnesota but \nall over this country, the answer should be because we sit here week \nafter week not being able to take up legislation that is bipartisan \nbecause they are not happy with the pace of judges. It all comes down \nto that. Is that the Senator's understanding?\n  Mr. REID. I say directly to my friend from Minnesota, you are exactly \nright. You go back to Minnesota and tell your sugar beet farmers, we \ncannot take up an appropriations bill because we are not moving judges \nfast enough, according to the Republicans.\n  I went to Minnesota. You and I met with some seniors when we were \ncampaigning. That was your No. 1 issue. You can tell them you are sorry \nwe have not been able to take this up, but we have been tied up with a \nvery important issue; that is, we are not moving judges fast enough. So \nyou can tell them that. That is basically what you can tell them.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I say to the Senator, ``fast enough'' is a relative term, \nas I understand it. It is sort of in the eye of the beholder.\n  As I understand it, Senator Leahy, chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, held a hearing and squeezed it in here, literally and \nfiguratively, last week so we could move judges forward. I know the \nbench is full in Minnesota.\n  The people's agenda, the whole agenda of the United States of America \nis on hold because a group says we are not moving judges fast enough. \nIs there a measure of what is ``fast enough'' in the Senate?\n  Mr. REID. The answer to the question is, you are correct; it is in \nthe eye of the beholder. It absolutely is.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Minnesota for addressing other \nitems on the agenda which we cannot get to because of this Republican \nfilibuster over the pace of judges.\n  I say to the Senator from Nevada, what we are looking for now, if I \nam not mistaken, is what--eight or nine more Republican Senators who \nwill decide that it is time to put an end to this charade that has gone \non for so many weeks. If we can get eight or nine Republican Senators \nto come forward, we can finally invoke cloture, bring the President's \nbill that he requested to the floor, and provide the\n\n[[Page S10867]]\n\nassistance for these starving refugees who are coming out of \nAfghanistan.\n  I ask the Senator from Nevada, am I correct that is what we are \nlooking for, another eight or nine Senators to come forward on the \nRepublican side?\n  Mr. REID. I answer my friend, the distinguished Senator from \nIllinois, by saying it would be patriotic, in my view, to have a few \npeople break away over there, step forward and say, I think this has \ngone on long enough. A 3-week filibuster is pretty good in holding up \nlegislation for a period of time.\n\n  I think if we had nine Senators step forward, we would be able to \nbreak the filibuster and move forward on these appropriations bills. \nAnd then, as the Senator from Minnesota said, maybe this bowl of jello \nthat says how many judges the American people are entitled to can work \nout somewhat.\n  I want everyone to be reminded that Senator Leahy is a veteran \nlegislator. On September 11, Senator Leahy was forced into a new \ndirection. He had to tell the members of his committee, such as the \nSenator from Illinois, that we had to do different things. As a result \nof that, he, as the leader of that committee, worked day and night for \nweeks to come up with a counterterrorism bill. It is not as if he has \nnot had anything else to do. And then, I repeat, we have had the \nanthrax problem.\n  Again, he does not even know if some of the judges have responded to \nsome of the questions sent to them. He is not doing anything that \nunique or different. He may be asking some questions a little \ndifferently, but from the beginning of time in the Senate, when we have \nconfirmed Federal judges, people on the Judiciary Committee have had \nthe right to ask questions. I am not on the Judiciary Committee, but I \ncan send a question to you, and you can ask a question that is entirely \nappropriate. Or when a judge is placed on the calendar--like I made an \nannouncement earlier today on behalf of Senator Daschle. I said, we \ncannot hotline everybody as we normally do, but we have nominations on \nthe Executive Calendar, and we are going to try to clear a lot of them. \nSo if anybody has any objection to these people, such as John \nMarburger, to be Director of the Office of Science and Technology \nPolicy, let us know. If you have a problem with CPT Duncan Smith, let \nus know. If you have a problem with Eugene Scalia, to be Solicitor for \nthe Department of Labor, let us know. There is a whole list.\n  We have a lot of U.S. attorneys who have been cleared. We have a \ncouple people on the Executive Calendar from Nevada, such as Jay Bybee, \nto be an assistant attorney general, a very fine man. Anyway, we have a \nlot of people. We have a nominee to be U.S. Attorney for the District \nof Nevada.\n  Mr. DURBIN. May I ask the Senator from Nevada a question?\n  Mr. REID. I am just amazed at this kind of loosely knit problem we \nhave where they say we are not moving fast enough. The Senator from \nMinnesota asked, what is ``fast enough''?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I might ask the Senator this.\n  Mr. REID. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would respond, this foreign operations \nappropriations bill, which the President has requested, which the \nDemocrats are prepared to bring to the floor to help the President in \nthis effort against terrorism, stopped by the Republicans again this \nmorning, with the exception of Senator Stevens--and I applaud him; he \nhas always been a man who has charted his own course. He broke ranks \nwith the Republicans and said: Enough is enough. I salute him for that.\n  This bill, which the Senator from Nevada appreciates, I am sure, as I \nand other Members do, is a life-and-death bill for a lot of people \naround the world. The Senator from Nevada earlier mentioned the AIDS \nvictims in Africa where 25 million people are infected and there are \n15 million AIDS orphans. There is money in this bill to help these \nchildren and to help these families try to cope with this health \ncrisis. There is no doubt in my mind, the failure to send the money is \ngoing to lead to the loss of life.\n\n  When it comes to feeding programs for the Afghan refugees, there is \n$255 million. The failure of the United States to send the money \nPresident Bush has asked for to help these Afghan refugees will take \nlives. People will die because we do not move as fast as we should.\n  Does the Senator from Nevada have a suggestion from the Republican \nside that if we give them a certain number of judges, then they will be \nwilling to give a certain amount of money to send to people who are \nstarving to death around the world? Are they negotiating in those terms \nas to how many judges they will need before they can support their own \nPresident's foreign operations appropriations bill?\n  Mr. REID. If I could just take a minute to answer the Senator's \nquestion, this negotiating has been a little bizarre, for lack of a \nbetter description. I personally negotiated with a number of Senators \non the other side. Finally, the majority leader said: You keep coming \nto me with different people negotiating for judges. Who is speaking for \nthe minority as to the number of judges? I think that was a pretty good \nquestion Senator Daschle came up with.\n  Then I was told I could negotiate with my counterpart, the minority \nwhip, Senator Nickles. So we met on a couple occasions, and I thought \nwe had a good understanding of what they wanted and what we could do. \nBut that all fell apart because other people now are speaking for the \nother side.\n  So the direction I had to work with Senator Nickles is no longer the \ncase. I do not know what they want. That is why I think there may be \nsome other agenda. I think it may be more than just judges, although \nmaybe they are holding up all this important legislation for judges.\n  Before the Senator asks another question, let me also say this: The \nSenator is a veteran legislator, having come to be elected in 1982. You \nknow how this institution works. And you have served in the Senate for \na number of years. You can remember the trouble we had getting \nAmbassadors when they were in the majority. They would load them up and \nfinally we would have them. It was hard to get Ambassadors.\n  There has not been a peep out of them for Ambassadors. Why? Because \nwe have been approving Ambassadors every time. Senator Biden gets these \npeople out just as quickly as possible. We do not want a single post to \nbe vacant, like they were vacant under President Clinton because they \nwould not even give some of these people hearings.\n  So we are doing what is right for the country. We are not holding up \nAmbassadors, as they did to us. We are not holding up judges, as they \ndid to us. We are treating them as they did not treat us. That is the \nright thing to do.\n  I would be happy to respond to another question from my friend from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Nevada, based on what he just \ntold me--that the Republicans have not even come forward with a \nrequest, a negotiated plan on these judges--I have to agree with the \nSenator from Nevada; I do not understand what their agenda is.\n  I can tell you what the result will be. Because they refused to bring \nPresident Bush's bill up to fund the State Department and other \ncritical agencies, they are taking away from their President part of \nthe authority he is asking for Congress to give him to wage this war \nsuccessfully, part of which obviously has to do with military \nexpenditures, intelligence expenditures. Another has to do with \nbuilding a global coalition.\n  What the Republicans have said is: Mr. President, we are not going to \nstand with you. You can wait for an indeterminate amount of time for an \nindeterminate reason before we will give you our support.\n  The Democrats in the Senate are standing with the President. The \nRepublicans in the Senate have shunned him, turned their backs on him. \nThe net result of this, as we delay, is clearly going to be the loss of \nlife. It clearly means that refugee children and others around the \nworld who are waiting for U.S. assistance will not receive it in a \ntimely fashion because of the Republican agenda on the Senate floor. \nThat is certainly unfair to the President. It is certainly inhumane \nwhen it comes to these poor children and others around the world.\n  I sincerely hope that a number of Republican Senators, at the \nluncheon they are about to have, will stand up\n\n[[Page S10868]]\n\nwith Senator Stevens and say enough is enough. It is time for us to get \nbehind the President, get the business of the Senate moving forward in \na bipartisan fashion again.\n  I might ask the Senator from Nevada, before I close and yield to \nothers who might ask questions: A similar thing is happening with \naviation security, is it not, in the House? This is a bill we passed \n100-0. People have come up to me on the street in Chicago, at Marshall \nFields department store on Sunday. I was spending a few minutes looking \naround. A couple fellows asked: Aren't you Senator Durbin? We want to \ntalk to you about aviation security, airport security. And we want to \nknow whether it is safe to fly.\n  We passed a bill which has sky marshals, which has perimeter security \naround airports, which professionalizes the screening at airports so we \ncan have confidence that we have the best people with background checks \nand training and supervision and national standards, just as we had \nwith air traffic controllers, having them working security at airports. \nThat bill has been stopped in the House of Representatives by the \nmajority whip, Tom DeLay of Texas, who objects to the idea of Federal \nemployees being involved. So here in the Senate we can't move the \nPresident's bill for foreign operations to deal with our war against \nterrorism, and over in the House of Representatives they can't move the \nbill for aviation security.\n  In both instances, is it not true it is the President's party that is \nstopping a bill the President is asking for?\n  Mr. REID. The Senator from Illinois is absolutely right.\n  The Senator asked the question about the negotiation part of it. Our \nleader is Senator Tom Daschle. He has 50 people who support him in our \ncaucus on everything. He is our leader. We recognize that. He is a man \nof great patience. I have worked with him, served with him in the \nHouse. We were elected to the Senate at the same time. We work very \nclosely together. I have never served politically with anyone with as \nmuch patience as he has.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I agree with the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. Even Tom Daschle's patience has run out on this roving \nfilibuster on judges. The Senator asked me what has happened on the \nnegotiations. This is foolishness. We have three office buildings \nclosed. Senator Leahy just came upon the floor. He can't go into his \noffice. He can't go into his personal office. He can't go into the \nJudiciary Committee office.\n\n  What in the world is the man supposed to do? Can't we move forward on \nthese appropriations bills? This is a travesty. It is a travesty of the \nAmerican political system to hold these programs up because we are not \napproving enough judges because this man here is not leading the \nJudiciary Committee properly.\n  I was on the floor Thursday. This is one thing I said. The Senator \nwas not on the floor. I want to say it right here again, the last thing \nI said:\n\n       Why hold up these appropriations bills? It is not going to \n     speed things up. Now we are going into the third week with a \n     filibuster. It is wrong, and I am very sorry it is happening. \n     But no one is going to denigrate Pat Leahy while I have an \n     ounce of breath left in my body.\n\n  That is how I feel about it. This man is being slandered. I think it \nis awful what is happening here, what is happening to this man and to \nthis institution. I have lived on the Senate floor. I have worked day \nand night helping them move appropriations bills, helping them, going \nto you and to you and to you, saying, don't offer that amendment; we \nneed to move this; it is for the country. And we came through every \ntime.\n  Here we have this bill being held up because we are not moving enough \njudges. I think it is horrible. I think it is wrong.\n  I yield to the Senator from Vermont for a question.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I am sure the distinguished senior Senator from Nevada \nknows how much I appreciate his kind words of support. And of course \nour friendship, of nearly a generation now, I value as much as any \nfriendship in this body. It is interesting, I wonder if the Senator \nfrom Nevada knows that last week when a number of buildings were being \nclosed down and all, I had several members of the other party come to \nme and tell me privately: I assume, of course, you won't have an \nexecutive meeting and pass out judges; you certainly aren't going to be \nable to have any hearings on judges.\n  In fact, some of them were saying they not only assumed that, they \nhoped I wouldn't because they wanted to get out of town.\n  The Senator from Nevada told me one of President Bush's nominees had \nmade a 3,000 mile trip here and is there some way we could hold the \nhearing for this Republican judge, having made the trip. Of course, I \nhad the hearing. Of course, we met. In fact, we had a picture in one of \nthe papers showing we had about 100-some-odd people crowded into the \nPresident's room and a couple other people crowded into Senator Byrd's \nAppropriations committee room to have both of the hearings. We voted \nout about 20 nominees between U.S. attorneys and judges. And then we \nhad a hearing on four or five more judges that afternoon, even \nincluding one from a State where the Republican Senator didn't bother \nto show up.\n  Mr. REID. Before we go out, I want to respond to the Senator's \nquestion. First of all, I appreciate the friendship that we have. I say \nthis for the institution, I say to my friend for the institution. I \nwould have stood to defend this institution. You are part of this \ninstitution, and the institution we call the U.S. Senate is also being \ndefamed. This is not the way to legislate.\n\n  Yes, Larry Hicks flew from Nevada to here, as did other people fly \nfrom around the country. What a disappointment it would have been to \nLarry Hicks and to the other people if they had come back here to find \nout the meeting was canceled. No one could have criticized you for \ncanceling that meeting.\n  Anthrax was present. People were being treated for anthrax poison. No \none could have criticized you. But you not only held a markup back \nhere; you went down on the first floor and held a hearing. I said \nearlier today, if we passed out medals in the Senate, you would deserve \na medal for what you did last week. To have people criticizing you and \nyour committee for not moving fast enough is disgraceful.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. REID. Our time is up. I think it is time to go out.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Forty-five seconds remain.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I was going to ask how many of these instances have \noccurred. The U.S. attorney from Minnesota, a Republican friend of \nmine, high school classmate who was appointed, Senator Leahy went to \nfinish the paperwork himself to get him expedited through the process. \nI wonder how many of these have occurred.\n  Mr. REID. I think we are going to report out 13 of these today that \nhe did not have to do but he did.\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the hour of 12:30 \nhaving arrived, the Senate stands in recess until the hour of 2:15 p.m.\n  There being no objection, the Senate, at 12:30 p.m., recessed until \n2:15 p.m. and reassembled when called to order by the Presiding Officer \n(Mr. Cleland).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. In my capacity as a Senator from Georgia, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/23/senate-section/article/S10868-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10868-S10870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nNOMINATION OF JAMES H. PAYNE TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR THE \n          NORTHERN, EASTERN, AND WESTERN DISTRICTS OF OKLAHOMA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the nomination of James H. \nPayne, of Oklahoma, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of James H. \nPayne, of Oklahoma, to be United States District Judge for the \nNorthern, Eastern, and Western Districts of Oklahoma.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will confirm four \nadditional\n\n[[Page S10869]]\n\nFederal judges. These nominees all participated in hearings on October \n4 and were reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee last \nThursday, when the committee persevered with our previously scheduled \nmeeting in spite of the extraordinary circumstances that prevailed here \non Capitol Hill.\n  In spite of the postponement of other matters by other committees, in \nspite of the closure of the Dirksen Senate Office Building and the \nunavailability of our hearing and meeting room and in spite of our \ncontinuing focus and efforts to finalize an antiterrorism bill, last \nThursday the Senate Judiciary Committee proceeded to meet and report \nthese 4 judicial nominees, 13 nominees to be U.S. attorneys for \ndistricts around the country and an Assistant Attorney General for the \nDepartment of Justice. Then, last Thursday afternoon we held a hearing \nfor an additional five judicial nominees that was chaired by Senator \nSchumer, which I attended along with Senators Kennedy, Durbin, and \nDeWine.\n  Thus, last week while Republicans were voting as a bloc to filibuster \nthe foreign operations appropriations bill and stall initiatives vital \nto building an international anti-terrorism coalition, the Senate \nJudiciary Committee continued to do its work. Two weeks ago the Senate \nconfirmed our fourth court of appeals judge for the year, topping the \ntotal confirmed in the first year of the Clinton administration and \ntopping the zero from 1996 when a Republican majority in the Senate \nrefused to confirm even a single nominee to the courts of appeals all \nyear.\n  Two weeks ago the Senate also confirmed another district court \nnominee. That brought the total judges confirmed so far this year to \neight, exactly twice the number that had been confirmed by the same \ntime in the first year of the first Bush administration and by the same \ntime in the first year of the Clinton administration. In spite of our \nrecord pace since July in confirming judicial nominees, every \nRepublican Senator voted last week to stall Senate consideration of a \nvital appropriations bill ostensibly to ``protest'' what they contend \nis a supposed ``slowdown'' on the consideration of judicial nominees. \nThe facts belie their unfounded contention.\n  The Senate's continuing progress in spite of the numerous roadblocks \nand obstructions erected by Republicans throughout the year was \nevidenced again last Thursday and will be again today when the Senate \nvotes to confirm another four judges.\n  At the end of this series of rollcall votes on these district court \nnominees to fill vacancies in Oklahoma, Kentucky, and Nebraska, the \nSenate will have confirmed 12 judges since July. Since I became \nchairman, Republicans finally allowed the Senate to reorganize at the \nend of June and Members were assigned to the Judiciary Committee on \nJuly 10, the committee has held seven hearings involving judicial \nnominees.\n  We have already held as many hearings for judicial nominees as were \nheld during the first year of the first Bush administration and more \nthan were held during the first year of the Clinton administration. In \naddition, I have scheduled an eighth hearing involving judicial \nnominees for this week.\n  Our Republican critics have come up with a new statistic in an effort \nto diminish our accomplishments. Last week they took to talking in \nterms of average judges per hearing. Since it is their statistic, I \nguess they can figure it any way they want. I would observe that I can \nfind no time this year when we had included only 1.4 judicial nominees \nper hearing. I should also observe that after the hearing on Thursday \nwe will have included 23 judicial nominees at eight hearings. Even \n``fuzzy math'' would have to concede that we are at more than double \nthe ``average'' Republicans cite.\n  They do not explain that when President Bush unilaterally decided to \nchange the more than 50-year-old practice of involving the American Bar \nAssociation in professional peer reviews while nominations were being \nconsidered, and that his decision has had consequences at other stages \nof the process. They do not acknowledge that only two of this \nPresident's first 18 nominees were for district court vacancies. They \nare oblivious to the fact that when early hearings were noticed and \nheld many of these nominees had not completed paperwork and complete \nfiles.\n  They ignore the structure and practice for judicial confirmation \nhearings that has been followed by Republican and Democratic chairmen \nof the committee for more than 25 years in including three to five \ndistrict court nominees with a nominee to a court of appeals and to the \nextent district court nominees did not have completed files or were \ncontroversial and not rushed into a hearing there might be a good \nexplanation for the lack of a full complement of nominees at a hearing. \nThey refuse to acknowledge the extraordinary parallel effort we \ncontinue to make to hold hearings for the numerous executive branch \nnominees that are simultaneously pending.\n  They are apparently frustrated that we have already confirmed four \nnominees to the courts of appeals and will match and likely exceed the \nnumber of court of appeals nominees confirmed in either 1989 or 1993. \nThey seek to discount the judges confirmed by referring to three of \nthem as ``Democrats.'' These are nominees from President Bush that they \nhave somehow determined are ``Democrats'' and whose confirmations \nshould not be considered or counted in their partisan view, I guess.\n  The answer to their criticism is very simple: Since July 11 we have \nheld 7 hearings and included 19 judicial nominees. That is more \nnominees than received hearings by October 18 in the first year of the \nfirst Bush administration or by October 18 in the first year of the \nClinton administration. Thus, whether measured by confirmations or by \njudicial nominees who have received hearings, in spite of the change in \nmajority in the middle of this year and the delays that Republicans \nhave caused in the process of reorganizing, we are ahead of the pace of \nthe first year of the Clinton administration and the first year of the \nfirst Bush administration. The Republicans' charges of a slowdown could \nnot be farther from the truth.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate are on pace to match or \nexceed the confirmations of judges at the end of the first year of the \nClinton administration and at the end of the first year of the first \nBush administration.\n  In order to obscure this record pace, our Republican critics compare \nwhere we are now, on October 23, with where those Senate's were after \nthey adjourned in late November. The facts are that on October 23, \n1989, the Senate had confirmed only seven of President George H.W. \nBush's judicial nominees. On October 23, 2001, this year we will have \nconfirmed 12 of the judicial nominees of President George W. Bush.\n  Among the seven nominees confirmed by October 23, 1989 were three to \nthe courts of appeals. This year we have already confirmed four judges \nfor the courts of appeals.\n  By October 23, 1993, the Senate had confirmed eight judicial nominees \nfor President Clinton. Today we confirm our 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th \njudicial nominees since July this year. Among the nominees confirmed by \nthis date in 1993 were two nominees to the courts of appeals. This year \nwe have already confirmed four judges to the courts of appeals.\n  We are actually confirming more judges and confirming them faster \nthan in either of the first years of either the Clinton or first Bush \nadministration. In addition, I suspect that we are acting faster with \nrespect to more judges, including more nominees to the courts of \nappeals, than at virtually any time during the last several years in \nwhich a Republican majority controlled the Senate and the Judiciary \nCommittee and President Clinton was doing the nominating.\n  Further, in addition to the 12 judges the Senate has confirmed, the \nSenate Judiciary Committee has included seven additional nominees in \nconfirmation hearings and I have scheduled another hearing later this \nweek for another four judicial nominees, as well as another Department \nof Justice nominee. Thus, by the end of this week, in addition to the \ndozen judges confirmed, another 11 will have had hearings before the \ncommittee. If the Senate remains in session this year as late into \nNovember as it did in 1989 and 1993, we may have the opportunity for \nanother hearing involving several more judicial nominees.\n\n[[Page S10870]]\n\n  The record of the Senate since July is a good one. In spite of unfair \ncriticism and the wrongheaded delays and obstruction of Republicans, \nthe Senate remains on track to meet and exceed the judicial \nconfirmation totals for the first year of the first Bush administration \nand the first year of the Clinton administration.\n  Mr. NICKLES. Mr. President I am pleased that the Senate today will \nconfirm two outstanding jurists, Claire V. Eagan and James H. Payne, to \nbe U.S. District Court judges in my State of Oklahoma.\n  President Bush could not have chosen two finer individuals to serve \nour country as district court judges.\n  These individuals are exceptionally well-qualified and will prove to \nbe great assets to the judicial system in Oklahoma and our country.\n  Judge Eagan has been confirmed to serve as district judge for the \nNorthern District of Oklahoma. She is currently a U.S. magistrate judge \nfor the northern district where she has served for 3 years. Prior to \nthat she served as a litigation attorney with the firm of Hall, Estill \nfor 20 years. During that time, she handled a wide array of litigation \nas well as significant pro bono work and bar activities.\n  As a magistrate, she has gained judicial experience in criminal, \ncivil, habeas, and bankruptcy matters. She also supervised the court's \nsettlement program and devoted considerable time to early case \nresolution.\n  Judge Eagan is recognized as both a leader and instructor in the \nfields of trial and appellate practice and alternative dispute \nresolution. She has served on the faculty at the University of Tulsa \nCollege of Law and as an adjunct settlement judge for Tulsa Country \nDistrict Court.\n  Judge Payne has been confirmed to serve as district judge for the \nEastern District of Oklahoma. He is currently a U.S. magistrate judge \nfor the Eastern District of Oklahoma where he has served for 13 years. \nPrior to that he served as a private practice attorney with the firm of \nSandlin and Payne for 15 years, handling civil matters. He also served \n3 years as an assistant U.S. attorney for the eastern district. He has \nmaintained an active role in the community by providing pro bono \nservices to several local charitable organizations.\n  As a magistrate, he has gained experience in a broad range of \ncriminal and civil issues. He has implemented an Alternative Dispute \nResolution Program for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, which has \nallowed him to conduct an average of 100 settlement conferences per \nyear.\n  Following graduation from the University of Oklahoma College of Law, \nJudge Payne's 30-year legal career has included military service as an \nAir Force Judge Advocate General officer.\n  I thank Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member Hatch, and the Judiciary \nCommittee for their work on these nominations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of James H.

Mr. President, there were a number of hearings scheduled \nfor today and tomorrow in the Judiciary Committee, hearings to be \nchaired by Senators Schumer, Biden, and Feinstein, which have been \npostponed.

The Senate will now proceed to the \nconsideration of the nomination of Karen K. Caldwell, of Kentucky, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Karen K. \nCaldwell of Kentucky, to be a United States District Judge for the \nEastern District of Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the \nnomination of Karen Caldwell to be a Federal District Court Judge for \nthe Eastern District of Kentucky.\n  Karen has the qualities that will make her a fine judge--knowledge of \nthe law, calm and respected demeanor, and obvious intelligence.\n  She has had an outstanding professional career that has prepared her \nwell to sit on the bench. She is a former Assistant U.S. attorney for \nthe district, rising to become Deputy Chief of the Civil Division. From \n1991 to 1993, she served as the U.S. attorney for the eastern district. \nAmong the notable prosecutions during her tenure was her office's \nprosecution as part of Operation Boptrot, the Federal sting operation \nthat led to the conviction of a number of public officials and \nlobbyists in Kentucky.\n  It was a difficult and complex case, both legally and politically, \nand she handled it with great skill. In short, Karen's work helped \nrestore public confidence in elected officials in our Commonwealth.\n  Since leaving the U.S. attorney's post, Karen has specialized in \ncomplex civil and criminal litigation at one of Kentucky's leading \nfirms. She has won numerous awards for the quality of her work, and has \ntruly made a mark in Kentucky. It is only natural now that she rise to \nthe bench.\n  I urge the Senate to support this nomination. The President made a \ngreat choice by selecting her for the bench, and she is going to be a \nfine judge, not just for the people of the eastern district, but for \nour entire Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Karen K. Caldwell, of Kentucky, to be a \nUnited States District Judge for the Eastern District of Kentucky?\n  On this question the yeas and nays have been ordered.

Madam President, I have two subject matters I want to \naddress. I will take the first 10 minutes or so with my colleague from \nOhio to talk about the issue of children and bioterrorism, a matter I \nshared for many years working with the Senator from Ohio particularly \ndealing with pharmaceutical products and testing for pediatric cases, \nchildren. I want to take a few minutes to talk about some thoughts we \nshare together about the subject matter.\n  The second subject matter is about the recent, very positive news \ntoday coming out of Northern Ireland. In the midst of a lot of bad \nnews, we have heard the news today out of Northern Ireland that a \ndecommissioning process has begun and is underway as I speak, and that \nfinally, the real opportunity for lasting peace in Northern Ireland is \nat hand. I am sure my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, \nwho spent has worked tirelessly over many years to reach this day, will \nshortly have some comments and thoughts he would like to express on \nthis subject matter as well.\n  Let me express, on this first subject--and I see my colleague from \nOhio--and talk about the issue of bioterrorism and children. We know \nthere is a lot of work going on right now in trying to put something \ntogether.\n  Last week, as some of our colleagues may know, Senator DeWine and I \nwere able to pass unanimously in this body--by the way, we thank all of \nour colleagues for their support. Certainly, the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Kennedy, deserves a great deal of credit for working \nout a package for which we were able to garner the unanimous support of \nour colleagues to pass the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, which \nis designed, as I think many of our colleagues know, to induce the \nindustry to develop products specifically designed for children.\n\n[[Page S10872]]\n\n  Less than 20 percent of all pharmaceutical products on the shelves \ntoday are for children. Senator DeWine and I thought we ought to fix \nthat. We, in 1997, passed a 3-year bill as a trial more than anything \nelse. We had no idea whether or not it would work, but by providing a \nvery limited 6-month period of exclusivity, we hoped we might induce \nthe industry to do a lot more in this area.\n  In the previous 7 years before 1997, there had been 11 clinical \ntrials and two new products on the shelves of America for children. In \nthe 36 months since we passed that bill in 1997, there were 400 \nclinical trials and 40 new products on the shelves. As a result of that \ntremendous, beyond-our-wildest-imagination result, the other day, we \nwere able, with the full support of this body, to pass a 5-year bill \nthat will extend that very concept, with some additional provisions in \nit.\n  Why do we mention that particularly? It is because we believe today, \nin this era of bioterrorism we are now very painfully aware of, that we \nwant to make sure children are going to get properly tested, that \nproducts will be developed for children that will be especially \nvulnerable to release of chemical or biological toxins. So we outlined \nsome provisions. That is first of all.\n  We want to see legislation that will certainly take into account \nchildren's needs. We identify antibiotics or vaccines to prevent or \ntreat illnesses related to bioterrorism. We adults certainly need to \nknow how children will be affected as well, particularly during the \ncritical growth periods for children and the development that occurs \nthen that could lead to detrimental effects later in life. So we must \nhave proper medications to prevent those risks.\n  Secondly, we want to make sure the public health community will have \nemergency response personnel, doctors, and nurses who are properly \ntrained to address the special needs of children.\n  Thirdly, we think our children's mental health is as important as \ntheir physical health. There are a lot of issues we cannot even begin \nto calculate yet. Certainly, everyone in this Chamber can speak about \nthe great fear many in our Nation are experiencing as a result of the \nrecent bioterrorism attacks.\n  Just imagine the fear our children are experiencing as a result of \nthose same acts. We need to do everything in our means to address those \nparticular anxieties.\n  Fourthly, we need to make sure all places where children gather, from \nschools, child care centers, Head Start, and the like, are going to be \nprepared to deal with these emergency situations. The old way would \nhave been for them to be prepared for a fire, but today, as we know \nonly too well, emergency situations require a new response.\n  In times of bioterrorism, the children may not need to just exit the \nbuilding and stand on the sidewalk. We need to plan to potentially \naddress a far more grave crisis, as we have painfully learned in the \nCongress of the United States in the last several days.\n  We know people are working on this. We know the Senator from \nMassachusetts is working on it. The Senator from Ohio and I have some \nvery strong feelings about children and their need to be protected in \nthis area, and we wanted to take a few minutes today to share those \nthoughts with our colleagues.\n  I yield to my friend from Ohio for whatever time he may need to \nrespond to make some comments.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague and congratulate him for the great \njob he has done during his career in the Senate as an advocate for \nchildren. The bill he and I worked on several years ago, I think it is \nsafe to say, we anticipated would do good things, but neither one of us \nhad a full appreciation of what it would do until we saw several years \nlater the advances and the help it has given to children.\n  We hope, by the bill we were able to pass last week unanimously in \nthis body, we will continue and actually expand that work. The whole \nidea that when new drugs come on the market they would be appropriately \nlabeled for children so pediatricians and parents understand and will \nknow exactly, based on scientific data, what the best and proper dosage \nof that drug is. So I thank him for that work.\n  He and I have also been working in the last few days on the \nbioterrorism bill. Many people are involved in putting this legislation \ntogether. We are going to be drafting and ultimately debating this \nlegislation to protect our Nation against chemical and biological \nterrorism. Senator Frist and Senator Kennedy are working on that \nbioterrorism bill. Senator Dodd and I are working to help them on it.\n  Several weeks ago, Senator Clinton introduced a bill that would \naddress some of these issues. This is going to be a real bipartisan \nbill.\n  As we develop this legislation, it is absolutely essential we \nremember our children. It is critical that any measure we develop \naddresses the unique risk children face against the threat of chemical \nand biological terrorism. Children are not just small adults. My wife \nFran and I, with our eight children, grandparents of six, we are well \naware of that. We can't treat children the same way we treat adults.\n\n  So, again, as we consider steps to protect adults against \nbioterrorism, it is really absolutely essential that any measures we \nemploy also protect our children.\n  The sad fact is that currently little scientific data are available \nabout how the chemicals and microbes that terrorists might use, from \nanthrax to sarin gas, could affect children. It is not a leap in logic, \nhowever, to suggest that children, because of their size, their \ndeveloping immune system, and higher respiratory rates, are at a very \nhigh risk.\n  Our Nation today is not fully prepared to treat the specific needs of \nchildren in the event of a large-scale chemical or bioterrorist attack. \nThat is the sad truth.\n  Health care professionals, childcare providers, educators, and \nparents lack basic information about how to identify and treat \nbiological attacks. Furthermore, we lack research on antidotes and \nantibiotics, and their effects on children. We need more information on \nthe proper drug dosages for children, and we need to learn if certain \ndrugs can or even should be administered to children at all.\n  My point is very simple. Any legislation that we consider to address \nthe chemical and biological terrorism must, absolutely must at a \nminimum contain provisions to protect the needs of our children. In \ndoing so, I believe there are four primary areas that must be \naddressed.\n  First, we need to fund more drug research for children. Our Best \nPharmaceuticals For Children bill is a step in making sure children are \nprotected. We need to continue to ensure that drugs are tested and used \nappropriately for children.\n  Basically we need to do two things. One is to spend more money on \nresearch for children, and we need to put the resources behind \ndeveloping the protocols and the testing so once the drugs are \ndeveloped we know how they can be best used for children.\n  Second, we need to train health care workers to recognize and treat \nsymptoms of chemical and biological attacks. Pediatricians must be \nincluded in disaster planning and such plans should take into account \nthe need for special equipment and medications for children. Parents \nand emergency response personnel also should be given information on \nthe care and treatment of children in the event of an attack.\n  Third, we need to provide adequate mental health services for \nchildren to address the very real psychological effects of terrorism. \nChildren are scared just as adults are. We have to focus on how \nchildren are perceiving the world around them. We have to listen to \nthem. We have to hear their concerns.\n  Fourth, we need to educate childcare providers, teachers, schools, \ndaycare providers, childcare facilities--anyone who takes care of \nchildren. They all need to have information available so they are \nprepared to act in the case of a bioterrorist attack.\n  Ultimately, all the measures we debate to fight against terrorism are \nabout the future, about making our world safe, stable, and secure. This \nis all about the future. Children, of course, are our future.\n  When I think about that I am often reminded of something very \npowerful that the great American President Abraham Lincoln once said:\n\n       A child is a person who is going to carry on what you have \n     started. He is going to sit\n\n[[Page S10873]]\n\n     where you are sitting and when you are gone attend to those \n     things which you think are important. He will assume \n     control of your cities, states, and nations. He is going \n     to move in and take over your churches, your schools, your \n     universities and corporations. The fate of humanity is in \n     his hands.\n\n  Lincoln's words are as true today as they were more than a century \nand a half ago. There is no question that we have an obligation to \nprotect our children to make sure they are safe now so they can grow \ninto healthy, happy adults. So I urge my colleagues to remember that \nand to support antiterrorist efforts that will protect our children.\n  I thank my colleague for his kind comments. I, again, congratulate \nhim on the birth of his child. We talked about that a little last week. \nI know what a wonderful occasion that is, what a great joy. I had the \nopportunity to see my colleague come into the Senate office building, \nprobably for the first time, with his baby and see what a happy time \nthat was. I thank him again for his deep and longstanding commitment to \nthe children of this country.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Ohio. As I said \nbefore, he not only brings an intellectual commitment to this issue \nbut, with eight children and six grandchildren, he is a wellspring of \ngood practical advice as well. If you have a bill about children and \nyou want to know whether or not it is practically going to work, Mike \nDeWine is the fellow you want to talk to, given his family.\n  I thank him and point out, as he has said so eloquently here, that we \nhave learned a lot in the last several days and weeks. The thing we \nhave learned the most I guess is how little we know and how ill-\nprepared we are in many ways and how vulnerable we are. People take \nadvantage of our freedoms to use those freedoms against us in many \nways. The best answer to that is to not give up these freedoms but be \nbetter prepared to face the challenges. That is what Senator DeWine \nadvocated in his outline of four or five points that are to be included \nin any bill on bioterrorism where children are concerned.\n  Senator Kennedy graciously has provided some time for us to have some \nhearings. It may not be possible this Friday. We had hoped to this \nFriday, but a couple of key witnesses we wanted to have testify may not \nbe able to appear because of the demands that are being placed on them \ndealing with the present situation here in the Halls of Congress. But \nwe may postpone it a week or so.\n  We want to look at this issue in a broad way. I have always thought \nsome of the most important functions we engage in are not only \nlegislating but providing a forum where people can be heard in order to \neducate people. So we would like to craft as well a comprehensive bill \nas we can to deal with children. We may not get it all done in a \nbioterrorism bill. We may look further than that in the coming months, \nas to how best prepare America--families, parents, schools, childcare \ncenters, others, as the Senator pointed out--how to deal with these \nsituations, how to be well educated in their own response. The \nSubcommittee on Children and Families, which I serve now as chairman \nand on which I worked very closely with my colleague from Ohio on a \nnumber of bills in the past, will be holding a number of hearings on \nchildren and the effects of recent events in New York and Washington, \nthe savage attacks on September 11 and then, of course, the most recent \nattacks here in Washington, Florida, New York, New Jersey, and \nelsewhere with anthrax. It is just an indication of the kinds of \nexposures to which we are all vulnerable.\n  We have a lot of work to do here but we welcome the challenge. I \ncan't tell you how much I look forward to working with my colleague \nfrom Ohio and others. The Senator from Ohio properly pointed out there \nare a lot of our colleagues who are interested in this subject matter. \nCertainly Senator Kennedy is, Senator Frist has done a lot of work \nhere, our colleague from New York, Senator Clinton, has a deep interest \nin the subject matter and has made various proposals. We hope to be \nable to marshal all of this together and come out with the best ideas \nwe can to deal with the immediate problems, and then recognize this \nmust be an important part of our agenda in the coming months.\n  It is regretful to say that, but the world has changed. You can \npretend it didn't happen, pretend it doesn't exist and leave yourself \nvulnerable to further attacks. Or you can address it. I think what the \nSenator from Ohio and I are suggesting this afternoon is that we \naddress these problems.\n  I thank my colleague from Ohio for his comments and kind words.\n  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/23/senate-section/article/S10873-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10873-S10874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE NORTHERN IRELAND PEACE PROCESS\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, a second subject matter I want to address \nis that with the bad news that we have daily been subjected to in this \ncountry since September 11 regarding international and domestic \nterrorism and finding and bringing those to justice who are responsible \nit is refreshing to be able to report on some good news. Today, it \nappears that a major obstacle to the full implementation of the Good \nFriday accords on the Northern Ireland peace process has been removed \nwith the announcement by the IRA that it has begun to permanently put \nbeyond use all its weapons. I believe that General de Chastelain, on \nbehalf of the International Commission on Decommissioning, will shortly \nconfirm that this has, in fact, been done.\n  For those of us, and there are many in this Chamber and the other \nbody who have been involved in these issues over the past 8 or 10 \nyears, this is a very significant moment indeed.\n  It means that the sectarian differences which have torn Northern \nIreland apart for nearly thirty years, and shed the blood of too many \nIrish men, women and children can now be addressed through dialog and \ncompromise rather than by bullets and bombs.\n  In many ways the issue of decommissioning has been an unfortunate \ndistraction that has delayed the implementation of key provisions of \nthe 1998 Good Friday Accords--provisions that were specifically \ndesigned to address the problems that have plagued the six counties of \nthe North for decades. Now Northern Ireland's political leadership \nshould no longer be paralyzed by this side issue. Finally they can \nbegin to deal with injustice and inequality--the real causes of the \nTroubles, as those who signed the Peace Accords committed themselves to \ndo within the context of that agreement. There is no mystery as to what \nneeds to be done--the issues of police reform, domestic security, human \nrights and equal opportunity for all the citizens of Northern Ireland \nmust be tackled in good faith.\n  It has taken a great deal of courage on the part of Ireland's \npolitical leaders to bring us to where we are today. Many have done so \nat great personal risk to themselves. They have been willing to do so \nbecause they are mindful of the historical significance of their \nactions. I want to commend Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness of Sinn \nFein for their tireless efforts to convince the IRA to trust in the \npolitical process as the only way to remedy past grievances. I commend \nas well David Trimble--Ulster Unionist Leader--for his courage in \nstanding up to those elements of unionism who will not or cannot accept \nthat all the peoples of the North are equal in the eyes of God and man. \nI cannot fail to mention the role that British and Irish political \nleaders Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern played in this drama--they stuck \nwith the peace process even when it seemed as though it seemed at times \nthat the obstacles were insurmountable. I believe that President Bush \nalso should be commended for continuing President Clinton's policy of \nprodding all the parties to move forward to implement the Good Friday \nAccords so that Irish weapons will be silenced once and for all. I \nwould be remiss if I did not also mention our former colleague, the \nformer majority leader of this body, Senator George Mitchell of Maine, \nwho played a key and pivotal role in crafting those Good Friday \naccords. I have not had the chance to speak to him today, but I am sure \nhe is gratified by these recent developments. But most of all I want to \nheap praise on the individual who had the vision and determination to \nwork for the last thirty years so that this day would happen, I am \nspeaking of John Hume, among the greatest civil rights activists of his \ngeneration. Obviously there\n\n[[Page S10874]]\n\nare others, Albert Reynolds, Jean Kennedy Smith--who played very \nsignificant roles in moving this process along step by step over the \nlast many years.\n  I hope that the significance of this event does not get lost in other \nnews today. I would ask our colleagues to take time out and reflect \nupon the significance of today's announcement. Sometimes we think \nproblems are intractable that we will never be able to solve them--\nproblems of the Middle East, problems of central Asia--that there is no \nhope of ever resolving civil conflicts. Certainly many put Northern \nIreland in that category as well.\n  Just as the signing of the 1998 Peace Accords created new \nopportunities for the people of Northern Ireland to find peace, so too \ndoes today's announcement by the IRA. But let me stress that it is just \nthat, an opportunity, which can be made the most of or squandered. It \ncan be approached with generosity and reciprocity or it can be \ndenigrated as insufficient. The people of Northern Ireland have \nsuffered for too long. They are desperate to live in peace--desperate \nfor a better life for themselves and for their children. I hope and \npray that the political leaders of Northern Ireland will find that \nspirit of generosity as well as the vision and courage that the people \nof Northern Ireland expect from them and move forward to fully \nimplement the Good Friday Accords. If that comes to pass, then we will \nbe able to look back on this day--a day otherwise clouded by threats of \nterrorism--and recognize that there was a ray of light breaking through \nthat cloud.\n  I hope, Mr. President, that this ray of light can someday shine \nbrightly in all corners of the globe so that matters which can affect \nus so deeply here at home, in the Middle East, and central Asia can \nalso be the beneficiaries of that light, and that one day we will stand \nhere and talk about the end of terrorism and peace in all quarters of \nthe world where people today believe peace and security are not \nachievable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dayton). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/23/senate-section/article/S10874-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 1552\n\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I rise in the matter of Internet taxes. As \nyou and others across this country who are following this issue very \nclosely well know, the 3-year moratorium on access taxes as well as the \n3-year moratorium on discriminatory taxes on the Internet that had been \npassed by the Senate and the House 3 years ago expired on Sunday, \nOctober 21--just a couple of days ago.\n  The Internet is important to our economy. The taxes that could be \nimposed on the Internet would be harmful to the economy. It would be \nharmful to technology. I think it would be very harmful especially to \nlower-income families and thereby widen the digital divide. In my view, \nthere is no time to dawdle; there is no time for conference committees.\n  So I ask unanimous consent that the Senate immediately proceed to the \nconsideration of H.R. 1552, the House-passed 2-year clean extension of \nthe Internet access tax moratorium currently being held at the desk, \nand that it be considered, read three times, and passed, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I shall \nobject--let me say to the Senator from Virginia, he and I have had long \ndiscussions about this subject. I very much respect his views. He is \nproposing a 2-year extension of the Internet tax moratorium. I proposed \nan 8-month extension last week, I believe it was. But my 8-month \nextension to June 30 of next year included an additional proviso, and \nthat proviso, at the end of the legislation, would have had Congress on \nrecord saying to both State governments and also to Internet and other \nremote sellers that we want them to, A, simplify the sales and use tax \nsystem and, B, when that is done, be able to allow the remote sellers \nto collect the sales and use taxes on the sale.\n  There are two issues here. The Senator from Virginia and I do not \ndisagree on the first. I am not someone who supports taxing access to \nthe Internet. As far as I am concerned, we can extend the prohibition \non that forever. I also do not support punitive and discriminatory \ntaxation with respect to Internet sales. So we have no disagreement \nabout that. But however there is a second area of difficulty. The \nSenator from Virginia raises the first.\n  If I might continue under my reservation, Mr. President, the first \nissue is taxation with respect to the Internet. It actually is taxation \nwith respect to remote sales, which is a broader issue. The second is \nthe question, How do you effect a collection of the tax that is already \nowed on remote sales? As the Senator from Virginia knows, almost no one \nis paying that use tax and States are losing a substantial amount of \nmoney, most of which is used for funding education.\n  So what I want to do is find a way to solve both problems, not just \none. And on the first piece, the Senator from Virginia and I will not \nfind great disagreement. I understand his view and will support his \nview with respect to extension and prohibiting taxing access, et \ncetera.\n  I hope he will similarly support my view that we also ought to solve \nthe other problems State and local governments have, and remote sellers \nhave, for that matter, with respect to the complexity of the sales tax \nand the collection or lack of collection of sales taxes and use taxes. \nMy colleague from Wyoming is, in fact, working on another piece of \nlegislation on that issue even as we speak. I know he has consulted \nwith the Senator from Virginia.\n  So, Mr. President, for those reasons, I object to the request by the \nSenator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/23/senate-section/article/S10874-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10874-S10876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--S. 1504\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as long as the Senator from Virginia is \nhere, I ask unanimous consent, again, that we discharge S. 1504 and \nproceed to it: that it be read a third time, and passed, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Incidentally, in my request is an extension of the Internet tax \nmoratorium. The extension would last until next June 30. The Senator \nfrom Virginia wants the extension. I say, yes, let's have an extension. \nI will not support the 2 years at the moment. I support him until June \n30, 2002. I will be prepared to support much longer than that when we \nare able to reach agreement on the other piece.\n  The second piece I have in S. 1504 is a statement by Congress saying \nto both sides, on the second problem: State and local governments, \nsimplify your sales and use tax system. And then it says to them: When \nyou have done so, when you have substantially simplified that system, \nwe will then allow consideration of the opportunity for you to enforce \ncollection of sales and use taxes with respect to remote sellers. It is \na two-pronged approach to solve the second problem.\n  The Senator from Virginia, I might say, addresses the first. I would \nask Congress to address the first and second piece of this. I \nunderstand it is horribly complicated. But, by the same token, I think \nwe need to address both problems.\n  So I have objected to the 2-year extension proposed by the Senator \nfrom Virginia and would like to continue to work with him on these \nissues.\n  I have now proposed and asked consent that we discharge S. 1504, \nproceed to it, that it be read a third time, passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table. As I have indicated, it has an \nextension to June 30, 2002 and has a paragraph at the end of the \nlegislation that deals with the second important issue as well. I make \nsuch a request, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALLEN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, I respect the creativity, diligence, and \nardor\n\n[[Page S10875]]\n\nwith which the Senator from North Dakota pursues this issue. This issue \nof taxing or requiring retailers or sellers to tax that are not located \nwithin the State, that do not have a physical presence in the State, do \nnot have a nexus in the State, is an argument that is as old as our \nRepublic.\n  One of the problems our Founders had, in going from the Articles of \nConfederation to our current Federal Republic, was that different \nStates were imposing fines, taxes, and tariffs on interstate commerce. \nSo that was one of the reasons we went to the current form we have--to \nat least have within our country a free trade zone and not have \nburdensome taxes on the flow of interstate commerce.\n  The idea the Senator from North Dakota, Mr. Dorgan, proposes, with \nlong, deliberative examination, may be worthwhile. But the issue at \nhand at this moment is that the moratorium on Internet access taxes and \ndiscriminatory taxes expired last Sunday, October 21.\n  This issue in recent years has been worked on time after time. It \nfirst came up in the midst of the Bellas Hess decision and then came up \nmore recently in the Supreme Court Quill decision. In those situations, \nthe issue was catalog sales. But whether the catalog company is in \nMaine or New Hampshire or Oregon or whatever other State, the Supreme \nCourt ruled that these States could not compel those companies--Quill \nat that particular time--to remit sales taxes to a State in which they \nhad no physical presence. So that is the constitutional parameter we \nare under.\n  This issue of trying to get around the Supreme Court decisions, \ntrying to come up with simplification, and hamstringing the Senate in \nthe future to vote on whatever this may be as far as simplification is \nconcerned, while it is a very creative and, I think, very thoughtful \napproach, to me, we really have no time to act.\n  Let's recognize that the other body, the House, has already acted. It \nis a 2-year extension on the very simple, clear, and clean issue of \nhaving a moratorium on access taxes and discriminatory taxes on the \nInternet by States or localities.\n  Please note, Mr. President, when this moratorium was first put on 3 \nyears ago, several States and localities had imposed access taxes and \ndiscriminatory taxes, and they are now grandfathered. So here we are \ntoday generally stuck with those taxes being imposed in those \njurisdictions, in those States.\n  The longer this lapses, the more likely the legislative process will \napply, whether in a local jurisdiction or in a State. We will end up \nwith more of these taxes, and we will never be able to get rid of them. \nThey will be like the Spanish-American War tax, the luxury tax that was \nput on telephone service to finance the Spanish-American War. We won \nthat war 100 years ago, but that tax is still on telephone service.\n  While this is a good idea and something that can be worked on over \nthe years, if something such as this should pass the Senate, it is \nobviously different from what has passed the House, which means it \nwould have to go to a conference committee. Who knows when that might \nmeet? We may be here only a few more weeks, and most likely those \ndifferences would not be ironed out.\n  It is fine to work on simplification. It has been worked on for \ndecades. I don't think this issue of access taxes on the Internet or \ndiscriminatory taxes ought to be held hostage to that very problematic \nalthough understandable concern of the Senator from North Dakota and \nmany others.\n  With that, I object to the request of the Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Virginia and I have had \nsome nice conversations on this subject. I know he feels strongly about \nthis. I did want to clear up a couple things.\n  First of all, when someone purchases something on the Internet or \nfrom a catalog, there is actually a tax owed in most cases. It is just \nthat it is never paid. Most Americans when they order something from a \ncatalog are required to submit a use tax to the State, because the \nseller wasn't required to collect the sales tax. The buyer is supposed \nto send a use tax to the State government, but they never do and never \nwill because it would require literally millions of tax returns being \nfiled for a $1.20 or $2.80 purchase. That is why it was always much \nmore effective to collect a sales tax at the source.\n  I agree with those who say we don't think catalog sellers or Internet \nsellers or remote sellers ought to be required to subscribe to 7,000 \ndifferent taxing jurisdictions; that is not fair. I agree with that. \nThat is why I say, if you are going to simplify the collection system \nand allow it to have the remote sellers collect it, then you really \nneed to simplify it in a way that is substantive.\n  Let me make this point also: It is not the case that the Supreme \nCourt has said there is no inherent right for State governments to tax \nin these circumstances. That is not what the Supreme Court has said. \nThey said the sole arbiter of what the States can or can't do with \nrespect to what is called nexus or whether they have jurisdiction is \nthe Congress because it deals with the commerce clause. That decision \nis only reserved for the Congress, not for the States. That is what the \nSupreme Court decision said.\n  That is why Congress has to decide what to do and how to do it at \nthis point. While we perhaps have a disagreement at this moment, I hope \nwe might be able to figure out how to resolve it. It does not make any \nsense to me, if we are going to lose $20 or $30 or $40 billion in local \nrevenues, to have somebody hire tens of thousands of tax collectors to \ngo knock on doors and ask for them to submit their $3.38 in use tax \nthey owe. That doesn't make any sense. I don't believe the Senator from \nVirginia or anyone else would want to do that. All you do is add to the \nemployment rolls of the Government and hassle people.\n  It makes far more sense to require State and local governments to \nsimplify their local sales and use tax base and then to say to the \nremote sellers, those above $5 million a year in sales: Collect this \nnow and remit it to the States and save everybody from trouble. We \nsimplified the system for you. We simplified it for the consumer. \nEverybody wins. That is the point of all of this.\n  With respect to the question of the tax incidence that the Senator \nfrom Virginia mentioned, as I said before, there is no new tax here. \nThis is not a discussion about a new tax versus an old tax or whether \nthere is a tax versus not a tax; this is a question of how you collect \na tax that is owed, in what circumstances would it be fair to require a \nremote seller to collect it; that is all.\n  On the final subject of this issue of an expiring moratorium, I \nsupported the moratorium. I was on the floor of the Senate at that \npoint and worked with Senators Wyden, McCain, and others. I supported \nthe moratorium. I now support it and would be willing to extend it \nuntil June 30, 2002 at this point. We can perhaps extend it beyond that \nas we go along.\n  My expectation is that the narrow time-frame in which this moratorium \nhas expired will not give opportunity to those who might want to take \nadvantage of it. I frankly don't think that is going to happen. I am \nhere on the floor perfectly prepared to work with the Senator from \nVirginia and others to extend this moratorium, if he will work with me \nand Senators Enzi, Voinovich, Graham, Kerry and other colleagues to \nhelp solve the other side of the equation. And we may not solve it all \nnow, but put a provision in that says this is congressional intent. If \nhe will work with me to solve the second side of the issue, I will work \nwith him to solve the first side. We will make some progress on this \nissue.\n  This is a complicated issue. I admit that. It is one of some \nconsequence with more and more remote sales occurring. More than forty \nGovernors have now written letters saying: We have literally tens of \nbillions of dollars we are not going to collect, much of which is \nneeded to run our school system. You need to help us find a way to \ncollect that revenue that is owed.\n  We say to the Governors: God bless you. You have a problem. We will \nhelp you solve that problem, but you have to do something for us. You \nhave to simplify your system so that we are not going to whipsaw \nbusinesses out there that have to comply with thousands of different \njurisdictions.\n\n[[Page S10876]]\n\n  I want to do two things. I want to require dramatic simplification on \nthe part of State and local governments and require the collection of a \ntax that is owed on the part of remote sellers, and I want to extend \nthe moratorium so that we don't have discriminatory and punitive taxes \napplied anywhere in the system, with Internet sellers, remote sellers, \nand so on.\n  I certainly am someone who works in the Commerce Committee with the \nSenator from Virginia. I am proud to do that. I believe technology is \ncritically important to our country. It is an accelerator to the growth \nof our economy. There are a lot of important things that are happening \nwith respect to technology. That is the reason I, too, am interested in \nextending this moratorium. That is why I offered the consent request \nlast week, why I offer it today, and I will continue to offer it. It is \nmy hope that others will continue to join me in trying to solve the \nsecond side of the equation.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. President, this issue is foundational to the formation \nof our Republic. It is actually similar to what Patrick Henry talked \nabout, taxation without representation. Obviously, the use taxes are to \nbe collected by the States.\n  This is not a decision to be made by the States. If it were up to the \nStates, obviously, they would be collecting and compelling retailers \nwho do not have a physical presence in their State, who don't vote in \ntheir State, who do not receive any fire services, any police services, \nany services whatsoever from that State. If it were up to the States, \nfor their convenience, they would be requiring them to collect and \nremit these taxes. This really becomes an issue of convenience for the \ntax collectors at a locality or at a State.\n  It is, as Senator Dorgan rightly stated, a decision for Congress to \nmake. It does deal with interstate commerce. However, Congress, in all \nthe decades this has been considered, has never said, before the \nInternet was even contemplated for use of communications or commerce or \neducation, when people were more concerned about catalog sales, even \nthen Congress said, no, we are not going to burden interstate commerce.\n  So that is the reason why Congress has never agreed. Now, the States \nand the localities can simplify. There is a ZIP code reported to me in \nthe Denver, CO, area, that within that same code there are four \ndifferent sales taxes applied to the very same product. I agree with \nSenator Dorgan that all of this ought to be simplified. I think if the \nStates on their own, along with their subdivisions--counties, cities, \nor municipalities--worked to simplify, they will find many, especially \nthe larger retailers that are from out of State, willing to comply as \nlong as it is simplified and there is auditing, which is logical, and \nthey get a reasonable remittance back for collecting and sending in \nthose sales taxes, as is accorded to most retailers within a State. \nThen I think you will find it all being handled in that regard.\n  Again, all of this is separate from the most pressing issue, which is \nthese access taxes and discriminatory taxes which on Senator Dorgan and \nI would be in absolute agreement; we would not want to see more of them \ncoming on, and there are many in effect now. Indeed, I am researching \nSouth Carolina, where the legislature has enacted a moratorium on State \nsales taxes on charges for Internet access effective from October 1998 \nthrough October 2001. Outside of this moratorium period, South Carolina \ncan subject charges for Internet access to the State's sales tax. It \nmay be automatic, by virtue of that law in South Carolina, that such \ntaxes can be imposed even if the legislature may not be meeting. So for \nthe most part I don't suspect many are going to be able to go to public \nhearings to get them done. But this is how this may be applying in \nSouth Carolina, unless the Governor said let's hold off on this and see \nwhat happens in Washington.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield, I believe the Senator from \nVirginia raised the question of South Carolina. I am not familiar with \nthat circumstance, but I think the Senator said South Carolina could, \nin fact, begin collecting. I don't know that he said they would or are \ncollecting. I say this to the Senator. We will, in my judgment, extend \nthe moratorium. When we do that, I will be willing to join him in \nextending it retroactively until October 22, 2001, to say to State and \nlocal governments: Beware, if you are thinking of messing around with \npublic policy and taking advantage of a window when we extend this--and \nwe will, in my judgment--Congress will intend to extend it \nretroactively to October 22. It is not unprecedented. I would be happy \nto join the Senator in sending that message if that is the message he \nwould like to send. That resolves the issue he has just discussed.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I say to the Senator from North Dakota, I join with him. \nAlthough we have a contentious issue on some parts, we are in agreement \nthere. I hope that message goes out to States and localities. Just \nbecause this has lapsed, please do not rush to tax the Internet access \nor impose discriminatory taxes.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/23/senate-section/article/S10876-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     EXTENSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, early this afternoon, my friend and \ncolleague, Senator Dodd, addressed the Senate about a very significant \ndevelopment that occurred today in the Northern Ireland peace process. \nI join him and so many others in the Senate, in the House of \nRepresentatives, and across the country in welcoming these \ndevelopments. They are especially welcome at a time when we are still \nexperiencing the dark emotions and feelings from the September 11 \nterrorist attacks that killed thousands. We have been further disturbed \nin recent days by the anthrax attacks that have taken the lives of \ndedicated public servants in this community.\n  In the midst of these tragic events, I welcome this opportunity to \nbring to the attention of my colleagues an historic breakthrough in the \nNorthern Ireland peace process that occurred earlier today. This \nafternoon the IRA issued a statement indicating that it had begun the \nprocess of decommissioning its weapons. General de Chastelain, who \nchairs the international group responsible for overseeing the process, \nhas confirmed that the decommissioning of some weapons has has \noccurred. These actions are unprecedented in scope and are a watershed \nin the peace process that began a decade ago.\n  In 1994, after 30 years of violence, the IRA announced a historic \ncease-fire. That cease-fire led to the discussions, ably led by Senator \nMitchell and strongly supported by President Clinton, which culminated \nin the 1988 Good Friday Peace Agreement. As a part of that visionary \nAgreement, commitments were made by the British and Irish governments \nand the political leaders on all sides of Northern Ireland to advance \nthe peace process. Each party to the Agreement made important \nsacrifices to advance the common good and the process of peace.\n\n  The Agreement provided for a power-sharing local government and \ncross-border institutions. It called for dramatic reform of the police \nservice in Northern Ireland to ensure that it would be representative \nof both communities. It called for equal treatment and equal \nopportunity for all in Northern Ireland. It called for a reduction in \nthe presence of British troops and on all paramilitary organizations to \ndecommission their weapons.\n  This bold and historic action by the IRA to decommission its weapons \nwill\n\n[[Page S10877]]\n\nliberate the peace process, advance the cause of peace, and enable the \nissue of IRA decommissioning to take its rightful place as one of many \nreforms essential to the full implementation of the Good Friday Peace \nAgreement and the achievement of lasting peace for Northern Ireland.\n  Now the Irish and British governments and the political leaders of \nNorthern Ireland must commit to implement all aspects of the Agreement \nfairly and fully, especially the critical provisions on reductions of \nthe presence of British troops, reform of the police service, and equal \ntreatment and equal opportunity for all of the people of Northern \nIreland. Through this action, the IRA has enhanced the prospect for \npeace.\n  Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams' public call for the IRA to \ndecommission its weapons was strong and bold, and I commend him for his \nleadership on this difficult issue at this critical time. This \nextraordinary breakthrough could never have happened without the \nskillful and constant leadership of Prime Minister Blair of Great \nBritain and Prime Minister Ahern of Ireland. I also commend President \nBush and his envoy to Northern Ireland, Ambassador Richard Haass, for \ntheir skillful assistance in helping to break this extremely serious \nimpasse.\n  I commend as well the leaders in Ireland, and Great Britain, and the \nU.S. who, over the years, have contributed so much to the beginnings \nand continuation of this all important peace process. They all deserve \ngreat credit for their vision and leadership in the cause of peace.\n  I am mindful of the extraordinary role of John Hume, who shared the \nNobel Peace Prize with David Trimble. I can remember many years ago \nmeeting John Hume, who at that time was a local political leader and \nwho had exhibited extraordinary political courage.\n  His life has been one of commitment and dedication to peace. He \nplayed an instrumental role in securing the cease-fire. His voice for \ntolerance and understanding and his call for respect for the two great \ntraditions in the north--the Protestant and Catholic faiths--have been \neloquent.\n  He has recently retired as political leader for his party, the SDLP \nin Northern Ireland. His contribution to a political resolution of the \nconflict in Northern Ireland will be forever emblazoned in history.\n  All who share the goal of peace should welcome the action that has \nbeen taken today.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The senior assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska).

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the question of \nfunding a farm bill. A number of the commodity groups have written to \nleadership suggesting we do not have to worry about moving with \nexpedition to deal with a farm bill this year because, they suggest, \nthey have received a commitment from the administration, and I will \nquote from the letter:\n\n       The administration has provided assurances that the \n     resources necessary to fund a farm bill above the current \n     baseline will be available next year.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 23, 2001.\n     Senator Tom Daschle,\n     Senate Majority Leader,\n     The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Daschle: The following organizations would \n     like to offer our thoughts on the current consideration of \n     the farm bill in the Senate. To date, the debate has \n     reflected the assumption that the additional funding for the \n     bill provided in the FY-2002 Budget Resolution will only be \n     available if the legislation is completed by the end of the \n     First Session of the 107th Congress. This premise has led a \n     number of interested parties to support a process that would \n     limit the amount of time for consideration and development of \n     a farm bill.\n       The Administration has provided assurances that the \n     resources necessary to fund a farm bill above the current \n     baseline will be available next year. In light of this \n     commitment, we would support the Senate Agriculture Committee \n     continuing a deliberative process with a goal of reaching \n     Senate passage early in the Second Session of the 107th \n     Congress. We believe that a careful and deliberative process \n     will provide an opportunity for all parties involved to fully \n     address the needs and implications of the next farm bill on \n     U.S. agriculture and on consumers at home and around the \n     world.\n       We believe it is also important to recognize that the \n     attention of the Administration and Congress today is \n     appropriately focused on conducting the war against \n     international terrorism. Rushing the process of developing \n     comprehensive farm legislation at this critical time without \n     full and careful consideration could well result in policies \n     and programs that do not effectively address today's needs.\n       Based on the Administration's support for a deliberative \n     Committee process and the necessary levels of funding, we \n     urge you to set a goal of finalizing the farm bill by the \n     spring of 2002. We feel this schedule will enable all of us \n     to address the needs of all farmers, ranchers, and other \n     interested parties, and to chart a successful course for \n     agriculture and consumers for years to come.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Soybean Association; National Cattlemen's Beef \n           Association; National Corn Growers Association; \n           National Chicken Council; National Pork Producers \n           Council; National Sunflower Association; National \n           Turkey Federation; United Fresh Fruit & Vegetable \n           Association; U.S. Canola Association.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. That assurance is meaningless. That assurance by the \nadministration that the resources are going to be available next year \nis meaningless. Why is it meaningless? It is meaningless because the \nadministration plays no role in the writing of the budget resolution. \nThat is purely a congressional document. It does not even go to the \nPresident. It is considered in the House and in the Senate, and it is \nconferenced between the House and the Senate and it never goes to the \nPresident.\n  I am the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. I want to alert my \ncolleagues that anyone who believes the same amount of money is going \nto be available next year as is available this year is absolutely in a \ndream world.\n  I understand the Secretary of Agriculture has called Members in the \nlast few days telling them money is not a problem, that she has been \nassured by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mr. \nDaniels, that money is not a problem. Wrong. Money is a problem. Money \nis going to be a big problem. We have funding in the current year \nbudget to write a new farm bill. We have $74 billion over the so-called \nbaseline with which to write a new farm bill. Those resources were \nprovided because it was understood without additional resources we \ncould not write an adequate farm bill because the so-called baseline is \nbased on the previous farm bill that has proved to be such a failure. \nIt has been a disaster itself.\n  If it has not been a disaster, why have we had to write four economic \ndisaster bills in a row to keep our farmers from mass liquidation? That \nis what would have happened without the disaster assistance bills we \nhave passed in each of the last 4 years.\n  The administration says--and these farm organizations people who they \nare supposed to represent send a letter to the leadership saying--the \nadministration has provided assurances the resources necessary to fund \na farm bill above the current baseline will be available next year? How \nmuch above the baseline? Seventy-four billion dollars above the \nbaseline because that is what is available now.\n  So they are buying a pig in a poke? They are saying to those of us \nwho represent farmers all across America: You just line up there and \nyou wait and do not worry about it because we are going to have money \nabove the baseline? Really? How do you know? Where is the money coming \nfrom?\n  Is it going to be $74 billion, or is it going to be $1 billion above \nthe baseline? The administration would meet its supposed assurance if \nthey provided $1 billion instead of the $74 billion that is available \nin the budget now.\n  I have never been so disappointed in farm organizations as in the \nfarm organizations that wrote this letter to our leadership telling \nthem do not worry about getting the job done this year because they \nhave gotten assurances that the money is going to be there; that\n\n[[Page S10878]]\n\nsome amount of money--they do not know how much--theoretically is going \nto be available and they have taken assurances from the administration, \nwhich plays no role in determining what resources are available in the \nnext budget resolution to write a farm bill.\n  It is a dereliction of duty. I think they have let down the people \nwho they purport to represent by sending up a letter like this saying: \nDo not worry about it, the money is somehow going to be there. I say to \nmy colleagues, do not be fooled. The money is in the budget now. If we \ndo not use the money that is in the budget now, it is very likely not \ngoing to be available next year.\n  When we write the next budget resolution, we are going to be facing a \ntotally different circumstance than we faced in the spring of this year \nwhen we wrote the budget. Does anybody not understand that? Does \nanybody not see the dramatic transformation from a weakening economy, \nfrom a sneak attack on this country, from the need for substantial \nfunds for rebuilding the country, for defending the Nation for \ncounterterrorism efforts?\n  Somehow the money is going to come from somewhere to write a new farm \nbill. I say to my colleagues, there is money in the budget this year to \nwrite a new farm bill, and if we do not use the money that is available \nthis year, you can forget that same amount of money being available \nnext year. It is not going to happen.\n  The economy is weakening. That means less revenue. On the spending \nside, we are having to spend more money on defense, on \ncounterterrorism, and on rebuilding those areas that were damaged in \nthe attacks. That means everything else next year is going to be very \nsqueezed. That means there is not going to be the same amount of money \navailable next year to write a decent farm bill. Frankly, the money \nthat has been provided in this year's budget is just barely enough to \nwrite a decent farm bill. It is, in fact, less--it will provide less \nthan farmers have gotten each of the last 3 years. Not just a little \nbit less, substantially less; in fact, 26 percent less on average than \nthey have gotten under the disaster assistance bills of the last 3 \nyears.\n\n  So nobody should be under any illusion about the money being \navailable next year. Nobody should be under any illusion. The \nadministration is in no position to help with this problem because they \nhave no role--none, zero--in writing the budget resolution that will be \nadopted next spring. So these farm organizations that have run out, \nsupposedly representing their members, and told the leadership here, \ndon't worry about getting the job done this year, have done an enormous \ndisservice to their membership--enormous.\n  What are they going to say when we get to write a new farm bill next \nyear and the money is dramatically reduced? What are they going to say \nto their members then, after counseling delay? What are they going to \nsay to them? What is the administration going to say? Because this \nadministration has made clear they don't want us to write a new farm \nbill this year; they don't want to spend the amount of money that is in \nthe budget. Unfortunately, what that means is that the rural parts of \nthis country, those that are dependent on agriculture, are going to be \nin very grave danger of being left out and left behind as we write, \nironically enough, a stimulus package for the national economy.\n  These farm organizations that have written the leadership here saying \nthe resources necessary to fund a farm bill above the current baseline \nwill be available next year are giving very bad advice. They are wrong. \nThey are just as wrong as wrong can be. It is really hard to understand \nhow they would ever have written such a letter without doing their \nhomework first because they have let down their membership.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DAYTON. I say to the distinguished chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, who you might say was instrumental in getting this $73 \nbillion into the budget resolution for the sake of the farmers from \nNorth Dakota, Minnesota, and elsewhere across the country, I received \none of these phone calls asking if we couldn't hold off on the farm \nbill until next year. It seems not coincidental that this letter \nfollows that conversation by just a day, in fact, in my case.\n  I am wondering if the Senator from North Dakota thinks there is some \nconnection with these organizations, that they have been persuaded \nsomehow to write a letter. As you say, why would they be contrary to \nthe interest of their own member farmers? As part of this desire of \nsome, and I guess the administration, to delay a farm bill until next \nyear, what do you think the consequences of that will be?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I say to my colleague, there is no question in my mind \nwhat the consequences will be. No. 1, substantially less money to write \na new farm bill than the money left in this budget.\n  No. 2, that means a totally inadequate farm bill.\n  No. 3, that means hard-pressed farmers would be in even more serious \nshape because we failed to use the money that was available in this \nyear's budget to write a farm bill that would strengthen their economic \ncondition.\n  I want to make this as clear as it can be. They say they have \nreceived assurances that the resources necessary to fund a farm bill \nabove the current baseline will be available next year.\n\n  No. 1, there is no statement there about how much above the current \nbaseline. The current baseline was predicated on the old farm bill--the \nold farm bill that was a total failure, the old farm bill that required \nus to write four disaster assistance bills in the last 4 years. This \nhas no assurance that it is going to be the same amount of money that \nis in the budget this year. In fact, we know the administration doesn't \nwant us to have the same amount of money. They have proposed a dramatic \ncut from what is in the budget this year to write a new farm bill. That \nis the dirty little secret.\n  They proposed a substantial cut. Instead of over the next 5 years $40 \nbillion being available, they have said only $25 billion ought to be \navailable. Guess what. You can't write a decent farm bill with $25 \nbillion when the money that is in this year's budget is already \nsubstantially below what we had the last 3 years to assist farmers at \nthis time of economic crisis. We are already, in the funding that is in \nthis budget, 26 percent below what has been provided in each of the \nlast 3 years.\n  These farm organizations, somehow, got sold a bill of goods. I \nsuspect it is from the Secretary of Agriculture, who is calling \ncolleagues, trying to sell them the same bill of goods, telling them: \nDon't worry, the money is going to be available; we have been assured \nby the Office of Management and Budget.\n  Please, don't anybody be misled. The Office of Management and Budget \nhas nothing, zero, to do with writing the next budget resolution. I am \nchairman of the Senate Budget Committee. I can tell you the same amount \nof money is not going to be available next year as is available now. If \nanybody will just do a quick reality check, they will understand that \nwhat I am saying is true.\n  No. 1, on the revenue side, the revenues are going down as a result \nof the economic slowdown and as a result of this sneak attack on the \nUnited States. The economy is weaker. It is generating less revenue, so \nless money will be available on that side of the equation.\n  On the spending side of the equation, the expenditures are going up, \nand up dramatically. There is more money to defend the Nation, more \nmoney for counterterrorism, more money for item after item that is \ncoming to our attention as a result of this vicious attack on our \ncountry on September 11. Just a commonsense approach would tell you \nless money is going to be available next year--perhaps dramatically \nless money.\n  For anybody to suggest that they have an assurance from the \nadministration--or anybody else who is outside of the Congress where \nthese issues are decided--that resources are going to be available, \nthey are not dealing with reality. They are not dealing with reality. \nFor these farm organizations to send a letter to our leadership telling \nthem, oh, don't worry about getting the job done this year with the \nmoney that is available in this budget because they have gotten \nassurance from the administration that the money is going to be \navailable next year--they have\n\n[[Page S10879]]\n\nnot done their homework. They have done an enormous disservice to their \nmembers, in my judgment. And I will say that to them directly when they \ncome to see me about this farm bill. They have done an enormous \ndisservice by telling people money is available, don't worry about it, \nwhen, with absolute assurance, we can see the money is not going to be \navailable in the same amount that is available in this year's budget.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Yes.\n  Mr. DAYTON. If I understand the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee correctly, in this body, the Senate, we have to pass a farm \nbill this year. Then do we also have to have it conferenced and sent to \nthe President in this calendar year as well, in order to protect these \nfunds?\n  Mr. CONRAD. We do. The hard reality is this, in my judgment. In the \nbudget resolution, those funds are available to us until the next \nbudget resolution is passed. But there is another thing that is going \nto happen. In January of next year a new economic assessment is going \nto be made by the Congressional Budget Office, by the Office of \nManagement and Budget, and it is going to show significant \ndeterioration. That is going to change the dynamics very significantly, \nand that is going to make the ability to use this money in this budget \nresolution now to write a new farm bill much less real next year.\n  So nobody should be under any illusions. A lot is at stake for \nagriculture. This is not agriculture somehow separate and distinct from \nthe rest of the economy because we know agriculture plays a key role, \nright at the heart of this economy. We know if agriculture is hurting, \nMain Street businesses are hurting. Certainly that is true in our \nState. Certainly that is true in the State of the distinguished Chair.\n  The irony is, right at the time we are considering writing a stimulus \npackage for the national economy, we are getting advice to forget about \nwriting a strong farm bill this year when we know the money that is \navailable now will not be available next year. That is reality.\n\n  For these farm groups to write to our leadership and say to them, \ndon't worry about it, we have assurances that the resources necessary \nto fund a farm bill that is above the baseline will be there next year, \nthey have completely bought a pig in a poke.\n  I hope the members of these organizations will call their \nassociations and ask them: What are you doing? What kind of advice are \nyou giving down there? It is not advice that is good for the people you \nrepresent. This may be good advice for the administration. This may be \nthe advice the administration wants to give. Why are they signing up \nfor that? Why are they endorsing the administration's position when the \nadministration is taking the position that is totally counter to what \nis good for not only I believe the farmers of America but for the \nnational economy?\n  One of the things the economists have been telling us about the \nstimulus package is that one of the most effective things you can do is \nget money into the agricultural sector because, No. 1, that money gets \nout quickly to the farmers and, No. 2, because there is such economic \nhard times for farmers.\n  We have the lowest farm prices in real terms in 50 years. That makes \nfarmers have a greater dispensation to spend the money that is part of \nthe farm program.\n  Mr. DAYTON. Mr. President, the Senator and I share a common border. I \nknow our farmers are in a similar predicament. These dollars are going \nto be central to the survival of farmers in Minnesota, and I dare say \nin North Dakota as well.\n  It seems to me that somebody is playing a very dangerous game with \nliterally the lives and the livelihoods of a lot of farmers in my home \nState of Minnesota, and I expect others as well. It makes me wonder who \nis looking out for whom here. How could it be there are those who are \nso active in trying to postpone action on a bill with the result being \nthat farmers are going to receive less money. It will take longer one \nway or the other.\n  The bottom line, from what I hear from the Senator from North Dakota \non the Budget Committee, is that they may be out of money entirely if \nwe don't act this calendar year.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I believe these groups have been flimflammed. I do not \nknow a nice way to say it. I don't think they understand how the budget \nprocess works--for them to be realigned on the representation from the \nadministration about money that is going to be available in the next \nbudget resolution. The administration doesn't have any role in writing \nthe next budget resolution. That is written in the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate. The administration has absolutely \nnothing to do with writing the budget resolution. That is what makes \nthe resources available next year. Just a little bit of commonsense \nanalysis would tell you that the same amount of money is not going to \nbe available next year. Receipts are going down. Expenses are going up. \nThat means there will be less money available.\n  When a budget resolution is written next year, there will not be \nanywhere close to this amount of money available for writing a farm \nbill. That puts all of the people who we represent in jeopardy. That \nputs their financial lives on the line.\n  For the farm organizations that are supposed to represent these very \npeople to send up a letter such as this tells me one of two things: No. \n1, either they have been totally hoodwinked about the budget \ncircumstances we face next year, or, No. 2, they aren't thinking very \ncarefully about who they have a responsibility to represent. No. 3, \nperhaps they have just not done their homework and don't know the \ncircumstances that we will be facing.\n\n  Mr. DAYTON. I know the time under the previous order is about to \nexpire. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for sounding this alarm. \nI was not aware of this situation. I thank the Senator for making it \nvery clear to the Members of the Senate and to farmers throughout this \ncountry what is at stake. My hope is that our colleagues will join with \nus in insisting that we have a farm bill passed so we don't leave our \nfarmers back home seriously in the lurch.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from our neighboring State, who is a \nmember of the Senate Agriculture Committee. Already, just in the first \nmonths of his term, he has demonstrated a real commitment to family \nfarmers, and also to an understanding of the budget process. I wish \nthat same understanding had been evidenced by these farm organizations \nthat sent this advice to the leadership that could be so very harmful \nto the very people they seek to represent.\n  I conclude by saying to my colleagues that we need to write the farm \nbill now. We need to use the money that is in the budget resolution \nnow. No one should be under any illusion that this money is going to be \navailable next year. Most assuredly it is not.\n  Let's be crystal clear about what is at stake; that is, the economic \nlives of tens of thousands of farm families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/23/senate-section/article/S10879-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10879-S10899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      FOREIGN OPERATIONS, EXPORT FINANCING, AND RELATED PROGRAMS \n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2002\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the committee \nsubstitute is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the two managers of the bill, Senators Leahy \nand McConnell, are due back any minute. It is my understanding that \nthey are prepared to give their opening statements, and that they have \nat least a dozen amendments that the two managers have already cleared. \nWe have accomplished a great deal on this bill already.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am sorry some of our colleagues have had \nto wait. Both Senator McConnell and I have been down at the White House \nmeeting with the President and other Members on foreign policy issues. \nIt is a day when I have been wearing two hats--going from the Judiciary \nCommittee, and some of the issues we are handling there, to the foreign \npolicy issues. But I am glad we are going to do the foreign operations \nappropriations bill. We tried bringing it up a week ago, but it was \nheld hostage by partisan sniping over judicial nominations. I think \nthat is both unnecessary and unwarranted.\n  I consider it an honor that the desk that I sit in was once held by \nSenator Vandenberg, who coined the phrase that ``politics ends at the \nwater's edge.'' The senior Senator from Kentucky and I have done this \nfor years in writing the foreign aid bill, alternating us chairman and \nranking member of the subcommittee. We work closely together, and I \nhave stated many times how much I respect and admire him for his \nefforts to get a good, balanced foreign aid bill through.\n  There are things on which we can have partisan debates, but we should \nnot allow it on this bill, especially today when our Nation is at war.\n  Mr. LEAHY. This bill is of enormous importance to our country. In \nfact, in the last 15 or 20 years when I have been either chairman or \nranking member of this subcommittee, I don't know if I can think of a \nmore critical time when we needed to quickly pass this bill.\n  Before we start, though, I think it is appropriate to pay tribute to \nKen Ludden, an official at the Treasury Department's Office of the \nAssistant Secretary for International Affairs, and formerly a \ncongressional staff member, who died suddenly of a heart attack on \nSeptember 10. Senator McConnell's staff, Senator Stevens' staff and my \nown staff, knew him well. At an appropriate time, Senator McConnell and \nI will offer an amendment to name this Foreign Operations \nAppropriations Act after him in recognition of his years of government \nservice, and in particular for the invaluable assistance he gave to our \nsubcommittee.\n  Mr. President, in the past, there were times when the foreign \noperations appropriations bill has been the vehicle for divisive and \ntime-consuming amendments on controversial foreign policy issues. But \nwe are in an unusual time. Our country has suffered a grievous loss. \nThis is a time for unity and for getting our work done quickly. I have \namendments, Senator McConnell has amendments, and I am sure other \nSenators have amendments that would be controversial.\n  Senator McConnell and I do not plan to offer our controversial \namendments. This is not the time. We should work together to get this \nbill passed as quickly as possible.\n  Frankly, I was impressed this afternoon, listening to the President \nspeak of his discussions with foreign leaders during the APEC summit in \nShanghai. The President forthrightly told us what he said. I am sure he \ndid so there. It was not carefully drawn out diplomatic language, it \nwas the President's own words, and I commend him for it.\n  I think of the situation today. The President has a limited window of \nopportunity to do a number of things to help counter this long-term \nthreat. Whether the President serves one or\n\n[[Page S10894]]\n\ntwo terms, that threat will continue after he is gone. I am afraid it \nis going to continue long after every one of us is gone, whether one is \nnew in the Senate and just beginning a career, or those who are winding \ndown their careers in the Senate. No matter who one is, we are going to \nface this threat of terrorism for years to come. For the sake of our \nchildren, grandchildren, and generations to come, we have to make sure \nto do the right thing and take the steps that diminish the threat of \nterrorism over the long term.\n  I know the President feels that way. I suspect all 100 Members of the \nSenate feel that way.\n  What does this mean? It means that special forces attacks in \nAfghanistan, brave and effective as they were--and I think they were \nthe right steps to take--are not enough. It goes well beyond the \nmomentary alliances. It will not even end with the capture or the \ndestruction of Osama bin Laden. All of these things are critical. But, \nthere will be others who will rise in the same kind of milieu that \ncreated Osama bin Laden, rise in countries that fear us or hate us or \ncannot believe in the diversity we relish and practice, the democracy \nwe cherish, the same democracy, Mr. President, that you and I and every \nSenator take a solemn oath to uphold.\n  There are people in the world who may fear our Constitution. I have \noften said that the greatest part of our Constitution is probably the \nsame part they fear--the first amendment. It gives us the freedom of \nspeech. We do not all have to say the same thing. We can say what we \nwant in this country. It also allows us to practice whatever religion \nwe want or to choose to practice no religion at all.\n  There is this wall, this Jeffersonian wall, between us. Think what \nthat has allowed. It has allowed each one of us to hold whatever \nbeliefs we want, free of any interference by the Government. It allows \nus to say what we want to say, free of interference from our \nGovernment. Perhaps, most importantly, it guarantees we are going to \nhave diversity in this country. It means Nebraska will have its unique \nnature as will Vermont. It means there will be people in Nebraska who \nthink differently than people in Vermont on some issues and think the \nsame on others. It is this wonderful diversity that helps to guarantee \na vibrant democracy in this country.\n  It is that same diversity and that same attitude that holds \ntotalitarianism to be an anathema to our way of life.\n  It is this tolerance and diversity which frightens some other parts \nof the world. Unfortunately, we can build the most powerful army on \nEarth, and we have, the most powerful air force on Earth, and we have, \nthe most powerful navy on Earth, and we have, and as a proud father of \na young marine, the most amazing and powerful marine corps in \nthe world. But none of that by itself can protect us. To truly have \nsecurity, we must also do the things that help do away with ignorance \nand fear, abhorrence of the United States in parts of the world. And, \nwe must sustain this effort for decades to come.\n\n  One good example of this are the programs to help combat the spread \nof disease in the developing world. Many parts of the world, simply do \nnot possess the health care infrastructure to treat a number of life-\nthreatening conditions that are curable with the proper treatment and \ncare. And as a result far too many do not live beyond the age of 3 or \n4.\n  Think what the United States can do to help eradicate disease, not \nonly help eradicate disease but also to make sure diseases stay away, \nby putting in place the infrastructure so people are there to give the \nshots--polio vaccines, diphtheria shots--and remove river blindness \nonce and for all. We can do that, and we will have a better and \nhealthier populace in doing it, and we can point to this record and \nsay: This is what the United States stands for. We do not speak your \nlanguage, we do not follow your culture or customs, but we want your \nchildren to be healthier. Don't my colleagues think that in the long \nrun this makes everyone better off and minimizes the kind of terrorist \nattacks we face?\n  I would also ask my colleagues to think about the fact that every \ndisease in the world is only an airplane trip away from our shores--or \nmaybe even a postal stamp--away from our shores. Think about the things \nin this bill that will have countries to identify diseases, such as the \nebola plague or some new strain of disease to which we are not \nresistant, to help isolate them, and to help cure them.\n  We have a good bill. It was not an easy task. Senator McConnell has \nbeen an invaluable partner in putting this together.\n  We are trying to do many things. We want to help educate people. We \nwant to improve health care around the world. We want people to see and \nunderstand the best of the United States.\n  At the same time, we are trying to combat these global problems by \nspending less than 1 percent of our budget.\n  It is embarrassingly little for a superpower that is in a position to \nlead the world in solving these critical issues that threaten our \ninterests and the health and safety of every American citizen.\n  As a result, we often find ourselves unable to respond effectively to \nserious threats. That has proven to be true with international \nterrorism, but also when you consider what is needed to spot the spread \nof HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases.\n  It is the case when you consider how little we are spending to \nprotect the environment. We are more than $200 million in arrears in \nour payments to the Global Environment Facility.\n  The amount in this bill for family planning, although $25 million \nabove the Administrations request, is $89 million less than we provided \nin 1995. Yet hundreds of millions of impoverished people who want safe, \nvoluntary family planning services are not able to get them. For those \nwho have concerns about the numbers of abortions worldwide, think of \nthe number of abortions that could be prevented if we had had adequate \nfamily planning, voluntary family planning services, in place.\n  We ought to do a lot more to support the development of free markets \nand to strengthen democratic institutions, from central Asia to \nMacedonia to Latin America.\n  There are major humanitarian disasters today in many regions of the \nworld. We are hearing a lot about the looming catastrophe in \nAfghanistan, but similar tragedies exist in the Congo and Sudan, and \ndrought and earthquakes have devastated parts of Central America.\n  We are by far the richest country in the world--the richest country \nhistory has ever known--but on a per capita basis we often spend less \nthan other industrialized countries to help people whose lives are \nhanging by a thread. This bill attempts to respond, within our limited \nallocation, to these and other problems.\n  I very much appreciate the support we have received from Chairman \nByrd and Senator Stevens. They have the unenviable task of dividing up \na shrinking pie for 13 appropriations subcommittees.\n  The bill contains $15.5 billion in discretionary budget authority. \nAlthough our 302(b) allocation was higher than the House's allocations, \nthe House cut deeply into many of the President's requests for \nessential programs--programs which are also Strongly Supported by \nSenators. The Senate bill has restored many of those cuts.\n  We restore sufficient funding for the Export-Import Bank to support \nsubsidy financing well above the fiscal year 2000 level. We restore \nfull funding for the foreign military financing program and provide a \n$10 million increase above the President's request for international \nmilitary training.\n  We restore most of the House cuts in the Economic Support Fund, as \nwell as assistance for the former Soviet Republics.\n  We provide additional funding for international peacekeeping and for \nassistance for the former Yugoslavia, including Serbia, Montenegro, and \nMacedonia.\n  We include $450 million to combat HIV/AIDS, including $50 million for \nthe Global Fund to combat AIDS, TB, and malaria. This falls well short \nof what we should be spending, it is an increase above last year's \nlevel.\n  We also increase funding against other infectious diseases and for \nchildren's health programs, and I would note that both Republican and \nDemocratic Senators have requested this.\n  These programs are desperately needed to strengthen the capacity of \ndeveloping countries to conduct surveillance\n\n[[Page S10895]]\n\nand respond to diseases such as polio and measles. They are also \nequally important for combating the spread of biological agents such as \nanthrax used in acts of terrorism. There are tens of millions of \ndollars for those programs in this bill.\n  We provide $718 million for the Andean countries, primarily Colombia, \nBolivia, Ecuador, and Peru, of which over half a billion dollars is for \ncounterdrug programs. That is in addition to the $1.3 billion for Plan \nColombia we appropriated last year. It is interesting, that about--who \nmade requests to our subcommittee--even mentioned the Andean program, \nitems which has not accomplished a great deal.\n  The bill contains the usual earmarks for Middle East countries. It \nalso continues various limitations or conditions on assistance to \nseveral countries.\n  Senator McConnell and I have a number of amendments, including one to \nname this bill after Ken Ludden, and another to prohibit U.S. \nassistance to governments that harbor or provide financing for \nindividuals involved in the September 11 terrorist attacks.\n  We have a bill that that was reported in record time by the \nappropriations committee. And while I will now reveal a political \nsecret that has probably gone unnoticed in this body, Senator McConnell \nand I are not politically ideological soulmates. We have kept this well \nhidden, but it is a fact. Only because it is late in the evening and \nthe Chamber is nearly empty do I dare whisper that. I would not want \nanybody to know that outside of this Chamber.\n  This political odd couple has worked together to bring before this \nSenate a bill, within the amount of money we had, that I think is well \nbalanced. It is not precisely the bill Senator McConnell would have \nwritten by himself, nor that I would have written, but I am proud to \njoin with Senator McConnell in support of this bill. I appreciate his \nfriendship in working with him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Carnahan). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I am indeed shocked to hear that \nSenator Leahy does not make a practice of watching how I vote every \ntime so he may be so guided.\n  In fact, we have had a good relationship over the years and seen many \nof these issues in like manner, and I commend him for his leadership as \nchairman of the subcommittee. This is a bill that I can \nenthusiastically support, and we anticipate it to pass by a large vote \nsometime tomorrow.\n  I thank my good friend from Vermont for his leadership, as I said, in \ncrafting this $15.5 billion bill. This is, I think, probably our ninth \nbill together. When we started out, he was chairman and I was ranking \nmember. Then I was chairman for a while and he was ranking member. Now \nthe roles are reversed again. We have throughout, no matter who was in \nthe majority, been able to move in the right direction.\n  Obviously the world has changed since we marked up this bill on July \n26. The horror and grief of the September 11 attacks in New York, \nVirginia, and Pennsylvania are still very fresh in our hearts and \nminds. The recent anthrax mailings to Congress and the media are \nfurther indications of the diabolical nature of America's enemies. Our \nthoughts and prayers are with the many victims of these evil deeds.\n  The President and the administration have done a superb job in \nresponding to this national crisis, both at home and abroad. In the \ndarkest hours of the 21st century the American people have rallied in \nsupport of the new war against terrorism. This speaks to the strength \nof our Nation and the highest principles upon which it was founded.\n  Within 3 days of the September 11 attacks, the Senate passed a $40 \nbillion emergency supplemental bill to aid in recovery and \nreconstruction efforts. I am pleased that a portion of those funds will \nbe used to bolster counterterrorism and other security programs \nconducted by the State Department.\n  In addition to the funds contained in the supplemental, the bill now \nbefore the Senate fully funds the President's $38 million request for \nthe State Department's antiterrorism assistance program. These funds \nwill be used to provide training, equipment, and advice to foreign \ncountries to enhance their antiterrorism skills and to increase the \ncapabilities of foreign law enforcement and security officials. Those \nprograms are critical to America's national security and those of our \nallies.\n  My colleagues should be aware that Senator Leahy and I intend to \noffer an amendment to prohibit assistance to any country that harbors \nor finances those individuals or organizations responsible for the mass \nmurder of American citizens on September 11. President Bush and \nSecretary Powell are right to hold those nations who aid and abet \nterrorism responsible for their actions. They have my full cooperation \nand support in this endeavor.\n  Let me offer concrete evidence of that support. Senator Feinstein and \nI intended to offer an amendment to this bill requiring the President \nto report on the Palestinian Liberation Organization's compliance with \nits commitments to renounce terrorism and violence. We were asked by \nSecretary Powell, in light of his efforts to forge an international \ncoalition against terrorism, to simply not offer that amendment. We \nagreed to withhold the amendment out of respect for this Nation's \ndesire and demand for justice for the September 11 murders. The \nadministration's request for our foreign policy priorities and needs \nare, for the most part, met through this bill.\n  In some accounts, including IMET and the Child Survival and Disease \nPrograms Fund, the President's request was exceeded. The bill increases \nthe Export Import Bank's subsidy appropriations from the requested \namount of $633 million to $753 million, and we provide $450 million for \nHIV/AIDS programs and activities.\n  My colleagues will note that while we have provided substantial \nfunding for counterdrug efforts in the Andean Region, the bill does not \nmeet the Administration's $731 million request for the Andean \nCounterdrug Initiative. Not everyone may agree with the $567 million \nthe bill provides for this program. However, funds are still in the \npipeline for social, economic, and judicial programs in Colombia. \nSpillover of the narcotics trade to neighboring countries remains a \nconcern. Successful counterdrug and alternative development programs in \ncountries such as Bolivia must be continued.\n  Funding is also provided to continue vital democracy building \nactivities in Asia, including Burma, Indonesia, and East Timor. The \nbill earmarks $10 million for rule of law programs in China, which are \nbeing successfully conducted by a variety of American academic and \nnongovernmental institutions. I would suggest to my colleagues that \nadvancing democracy and the rule of law abroad is essential in the \nfight against terrorism.\n  I want to share with my colleagues an observation on U.S. foreign \npolicy in the wake of the terrible attacks earlier this month. The very \nnature of our foreign assistance programs and priorities will change as \nAmerica and its allies wage war against the foes of freedom and \ndemocracy. As one who believes that foreign aid is not an entitlement, \nassistance can--and should--be used as leverage to reward cooperation \non common objectives, such as identifying and destroying terrorist \nnetworks. Conversely, nations that refuse to join the fight against \nterrorism should face restrictions on U.S. assistance they receive. As \nPresident Bush said, ``Every nation in every region now has a decision \nto make: Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.''\n  Finally, I want to express my condolences to the family of Ken \nLudden, Legislative Coordinator to the Office of the Assistant \nSecretary for International Affairs who passed away of a heart attack \non September 10. Ken will be sorely missed by this subcommittee. Given \nhis long and dedicated service to our country in many capacities, I \nhave joined Senator Leahy in sponsoring an amendment to designate the \nbill the ``Kenneth M. Ludden Foreign Operations, Export, Financing, and \nRelated Programs Appropriations Act.''\n  Again, I thank Senator Leahy, and his capable staff--Tim Rieser and \nMark Lippert--for their leadership on this bill.\n  Senator Leahy and I are open for business and fully intend to finish \nthis bill at the earliest possible time tomorrow.\n\n[[Page S10896]]\n\n  I see the chairman is on his feet, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we have a number of things we can \nprobably do in a couple of minutes to go through here.\n  I would like to note that there is some promising news from Ireland. \nThe International Independent Commission on Decommissioning, led by GEN \nJohn de Chastelain, of Canada, has announced that the IRA has begun to \ndecommission its weapons. The Irish Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, has \nappropriately called this an ``unparalleled breakthrough.'' David \nTrimble, with whom I talked here in Washington a few days ago, has said \nhe will recommend to the Ulster Unionist Council that the party reenter \nthe Northern Ireland Executive.\n  I commend Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness from Sinn Fein for their \nefforts to take this important step. I have been one who has been \ncritical of the IRA taking so long to begin to decommission its \nweapons.\n  There are justifiable and long-held grievances on both the Protestant \nand Catholic sides in Northern Ireland, and there are generations who \nwill never completely forgive or forget. But for the sake of the \nchildren in Ireland, both in the Republic of Ireland and Northern \nIreland, they must move forward, and this is a critical step. Peace \nwill not be won by assassinations or guns and bullets, whether done by \nProtestants or by Catholics. Peace will only come about if children are \nallowed to grow up in peace so we will not have scenes such as we saw \njust in the opening of school this year of little children, 7- and 8-\nyear-old girls and boys, running terrified past a mob, screaming at \nthem because all they wanted to do was go to school. That cannot \ncontinue.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a number of news items be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\n                 [From the Irish Times, Oct. 23, 2001]\n\n         De Chastelain Says IRA Has Begun Decommissioning Arms\n\n                           (By Patrick Logue)\n\n       The International Independent Commission on \n     Decommissioning, led by General John de Chastelain, has said \n     it has witnessed the IRA begin to decommission its arsenal of \n     weapons, including guns, ammunition and explosives.\n       ``We are satisfied the arms in question have been dealt \n     with in accordance with the scheme and regulations. We are \n     also satisfied it would not further the process of putting \n     all arms beyond use were we to provide further details of \n     this event.''\n       ``We will continue our contact with the IRA representative \n     in the pursuit of our mandate.'' This afternoon the IRA said \n     in a statement that it had begun the process.\n       In a statement the IRA said its motivation behind the move \n     on weapons was ``to save the peace process''.\n       * * * says: ``The political process is now on the point of \n     collapse. Such a collapse would certainly, and eventually, \n     put the overall peace process in jeopardy.\n       ``There is a responsibility upon everyone seriously \n     committed to a just peace to do our best to avoid this.\n       ``Therefore, in order to save the peace process, we have \n     implemented the scheme agreed with the IICD in August.\n       ``Our motivation is clear. This unprecedented move is to \n     save the peace process and to persuade others of our genuine \n     intentions''.\n       In August the IICD said in a statement it had agreed a \n     method for putting arms ``completely and verifiably beyond \n     use''. Details of the method were not made public however.\n       The move comes in response to a call yesterday by the Sinn \n     Fein president Mr. Gerry Adams for a ``ground-breaking'' \n     gesture to save the peace process.\n       Speaking in West Belfast last night Mr. Adams said: ``We \n     have put to the IRA the view that if it could make a ground-\n     breaking move on the arms issue that this could save the \n     peace process from collapse and transform the situation''.\n       Sinn Fein this evening welcomed the IRA statement saying it \n     was a courageous initiative to save the peace process''.\n\n\n                        ira's estimated arsenal\n\n       650 AK47/AKM assault rifles;\n       36 Armalite AR-15 assault rifles;\n       2 Barret M82A1 sniper rifles;\n       60 Webley .455 revolvers;\n       20 12.7 107mm DshK heavy machine guns;\n       12 7.62mm FN MAG machine guns;\n       6 LPO-50 flamethrowers;\n       1 SAM-7 surface-to-air missile;\n       600 bomb detonators;\n       3 tons of Semtex plastic explosives\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Irish Times, Oct. 23, 2001]\n\n                Trimble Hints UUP Will Reenter Executive\n\n                           (By Kilian Doyle)\n\n       The leader of the Ulster Unionists Mr. David Trimble said \n     tonight he would recommend to his party that they reenter the \n     Northern Ireland executive following IRA weapons \n     decommissioning.\n       Mr. Trimble was speaking after a meeting with the head of \n     international decommissioning body, General John de \n     Chastelain, where he said he was told the IRA had begun to \n     put its arms beyond use.\n       ``This is the day we were told would never happen'', he \n     said. Mr. Trimble said he would attend of meeting of the \n     Ulster Unionists Council later this week, and he would be \n     recommending that they re-enter the Northern Ireland \n     Executive.\n       UUP ministers could be back in their offices in Stormont as \n     early as next week, Mr. Trimble said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 [From the Irish Times, Oct. 23, 2001]\n\n                Ahern Hails `Unparalleled Breakthrough'\n\n                           (By Kilian Doyle)\n\n       The Taoiseach, Mr. Bertie Ahern, said the IRA statement was \n     an ``unparalleled breakthrough'' that was of ``profound \n     importance'' to the peace process.\n       He said the IRA had now done enough to satisfy General de \n     Chastelain, but there was still an ``enormous'' amount of \n     work remaining to be done.\n       Mr. Ahern paid tribute to the leaders of the IRA, who he \n     said had made a brave and difficult decision in agreeing to \n     decommission.\n       The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Brian Cowen, said the \n     statements from the IRA and the International Commission on \n     decommissioning heralded a new era in the history of Ireland.\n       ``That is a moment for political leaders to be responsive \n     and generous. The reaction to decommissioning will be as \n     important as decommissioning itself,'' he said.\n       ``It is imperative that politics is made to work and that \n     the nightmarish scenes like those from north Belfast are \n     consigned forever to the pages of history.''\n       ``We must harness the new energy that has been released by \n     today's developments and begin a new, dynamic era on this \n     island at all levels, based on partnership, equality and \n     mutual respect.\n       ``We simply cannot afford to let this opportunity slip.''\n       Mr. Michael Noonan, the leader of Fine Gael, said he \n     believed decommissioning had ``already occurred'' and that \n     General de Chastelain would be confirming that ``before too \n     long''.\n       ``What we had was the Good Friday Agreement, there is an \n     opportunity now to make it the Good Friday Settlement.\n       ``Now that [decommissioning] has happened, it seems to me \n     that there is no difference in principal between putting some \n     arms beyond use and putting all arms beyond use.''\n       Mr. Ruairi Quinn, the leader of the Labour Party, said we \n     are now witnessing events of ``historic proportions.''\n       He said all parties must now intensify efforts to overcome \n     the ``distrust and sectarianism that has bedevilled Northern \n     Ireland for so long.''\n       There is a particular obligation on the loyalist \n     paramilitaries to honour the statements made that they would \n     follow suit if the IRA started decommissioning.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Is there further debate on the amendments?\n  Without objection, the amendments are agreed to.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1909 through 1920) were agreed to, en bloc.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                     HONORING KENNETH MARTIN LUDDEN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, each year, many people assist in the \ncreation of the Foreign Operations bill. Besides the efforts of our \nstaffs, hundreds of individuals from the Federal Government provide \ninformation and expertise on the Administration's funding requests. \nUnfortunately, on September 10, we lost one of the people who played a \nvery important part of the creation of this bill for a number of years, \nKen Ludden. Ken worked at the Department of Treasury as their \nLegislative Coordinator to the Office of the Assistant Secretary for \nInternational Affairs. Ken was a very capable and attentive liaison. \nNot only did he go the extra mile in trying to answer any questions we \nhad, but he was so good at his job that he would know which member \nmight be more concerned about one issue and provide information before \nstaff would request it.\n  This was not Ken's first position in Government, in fact he dedicated \nmost of his life to public service. He worked for Congressman Edwin \nForsythe, at the United States Agency for International Development, \nfor Senator Lugar on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the \nDepartment of State and then Treasury. In between his time at the \nDepartments of State and Treasury, Ken did spend some time in the \nprivate sector but then returned to public service to work as a \ncongressional liaison. He seemed to genuinely enjoy working with the \nHill. Like many former staff, Ken never forgot his Hill roots. he \nunderstood the needs of staff and members and the demands and \nexpectations we face from our constituents. Ken also even made bad news \neasy to take--he would not stall or press an unworkable position but \nwould work until common ground could be found between the Department \nand Congress.\n  In light of his dedicated service to the Committee, Senator Leahy and \nI have offered an amendment in the manager's package that would \ndesignate the fiscal year 2002 foreign operations bill as the ``Kenneth \nM. Ludden Foreign Operations, Export Financing and Related Programs \nAppropriations Act, for Fiscal year 2002.'' This is just a small \ngesture to acknowledge our appreciation for a life time of service to \nthe American people. On behalf of the Senate, Senator Leahy and I offer \nour deepest condolences to his wife, Mary, and their daughters, and his \ncolleagues at the Department. We will miss him.\n\n\n                       THE WHEELCHAIR FOUNDATION\n\n  Mr. STEVENS. Madam President, I rise today to express my appreciation \nto the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, for his assistance in the \ncoming fiscal year to an exceptional organization--the Wheelchair \nFoundation. Since its launch in June 2000, the Wheelchair Foundation \nhas delivered over 26,000 wheelchairs to individuals in 74 countries \nand throughout the United States. The World Health Organization \nestimates that some 25 million people around the world are unable to \nwalk due to one cause or another. Various country officials and non-\ngovernment officials in different countries around the world put the \nnumber at over 100 million.\n  To date, the foundation has been financed by private donations from \nthe Kenneth E. Behring Foundation, private individuals, corporations, \nathletic teams and various non-profit organizations. Additionally, \npartnerships exist with the International Red Cross, Project Hope, \nGoodwill Global, Rotary International, Ronald McDonald House Charities, \nand Operations USA, among others. However, the Wheelchair Foundation \nhas decided to intensify its efforts by launching a goal of delivering \n1,000,000 wheelchairs to those in need in the next five years. In order \nto take its efforts to this next level, the foundation is seeking a \npublic/private partnership with the Federal Government.\n\n[[Page S10898]]\n\n  My staff has been working with the Secretary's office to try and \ncreate a workable partnership. One of the Federal programs we believe \nthe Wheelchair Foundation can work with is the Denton Program. The \nDenton Program allows the Department of Defense, through a memorandum \nof understanding with the U.S. Agency for International Development to \nprovide space available transportation of humanitarian cargo at little \nor no cost to the donor. The donor must ensure that (1) there is a \nlegitimate need for the supplies by the people for whom they are \nintended; (2) that the supplies will in fact be used for humanitarian \npurposes; and (3) that the beneficiaries are capable of using the \ndonated commodities safely. I think I can safely say that each of these \nrequirements can be easily met by the Wheelchair Foundation. We have \nhad notification from Secretary Powell's office that he agrees with \nthese sentiments.\n  We have also been notified, that, assuming that we provide the \nadequate resources in the foreign operations bill, the Secretary will \nsupport providing funding to assist the program. The Wheelchair \nFoundation estimates that it will cost $150,000,000 to provide the \n1,000,000 chairs. This approximately $150 per chair. Combined with the \nDenton Program support, any additional financial assistance that the \nDepartment of State provides would be greatly appreciated.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Stevens, would you pause for a question? This \nprogram sounds like it has been very successful--but now requires some \nof the Federal Government's global contacts to make that extra step--is \nthat correct?\n  Mr. STEVENS. Senator McConnell you are exactly right. The efforts by \nthe foundation will not only utilize the vast resources of the private \nsector--but combine that with the experience and knowledge of the \nDepartment of State and the United States Agency for International \nDevelopment. State and USAID each have personnel around the globe who \nare aware of the need for these chairs--from Central America to the \nnations of Africa to the Balkans to South East Asia. We are confident \nthat these U.S. personnel can utilize their contacts in each of these \ncommunities to bring relief to those in need--and in five years--to \nreach one million people.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Senator, one more question please? Is there any limitation \non who may receive these chairs? Are they designated for one group in \nparticular?\n  Mr. STEVENS. No--one must only show a need--from innocent victims of \nlandmines to those with muscular dystrophy--the Wheelchair Foundation \nhas a single mission of bringing mobility and independence to those who \ncannot walk.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Senator Leahy, it is clear that Senator Stevens has \ncome to us on behalf of an organization worthy of receiving U.S. \nsupport and I look forward to hearing of the accomplishments they make \nin the coming year.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Senator, I concur with your assessment and hope that the \nfoundation reaches its goals for the coming year.\n  Mr. STEVENS. Thank you both for your support and, again, for the \nsupport of the Secretary. I look forward to working with you all to \nensure that this project is a success.\n\n\n       TREATMENT FOR PRIMARY IMMUNODEFICIENCIES IN LATIN AMERICA\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Madam President: I would like to begin by commending my \nfriend from Vermont, Senator Leahy, for his tremendous work in putting \nthis foreign operations appropriations bill together. I also want to \napplaud the efforts of USAID for its support of child health programs \nover the last 25 years, and, particularly, for intensifying its efforts \nin 1985 with the child survival initiative. Today more than 4 million \ninfant and child deaths are prevented annually due to the critical \nlife-saving health services provided by USAID and its partners.\n  It has been estimated that in Central and South America over one \nmillion children are afflicted with primary immunodeficiency. \nIndividuals with undiagnosed primary immunodeficiency are a source of \nviral and bacterial infection. When left undiagnosed and unprotected \nthis population harbors serious viruses, bacteria, fungi and deep-\nseated infections. I am aware that an immunology infrastructure is in \nplace in several Central and South American countries to conduct early \ndiagnosis and treatment. However, funds are needed to further enhance \nand develop appropriate treatment. The Jeffrey Modell Foundation has \ndeveloped a successful model for combating primary immuno-deficiencies \nin the United States and around the world. I am hopeful that USAID, in \ncollaboration with the foundation, will consider this model in Latin \nAmerica. The components of this program would include physician \neducation and public awareness, prevention, diagnosis and treatment.\n  I would be grateful if the chairman would join me in urging USAID to \nconsider supporting the establishment of such programs in Latin \nAmerica.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I want to thank my good friend from New York for bringing \nthis to the Senate's attention. She has been a strong supporter of \nUSAID's programs to improve the health of women and children in poor \ncountries, and I applaud her for that. I look forward to having the \nbenefit of her expertise on these issues, and will certainly encourage \nUSAID to consider supporting the initiative she speaks of to combat \nprimary immunodeficiencies in Latin America.\n\n\n           cambodia's ministry of women and veteran's affairs\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. The amendment I am offering will allow U.S. assistance \nto support programs and activities conducted by Cambodia's Ministry of \nWomen and Veteran's Affairs, and local and international \nnongovernmental organizations to counter human trafficking in the \nKingdom of Cambodia. The State Department's ``Trafficking in persons \nReport'' dated July 2001 designates Cambodia as a source, destination, \nand transit country for trafficked persons. I offer this amendment with \nthe full understanding that the climate of impunity in Cambodia today \nhas allowed the trafficking of persons--and other illicit activities--\nto flourish. However, the Ministry of Women and Veteran's Affairs has \ndemonstrated the political will to address this problem in a meaningful \nway--and to coordinate its work with the NGO community--and I encourage \nthe State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development \nto support the Ministry's efforts. I yield to my friend from Kentucky \nfor a question.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. My colleague has given serious thought to this \namendment, and I commend him for his approach in selectively engaging \nthe Cambodian government on issues of importance to the Cambodian \npeople and the region. As a point of clarification does the Senator \nintend his amendment to allow the provision of U.S. assistance to any \nother segment of the Cambodian government, with the exception of the \nMinistry of Women and Veteran's Affairs for the sole purpose of \ncombating human trafficking?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. No. This amendment would permit U.S. assistance only \nto that Ministry for the sole purpose you mention. It is not my \nintention to subvert Section 560 of the FY 2002 Foreign Operations \nAppropriations bill. I seek only to support the reform efforts of the \nMinistry. It is a tragedy and horror that Cambodians can be abducted \nand sold into some form of slavery for as little as $30. One survey \nfound that 68 percent of sex workers in Cambodia had been forced into \nprostitution by outright sale by parents or boyfriends or by being \nlured into brothels with promises of a good job. I thank Senator \nMcConnell and Senator Leahy for their interests in helping Cambodia's \nwomen and children.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Kansas for that \nclarification. I also want to note that the democratic opposition in \nCambodia fully supports this amendment, and I ask that a letter from \nCambodian Member of Parliament Sam Rainsy be inserted in the record \nfollowing my remarks. I ask that I be added as a cosponsor to this \namendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. This is an important amendment that will enable the United \nStates to support efforts by Cambodia's Ministry of Women and Veteran's \nAffairs to combat human trafficking, which as Senator Brownback has \nnoted is a terrible problem in that country. I commend him for his \ncommitment to address this problem and ask that I be added as a \ncosponsor as well.\n  Madam President, if the distinguished Senator from Kentucky and I\n\n[[Page S10899]]\n\nwere to have our way about it, we would go to final passage, but I have \na feeling there are probably some who may not be in favor of that.\n  I don't have anything else.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/23/senate-section/article/S10899-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Madam President, I come to the Senate floor today to \nshare with my colleagues a speech that former President Clinton gave \nearlier this month to the Greater Washington Society of Association \nExecutives. It is an excellent speech that underscores a point many of \nus have made right here on this floor: the terrorists will not win, \nbecause we will not allow them to win.\n  If the terrorists thought they would succeed in dividing us, they \nneed only read this strong endorsement of President Bush by President \nClinton.\n  If the terrorists thought they could use terror to force us to \nwithdraw from the world, they need only read this blueprint for greater \nU.S. engagement across the globe.\n  And, if the terrorists thought that they would get us to succumb to \nfear, they need only read this testament to the bravery shown by \nthousands of Americans since September 11.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that President Clinton's \nOctober 9, 2001 speech be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nFormer President Clinton's Remarks at the Greater Washington Society of \n                         Association Executives\n\n       Thank you.\n       I never imagined that I could draw a crowd like this just \n     because my wife is a senator. Well, Helen, you'll have a lot \n     of mentions in the index. When I was told Helen Thomas was \n     going to introduce me, I said, ``God, I hope she's doesn't \n     get to ask a question.'' I thought her questions to me were \n     term-limited. You know when Helen left the UPI, some \n     reporters wrote that she had given up her front row seat at \n     the White House press conferences. But it turned out not to \n     be so. In a town where power is supposed to be vested in the \n     office and not the individual, she is the exception to the \n     rule: The only person powerful enough to quit her job and \n     still keep her seat, and I am profoundly honored to be with \n     her tonight. America is a better place today because of the \n     50-plus years she has given to the noble work of journalism.\n       Tonight, as we ask God's blessings on our men and women in \n     uniform and their allies on their mission and pray that they \n     return home safely, I thank the Greater Washington Society of \n     Association Executives for going forward with this event, \n     consistent with President Bush's request to us to go on with \n     normal life in America.\n       Of course, it is not quite normal, and having been \n     president and having been used to being second-guessed a bit, \n     I want to make sure that anything I say here tonight about \n     where we are and where we're going will be understood in the \n     context of my complete support as an American for our \n     president, his national security team and our allies in our \n     efforts to deal with the challenges of terrorism.\n       Now, this bipartisan thing's getting down-right amazing. \n     Last week Bob Dole and I taped a public service announcement. \n     To--he did make sure I sat on the left and he sat on the \n     right. To make America aware of the Families of Freedom \n     Scholarship Fund which has been established to raise $100 \n     million for the children and spouses of those killed or \n     disabled on September the 11th, including people from other \n     nations. These people are going to make a big contribution to \n     our national life in the years ahead if we make sure that we \n     don't forget them, even in three, five, 10, 15 years. An \n     amazing number of the men who died left wives who were \n     pregnant. And this endeavor will therefore carry forward at \n     least 21 years.\n       I thank the Greater Washington Society of Association \n     Executives for assisting with a very special fund-raising \n     event on October the 23rd from 5 to 7 at the Washington \n     Hilton where President Gorbachev will be talking about the \n     world after September the 11th. Attendance there will be \n     free, but those attending are asked to bring a check payable \n     to the Families of Freedom Scholarship Fund.\n       Thank you very much for supporting this effort.\n       Since September the 11th, I have spent a lot of time in New \n     York with rescue and recovery workers, with survivors, with \n     the families of the victims, with schoolchildren and their \n     teachers, with people working to help people find answers and \n     help people deal with their problems.\n       Today I attended the funeral of New York Fire Department \n     Captain Fred Ill, a man who used to support my trips to New \n     York as president. He was one of 10 firemen lost in one small \n     firehouse in Midtown Manhattan and a remarkable man, who \n     leaves a beautiful wife and three children, including a 22-\n     year-old son who is New York fireman. The fire department, \n     you know, is like a Medieval army. The generals lead the \n     charge. They don't sit on a hill and direct. So after this \n     terrible incident, we lost our fire chief and his top three \n     deputies. We lost the Catholic chaplain who was a friend of \n     Hillary's and mine. Over 300 firemen died and it required the \n     New York Fire Department to promote over 200 of its firemen \n     to fill the ranks of their superiors who went in first. But \n     because they did, thousands and thousands of others who would \n     have died did not.\n       After one person in the temple of our home town of \n     Chappaqua perished, Hillary and I were invited to come to \n     Rosh Hashanah service there. And I happened to meet one of \n     those two amazing men who was on the 84th floor of the \n     World Trade Center Tower, which was hit on the 85th floor. \n     He immediately told everybody to get in the stairs and go \n     down and then, with another man, carried a women in a \n     wheelchair 84 floors to safety.\n       I have been to the crisis center, first at the old armory \n     on 26th and Lex and now at Pier 94, three times. There a man \n     came to me and said President Clinton, ``I'm glad to see you \n     again. I first met you in Oklahoma City.'' And I said, ``How \n     did we come to meet?'' He said, ``You came to console me. My \n     wife was in the building and I lost her.'' And he said, ``The \n     minute this happened, I took a leave of absence, got in my \n     car and drove to New York because I had no one to talk to who \n     knew what I was going through. And I thought maybe I could be \n     there for these people.'' So he said, ``I just come in and \n     sit here all day and the people who are working with the \n     victims bring them to see me.''\n       I've met a lot of victims' families from all over the world \n     and every conceivable group here in America. I met the \n     British and the Germans and the Italians, the Chinese, the \n     Japanese, the Indians, the Pakistanis, the Bangladeshis. I've \n     met people from several African countries, from Mexico, \n     Brazil, the Caribbean and elsewhere.\n       I've been in three schools, and two of them had double \n     student bodies because the schools took in grade school kids \n     in one case and high school kids in another who were blown \n     out of their schools on September the 11th. One of these \n     schools has a principal whose sister was killed at the World \n     Trade Center. And she knew immediately that her sister might \n     have been lost, but after her school was vacated, she walked \n     five miles to the central office of the New York City school \n     system to tell them that her children and teachers were well, \n     and that as soon as they found them a building, they would \n     conduct school again.\n       I have also had the great good fortune in the last few days \n     of talking to people like you in Chicago, Los Angeles, El \n     Paso, Little Rock and New Haven. And there are so many \n     questions people have. You probably do too.\n       In the schools, the children want to know, the 9- and 10-\n     year-olds, why do they hate us so much? How did bin Laden get \n     all of these people to commit suicide anyway? If we hit them, \n     won't they retaliate? The kind of things that you can't \n     imagine a 9- or 10-year- old should ever have to think about. \n     And I do my best to give them honest answers.\n       The men I talked with often speak with awe and admiration \n     of what happened on the plane that went down in Pennsylvania. \n     We ask each other whether we would have had the guts to take \n     it down too.\n       When my oldest friend in the world, Mack McClarty called me \n     and asked me how I was doing, and I asked him how he was \n     doing and whether we would have had the guts to take the \n     plane down if we had been on it, he said, ``I think so and I \n     sure hope so.''\n       The mothers I talked to--and an astonishing number of women \n     that Hillary and I know who are mothers of young children, \n     have called me. They just, almost uniformly say, ``Bill, is \n     it going to be all right? Tell me it's going to be all \n     right.''\n       Tonight I'd like to sort through those questions with you, \n     and I'd like to make these points.\n       First of all, though neither I nor anyone can tell you \n     there will not be another terrorist attack on American soil, \n     it will be all right, if we unite behind the president and \n     our allies to fight terror now, if we spread the benefits and \n     shrink the burdens of the 21st century all across the globe, \n     if we bring freedom today to people who don't have it, and if \n     we continue our efforts to become the people we ought to be, \n     the polar opposite of what the terrorists represent.\n       We saw that in the sacrifices of the men and women of the \n     police and fire departments in New York. The terrorists died \n     to kill people, and they died to save them.\n       Make no mistake about it, this conflict represents a \n     fundamental struggle that will go on for the next few years \n     to define the\n\n[[Page S10900]]\n\n     soul of the 21st-century world. Mr. bin Laden, the Taliban \n     have one set of answers. America and all the people who have \n     rallied to our side, we have another.\n       Here's how, at least I think about this question. Try to \n     imagine yourself on September the 10th. If I had asked you on \n     September the 10th, ``What do you believe is the dominant \n     factor of the 21st-century world?'' what would you have \n     answered?\n       If you're an optimist, you might have said, ``The \n     globalization of the economy.'' After all, its lifted more \n     people out of poverty in the last 20 years than have ever \n     been lifted out in all of human history; brought America 22.5 \n     million jobs, the lowest unemployment in 30 years; and \n     brought benefits to people around the world.\n       If you're into technology, you might say, ``No, no, it was \n     the explosion of information technology.'' Think about this, \n     when I became president in January of 1993, there were only \n     50 sites on the World Wide Web--50.\n       Unbelievable. It was still the private province of research \n     physicists. When I left office in January of 2001, there were \n     350 million. Today, 30 times as much--as many messages are \n     sent by e-mail as by the postal service or what the kids call \n     snail mail.\n       If you're interested in politics and society, you might \n     say, ``No, it's the explosion of democracy and diversity \n     within democracies.''\n       I was honored to be president when, for the first time in \n     all of human history, more people lived under governments of \n     their own choosing than every before. And America became \n     wildly more diverse. And I might add, much more interesting \n     as a consequence of it.\n       The children I saw in Lower Manhattan who were blown out of \n     their schools, represented at least 80 different ethnic \n     groups and many, many different religions.\n       Or you might say, ``No, it is the advances in science that \n     will shape the early 21st century.'' We're going to find out \n     what's in the black holes outer space. We're still finding \n     new forms of life at the deepest points of our rivers and \n     oceans.\n       The sequencing of the human genome, which was announced a \n     couple of years ago, is going to enable us to give genetic \n     profiles of young babies to mothers when they bring them home \n     from the hospital. And really quite soon, countries with good \n     health systems will be seeing babies born with life \n     expectancies in excess of 90 years.\n       Scientists are working on digital chips to replicate the \n     incredibly sophisticated nerve movements in the spines, \n     raising the specter that we might be able to implant a chip \n     at the base of the spine that will work like a heart \n     pacemaker and enable people with damaged spines confined to \n     wheelchairs to stand up and walk.\n       So you might say that will be the dominant thing in this \n     new century.\n       On the other hand, if you're not much of an optimist, or if \n     you're what Hillary refers to as the designated worrier in \n     your family, you might mention negative things that you think \n     are the dominant forces of the 21st century.\n       You might have said that environmental challenges will \n     dominate the next 50 years and if not addressed they will \n     swamp all these positive developments. Climate change, the \n     water shortage, the deterioration of the oceans, nine of the \n     hottest 11 years recorded since 1400 occurred in the last \n     decade or so. If the Earth warms for the next 50 years at \n     the rate of the last 10, we'll lose 50 feet of Manhattan \n     island, the Florida Everglades I worked so hard to save, \n     the sugar cane fields in Louisiana, several Pacific island \n     nations, we will totally disrupt agricultural patterns all \n     across the world and create tens of millions of food \n     refugees meaning more fighting and more terrorism.\n       We have a terrible water shortage in the world. One in four \n     people here today never get a clean glass of water. It also \n     threatens agricultural production and the stability of life \n     on the planet.\n       And, of course, the oceans provide most of our oxygen. \n     There is now a dead space in the Gulf of New Mexico the size \n     of New Jersey. And many people believe the deterioration of \n     the oceans is a serious threat, which is one of the reasons \n     we protected so much of the great coral reefs and the \n     northern Hawaiian Islands and the coast there.\n       Or you might say, ``No, no, long before global warming gets \n     us, the public health crisis will get us.'' The health \n     systems are breaking down all over the world. And we're going \n     to be awash in epidemics. AIDS is the beginning. There are \n     now 36 million cases of AIDS in the world; 22 million people \n     have died. If present trends continue, there will be 100 \n     million AIDS cases in four years. And while 70 percent of \n     today's cases are in Africa, the fastest growing rates are in \n     the former Soviet Union, on Europe's back door. The second \n     fastest growing rate is in the Caribbean on our front door. \n     The third fastest growing rate is in India, the biggest \n     democracy in the world with nearly a billion people. And the \n     Chinese recently announced they have twice as many AIDS cases \n     as had previously been thought, and tragically, only 4 \n     percent of their adults know how the disease is contracted \n     and spread. If that keeps going, it will be the biggest \n     plague since the bubonic plague killed one-fourth of Europe \n     in the 14th century.\n       Or you might say, ``President Clinton, you have got it all \n     backwards. The global economy is not the positive \n     development; it's the negative development, because Americans \n     are getting rich, but half of the people in the world are \n     still living on less than $2 a day.'' Think about that the \n     next time you buy a cup of coffee. Half of the people in the \n     world are living on less than $2 a day. A billion people are \n     living on less than $1 a day. A billion people go to bed \n     hungry every single night. One in four people die of AIDS, TB \n     and malaria and complications from diarrhea every year. \n     That's how--of all of the deaths in the world from wars, from \n     terrorism, from heart attacks, from strokes, from accidents, \n     one in four people die of AIDS, TB, malaria and complications \n     from diarrhea, most of it little kids that never got a clean \n     glass of water because they are poor. And it is projected \n     that in the next 50 years the world's population will \n     increase by 50 percent, almost all of it in the countries \n     that are poorest and least able to handle it, creating a \n     breeding ground for terrorists, who feel that they can \n     recruit among the disposed.\n       Or even on September the 10th, if you'd been thinking about \n     it a long time, you might have said, ``No, the thing that \n     could shape the 21st century most is the marriage of \n     terrorism with weapons of mass destruction and ancient \n     racial, religious, ethnic and tribal hatreds.''\n       You might have pointed out that 700,000 people were killed \n     in Rwanda, all innocents, with machetes in three months. Or \n     that Bosnia, a country of only 6 million, lost 250,000 \n     innocents in Milosevic's campaign of ethnic cleansing. Or \n     that Kosovo had 1 million refugees created overnight.\n       Now here's the question I would like to ask you, since \n     obviously all eight of these things probably had some \n     resonance in reality for each of you. I mentioned four \n     positive things: the global economy, the explosion of \n     information technology, the advance of democracy and \n     diversity and the advances in medical sciences and other \n     sciences. I mentioned four negative things: environmental \n     crises, health crises, half the world in poverty and the \n     growth of terrorism rooted in ancient hatreds.\n       Here's the real question: What do all things have in \n     common, the positive and the negative? They all are \n     manifestations of a breathtaking increase in global \n     interdependence. And it is very important that we understand \n     this. The reason we have to be concerned about all of them, \n     the positive and the negative, is that we live in a world \n     where we have collapsed distances, torn down walls and spread \n     information.\n       For Americans, it has brought us great bounty and has been, \n     on balance, an enormous blessing. But it has also created \n     vast new opportunities for the forces of destruction to come \n     into our lives. My wife represents New York in the Senate. \n     They have a million Dominicans alone. If the Caribbean has \n     the second fastest growing rates of AIDS in the world, can \n     New York escape it? We depend upon continually expanding \n     markets for America's economy to grow. If half the people are \n     still living on $2 a day or less 10 years from now can we \n     continue to grow? We haven't changed human nature. And \n     therefore, there will always be organized forces of \n     destruction unless we succeed in finding a pill to change \n     human nature or solve every problem on Earth. So if we take \n     down barriers, collapse distances, spread knowledge, we are \n     inevitably vulnerable here in ways that we never were before \n     to those organized forces of destruction. Therefore, what \n     happened on September the 11th is the dark flip side of the \n     positive things that have come into a world without walls. \n     That means that the great question of the 21st century is \n     whether, on balance, it'll be a good thing for you and your \n     family, your country and people like you in every corner of \n     the world; whether we can expand the forces and reach of \n     positive interdependence and shrink the impact of negative \n     interdependence.\n       What are we going to do now?\n       First, let me try to put this into some perspective. In the \n     whole of human history, no terrorist campaign has ever won on \n     its own. Even when coupled with a successful conventional \n     military strategy, terrorism has almost always backfired. In \n     the great crusade that succeeded in capturing Jerusalem, the \n     Christian soldiers burned a synagogue and killed 300 Jews, \n     and proceeded to slaughter every man, woman and child who was \n     a Muslim on the Temple Mount. And I promise you that story is \n     being told today in the Middle East. We are still paying for \n     it, and it was not necessary for the military campaign.\n       When I was a boy growing up in the South, when we should \n     have been focusing on civil rights and equal rights for \n     African-Americans, instead young white boys still learned the \n     story about how General Sherman marched to the sea by burning \n     all of the farms and burning Atlanta. It was, in fact, a \n     brilliant military campaign, and by modern and ancient \n     standards, rather tepid terrorism. He didn't kill innocent \n     women and children. He just burned all of the farms and \n     burned Atlanta to break their spirit and make them hungrier. \n     But it was dumb politics that our efforts at national unity \n     had to deal with for a century afterward.\n       The terrorist therefore, cannot win unless they affect the \n     way we think and act. They want us to be afraid of them. They \n     want us to be afraid of each other, and they want us to be \n     afraid of the future--don't get on an airplane, don't put any \n     money in the stock market, don't expand your business, lay \n     people off, the Moslem sitting next to you might have a gun \n     or a knife and they're coming again.\n       They want us to shrink. And they believe that terrorism \n     might work in this modern world to achieve their objectives \n     because we\n\n[[Page S10901]]\n\n     have collapsed distances and because the filaments of our \n     economy are so delicately interrelated, so that they can have \n     a big economic impact in southern Manhattan and scare the \n     living daylights out of people all over the world who see it \n     unfold. But they still can't win unless we give them \n     permission. We are not about to give them permission.\n       So what are we going to do?\n       First, we have to support the president and all those who \n     are leading us in the fight against the present terrorist \n     threat. We will get better at this. Better at playing \n     defense. Better at offense.\n       You should know that hundreds and hundreds of your fellow \n     citizens, dedicated public servants, have been working at \n     this for years to protect you from the awful thing that \n     occurred on September the 11th. And they have had some \n     astonishing successes since we got our own wake-up call back \n     in the early '80s when our soldiers were killed by the \n     suicide truck bomb in Lebanon. In my time, they stopped \n     planned attacks on the Holland Tunnel, on airplanes flying \n     from Los Angeles to the Philippines, on the pope. During \n     the millennium celebration alone, a dozen planned \n     terrorist attacks were thwarted, including planned attacks \n     on the northeast and the northwest of our country by \n     bombers who were picked up coming across from Canada. A \n     plan to put a bomb at the Los Angeles airport, a plan to \n     blow up the biggest hotel in Amman, Jordan. A plan even to \n     blow up one of the Christian holy sites in the Holy Land. \n     For those things which have been done, many people have \n     been arrested and put in jail or executed. But obviously, \n     everything that was done was not enough to prevent what \n     happened on September 11th. So we have to make our \n     defenses better. Airline security is being improved. We \n     are also facing the fact that we have to do a much better \n     job of using modern technology to track people when they \n     are in our country. That will be done. And the president \n     in the current campaign against the Taliban and Mr. bin \n     Laden, with the help of our allies, is bringing to bear \n     military forces to support our law enforcement efforts. \n     And I might add, doing it in a way which deserves our \n     commendation, accompanying it with humanitarian aid and \n     making every effort not to do what bin Laden wants us to \n     do, which is to kill as many civilians as he did so he can \n     say we're no better than him. And I applaud the way this \n     campaign has been conducted. Now, so we have to continue \n     to do this.\n       But the second thing I want to say is that though nothing \n     can ever justify the killing of innocents and terror tactics, \n     we have to realize that we must do more to reduce the pool of \n     potential terrorists. This is manifestly not about blaming \n     America. I don't belong to that crowd. But it is about \n     knowing our enemy, understanding the threats and acting \n     according to our interests and our values. So many of the \n     countries where terrorists recruit have 50 or 60 or more \n     percent of the people who are under 18. Kids who never go to \n     school, or if they do, are mostly indoctrinated instead of \n     educated and know they won't have a job when they get out. So \n     America must continue to work to reduce global poverty and to \n     increase economic empowerment through education and other \n     proven strategies.\n       We had a huge bipartisan effort last year to lead the world \n     to its first big round of targeted debt relief for the 24 \n     poorest countries in the world. So they got the debt relief, \n     but only if it went to education, health care or economic \n     development. We should do more of that. We funded 2 million \n     micro-enterprise loans for economic empowerment among the \n     world's poor. We should do more of that. We tripled overseas \n     efforts to reduce AIDS by treatment and prevention. And the \n     current administration has pledged $300 million, I think, to \n     the Secretary General's Global Health Fund to fight AIDS, TB, \n     malaria and diarrhea-related disease. We should do more of \n     that. We should reduce the pool of potential terrorists by \n     showing people that we will not claim for ourselves what we \n     would deny to them.\n       We should continue to promote democracy throughout the \n     world. It is no accident that the most fertile recruitment \n     grounds for terrorists in the world occur in countries that \n     are not democracies. Because when people cannot exercise any \n     responsibility for themselves, they are kept in a state of \n     permanent collective immaturity, and it becomes quite easy if \n     they are in distress to convince them that our success is the \n     cause of their problems. This creates, I might add, agonizing \n     dilemmas for leaders of such countries, many of whom have \n     been our friends but also are terrified by stirring dissent \n     in their own countries. And it is going to be a significant \n     challenge for us when the current military campaign is over.\n       But if you look at the Middle East, it's no accident that \n     perhaps the stablest country is not the richest. Jordan is a \n     country that is ripe for trouble. A majority of its people \n     are no longer Jordanians; they are Palestinians. Indeed, the \n     young queen of Jordan is a Palestinian. But the late King \n     Hussein several years ago recognized that he had to find a \n     way if he wished to preserve the monarchy as a relevant \n     institution in modern times to give the people of Jordan some \n     greater say over their own lives. So they began to have \n     elections, real elections where real parties could run, \n     including militant Islamic fundamentalists who could get \n     elected to parliament. The problem is, as we all find, after \n     the campaign when you get one of these jobs, you actually \n     have to show up for work. And when you have to show up for \n     work, people expect you to deliver, especially if they can \n     hold you accountable. And so people of highly extreme \n     political views have to reconcile them to get decisions made \n     so that the country can go forward. You may have noticed some \n     of that occurring in the previous years in America.\n       The same thing will happen in other countries with people \n     of different views. The king of Jordan can still replace the \n     prime minister. He is still the spokesperson and the leader \n     of the state and the person who charts a course in foreign \n     affairs. He comes to see our president in times like this. \n     But it's an example of the kind of thing that we need more \n     of. Because if people have no outlet for their frustrations \n     at home and never have to take any responsibility for \n     themselves, then they will never have an awareness of what \n     they have to do to solve their own problems and to get the \n     help that they may well deserve and to make the most of it if \n     it comes.\n       This is a big issue and will grow larger in the years \n     ahead.\n       Finally, we have to continue our efforts to show people all \n     over the world that America is not the enemy of any faith or \n     any people. Actually, Mr. bin Laden has a pretty hard case to \n     make against America if you look at all the facts.\n       The last time we used military power was to protect the \n     lives of poor Muslims in Bosnia and Kosovo. We lead the world \n     in the debt forgiveness campaign I just mentioned. We stood \n     for a fair and a just peace in the Middle East, which would \n     have given the Palestinians their state, and their equities \n     in their religious sites and a chance to make a genuine \n     economically successful partnership with the Israelis.\n       We are not the enemy of the poor of Islam in the Middle \n     East or anywhere else in the world.\n       I also think it's important to point out, however, that \n     we'll have to keep working on this. We've got more to do \n     there. And we have to keep working at home.\n       I was very encouraged when the president went to the mosque \n     and met with the Muslim leaders to point out to the American \n     people that Islam is not our enemy. The attacks on Muslims \n     and mosques are regrettable. They are by in large carried out \n     by people who are angry and scared and still ignorant of the \n     roots and the diversity of Islam, because we're still \n     learning about each other.\n       Sikhs have been attacked because they wear turbans and the \n     Taliban does too. An Indian Christian was attacked because he \n     looked like he might have been one of them.\n       We're still getting it right here. One the most moving \n     encounters I've had since I started going into New York was \n     outside the armory crisis center when I was talking to all of \n     these victim's families, this huge guy was a head taller than \n     me, was standing there, and he had big tears in his eyes. And \n     I said, ``Have you lost someone?'' He said, ``Not in my \n     family.'' But he said, ``I am an Egyptian Muslim American.'' \n     And he said, ``Believe it or not, I probably regret what \n     happened more than you do. And I am so afraid my fellow \n     Americans will never trust me again.'' That's one of the \n     things they want. And we can't give it to them. We have to \n     continue to live up to our founders' injunction about \n     making a more perfect union.\n       The last thing I want to say is this: This is about more \n     than what we do, it's about who we are, who they are and what \n     the 21st century's going to be about. For between ourselves \n     and the Taliban and Mr. bin Laden, there are radically \n     different views about the nature of truth, the value of life \n     and the content of community. It is at the root of all of \n     this, would not be solved if we had perfect policies in all \n     the areas that I mentioned.\n       They believe they have the truth. And if you agree with \n     them, you've got it too. And if you don't--well, you know \n     that.\n       We believe, and have believed since we were founded as a \n     democracy, that no one has the whole truth; that the truth is \n     something we can only fully realize when we're in a different \n     place than Earth; that we are humans, be definition, \n     fallible. We are on a journey toward understanding the truth.\n       This difference leads to radically different conclusions \n     about the value of life. We believe everybody counts, \n     everybody has a role to play, everybody deserves a chance. We \n     have to learn from each other. They believe there are three \n     categories of people: the people who accept their truth, who \n     are Muslims; the Muslims who don't, who are heretics; and \n     those that are Muslims, who are infidels. And if you are in \n     the latter two categories, well, just to hell with you, even \n     if you are a 6-year-old girl who just wanted to go to work \n     with her mother on September the 11th at the World Trade \n     Center.\n       They believe a community is people--made up of people who \n     are all the same, who have the same religion, and the same \n     beliefs and practice the same way, and that those beliefs \n     have to be enforced by rigorous authority so we see on the \n     television the excerpts from that movie, ``Behind the Veil,'' \n     with those Afghan women imprisoned in their burqas--I don't \n     even know how they breathe in them--being beaten on the \n     street by sanctimonious men with their little sticks, or in \n     one case shot.\n       We believe that anybody can be part of our community as \n     long as you accept the rules of engagement: individual \n     equality, mutual respect, obedience to the law. We think we \n     all do better when we work together. And this is a much more \n     interesting country than it was 30 years ago because we have \n     people here\n\n[[Page S10902]]\n\n     from everywhere. We've got people in this room here tonight \n     from everywhere. Now our kind of community has a lot of \n     problems. We still have hate crimes. We still have--because \n     we're more open, we're vulnerable to the things that happen \n     that we deplore. But it has created a lot of good, and it's \n     given a lot of people from everywhere a chance to live their \n     dreams.\n       Their kind of community has created 4.5 million refugees. \n     So people are voting even there.\n       It's very important that you understand that we are up \n     against a worthy adversary: a man of great intelligence, \n     great wealth, great boldness who honestly believes he has the \n     truth with his top aides.\n       It's also important that you believe--even though sitting \n     here tonight you agree with me, that you understand this is \n     very hard to do. We all organize the world into categories so \n     we can think and function. We have to. Men, women, boys, \n     girls, adults, children, black, white, Muslim, Christian, \n     Ba'hai. Buddhist, business, labor, government, education. We \n     have to. We have to organize reality into these little boxes.\n       And then our whole lives are spent acquiring the wisdom to \n     understand that they do not reflect reality, they just \n     capture a piece of it we can use so we can come to understand \n     the unity of the human spirit and the human community. But \n     it's very hard.\n       Look what happened to the greatest people of the age. \n     Gandhi killed, not by a Muslim, but by a Hindu because he was \n     a Hindu who wanted India for the Muslims and the Jains and \n     the Sikhs.\n       Sadat killed by the organization the number two guy in \n     Afghanistan heads today. Not by an Israeli rocket, but by an \n     angry Egyptian who hated him for being willing to lay down a \n     lifetime of military service to make peace with Israel.\n       My friend Yitzak Rabin killed, not by a Palestinian \n     terrorist, but by an angry Israeli who though he should not \n     reach across the divide to recognize the legitimate \n     aspirations of the Palestinians and try to bring an end to \n     decades of slaughter and insecurity.\n       Mandela survived, praise God, but only after giving up 27 \n     of the best years of his life, so that he was able to reach \n     out to the other side without having the people of his own \n     ethnic group and political views think he had betrayed them. \n     This is not easy to do.\n       But if you look at America's long journey, it is worth the \n     effort. So, yes, let us support the president. Let us win \n     this battle. But let us look down the road to reduce those \n     negative resources and spread the reach of those positive \n     ones so that what we have sought for America we can one day \n     offer to all of the world, and so that our children will see \n     that we met this task in a way that not only helped their \n     lives, but the children like them in every corner of the \n     Earth.\n       Thank you, very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/23/senate-section/article/S10902-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Ms. Evans, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/23/senate-section/article/S10902-2", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/23/senate-section/article/S10902-3", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  THE ANNUAL REPORT OF THE RAILROAD RETIREMENT BOARD FOR FISCAL YEAR \n                2000--MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT--PM 50\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith the Annual Report of the Railroad Retirement \nBoard for Fiscal Year 2000, pursuant to the provisions of section \n7(b)(6) of the Railroad Retirement Act and section 12(1) of the \nRailroad Unemployment Insurance Act.\n                                                      George W.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 191, and \nI ask unanimous consent that the committee amendment be agreed to, the \namendment to the title be agreed to, the bill be read a third time and \npassed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any \nstatements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  This is the veterans homeless bill. This is a bill that provides \nsupport for homeless veterans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, on behalf of another Member on this \nside of the aisle and not myself, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, I very much appreciate the Senator \nfrom Kentucky saying that the objection is not on his behalf. I say to \nwhoever is objecting that I am going to do this every day. I would like \nto know who objects. It is interesting. I am not going to mix the \nagenda. But in all due respect, it is hardly helpful to veterans to \nobject to a piece of legislation that passed with unanimous support out \nof the veterans committee of Republicans and Democrats alike focusing \non what is a national scandal.\n  If you look at the number of men who are homeless--there are too many \nwomen and children--probably about 30 percent of them are veterans. \nMany of\n\n[[Page S10904]]\n\nthem are Vietnam veterans. Many of them struggle with addictions.\n  This piece of legislation was a bipartisan piece of legislation \ncoming out of committee. Lane Evans has done great work for veterans in \nthe House of Representatives. He has taken the lead. It is legislation \nnamed after Katie Marie Harman, who is Miss America. Her dad is a \ndisabled veteran. She has made it her priority.\n  I say to whoever is objecting that I would like for them to come out \non the floor of the Senate and object. Tomorrow I will spend as much \ntime as I can finding out who is objecting to this piece of \nlegislation. Pretty soon we will either find out, and we can work it \nout together, or I will figure out a way to come out on the floor with \nthis legislation and take a long time talking about what is on for \nveterans and the health care needs in particular.\n  The fact that I can't even move a piece of legislation that passed \nwith unanimous support out of a committee that deals with providing a \nlittle bit of help to homeless veterans--I am not being histrionic; I \nam not trying to be melodramatic--is just plain maddening.\n  My God, in order to have a piece of legislation that deals with \nuniversal health care coverage and national health insurance, there can \nbe a debate about the role of the Government.\n  Economic stimulus, I hope we will have that debate. There are many \nother issues. But when you take the most modest step that you can think \nof--I will start outlining the provisions of this bill tomorrow when I \nget a chance--and you have support among Republicans and Democrats in \nthe committee and you believe you can move it and you have a lot of \nveterans who are hopeful about it--a number of them came from all \naround the country to testify for this legislation--then we have some \nanonymous objection.\n  That is enough said for tonight. I hope tomorrow I can find out who \nis objecting and that we can pass this by unanimous consent.\n  I was working on amendments for this foreign \noperations appropriations bill. I want to let Senator Reid, the whip, \nand other Senators know that the first thing tomorrow morning, or \nwhatever best accommodates the Senate's schedule, I will come to the \nfloor with amendments and be ready to go with time limits.\n\n  I will be very anxious to get done tomorrow. I am glad we are in \nsession. I am glad we are on this piece of legislation.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, that is very good. We want to finish this \nbill as quickly as we can. It is an important piece of legislation. We \ntalked about it for a long time today. We are going to come in tomorrow \nat 10:30. If the Senator can be here at 10:30, as soon as we finish the \nbusiness of the day, we will move right to his amendments. I would like \nto be able to tell the managers.\n  How many amendments will the Senator have tomorrow?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Madam President, if it is OK, I will ask unanimous \nconsent when we come back on the floor that I be allowed to introduce \nthe first amendment.\n  Mr. REID. The managers are not here. I wouldn't like to do that \nwithout their being here. How many amendments is the Senator going to \nhave?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. Three amendments. I will have one amendment that deals \nwith the humanitarian crisis right now in Afghanistan. I am hoping the \nmanagers will accept it. I think it is a good statement. I think it is \nexactly what we are committed to as a nation.\n  I will take 20 seconds tonight to say that the President--and he was \neloquent--said our military effort is not aimed at the innocent people \nin Afghanistan; we are going after terrorists and those who harbor \nterrorists. I think one of the best ways we can show that we are good \npeople who commit by way of deed is to make a serious effort on the \nhumanitarian front. We are going to have hundreds of thousands of \nchildren who are going to starve to death. The first amendment is going \nto be a resolution that talks about the need to make this a priority.\n  The second one is going to deal with the Andean plan, Colombia, and \nsome of my concerns about human rights. The third one will be also a \nhuman rights amendment. I can do all of these with a time limit.\n  Mr. REID. Senator Durbin and I spoke at some length on the floor this \nmorning about the war in Afghanistan. It is certainly not against the \npeople of Afghanistan. It is against the Taliban, which has treated \npeople so brutally, especially women.\n  There are some good provisions in this bill already that relate to \naid generally for the people of Afghanistan. So I personally look \nforward to hearing the Senator tomorrow. I am sure the managers look \nforward to his amendments. I am sure they would look forward to some \nreasonable time agreement to move forward on those amendments as \nquickly as possible. Hopefully one, two, or three of them can be \naccepted tomorrow.\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I thank the majority whip. I hope one, two, and three \nof them will be accepted as well. That would be a first for me, but I \nwill certainly try.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. REID. Will the Senator withhold that, please?\n  Mr. WELLSTONE. I withhold and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2001/10/23/senate-section/article/S10904-1", "month": "10", "year": "2001", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10904-S10905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.
